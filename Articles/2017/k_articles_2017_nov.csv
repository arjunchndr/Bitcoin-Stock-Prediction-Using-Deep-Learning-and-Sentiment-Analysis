11/01/2017,"['CME Group, a leading marketplace for derivatives which handles 3 billion contracts worth about $1 quadrillion annually, is set to roll out bitcoin futures by the fourth quarter.\n\nA bitcoin future will allow investors to bet on the future price of bitcoin without having to actually hold the coin itself.\n\nIt could bring more Wall Street firms into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nJust when you thought you finally got your head around bitcoin, along comes a new bitcoin-linked financial product: bitcoin futures.\n\nCME, the Chicago-based exchange giant, said on Tuesday that it would launch a bitcoin futures product before the end of the year. Last year CME launched a bitcoin index CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate. The bitcoin futures will be based off of this rate.\n\nCross-town rival exchange Cboe has long had a plan for bitcoin futures in the works, and is also preparing for a possible Q4 launch.\n\nBitcoin popped after the news and has continued to rise since. It\'s gained more than $300 since Tuesday and is trading near $6,600 per coin.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the price of bitcoin is up over 500%. That epic rise has gripped the attention of Wall Street and Main Street alike. The development of bitcoin futures is the latest chapter in a broader story about cryptocurrencies gaining traction among traditional players in financial services.\n\nHere\'s a quick explainer of bitcoin futures and why they could be a big deal for Wall Street and bitcoin.\n\nWhat are futures?\n\nFutures, which allow two parties to exchange an asset at a specified price at an agreed upon date in the future, have been around since the late 19th century. They are traditionally traded by professional investors and firms.\n\nCME trades futures based on everything from oil to corn. In some cases, when a futures contract settles the buyer of the contract can receive their payment in the product itself (a barrel of oil, say), or in cash.\n\nThe latter are referred to as cash settled futures.\n\nFor instance, an investor can buy a future for a commodity like oil betting that its price goes up at a certain point in time. Let\'s say oil is trading at $50 right now, and the investor thinks the price is going to go higher. They might buy a future to buy oil at $55 a month later. If the price of oil is $60 when the contract expires, they get the $5 difference.\n\nWhat would a bitcoin future look like?\n\nBoth Cboe and CME have said that their bitcoin futures products would settle in cash. And that\'s exactly what makes the possible market so appealing to Wall Street. Firms who buy or sell bitcoin futures don\'t have to worry about actually holding the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nIn a way, bitcoin futures would be similar to other futures traded on Wall Street, according to Bank of America Merril Lynch.\n\n""The reason this may be relatively straightforward is that there is no conceptual difference between running a futures market on bitcoin (or technically some cross rate involving bitcoin) and oil,"" the bank said in a wide-ranging note about cryptocurrencies.\n\nJohn Deters, chief strategy officer of Cboe, highlighted this feature of the product in a recent interview with Business Insider.\n\n""People will be able to settle in cash,"" Deters said. ""So you can take a speculative position without touching bitcoin itself, which helps make it more attractive to all sorts of folks.""\n\nYou can take a speculative position without touching bitcoin itself, which helps make it more attractive to all sorts of folks.\n\nWhy do people care?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why bitcoin futures products would be a big deal for Wall Street and the world of crypto. First, the launch of bitcoin futures by establishment firms is likely to to open the door to wider participation in bitcoin trading by other Wall Street firms.\n\n""The CME announcement provides the first step in legitimizing the ever-growing crypto space as a true financial asset,"" Dave Johnson, the CEO of Latium, a cryptocurrency technology company, told Business Insider. ""For market makers this presents access from a known and trusted party into a $94 billion marketplace.""\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported two high-frequency traders, Virtu Financial and DRW, are looking to provide liquidity in bitcoin futures markets. And other firms are likely to jump on the bandwagon as well. Goldman Sachs, for instance, is thinking about setting up a bitcoin trading operation.\n\nFutures could also help dampen volatility in the underlying bitcoin market, which is known for its wild price swings. Here\'s Bank of America:\n\nWe would not overstate this, as a material reduction in volatility would require there to be a large community of speculators prepared to provide liquidity to the natural owners of the various coins, but given the volatility of the coin markets, maybe there already exists a cadre of participants who would look to short coins on strong days and vice versa, which could overall reduce volatility.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Some investors may still think that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a bubble about to burst. But bitcoin just got a big boost from one of the world\'s biggest financial marketplaces.\n\nCME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, announced Tuesday that it plans to start listing bitcoin futures contracts during the fourth quarter.\n\nFutures let investors buy and sell an asset at a specified price at a later date, They\'re popular bets for currencies, metals and agricultural commodities like corn, soybeans and lean hogs -- as well as frozen orange juice for any fans of ""Trading Places.""\n\nThe fact that bitcoin will now be joining other physical currencies as well as gold and other commodities is yet another sign of its growing legitimacy.\n\nCME (CME) CEO Terry Duffy said in a press release that the reason the company decided to launch the new bitcoin contract was due to ""increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets.""\n\nBitcoin prices -- which just passed $5,000 in October -- topped the $6,500 level on Wednesday. Bitcoin has now surged nearly 600% this year.\n\nThe rapidly rising price has led to some skepticism. China has cracked down on its use in recent months, which has created more volatility in its price as of late.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a ""fraud"" that was only good for drug dealers and North Korea. He added that he would fire anyone at the bank that traded it ""in a second.""\n\nAnd Saudi Prince Alwaleed, a billionaire investor whose Kingdom Holding Company owns stakes in Apple (AAPL), Citigroup (C), Twitter (TWTR) and CNN owner Time Warner (TWX), told CNBC last month he thought bitcoin was an ""Enron in the making"" that will implode.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin keeps surging to new record highs\n\nBoth Dimon and Prince Alwaleed have been proven wrong in the short-term at least as the price of bitcoin has continued to soar.\n\nLukman Otunuga, a research analyst at online foreign exchange broker FXTM, wrote in a report Wednesday that the CME\'s endorsement of bitcoin cannot be underestimated. It could help bring in more big-time institutional investors.\n\n""Some skepticism over Bitcoin was rinsed away, consequently boosting its allure to market players,"" Otunuga wrote, adding that ""it is simply remarkable how resilient Bitcoin has been in the face of significant negativity.""\n\nAnd CME Group is not the only major financial firm that appears to be backing the cryptocurrency either.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted last month that while he wasn\'t endorsing or rejecting bitcoin just yet, he did note that ""folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold.""\n\nCNNMoney\'s Charles Riley contributed to this report.', 'Just 13 days after it breached the $6,000 (€5,156.40)mark, the price of Bitcoin has hit $6,591, the digital currency website CoinDesk has reported.\n\nThe London-based publication said the cryptocurrency achieved the new record on Wednesday, boosted by bets the crypto-currency might enter the financial mainstream after the world\'s largest derivatives exchange operator said on Tuesday it would launch bitcoin futures.\n\nWatch video 01:39 Share The Bitcoin Bubble Send Facebook Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2kK6e The Bitcoin Bubble\n\nCoinDesk said the digital currency had climbed more than 500 percent over the past 12 months, having been priced just below $1,000 on January 1.\n\nRead more:Bitcoin: Paying with the cryptocurrency\n\nA growing number of analysts now believe that Bitcoin will likely see a price correction following this year\'s incredible run-up.\n\n2017 has been a rollercoaster year for the digital payment system. In September, its value plummeted by more than a third, less than two weeks after reaching $5,000, but before going on to make a new high of $6,183 on October 21.\n\nThe sudden drop in value was attributed to China banning initial offerings of other cryptocurrencies and the use of Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBitcoin was the world\'s best performing currency in 2016 and has grown dramatically again this year\n\nThe buzz around Bitcoin has led to the launch of more than 80 digital currency hedge funds and even a Gold coin offshoot.\n\nBut still, most institutional investors remain on the sidelines, many of whom view the estimated 900 cryptocurrencies as opaque products that are too volatile and too illiquid to risk other people’s money on.\n\n""While cryptocurrencies are probably here to stay, they are difficult to analyze, wildly volatile and some may be prone to fraud,"" Trevor Greetham at Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), part of the Royal London life insurance company, told Reuters.\n\nRecently, legendary US investor Warren Buffett warned that the digital currency was in ""a real bubble."" A few days earlier, Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal likened Bitcoin to energy firm Enron, which went bankrupt in 2001 and has since become an example of wilful corporate fraud and corruption.\n\nRead more:Bitcoin slides on stern warning from JPMorgan CEO\n\nWhen it launched in 2009, Bitcoin was worth only a few US cents.

They’ve invested the proceeds in the virtual currency.\n\nHe estimated that Bitcoin would ""probably be worth $25,000"" by 2020.\n\nLast week, Russia moved to regulate digital currencies like Bitcoin, citing booming demand. Moscow will draft legislation that defines the rules that creators of virtual money will have to play by. They will also be required to register and pay taxes to the Russian state.\n\nmm/uhe (AFP, Reuters)', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For the first time ever, Bitcoin has hit £5,000 in value\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has surpassed £5,000 per coin - a new record.\n\nWhile it is a historic moment of sorts, Bitcoin is usually compared to the dollar.\n\nThe virtual currency peaked at $6,649.33 (£5,015) at about 16:34 GMT on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe total value of Bitcoin in circulation is currently $110bn (£83bn) and the cryptocurrency has risen more than seven-fold against the dollar over the past year.\n\nThe reason for the latest jump in value was in part driven by an announcement by US-based derivatives marketplace operator CME Group about a plan to launch a Bitcoin futures product before the end of the year.\n\nBitcoin was launched in January 2009. Its value was lower than $100 in June 2013, and below $1,000 as recently as January.\n\nBut in August, the virtual currency soared to $3,451 after a spin-off - Bitcoin Cash - failed to prove as disruptive as had been feared.\n\nAnd in September, Bitcoin crossed the $5,000 threshold for the first time.\n\n""It\'s been a very innovative year - there have been a lot of new technology platforms for cryptocurrencies, which have lifted Bitcoin,"" Garrick Hileman a research fellow at University of Cambridge told the BBC.\n\n""It wouldn\'t surprise me if the price were to go even higher.""\n\nCoinbase - a business that lets the public trade and store digital currencies - reports that it is now signing up between 35,000 to 50,000 new users per day.\n\nMr Hileman said that many people had recently been attracted to invest in Bitcoin because when a ""fork"" happened in August, investors received an equivalent amount of new Bitcoin Cash coins for free.\n\nAnother ""fork"", SegWit2x, is due to happen on 18 November.\n\n""Rising geopolitical tensions on the Korean Peninsula are also driving interest in Bitcoin in the surrounding countries, because people are wary of investing in the yen or the dollar,"" Mr Hileman added.\n\nHowever, he continued, government regulators may crack down on cryptocurrencies, which could drive prices back down.', 'E-commerce giant Amazon has registered three cryptocurrency-related web domains, online records show.\n\nAccording to information from Whois Lookup, three domains – ""amazonethereum.com,"" ""amazoncryptocurrency.com"" and ""amazoncryptocurrencies.com"" – were registered on Oct. 31. The domains are linked to Amazon Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. that has been attributed to past patent filings from the e-commerce company.\n\nPhone numbers listed on the registration documents connect to Amazon\'s legal department, though a representative of that office could not be reached by press time. The registrations were first reported by industry news site DomainNameWire.\n\nAt this time, it\'s not entirely clear what purpose the domain names will serve.\n\nAs posited by DomainNameWire, Amazon may be simply moving to safeguard its brand. Back in 2013, Amazon secured ""amazonbitcoin.com,"" which currently redirects to Amazon\'s main page – an arrangement that further suggests the protective intent of the registration.\n\nAlternatively, Amazon could be seeking to avoid confusion between cryptocurrencies and Amazon Coin, a virtual currency product introduced in 2013 that serves as an online payment method for customers.\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nImage Credit: Hadrian / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The latest trojan, Cryptoshuffler, has managed to steal Bitcoins worth $150,000 so far.\n\nSimple modus operandi\n\nThe modus operandi of CryptoShuffler is very simple - It strikes when a user copies a Bitcoin address onto the clipboard, presumably to paste it in the destination address of his wallet and send across Bitcoins. Cryptoshuffler then replaces the address in the clipboard with an address owned by the malware creator. Unless a user notices that the address he has pasted is different, the funds will be transferred to the malware creator. Given Bitcoin transactions' irrevocable nature, the user has no way to retrieve his Bitcoins once the transaction is confirmed.\n\nBig profits\n\nThe malware targets not only Bitcoin users, but the users of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, ZCash, Monero, Dash and Dogecoin. The Bitcoin address linked to Cryptoshuffler has received 23 Bitcoins so far, valued currently at $150,000. The Trojan has been active for over a year, with the first reported Bitcoin transaction to the malware creator's address occurring in September 2016. After a brief lull in its activity, the number of affected transactions has increased in the last few months.\n\nSergey Yunakovsky, malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, writes about Cryptoshuffler\n\n“Cryptocurrency is not a far-off technology anymore. Lately, we have observed an increase in malware attacks targeting different types of cryptocurrencies and we expect this trend to continue.”\n\nClipboard hijacking is not new - trojans have been known to repeat the same modus operandi with bank accounts. However, CryptoShuffler seems to have been especially successful using this old strategy, lurking in the background of various computers.\n\n“The malware described is a perfect example of a “rational” gain. The scheme of its operation is simple and effective: no access to pools, no network interaction, and no suspicious processor load.”\n\nNo alternative to security basics\n\nThe recent success of CryptoShuffler has shown that there are no shortcuts when taking care of computer security. Do not install any software from untrusted sources. If software is digitally signed, ensure that you verify the signature before installing it. Keep your antivirus updated and a firewall in place. Store most of your cryptocurrencies in a cold wallet or a wallet which requires two factor authentication. Always be alert when sending Bitcoins. Small precautions taken can go a long way in safeguarding your cryptocurrencies."", 'Samsung built a bitcoin mining rig made out of 40 old Galaxy S5 devices that run on a new operating system for the company’s upcycling initiative, according to Motherboard. The company’s C-Lab developed the mining rig and other uses for old phones, which were on display at the company’s recent developer’s conference in San Francisco. The company displayed old Galaxy phones and assorted tablets stripped of Android software repurposed into various objects.\n\nThe company noted in an information sheet that the eight Galaxy S5 units are capable of mining bitcoin at greater power efficiency than a standard desktop computer. Desktops, however, are not currently standard bitcoin mining tools. The company declined to answer questions about the mining rig.\n\nSamsung has worked on bitcoin technology in the past, having partnered with IBM on bitcoin blockchain applications.\n\nSamsung to Release Software\n\nSamsung plans to release the software for the projects it displayed at the conference for free, a company spokesperson, Robin Schultz, told Motherboard. Schultz said the platform offers an environmentally responsible way to make use of old Galaxy devices.\n\nUpcycling devices requires the support of the original manufacturer.\n\nKyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, said software holds the key to keeping old electronic devices running longer. The software in old phones does not run on new apps.\n\niFixit is helping Samsung repair old S3s for the upcycling project. Weins said Samsung has built a layer between the hardware and the ability to install things on it.\n\nThe upcycling project has a video on Gitub. The site will allow users to download software to remove Android and open the devices to other types of software. Users will be able to browse various software projects. Users will also be able to upload their own projects and software.\n\nAlso read: Samsung researching bitcoin for future uses\n\nSuch support for repurposing devices is unusual. Apple and other companies make it difficult for users to fix broken devices. Samsung also programmed an old phone with facial recognition software shaped as an owl to guard a house entrance, repurposed a Galaxy S3 to monitor a fish tank, and turned a Galaxy tablet into an ubuntu powered laptop.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price extended gains and traded above $6900 against the US Dollar.

BTC/USD now eyes a test of the all-important $7000 handle.\n\nBitcoin Price Bullish Trend\n\nYesterday, we saw how bitcoin price was preparing for more gains above $6400 against the US Dollar. There was a solid upside move and the price was able to break the $6500 resistance to trade above $6900. A new all-time high was formed at $6909 from where a short-term correction was initiated. The best part was the fact that there was a break above yesterday’s highlighted ascending channel with resistance at $6522 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nAt present, the pair is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last leg up from the $6282 low to $6909 high. On the downside, there is a new connecting bullish trend line forming on the same chart of BTC with current support at $6680. The 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last leg up from the $6282 low to $6909 high is also positioned near $6669. Therefore, the $6680-70 levels are decent supports in the short term.\n\nThe most important support is near $6600. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg up from the $6282 low to $6909 high.

Yet a fundamental assertion made in the column doesn’t hold up under scrutiny.\n\nAlso read: Major FX Market CME to List Bitcoin in 2018\n\nJoin the Bitsonline Telegram channel to get the latest Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and tech news updates: https://t.me/bitsonline\n\nIn a new guest column, Forbes contributor and former U.S. Trading Commissioner Bart Chilton attributed Bitcoin’s current series of all-time price highs as resulting from “most ICOs [being] funded using Bitcoin.”\n\nPer the ex-Commissioner:\n\n“When the funds are actually invested in the ICOs, the currency used is—by and large—Bitcoin. Therefore, Bitcoin serves as the predominant liquid asset behind all these ICOs.”\n\nChilton, then, sees the ongoing ICO craze as fueling Bitcoin’s recent astounding price surge.\n\nAnd while Chilton is perhaps indirectly correct, to the extent that some novice investors are surely hearing about ICOs and then getting into Bitcoin and crypto for the first time, he is incorrect in suggesting that Bitcoin is the predominant currency of choice for participants of ICOs.\n\nThat’s because that honor goes to the #2 crypto by market capitalization, Ethereum. Makes sense, of course, since Ethereum’s fundamental smart contract product is the ICO.\n\nLet’s break it down.\n\nEthereum, Not Bitcoin, Dominates the ICO Market\n\nEven back at the beginning of June, Ethereum—namely its associated currency, ether—was responsible for holding a 76 percent supermajority when it came to being the digital currency of choice for investing in ICOs.\n\nAnd since dozens more ICOs have launched since June, many of them being run on Ethereum smart contracts for ERC-20 tokens that predominantly accepted ether, Ethereum’s dominance over ICOs surely has only grown since the summer.\n\nClearly, then, Ethereum is the crypto “of choice for ICO’d digital assets,” as TechCrunch’s Jason Rowley puts it.\n\nAccordingly, Chilton’s implicit suggestion that bitcoin is the currency of choice for ICOs is technically mistaken, though presumably it was just a well-intentioned oversight on the ex-Commissioner’s part.\n\nWhat do you think? Will Ethereum’s dominance in the ICO market continue unchecked for the foreseeable future? Be sure to sound off in the comments below!\n\nImages via Yahoo, Fortune.com', 'Mining for Bitcoin\n\nThe process for creating new bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies is one of the key attractions, especially among libertarians. Because traditional currencies are no longer backed by hard assets such as gold or silver, government-controlled central banks have absolute power over the quantity of currency in existence. They can create new supply by printing more money or reduce supply through taxation—whereas Bitcoin is immune to meddling governments.\n\nLike a kind of digital gold, the supply of bitcoins is finite and new ones are created through a process known as “mining”. Anyone with a computer can mine blocks of bitcoin, but in practice, most are extracted by organised groups using hundreds of dedicated machines that earn the blocks by cracking a computer code.\n\nThere is a limit of 21 million coins and 16.5 million have been mined so far. The value of each block, which is controlled by a mathematical protocol, halves every four years, meaning that 99 percent of all bitcoin will be mined by 2036—though it will take another century to mine the remaining 1 percent, assuming that the reward is still sufficient to pay for the cost of the electricity needed to mine them.\n\nTo put it simply, cryptocurrencies are money that exist outside of government control and the traditional banking system. They do not rely on the internet and can be stored offline on any external storage device—which means they can be lost just like paper money. It is estimated that 25 percent of all bitcoin in existence have been lost forever.\n\nSee also: Managing Your Legacy: How External Advisers Can Help']"
11/02/2017,"['A month ago, CME Group (CME) chief executive Terrence Duffy said he didn\'t see a need to list bitcoin futures. But Duffy, who heads the company that operates the New York Mercantile Exchange, has since reversed himself: He announced plans earlier this week to offer the contracts by year-end.\n\nSuch is the often-unpredictable nature of the market for bitcoin and other digital currencies, also called cryptocurrencies. In less than a decade, they\'ve morphed from an esoteric idea hatched on the internet to the financial world\'s mainstream with market valuations that eclipse the economies of some small countries and publicly traded corporations, including Goldman Sachs (GS).\n\nBitcoin, the largest of all cryptocurrencies, has been on a tear of late, surging 17 percent over the past week to above $6,600 on Wednesday, an all-time high. That indicates many investors are ignoring warnings from JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, billionaire Warren Buffett and others Wall Street veterans who argue the bitcoin market is a bubble pumped up by fraud that\'s bound to burst.\n\nBitcoin prices were $960 at the start of the year. In 2010, they were 8 cents.\n\nOnce the CME Futures contract launches, investing in bitcoin will become easier and more affordable for investors because the coins likely will be priced at a fraction of their current value. It also will enable skeptical investors to place bets that the cryptocurrency will fall, also known as selling short.\n\n""This is going to make people more comfortable and also make the markets more stable,"" said Abhishek Pitti, CEO of Nucleus, which provides cryptocurrency services. ""An institution is coming on board to organize the chaos.""\n\nBitcoin has plenty of fans in the financial world, such as Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson, whose firm has been ""experimenting"" with digital currencies for the past three years. Boston-based Fidelity allows some clients to access their digital currency held on the Coinbase exchange through their Fidelity accounts. Fidelity employees can also use bitcoin to make purchases in the employee cafeteria.\n\nIn a recent speech to a conference, Johnson said she ""loved"" bitcoin, its main rival Ethereum and the ""blockchain"" technology that powers digital currencies, though she noted that many challenges lie ahead.\n\n""What we\'ve realized is that if you only look at this technology through the lens of the problems that exist today, you will not find many compelling use cases -- at least not that can be implemented at scale,"" she said, adding that she remains a ""believer"" in digital currencies. ""If you are looking for bitcoin to beat Visa at the point of sale today, you are going to be disappointed. If you are looking at this technology as just a faster settlement system for financial transactions ... also disappointing.""\n\nAs Bloomberg News recently noted, Wall Street banks are taking a cautious approach to cryptocurrencies. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said he\'s ""open"" to the new technology, while his counterpart at Citigroup (C) John Gerspach is taking ""an intense"" study of digital money and blockchain.\n\nStill, skeptics such as Kevin Werbach, an associate professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Wharton School of Business, keep sounding alarm bells about bitcoin\'s stratospheric rise potentially leading to a dramatic fall.\n\n""I\'m not sure which way the futures markets will cut,"" he said. ""Regulated bitcoin derivatives markets will bring in more institutional capital and potentially smooth out volatility through market-making. On the other hand, they\'ll expose more investors to potentially serious risks.""\n\nWerbach added that ""we simply don\'t know to what extent the massive rise in cryptocurrency prices this year reflects fraud, manipulation or a herd mentality around poorly understood investments.""\n\nNot surprisingly, financial advisers are getting peppered with questions about bitcoin, from people eager to get in and those wondering when to cash out, as well as those wanting to know what all the buzz is about.\n\n""It\'s crazy. There are stories out there of young investors who bought bitcoin and now are millionaires,"" Houston, Texas, adviser Ashley Parker told Financial Advisor IQ. ""Even though it\'s such an unregulated marketplace, cryptocurrency is creating its own unique type of investment euphoria.""', 'The speculation around bitcoin is the “very definition of a bubble,” Credit Suisse Group AG Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam said as the currency exceeded $7,000 for the first time.\n\n“From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble,” he said at a news conference in Zurich Thursday. He added that in the history of finance, such speculation has “rarely led to a happy end.”\n\nThe digital currency got new impetus this week after CME Group Inc., the world’s largest exchange owner, said it plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the year, citing pent-up demand from clients. That pushes bitcoin closer to the mainstream by making it easier to trade without the hassles of owning bitcoin directly.\n\nOther bankers are also sounding warnings about the currency. JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin “a fraud” that will eventually blow up. UBS Group AG Chairman Axel Weber said last month that bitcoin has no “intrinsic value” because it’s not secured by underlying assets.\n\nBankers also are steering clear of bitcoin for fear that criminals could use its anonymity to hide their activities, Thiam said.\n\nBitcoin’s meteoric rise is attracting a ton of attention. Is it ready for the mainstream? (Source: Bloomberg)\n\n“Most banks in the current state of regulation have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges,” he said.\n\nWhile bitcoin remains a no-go with the industry, banks are racing to develop blockchain, the technology underpinning the currency. Thiam said blockchain may have many applications in banking. Credit Suisse is among more than 100 banks are working within the R3, a consortium created to find ways to use blockchain as to track money transfers and other transactions.', ""As Bitcoin hovers around the historic $7,000, talk of retraces is growing, with one analyst predicting an inevitable fall back to $5,000.\n\nDespite prices growing at an unprecedented rate this week, the fallout over SegWit2x will trigger a correction “no matter how high” Bitcoin gets, Tone Vays concluded.\n\nIn amendments to his short-term Bitcoin price outlook versus USD Wednesday, Vays said the “damage has been done” by the upcoming hard fork.\n\n“No matter how high we get before (the SegWit2x hard fork), the damage by these bad actors has been done!

Skeptics including Themis Trading say the rally is evidence that the software-created asset is a bubble that should not be given regulatory cover.\n\nThe speculation around bitcoin is the “very definition of a bubble,” Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Tidjane Thiam said at a news conference in Zurich Thursday.\n\n“From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble,” Thiam said. He added that in the history of finance, such speculation has “rarely led to a happy end.”\n\nBlankfein tweeted last month that while the was “still thinking” about bitcoin, people were once skeptical of paper money as well.\n\n“I’ve learned over the years that there’s a lot of things that workout pretty well that I don’t love,” he said today. Bitcoin certainly has been doing well in 2017, rising more than 600 percent since the start of the year and surpassing $7,000 for the first time.\n\nAnd the Goldman Sachs CEO isn’t the only one pulling a Hamlet act over bitcoin. What was once dismissed by Wall Street as a speculative bubble has been suddenly coming up more frequently, both in positive and negative tones. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon famously said that he would fire any trader who began trading bitcoin.\n\n“I don’t have an investment in it, but I’m not willing to pooh-pooh it and that’s why I say I’m open to it,” Blankfein said.\n\n— With assistance by Andrew Dunn', '', 'Bitcoin is breaking records. As noted by Business Insider, the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high on Nov. 1, 2017, and its bull run shows no sign of losing steam. Traders are hoping that the new SegWit2x software update could mean a windfall of free dividend currency if a new bitcoin variant is created.\n\nBut cybercriminals are also looking to cash in on free digital coins. According to Bleeping Computer, new bitcoin malware attacks have already co-opted more than $150,000 of the high-value cryptocurrency.\n\nPayment Pasting Problems\n\n\n\nDiscovered by Kaspersky Lab, the new attack strain, called CryptoShuffler, uses a simple tactic to steal valuable bitcoins from unsuspecting users: copy and paste.\n\nFirst, attackers compromise target devices and the CryptoShuffler code begins monitoring clipboard activity. That’s because many users copy and then paste the recipient’s wallet ID into transaction destination fields, which is easier than remembering the entire string and wiser than writing it down.\n\nCryptoShuffler simply bides its time until it detects common cryptocurrency wallet string characteristics. The malware then intercepts the copied wallet string and replaces it with one that sends money directly to the attackers. If a user doesn’t carefully check the intended recipient wallet address against the one he or she pasted, fraudsters will get the windfall.\n\nAs Kaspersky Lab noted, the efficacy of CryptoShuffler shows that “many kinds of malware try to keep a low profile and to operate as stealthily as possible.” By sitting quietly in memory and monitoring only the temporary cut-and-paste clipboard process, users won’t see any performance degradation, random pop-ups or ransom messages.\n\nSince bitcoin transactions are one way unless both parties agree to the payment, there’s little recourse for users who have been victimized. While this Trojan reached peak activity late last year, it’s enjoying new life as the price of bitcoin skyrockets.\n\nMaking a Mint With Bitcoin Malware Attacks\n\n\n\nClipboard threats aren’t the only malware attacks targeting cryptocurrency. BBC noted that coin-mining malware is quickly becoming a problem for websites.\n\nIn fact, Google is considering rolling out Chrome defenses to safeguard devices against resource-exploiting bitcoin mines. But these malicious miners leave behind traces of their activity, and device processing power can be significantly reduced as fraudsters leverage every available cycle to grab more coins.\n\nCryptoShuffler, meanwhile, takes advantage of the growing ubiquity of cryptocurrency. Users now have typical purchasing processes, which include copying and pasting destination addresses for quick payment. By exploiting day-to-day behavior rather than network or OS-level actions, attackers enjoy both greater success and a reduced chance of detection.\n\nThis puts the onus on users to monitor for any suspicious processes — Kaspersky identified Trojan-Banker.Win32.CryptoShuffler.gen as the most common variant — and avoid potentially compromised downloads or email attachments. Given bitcoin’s burgeoning bull run and ballistic trajectory, users may want to consider cutting out the copy-and-paste practice and instead take the time to input recipient wallet codes bit by bit.', 'The ethereum price has plunged to a seven-month low against the value of bitcoin.\n\nEthereum Price Falls to 7-Month Low Against BTC\n\nThe past two months have been disappointing for ethereum investors. Since nearing $400 at the beginning of September, the ethereum price has demonstrated an inability to mount a sustained rally past $300, even as bitcoin has achieved all-time highs on an almost weekly basis.\n\nEthereum did make some movement on Thursday, but it was not in the direction investors would prefer. The ethereum price fell 6% as traders liquidated their holdings to add more fuel to bitcoin’s bull run, temporarily forcing it below $280 although it has since recovered to about $290.\n\nHowever, the situation appears far more dire after examining the ETH/BTC price trend. It is no secret that bitcoin has been consolidating its position as the dominant cryptocurrency; at present, bitcoin controls nearly 63% of the total crypto market cap, and that number has been steadily rising over the past few weeks. However, ethereum came dangerously close to achieving the “Flippening” — raising its market cap above that of bitcoin and becoming the largest cryptocurrency — so one might have expected it to prove to be more resilient than the legion of altcoins with much smaller market caps. This has not been the case.\n\nETH Price Chart (USD & BTC) | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAt present, ethereum is trading at approximately 0.04 BTC. The last time ethereum was valued so low against the price of bitcoin was the last week of April, when the ethereum price was just $50. Moreover, it is roughly one-fourth of ETH/BTC’s all-time high, which topped out at close to 0.16 BTC in mid-June.\n\nHope on the Horizon\n\nNevertheless, while ethereum’s short-term performance has fizzled, investors have reason to remain bullish on the platform’s long-term prospects. Though overshadowed by the massive bitcoin price rise, this week’s Devcon3 conference will likely shed some light on the cryptocurrency’s future.\n\nOn Wednesday Vitalik Buterin laid out a multi-year roadmap that explains some of the issues facing the platform — most notably scalability — and how developers intend to address them. Moreover, Vlad Zamfir released a draft of a whitepaper for Casper, the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that developers have been previewing for some time now. Many of the projects that are being discussed at Devcon3 will take months or years to accomplish, so it is too early to predict when the ethereum price will turn a corner. However, current investors should continue to look to the future with optimism.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'With bitcoins now trading above $7,000 a pop — up seven fold from the start of the year — there’s greater attention than ever on the cryptocurrency and what you can do with it.\n\nThe everyday items you can buy with the digital currency have multiplied over the years. Overstock.com accepts them, for instance, so you can get all your furniture using bitcoin. You can pay for plane tickets and hotels with them through CheapAir. Or Xbox games and Windows apps via Microsoft. Or computers via Dell and electronics via Newegg.\n\nYou can even buy lunch at a Subway sandwich shop in Allentown, Penn. using bitcoin, or gain access to the VIP room of a “gentlemen’s club” in Las Vegas.\n\nBeware, though: “All those transactions go into your tax return,” says Bryan Skarlatos, a lawyer who specializes in tax issues at Kostelanetz & Fink.\n\nSkarlatos is sounding the alarm on the issue because few people realize that the Internal Revenue Service does not view bitcoins as a currency like the dollars in your wallet. Instead bitcoins are treated as “property,” which means they’re subject to capital gains taxes.\n\nHow Bitcoin is Taxed\n\nEvery time you purchase a sandwich or video game with the cryptocurrency, you’re essentially making two transactions: First, you are selling property (bitcoins) in the eyes of the IRS. And then you are using the proceeds of that sale to make a purchase (whether it’s a sandwich or a credenza). And when property is sold, you must report the purchase on your tax forms.\n\nIf your bitcoins have appreciated in price since you first obtained them — and there’s a great chance that they have — you’re subject to capital gains tax when purchasing an item.\n\nFor instance, imagine you bought a $3,500 bedroom set at Overstock.com using half a bitcoin (or 50 million “satoshis”) that you purchased for $200 at the start of 2016. That represents a capital gain of $3,300. At the typical 15% long-term capital gains rate, that works out to a $495 tax hit.\n\nOf course, if you spend appreciated bitcoin that you’ve held for less than a year, that would be considered a short-term gain, taxed at ordinary income tax rates that can run as high as 39.6%.\n\nYou’re technically required to list every purchase you made in any given year with bitcoins, outlining the capital gain or loss from selling the digital currency to make the transaction, “no matter how small,” Skarlatos says.\n\nThere’s more: The capital gains hit would come on top of the sales tax that you would pay for the item you wind up purchasing, adding another fee to transactions using cryptocurrencies.\n\nIgnore the IRS at Your Peril\n\nWhile some may ignore the issue – only 802 people reported Bitcoin profits to the IRS in 2015 – it’s important to remember that transactions are stored permanently within bitcoin’s network. This means a motivated IRS could easily find every purchase someone makes.\n\nOn a larger scale, it’s another issue that can hold back the mainstream appeal of a tool like bitcoin. Complications such as this tax rule prevent it from growing as an everyday option for purchases. Ease of use gives bitcoins “value,” adds Skarlatos. The more difficult it is to use, the more bitcoins’ ultimate value suffers.\n\nRepresentatives Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz) have introduced legislation that would limit the reporting of purchases to anything above $600. It’s something that will likely be discussed as the efforts for tax reform move forward.\n\nUntil then, though, bitcoin users will need to have a way to report all the transactions throughout the year to avoid the IRS’s ire. Libra offers free software for individuals that links directly to an e-wallet, providing a spreadsheet of your transactions.\n\nOr you can limit your spending with the currency, but there’s nothing wild about that.', 'LONDON - Bitcoin is surging on Thursday morning, shooting past $7,000 per coin on Thursday morning for the first time ever.\n\nBitcoin passed the milestone in early trade and, at 11.10 a.m. GMT (7.05 a.m. ET), the digital currency is up over 8% against the dollar to $7,300.11:\n\nAd\n\nsource Markets Insider\n\nBitcoin has been on a tear over the last week, posting record highs on consecutive days. The digital currency had not been higher than $6,300 at the start of the week but has now gained $700 on that level in just a few days.\n\nThe recent run has been helped by news on Tuesday that CME Group, the world\'s largest exchange operator, plans to introduce bitcoin future contracts in response to client demand. This is seen as a stamp of legitimacy from the world of traditional finance for bitcoin.\n\nTraders are also speculating that this week\'s bull run is partly helped by a coming ""fork"" in bitcoin\'s underlying software. The SegWit2x software update is scheduled for November 16 and could split bitcoin in two, creating a new currency.\n\nThis has happened in the past with bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold and, in those cases, bitcoin holders got those new coins free. As a result, investors may be piling into bitcoin in the hopes of a SegWit2x dividend.\n\nBitcoin has been on a tear in 2017, rising by over 600% against the dollar this year. The price rise has been driven by increasing mainstream adoption and awareness of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. At least 55 cryptocurrency hedge funds have sprung up this year, most focusing on bitcoin.', 'Since the beginning of January 2017, the price of Bitcoin has increased by an astonishing 690%, up from $1,000 to the current price of $7,066. Ethereum entered the scene at $10, now trading at around $300. In all, cryptocurrencies have experienced exponential growth this year, with Ethereum marking a 3,000% rally year to date. Naturally, this has attracted worldwide attention, made particularly evident during the summer months of 2017 when big investors entered the market.\n\nIt seems clear that the cryptocurrency market looks similar to how the stock market must have looked a century ago. Back then, investors bought securities directly on the basis of news stories, the latter being what predominantly drove prices as no one looked into earnings reports or compared ratios. Despite its impressive growth, though, the cryptocurrency market also seems prone to notably high volatility. In fact, it appears to be much more sensitive to speculation and news than any other market. It is worth recalling that, over the past few years we have witnessed a number of crashes and spikes, and many pessimists are now insisting, time and again, that this new cryptocurrency bubble is about to burst.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite stock market index lost 78% of its value during the dot-com crash (2000-2002), yet after the dust settled we saw the emergence of companies like Google and Amazon. The high-profile investors, bankers, and entrepreneurs are now caught in a debate over whether Bitcoin and Ethereum could constitute the fundamental structure of the whole blockchain. Warren Buffett, for example, said that he “can’t value Bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset”, but at the same time Dee Hock, the founder of Visa, argued that “Bitcoin represents not only the future of payments but also the future of governance”. With growing pace in altcoins creation and a vast number of seemingly doomed ICOs, it begins to seem like the whole situation looks more and more similar to the dot-com crash. Only recently, Vitalik Buterin\n\n(co-founder of Ethereum), said that 90% of all ICOs will fail.\n\nNews that the CME Group will launch bitcoin futures and that China may allow OTC trading in yuan create a more favorable climate in the market. Bitcoin has risen by 3.00%, trading at around $6,936, Ethereum is down by 2.87%, trading at around $280, while Bitcoin Cash is up by 14.71%, trading at around $553.12. The market enjoys this Bitcoin growth, yet we should remember that the situation may change at any moment.\n\nThis article is written by FxPro']"
11/03/2017,"['The Bitcoin phenomenon isn’t about a bunch of people who all believe the cryptocurrency is a good investment. That’s part of it. But for many, the belief in Bitcoin’s power to transform society runs much deeper: it’s almost an article of faith. Where does this fervor come from? To understand, it’s important to keep in mind that “the blockchain” is not really a thing.\n\nThis piece first appeared in our new twice-weekly newsletter, Chain Letter, which covers the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Sign up here – it’s free!\n\nA blockchain is a shared, permanent, encrypted data set, created by a network of computers according to a set of software rules. But there are different ways to set up those rules. The word “blockchain” is like the word “vehicle,” explains Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a blockchain-focused think tank. Saying you are putting something on “the blockchain” is like saying you are going to use “the vehicle” to travel overseas. It makes more sense to talk about “cars, trains, boats, or rocket ships, depending on what it is about the vehicles that we are interested in,” Van Valkenburgh argues.\n\nBitcoin is one type of vehicle that gets the most attention, and deservedly so. Its blockchain was the first, it’s been running the longest, and its network is the biggest. To many people, Bitcoin’s breakthrough is just as much about social innovation as it is technical. They believe the new model it represents can revolutionize how people share value and do business online.\n\nThere’s a good reason for that. Bitcoin has shown that it is possible to use a network of computers, connected via the Internet, to build and maintain a set of valuable shared data—in this case a ledger of account balances that prevents counterfeiting—without the need for a trusted authority. Think about that: from a bunch of anonymous computers that have no reason to trust one another, an ironclad network has emerged that can support a whole currency. Literal money—what could be a more valuable target for hacking or compromise? And yet there it stands, unperturbed amid the chaos of the Internet.\n\nIt’s heady stuff. And little wonder, then, that people think the incorruptible math underlying Bitcoin’s blockchain could, if adapted properly, make business processes in a range of industries vastly more efficient.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences\n\nStill, Bitcoin faces big questions over how it should modify its software to adapt to its growing popularity. Keeping the system running uses vast amounts of energy. And its blockchain, though encrypted, is public, meaning transactions can be traced. Bitcoin’s younger cousin Ethereum generally shares these characteristics. Meanwhile, some industries that stand to benefit most from blockchains—finance and health care, for example—are also highly regulated with respect to data privacy and security. Some say the best course is to pursue different kinds of vehicles, like blockchains that have been modified to require permission to access.\n\nTo Bitcoin acolytes, though, that misses the point. Bitcoin’s scaling issues, its energy consumption, and even its privacy challenges can be addressed through research and development, they argue. They say “permissionless” blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, whose networks are open to anyone who wants to use and build on them, can form a new kind of Web in which we won’t have to trust banks, corporations, or governments with our valuable data.\n\nIn other words, as author and MIT blockchain researcher Michael Casey argued in a column for CoinDesk last week, open blockchains could “save us from the Internet’s original sin.”', 'While the lack of regulation and use by criminals once formed the basis of attacks on Bitcoin, “bubble” is the latest condemnation used by skeptics. Credit Suisse CEO Thiam used the same logic to attack Bitcoin. Speaking at a news conference in Zurich, Thiam said:\n\n""From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.""\n\nHe went on to add that in the history of finance, such speculation has rarely ended well.\n\nBanks have no appetite\n\nTidjane also pointed out that banks are regulated entities, with strict know your customer (KYC) norms and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Hence it would be difficult for them to deal with Bitcoin directly. Banks have in the past shut down accounts of Bitcoin-based businesses because of the increased scrutiny such accounts entail. According to Thiam:\n\nMost banks in the current state of regulation have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges.\n\nWhy are banks bothered?\n\nBanks may have valid reasons, including strict regulations, which may prevent them from entering the Bitcoin space. However, this is no reason for them to attack Bitcoin, like Jamie Dimon and other bankers have done. Bitcoin threatens to disrupt the existing model, where bankers and regulators have a cozy relationship.\n\nBanks which have a larger-than-life reputation and are too big to fail pose far higher systemic risk than cryptocurrencies. By trying to build hysteria about a Bitcoin bubble, its use in criminal activity, or the threat it poses to economic stability, Bitcoin opponents aim to goad regulators into taking action. The market seems to be ignoring the Bitcoin opponents, scaling new peaks regularly.', '(Important update: The leaders of the SegWit2X faction announced on Wednesday, November 8 they would suspend their plan to split bitcoin in mid-November.)\n\nBitcoin has faced turmoil in the past but nothing like this. In two weeks, a massive fight taking place among bitcoin insiders could produce a ruinous schism—undermining the integrity of digital currency and threatening its sky-high value.\n\nThe fight is over a so-called fork in bitcoin’s software, known as SegWit2x, that will create two competing versions of the currency and lead to disagreement over the “real” bitcoin. There’s even a battle over who gets to use the popular BTC ticker symbol.\n\nThe fork will also mean a payout to existing bitcoin holders, though any windfall could be overshadowed by larger turmoil. To understand what’s at stake, here’s a plain English Q&A to explain the controversy.\n\nWhy is bitcoin going to split?\n\nThere is a disagreement between key stakeholders over how to update the core software that runs bitcoin. You can learn more about the technical details below, but the crux of the fight is over whether to double the size of bitcoin blocks.\n\nThe blocks, which are added every 10 minutes, serve as a record of all bitcoin transactions to create a permanent blockchain ledger. The current controversy means there is likely to be two bitcoin blockchains—one that uses smaller 1MB blocks and one that uses bigger 2MB blocks—and temporary uncertainty over which is the “real” bitcoin.\n\nWhile bitcoin has experienced these sort of forks in the past (most notably with the creation this summer of rival currency “Bitcoin Cash,”) the market has never regarded such splits as a replacement for the original bitcoin. This time could be different.\n\nWhen will the fork happen?\n\nIt is supposed to take place soon. This website offers a more precise moment —specifically Nov. 16 at 5:42 am—based on the number of blocks being added to the bitcoin blockchain. The fork is supposed to go into effect for block number 494784. (Once again, technical details on blocks and forks are further below).\n\nWho is supporting the split?\n\nThe main advocates for the bigger blocks, aka B2X, are consortiums of bitcoin miners who use specialized computer rigs to compile transactions on the blockchain—and earn bitcoins (currently valued at around $7,400) while doing so. They argue the bigger blocks are needed to accommodate the rapid growth of the bitcoin network, and to reduce the rising transaction fees that have come with this growth.\n\nThe mining consortiums are being backed by many of the companies that provide the financial eco-system that supports bitcoin. These include certain exchanges, wallet providers, market makers, and storage vaults. The positions of these companies, however, is inclined to shift based on the market and popular sentiment.\n\nWho is opposing it?\n\nOpposition is led by a group of developers who maintain the core software that has so far defined bitcoin. Many of them consider the proposed fork as a corporate takeover of bitcoin, and say there are other solutions to accommodate bigger blocks. Here is how Samson Mow, the CSO of the blockchain company Blockstream, describes the big block advocates:\n\n“[Big block] ringleaders are still pushing for a hard-fork now purely due to ego and escalation of commitment at this point. If you look at the history of contentious forks, starting from Bitcoin XT in 2015, it’s the same group of people. Either they are technically incapable of conceive of scaling methods other than block sizes increases, or they are trying to set Bitcoin on a path of centralization by making it more difficult for people to run nodes.”\n\nThe developers are supported by certain companies and mining groups, and by many amateur bitcoin enthusiasts who get together at meet-ups worldwide.\n\nWhat version of bitcoin will prevail?\n\nNo one is really sure. If most miners get behind the proposed split—and stay behind it—that will likely make the big block version the de facto official version of bitcoin.\n\nBut if the market continues to place more value on the original bitcoin, miners could get cold feet and go back to the small version if it is more profitable. Indeed, for now, certain futures markets are predicting the price of the original bitcoin will be significantly higher post-split than the big block version (it’s unclear how reliable these are).\n\nIt’s also likely that big exchanges like Coinbase will serve as king-makers after the fork, in part by deciding which version of the currency gets to be “BTC”— the ticker symbol everyone currently uses to define bitcoin. For now, most exchanges are not openly supporting one bitcoin version or the other. (You can read a rundown on where the 20 biggest ones stand here). Here is what Greg Dwyer of the exchange BitMEX has to say:\n\n“There is a lot of passion from both sides in the community as to why we should have a fork and as to why we should not, especially now with Bitcoin Cash (and its ability to mine larger blocks), a number of Bitcoiners do not see the need for 2X anymore. With bitcoin at [its current valuation of $7,400], there is a lot of money at stake to ensure the coin you support succeeds.”\n\nHow long will it take to clear up?\n\nThat’s also unclear, though it’s probably best for bitcoin if a winner emerges sooner than later. A prolonged battle could spread confusion among investors and trigger a crisis of confidence in the booming crypto-currency market.\n\nMeanwhile, some fear the big block version of bitcoin will fail to contain adequate technical measures (known as replay protection) to ensure transactions on both chains don’t become muddled. This would likewise spread uncertainty.\n\nFinally, there is speculation that, even if the big block version of the chain proves less profitable, some big miners will keep mining it anyway in order to impair the small version. If that sounds like civil war, you’re right, and the fallout could be ugly.\n\nWhat about those payments for current bitcoin holders?\n\nIf the big block version of bitcoin goes forward, it will contain an exact replica of the existing bitcoin blockchain—including a record of who owns all of the existing bitcoins. This also means every existing bitcoin holder will also hold those bitcoins on the new chain.\n\nCoinbase and other big exchanges have already confirmed they will accommodate both versions of the chain, meaning a client who holds five bitcoins will also soon hold five B2X (or whatever they call the new version). This is potentially good news for bitcoin holders because, hey, free money! They will wake up with digital assets they didn’t own the day before.\n\nThose waiting on a windfall should, however, take note of two caveats. First, there is uncertainty about how much liquidity there will be for both versions of bitcoin after the fork (note that Bitcoin Cash, which arrived after a fork in August, is fairly illiquid). Second, the arrival of B2X bitcoin could trigger a crisis of confidence in the digital currency market—and cause the combined value of both currencies to fall below today’s bitcoin price.\n\nSo what are the technical details behind the B2X update?\n\nBefore explaining B2X, it’s helpful to realize bitcoin works a bit like the operating systems in your iPhone or Android phone: Every so often the developers push a code update containing features or security updates for everyone to install.\n\nTypically, bitcoin miners and others install the updates without fanfare and carry on. If they don’t, it’s not a big deal since the updates are backward compatible—meaning new and old versions of bitcoin software can recognize each other, including the all-important blockchain transactions.\n\nThe B2X update, which aims to increase the size of a bitcoin block from one megabyte to two, is different. It involves a “hard fork” that will create incompatible versions of the existing blockchain. To use the phone analogy again, imagine an iOS update that resulted in an iPhone user only being able to message other iPhones that had also added the update.\n\nFinally, note that the technical measure itself—doubling the block size—is rejected by core bitcoin developers as necessary to accommodate the transaction growth on the network. These developers point out a recent technical solution (known as “SegWit”) that fits more transactions on a block is already in place, and that other easy-to-implement congestion solutions will arrive soon.\n\nWhere can I learn more about the B2X fork?\n\nThis Q&A is only a high-level overview of the coming split. If you want more, Bitcoin Magazine is an authoritative source and has a helpful guide to B2X and other forks. Meanwhile, a recent Forbes feature by bitcoin maven Laura Shin offers a detailed look at the people and factions driving the current crisis. If you’re curious about how exactly forks work (including soft versus hard forks), this is a useful piece.\n\nFinally, Twitter is your best source for up-to-date information about the fork. Some useful people to follow include bitcoin veterans like Ryan Selkis (aka Two-Bit Idiot), developer Jameson Lopp, economist Tuur Demeester, and small block advocate Samson Mow. It’s also worth watching the tweets of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong since his company is likely to affect the final outcome.\n\nThis is part of Fortune’s new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance. For more on The Ledger, click here.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Samson Mow as a developer.', 'Goldman Sachs as a company has gone through a range of emotions when it comes to Bitcoin. They are now slowly coming around to it and as a consequence CEO Lloyd Blankfein can see it as a currency of the New World.\n\nBlankfein admits that he has not yet invested in the controversial on Wall Street digital currency; however, he is not ready to turn on it or pooh-pooh it. Instead, Blankfein likes the idea of a currency backed by consensus.\n\nMakes a lot of sense\n\nBlankfein, while looking through the history of currencies, has made an interesting observation of what has been, what the currency situation is now, and why Bitcoin could work in the future - in a New World.\n\n“I read a lot of history, and I know that once upon a time, a coin was worth $5 if it had $5 worth of gold in it,” Blankfein said in an interview with Bloomberg. “Now we have paper that is just backed by fiat...Maybe in the new world, something gets backed by consensus.”\n\nBlankfein, maybe inadvertently, points out how the current situation of paper money does not make too much sense. Having paper money that is simply backed by fiat and governments and other rocky centralized authorities is not an ideal situation.\n\nIt makes sense then to have a currency that is backed purely by an agreement of its price - consensus. Bitcoin is in a unique position as its underlying technology and its position in the market makes it the perfect consensus-backed currency.\n\nThere is a New World revolution that is taking place across many sectors of society, and in the monetary ecosystem, Bitcoin is a disruptive force. Blockchain technology is spreading its influence, but Bitcoin is ravaging the established order of things.\n\n‘People were skeptical of paper money’\n\nDespite paper money being Blankfein and Goldman’s bread and butter, it seems that the CEO has a lot of reservations about it. He has said before, in a tweet that paper money was once viewed with equal suspicion.\n\nThe open-minded CEO may be taking a cautious approach to Bitcoin, but it is clear that he is looking for something new and revolutionary. Many are in a similar situation.\n\n“I’ve learned over the years that there’s a lot of things that work out pretty well that I don’t love,” the CEO concluded.', 'By now, most of my readers should figure out that I’m one of InvestorPlace’s strongest proponents of cryptocurrencies. In fact, I might be the biggest bull among my colleagues. However, I’m also a realist. While many critics may mock me as a “bitcoin shill,” I pride myself in telling it how it is. I genuinely believe that the bitcoin price has much higher to go. At the same time, I advise against taking undue risks.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA prime example is the upcoming Segwit2x hardfork. For those investors lucky enough to have bought bitcoin prior to its first Bitcoin Cash hardfork, supporting wallets and exchanges provided an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash. The situation was similar to a stock split, where only the units were split and not the value. Essentially, investors received free money, giving folks more incentive to invest despite the recently soaring bitcoin price.\n\nI know what you’re thinking because I had the same thought. We have a unique “arbitrage” situation here. If I buy as much bitcoin as I can prior to the Segwit2x hardfork on November 16 (per Coinbase), I’ll receive another round of free money. Considering that Bitcoin Cash almost hit $1,000 upon its introduction, the Segwit2x version can net serious coin (no pun intended).\n\nIf you’re gung ho on this plan, I’d advise sitting back and taking a breather. While I don’t believe that the bitcoin price chart has hit bubble territory, we all know cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Should Segwit2x hit $1,000 — a very big assumption — you’re still putting close to $7,000 at risk. You only have roughly a 14% margin in the bitcoin price before your Segwit2x trade becomes a wash.\n\nBeyond the basics of trading psychology, you have much more fundamental concerns to keep you up at night.\n\nComing Hardfork Threatens More Than the Bitcoin Price\n\nWhile many bitcoin holders are eagerly awaiting the Segwit2x hardfork for their freebies, the bad news is that it might not happen. The upcoming split involves high-level changes that could threaten the price of bitcoin. More critically, the hardfork risks the underlying blockchain’s credibility.\n\nTo understand the Segwit2x problem, we should understand why a hardfork is necessary. Primarily, hardforks address inherent weaknesses or vulnerabilities in a particular currency’s blockchain network. For bitcoin, users are concerned about the digital token’s scalability.\n\nWhen the cryptocurrency concept was born, few could imagine the immense popularity it would generate. At the beginning of this decade, digital tokens were a novelty. Today, even passersby comment about the bitcoin price chart.\n\nBut because bitcoin was the first of its kind, the original developer(s) didn’t integrate scalability into the blockchain architecture. Think of an upstart company that failed to forecast its meteoric revenue growth. For bitcoin to accommodate enormous user volume, the system requires hard programming changes.\n\nIf bitcoin was a dictatorship, the changes could be implemented easily. However, it’s a decentralized network, and that means dissenting voices.\n\nMiners, or those who verify the blocks of data in the blockchain, love Segwit2x because it makes mining more efficient. Other users believe Segwit2x gives too much power to miners, and that the hardfork is risky. Should a mishap occur, the blockchain’s integrity would be comprised, and by logical deduction, so would the bitcoin price.\n\nThe debate extends far beyond the scope of this article. However, the main point is that free-money hunters may be disappointed. If that is the case, then it stands to reason that you shouldn’t gamble on the bitcoin price for Segwit2x.\n\nNo Need to Make Bitcoin Great Again\n\nI, for one, hope that the Segwit2x hardfork doesn’t occur, and I speak as a Bitcoin Cash beneficiary. Too many questions exist surrounding the programming change. Although this may be an “old school” argument, can’t we just leave well enough alone?\n\nBoth InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth and I are on record stating that the bitcoin price will hit $10,000. Ashworth laid out a gutsy calendar target of October 11, 2018. I guess that’s why he makes the big bucks!\n\nBut in all seriousness, we see compelling signs. The bitcoin price chart continues to astound, with the cryptocurrency flirting with $7,000 at time of writing. Zerohedge ran a story indicating that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) may consider accepting Bitcoin.\n\nI know. Zerohedge has as much credibility as a flat-earther teaching astronomy. I personally view the site as a random collection of BS conspiracy theories and doomsday bunker-isms. Nevertheless, Amazon has registered the following domain names: amazonethereum.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com, amazoncryptocurrencies.com. A “WHOIS” search on all three names reveal that the registrant email is “hostmaster@amazon.com.”\n\nThose speculating on a higher bitcoin price will likely see it. Indeed, cryptocurrency fans have many reasons to believe in the current rally. But a Segwit2x hardfork is definitely not one of them.\n\nJosh Enomoto is long bitcoin.', 'Bitcoin has seen eye-watering gains in recent months.\n\nDigital currency Bitcoin took another leap higher yesterday, rocketing above $7 000 for the first time after a more than tenfold increase in its value over the past year.\n\nBitcoin has seen eye-watering gains in recent months, having more than doubled in value in the past seven weeks alone. It is on track for a fifth consecutive quarter of increases -- a run not seen since 2012-2013, when it was approaching $100 for the first time.\n\nIt hit as high as $7 354.10 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange yesterday, before settling back to $7 030 by 1630 GMT, still up over 4% on the day.\n\nCredit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam expressed caution about the booming crypto-currency, saying the current interest in it could eventually subside.\n\n""From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble,"" he said on Thursday.\n\nThe latest rally was driven in large part by news earlier this week that the world\'s largest derivatives exchange operator CME is to launch Bitcoin futures.\n\n""The move by such a well-known, established exchange throws open the doors for institutions to get into Bitcoin,"" said analyst Arnaud Masset at Swissquote, a brokerage that offers Bitcoin trading to retail clients.\n\n""Still, traditional investors will remain cautious and will not rush.""\n\nThursday\'s price move took Bitcoin\'s aggregate value or ""market cap"" -- its price multiplied by the number of Bitcoins released into circulation -- to more than $122 billion, according to industry Web site Coinmarketcap.\n\nThe aggregate value of all crypto-currencies hit a record high of more than $194 billion, the Web site said, more than the market values of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley combined.\n\n""This has been another incredibly bullish week for the crypto-currency, with the visible upside attracting investors from all directions,"" said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, a brokerage.\n\n""It must be kept in mind that Bitcoin\'s exponential gains are not only phenomenal, but [also] somewhat frightening.""\n\nCopyright 2017 Reuters Limited.

His comments came a day after Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam said the speculation around bitcoin, which pushed it above $7,000 for the first time, is the “very definition of a bubble.”\n\nThe digital currency got new impetus this week after CME Group Inc., the world’s largest exchange owner, said it plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the year, citing pent-up demand from clients. That pushes bitcoin closer to the mainstream by making it easier to trade without the hassles of owning bitcoin directly.\n\nBankers, meanwhile, are sounding warnings, even as they see promise in the currency’s underlying technology. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin “a fraud” that will eventually blow up. UBS Group AG Chairman Axel Weber has said that bitcoin has no “intrinsic value” because it’s not secured by underlying assets.\n\n“We are not really very keen to invest in the bitcoin, but we are very keen to invest in the blockchain technology,” Cabannes said.\n\nCabannes was speaking after the French bank posted a 15 percent decline in net income in the third quarter, missing analyst estimates.\n\n— With assistance by Caroline Connan', 'The bitcoin prices continue to skyrocket as the prices broke through the $7000 region and begin to trade in the $7300 region as of this writing. Though the bulls would be happy to see the prices moving higher at breakneck speed, they would do well to remember that the risks and the pitfalls are equally drastic as well. The momentum and the volatility has been huge, even by the bitcoin standards and in normal markets, such drastic moves would be viewed with a semblance of doubt on whether the instrument is being pumped for dumping later. New traders would not want themselves to be caught in this vicious circle and would do well to stick to strong areas of support and resistance in planning their trades.\n\nGet Into Bitcoin Trading Today\n\nBitcoin Prices Move Still Higher\n\nThe prices have been moving higher over the past couple of days and so far, the liquidity has been pretty good as well. Apart from the good news about CME considering the introduction of futures for digital currencies, there has not been any other major fundamental change as far as the bitcoin industry is concerned and hence this price rise should be considered as being driven purely by demand at this point of time. This surge in demand, especially in Asia, augurs well for the industry but speculators should take care of not being carried away by all the euphoria surrounding the move higher.\n\nThe Ethereum prices continue to flounder and the prices trade below the $300 region as of this writing. The devcon that is going on hasnt done enough to inspire confidence in the ETH industry and that is a cause for concern and one of the reasons for the prices to be low at this point of time. If this consolidation and trading at the lows of the range continues for longer, then the ETH industry would expose itself to the risk of a larger correction.\n\nForecast\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the day, it remains to be seen where this bitcoin train is going to take a bit of a break. We expect the prices to take a small halt at the $7500 region but how long this is likely to last is anybody guess. On the other hand, the ETH prices are likely to continue to trade in a weak manner.\n\nThe Best and Safest Way to Buy and Sell Bitcoins\n\nFor those who are looking to take advantage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies price fluctuations, some brokers provide traders with instant access to trade Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.

The rumors quickly drove up the digital currency’s price.\n\nAccording to Coindesk, Amazon signed up for the domain “amazonbitcoin.com” in 2013, which now redirects to Amazon’s main page.\n\nSome observers believe the firm could be seeking to avoid confusion between cryptocurrencies and Amazon Coin, a virtual currency introduced in 2013 that serves as an online payment method for customers.\n\n– Contact us at [email protected]\n\nBN/RT/RC', 'On this week\'s Rule Breakers podcast, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner brings in a special guest -- Aaron Bush from the Motley Fool Rule Breakers team-- to help him field some follow-up questions to their Oct. 18 tour-de-force episode on cryptocurrencies. The topics include how international government regulations will impact the currencies, which broker is the best to use, why blockchain has bigger potential than the cryptocurrency application, and what the long-term risk to bitcoin is once all the coins have been mined.\n\nA full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis video was recorded on Oct. 25, 2017.\n\nDavid Gardner: Mailbag Item No. 4: Rule Breaker Mailbag point No. 4. Well, actually, points No. 4 through No. 7. I have a special guest. If you were listening last week, you already know Aaron Bush from my Motley Fool Rule Breakers team. He\'s just released a report on cryptocurrencies, in fact, which you can talk about in a sec [maybe after], but we got a bunch of questions for you, Aaron, and you and I hand selected our four favorites and you\'re going to take them, because you\'ll take all comers.\n\nAaron Bush: Let\'s do it.\n\nGardner: You would have taken more than four...\n\nBush: Absolutely.\n\nGardner: ... but we have to control the time somehow on this podcast, so Aaron let\'s start with this one and it comes from Andrew Palmer. Andrew wrote, ""With China\'s recent \'Bitcoin ban\' and U.S. financial firms\' increasing interest in Bitcoin and Blockchain, how do you see new Bitcoin-related legislation or lack thereof affecting the growth of this ecosystem?"" Aaron?\n\nBush: That\'s a good question. I think, in general, regulation and legislation do have a tendency to slow down the growth of ecosystems; however, in this case I believe that having some rules is important to just simply cut back the scams and the bad actors, so I\'m not completely against regulation, here.\n\nI think that most countries are still wary of instituting too many regulations because they don\'t want to scare away entrepreneurs and let the value that they create go to other places, and so I think that\'s something that a lot of countries are thinking about in their regulation.\n\nThis is one of those things, too, where the currency lives on the internet, so you can\'t just have one worldwide rule.\n\nGardner: Jurisdiction...\n\nBush: Right. There is no jurisdiction.\n\nGardner: Yeah.\n\nBush: And so you start to see these companies create rules nation by nation. I mean, inside the U.S. I\'ve actually been fairly impressed by the way the government is handling things, here. If you read through any of the reports the government has published, you\'ll see that the decision-making groups have a deep understanding of the technology.\n\nGardner: I am delighted to hear that.\n\nBush: Yes, it\'s fantastic. And the current approach that they\'re taking to regulating the industry is sort of like this. If it looks like a security, and it acts like a security, then treat it like a security. If it doesn\'t act like a security or look like a security, then don\'t treat it like a security. And I think that that\'s a very level-headed approach to managing legislation, here, and that should lead to a growing ecosystem of players, here, domestically.\n\nHowever, like Andrew mentioned in his question, you do see countries like China ban ICOs...\n\nGardner: That\'s initial coin offerings.\n\nBush: Yes. Initial coin offerings, and they\'ve started banning exchanges, too. So this really is a power play that\'s intended to suffocate the market. Now I\'ll say on one hand that actually makes me a bit bullish because that comes to show that...\n\nGardner: This is for real.\n\nBush: This is for real.\n\nGardner: China\'s trying to stop it.\n\nBush: Absolutely, but censorship does limit the growth of new ideas. But what\'s interesting to me with China is that they actually have proven pretty savvy in the past when it comes to managing cryptocurrencies, so I wonder if they\'re playing chess in some way, in a sense of maybe they\'re going to come out with their own cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nSo I think it\'s early. It\'s tough to tell. And I think over time we\'ll see governments learn how to better regulate this. Because this is a worldwide [phenomenon], I do believe that there always will be places where entrepreneurs are welcome, and I think that there will continue to be ways for tokenized ideas to grow increasingly popular.\n\nGardner: You know, this is a total digression and I\'ll keep it really short, but I had the pleasure of getting to see [not meet], but see the Prime Minister of Singapore earlier this week. I\'m a member of something called The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., and people come through Washington from all parts of the world.\n\nAnd, boy, was I once again so impressed by Singapore. When you say there will always be places for entrepreneurs, when you\'re a nation of five million people with no natural resources, starting from a really tough place 50 years ago, and you\'ve gotten to be the size of economy that Singapore represents, that\'s a great example.\n\nIn fact, here\'s one thing I learned about Singapore, Aaron. They let in gambling, gaming. They didn\'t probably want to do it at first, but what the government decided is we will allow [it], because it\'s part of an ecosystem of tourism. Tourists come. They stay in the hotels. They want to do slots, that kind of thing. So they decided to let it in.\n\nBut here\'s the rule. Singapore natives, citizens, pay a $100 Singapore tax in order to go to the casino. So, you might ask who goes to the casinos, and the answer is all the people who are not citizens of the nation, itself. It\'s all the tourists who basically lose their money and pay Singapore. And Singaporeans can also gamble if they want, but they\'re going to be paying $100 tax to do so. Kind of interesting.\n\nMailbag Item No. 5: Anyway, question No. 2 for you. This is point No. 5 of this Mailbag and it comes [this is a quick one] from Del Clark. Del simply writes, ""Which broker is best for cryptocurrency? Coinbase?""\n\nBush: I think that that is a good logistical question, because in the cryptocurrency world, the concept of brokerages doesn\'t really exist the same way that it does with stocks and equities. Instead you hold value in wallets, which are either software wallets or hardware wallets, and you trade on exchanges.\n\nNow Coinbase is a respected and popular platform for buying and storing the most prominent cryptocurrencies. I think they support Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe Litecoin.\n\nGardner: Now Aaron, I\'m not sure I\'ve asked you this, but do you own any Bitcoin?\n\nBush: I do.\n\nGardner: OK, good. And did you use Coinbase?\n\nBush: I have in the past, yes.\n\nGardner: Excellent. Keep going.\n\nBush: So I think Coinbase is a great, simple solution. However, there is a trade-off. With Coinbase, you don\'t actually hold your own private key, which is ultimately what makes whatever you own yours, so you have to have trust in the company just like you would a normal bank.\n\nGardner: It\'s kind of like a broker. They used to hold the paper securities in the vault, and that\'s one reason you would use a broker, is that they would have the actual shares that you had safe. Safe and sound. So that\'s very real, here, for cryptocurrencies.\n\nBush: Right. So much of this movement is toward decentralization and this is sort of a centralized player. Some people like that. Some people don\'t. I think it\'s ultimately up to you to decide if you like that.\n\nHowever, that\'s only for those very few specific leading cryptocurrencies. If you wanted to buy another cryptocurrency, you would need to create an account at an exchange, and a couple of examples are Kraken and ShapeShift. There are a bunch of different players, but those are two leaders right now. And through that exchange you exchange either your chosen fiat currency or cryptocurrency like Bitcoin for whatever else you want to buy and there are thousands of cryptocurrencies you can buy through these exchanges now. And it\'s just like a normal currency exchange, but crypto.\n\nSo you can generally hold value in those exchange accounts, but it\'s typically safer to move those accounts, then, to a wallet and as I mentioned there are software wallets, which are simply downloadable and you can store them there. They\'re secured cryptographically. Or a hardware wallet, which is like a separate container that you plug in via USB to the computer and you can transfer your digital assets over there and unplug it. So it can\'t be hacked, because it\'s not connected to the internet.\n\nAnd so the last thing I\'ll say is that standardization is growing between these cryptocurrencies, but many cryptocurrencies still have different requirements, so it still is very much a case-by-case example. It\'s not super user-friendly yet, but it\'s slowly getting there.\n\nGardner: Awesome. Thank you, Aaron, and thanks Del Clark for a good question.\n\nMailbag Item No. 6: And here comes another one. This is from Tobin Anthony. This is Rule Breaker Mailbag No. 6. A friend of The Fool, Tobin Anthony.\n\n""David, I heard Marc Andreessen say a while back on EconTalk,"" [thanks, Tobin says, by the way, for mentioning that podcast on an early Rule Breaker Investing episode], ""saying that Blockchain was going to be the basis of contractual dealings in the future. He thought it was more important than cryptocurrency. Aaron made similar comments on last week\'s RBIPodcast. Can you get Aaron to explain what is it about the nature of Blockchain that allows for secure document exchange? Thanks.""\n\nNow that shouldn\'t be too hard, Aaron, right? You can just explain all the technical underpinnings. This is right within your wheelhouse. Anyone could do this.\n\nBush: Well, I\'ll try to keep it...\n\nGardner: Tobin should have just googled this himself and figured it out.\n\nBush: Yeah, come on Tobin. No, I\'m happy to help and I\'ll keep this relatively big picture. So probably about 20 years ago, a man named Nick Szabo, who\'s become highly respected in this field, realized that the logic of legal contracts is very similar to the logic of programming. It\'s highly structured with set parameters and cause and effect are explicitly detailed in the contract or the code.\n\nAnd what that means is that legal documents, where there\'s an exchange of some sort, can be programmed. And if the content of the deal resides on the internet [information and value]...\n\nGardner: Transparent. It\'s out there.\n\nBush: Right.\n\nGardner: Accessible.\n\nBush: If so then the entire thing can be set up and executed in code. And this is what has become known as smart contracts.\n\nGardner: And is that one word, Aaron, or two.\n\nBush: Maybe put a hyphen.\n\nGardner: We\'ll go hyphen. Smart hyphen. I need to know, so thank you.\n\nBush: I think it\'s two, but I like the hyphen personally. So Blockchains are what make these smart contracts secure for the first time. Because of its distributed nature, any exchange or transaction that takes place must be verified by the miners across the network, and all of the miners must be in sync with each other. If something is off, or if one node is overridden in the transaction, the network will know that something is wrong just through that inconsistency.\n\nSo in other words, decentralization creates transparency across the entire network, and leaves no room for any funny business. The code executes itself. The miners prove it and verify it. Corrupting a Blockchain means corrupting every single node in the network, and the probability of that is about as close to zero as you can get for these really large networks, and that is what makes it secure.\n\nI\'ll just quickly say that of course some exchanges are bound to add complication. It will be a lot easier for me to say, ""Hey, David. Let\'s make a bet. Let\'s each choose a stock, and a hundred days from now, whoever\'s stock went up the highest percentage, the other person will give them one Bitcoin."" That will be a lot easier to set up than say, ""Hey, David. I want to buy your house using a Blockchain."" There\'s just many more inputs. It\'s more complicated. A lot of those factors might live naturally outside of the internet.\n\nThat said, over the past month the first real estate transaction was made using a Blockchain. So I expect more possibilities to open up, but it\'s really because of the Blockchain that makes it secure.\n\nGardner: So Aaron, do you want to take that bet, by the way? What\'s your stock? A hundred days from now? Is that what it was?\n\nBush: I don\'t know if I\'m willing to bet that much on a stock.\n\nGardner: Since only one of us has a Bitcoin, I guess only one of us could really win something from the other guy, so I\'m going to say Match Group. What have you got? Match Group. That\'s my pick.\n\nBush: I\'ll go with Momo.\n\nGardner: Good, Momo, which is ticker symbol [MOMO]. This is not an official bet, and we didn\'t actually do this on the podcast, but we could have. And if we did, we could make it a Blockchain-contracted exchange.\n\nBush: Boom!\n\nGardner: OK, which takes us to the final Blockchain question of this episode. ""Hi, David."" This is written by [Allen Morris]. ""Hi, David. Because Bitcoin is finite, after 21 million coins mined there will be no more to find."" This is not, by the way, a Dr. Seuss poem.\n\n""What will happen to all those miners and all the assets they build up to mine for coins? If they were incentivized to process data and keep the system honest, how will they be incentivized when there are no more coins to be found? At that point, who will police the system? What would be in place to prevent Bitcoins from, say, becoming worthless?""\n\nA little bit more to this question, Aaron. ""My concern is,"" Allen writes, ""that in five, 10, or X years, Bitcoin loses its governing body because of the lack of financial interest, and then what? Aaron was a wealth of information,"" he goes on to say. This is a little compliment...\n\nBush: Aw, shucks.\n\nGardner: ... for @AaronBush on Twitter? Is that who you are?\n\nBush: AaronBush100.\n\nGardner: AaronBush100. So a little compliment for you. ""A wealth of information. I love your podcast. You\'ve made an amazing impact in my life and my investment practices over time. I look forward to hearing how you and your team might respond. Thank you. Cheers. [Allen Morris].""\n\nBush: Awesome! Thank you, Allen! I\'ll say that part of what you mentioned there is true and part of it is a bit of a misperception or misconception. Let\'s remember, first of all, that we\'re talking specifically about Bitcoin, here, because some other cryptocurrencies have different monetary policy. They might increase their supply into perpetuity.\n\nGardner: OK.\n\nBush: But with Bitcoin what is true is that the miners do compete to win over the new tokens that are being released, and that will happen until... It\'s expected at 2140 [their 2140]...\n\nGardner: The year 2140. Circle that on your calendars, Fools.\n\nBush: So we can be a little bit patient, here. But what is not true is that the miners are provided Bitcoins from that unreleased pile when they work to verify transactions across the network. Instead they\'re paid transaction fees by those conducting the transactions. So for all intents and purposes, the incentive to maintain the integrity of the network shouldn\'t go away, even if the supply remains stagnant.\n\nI will say, though, that Bitcoin hasn\'t proven to be the most scalable network for transactions in the sense that if you are to conduct the large transaction, the fees will be substantially high. I do expect that to change over time as the code, itself, that\'s running the Bitcoin network improves just to make it more energy efficient and such...\n\nGardner: OK.\n\nBush: But yes, transaction fees take care of that.\n\nGardner: Aaron, you mentioned earlier you own some Bitcoin. Have you mined?\n\nBush: I have not mined any Bitcoin.\n\nGardner: You kind of need to bring extra skills, right? I know that you have many skills. You\'ve done some programming for me, for example, but that\'s almost a full-time call with some serious expertise for the miners. Am I right?\n\nBush: I have downloaded the Bitcoin software, but it\'s so competitive, now, that\'s when you\'ve got to have...\n\nGardner: That supercomputer we talked last week.\n\nBush: You\'ve got to have a supercomputer. I don\'t have a supercomputer sitting around, unfortunately.\n\nGardner: Understood. Well, we\'re awfully glad that instead of mining something off somewhere, instead you\'re here at The Motley Fool with Rule Breakers [on my team there] and the Rule Breaker Investing podcast. Now I know that there is a report that you worked hard on that is just being released. Could you briefly, before we move to Mailbag Item No. 8 and welcome our next guest to this week\'s variety show, put a brief plug in for that, Aaron.\n\nBush: So for all of our Premier Pass members, which is a service that provides all of our front-end and back-end services, we give some specific portfolio allocation guidance, as well. For all of those members we are unveiling a new Cryptocurrency and Blockchain report which is a four-part series detailing just so much that there is to know about this stuff.\n\nGardner: All the things! All of them.\n\nBush: Right. And we\'re opening up Premier Pass and all the new subscribers will be able to get this four-part report.\n\nGardner: Outstanding. Aaron, thank you very much for sharing some more of your expertise, and a delight to have you back.\n\nBush: Thank you, David.']"
11/04/2017,"[""The announcement by CME that it plans to launch Bitcoin futures has resulted in a spike in interest across the world. Coinbase, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, has added 100,000 new users in the 24 hours past the announcement.\n\nWhy Coinbase matters\n\nCoinbase is a popular exchange to buy Bitcoins with 11.9 mln users supported across 32 countries.\n\nIt was one of the earliest exchanges to support Bitcoin trading in the Western world, doing so when Bitcoin was valued in single digits. It supports merchants as well, allowing them to accept Bitcoins for their products and services, but removing the price risk by crediting fiat currency to their accounts.\n\nCoinbase became the first unicorn of the crypto industry after it raised $100 mln in August 2017, implying enterprise valuation of $1.6 bln. The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, is also on Fortune’s 40 under 40 list.\n\nThe Stampede\n\nThe launch of Bitcoin futures by CME is expected to bring a deluge of institutional money into Bitcoin. Individual investors seem to be stampeding towards Bitcoin exchanges, trying to get their hands on Bitcoins before institutional investors make it out of reach.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Alistair Milne, of the Altana Digital Currency Fund, over 100,000 new users have joined Coinbase in the 24 hours since the CME announcement.\n\nThe exploding Bitcoin price has resulted in a sharp increase in the number of users of Coinbase, which has already doubled in 2017 to reach 11.9 mln users.\n\nHandling the surge\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of new users, the demand (and price) of Bitcoin is expected to eventually explode. It is estimated that currently less than 0.5 percent of the global population is invested in crypto space.\n\nWhile Coinbase has insurance protection for cryptocurrencies saved on its servers, questions will be asked about the robustness of its trading platform.\n\nA flash crash caused by a large order on Coinbase’s GDAX exchange resulted in Ethereum's price dropping to 10 cents for a short period of time, triggering stop loss orders. With increasing number of users, it is not just Bitcoin which is running full blocks and has a scalability problem; Bitcoin exchanges have to scale up too."", 'Bitcoin is unstoppable these days, passing one “technical” test after another, crossing the $5,000-mark, the $6,000-mark, and the $7,000-mark in a matter of weeks. The “people’s currency” has gained 27.33% in seven days, as market volume increased.\n\nWhat’s behind the digital currency’s breathtaking run?\n\nCertainly, it isn’t the lifting of regulations which halted trade of digital currency in China, as some expected (back in September, China banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and shut Bitcoin exchanges, sending the digital currency’s price tumbling from $5,000 to close to $3,000).\n\nInstead, there have been a number of positive developments that helped build investor confidence and hype in the “people’s” currency. One of them was the stepping up of government regulations in U.S. and Japan to protect the cryptocurrency markets from possible manipulation, while limiting the supply of new coin offerings.\n\nCoin/Investment Trust Change 7d* Bitcoin (BTC) 27.33% Ethereum (ETH) 1.79 Litecoin (LTC) 1.80 Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares (GBTC) 29.37\n\n*As of Saturday, November 4, 2017, at 10.30 am\n\nAnother development was the change in Wall Street’s attitudes towards Bitcoin, with hedge funds cozying up to the digital currency; and CME introducing Bitcoin futures.\n\nThen there was the renewed investor interest in technology in Wall Street, following a string of strong earnings reports from Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple, sending NASDAQ to new highs, and re-igniting hype for technology investments.\n\nCompany 1-month price change Amazon 15.14% Apple 12.39 Google 8.69 Facebook 6.23 PowerShares QQQ 4.96\n\nSource: Finance.yahoo.com 11/4/17\n\nMeanwhile money, the fuel behind the multiple asset rallies, continues to be cheap, as interest rates continue to be cheap. This means that investors do not have to sell one asset to buy another, as was the case back in the old days of “normal” interest rates.', 'Bitcoin’s impressive trajectory continues to astonish financial experts and the general public alike. During the week ending November 3, 2017, the digital currency once again exhibited its fantastic strength by closing at a fresh record high, surpassing the $7,300 USD mark. Likewise, the Dow Jones index rose to a new all-time high of 23,516.26 during intraday trading.\n\nBitcoin’s Unstoppable Skyrocketing Trend\n\nBitcoin gloriously started the week of October 30, 2017, by blasting past the $6,150 USD mark. Subsequently, every day this week, it has continued on relentlessly, puncturing new resistance levels, even climbing $400 in a single day. Then, the digital currency set a new record topping $7,400 USD during Friday’s intraday trading.\n\nMost analysts concur that the prospect of having Bitcoin futures contracts soon is attracting the interest of investors, hence driving the cryptocurrency to new record values. In this connection, the CME Group has announced plans to launch Bitcoin futures contracts in the last quarter of this year, pending regulatory approval. The CME Group is one of the largest and most diverse derivatives marketplaces.\n\nAnother factor driving the Bitcoin price surge is the upcoming Segwit2x hard-fork of Bitcoin’s blockchain, which is scheduled to occur on November 16, 2017. As a consequence of the Segwit2x hard-fork, there will be two coins: Bitcoin2x and Bitcoin. After the split, those holding bitcoins will receive an equal number of Bitcoin2x for each bitcoin they hold.\n\nBitcoin’s rate of adoption is gaining tremendous momentum as well. For example, Coinbase added more than 100,000 customers in just a single day.\n\nStocks of Bitcoin-Related Companies Continue to Soar\n\nFinancial markets have been renewing all-time highs for several weeks in a row. The week ending November 3, 2017, the Dow Jones Industrial Index established a new record of 23,557 points. Meanwhile, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was fueled by technology companies, such as Apple and Nvidia, and also hit a new record price, closing the week at 2,587.84 points.\n\nSimilarly, during the same period, companies linked to Bitcoin saw the value of their stock surge to all-time highs.\n\nFor example, Nvidia reached the new all-time high of $209.97 USD, on November 1, 2017. Nvidia is a chip maker that manufactures devices for mining Bitcoin, as well as for artificial intelligence, deep learning, and driverless cars.\n\nOn the same date, Square’s (SQ) stock price also climbed to the all-time value of $37.52 USD, closing the week at $36.89 USD. Square, Inc. develops and provides payment processing, point-of-sale (POS), marketing and financial services. Customers using Square’s network can perform payments in Bitcoin.\n\nFor four weeks in a row, stock markets and Bitcoin traders have been bullish. As a result, interest in investing in cryptocurrencies is increasing exponentially. However, investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon need to be cautious before investing.\n\nDo you think there is a relationship between Bitcoin, technology companies, and the recent unprecedented surge in the stock markets? Let us know what you think in the comments below.\n\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock', 'At a time in which bitcoin reaches a new record high around the $7,500 mark and catapults the cryptocurrency market cap above the $200 billion mark for the first time in history, Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam makes it clear that he isn’t a fan of the cryptocurrency, as he stated it was the “very definition of a bubble” while speaking at a news conference in Zurich.\n\nThe CEO expressed caution as interest in bitcoin could eventually subside. He noted that right now people are buying the cryptocurrency expecting a price rise that will help them make money, not as a store of value, meaning it is a bubble. He notably stated:\n\n“From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.”\n\nTidjane Thiam added that bitcoin currently presents a number of challenges, and expressed concern over its anonymity, as to him it is particularly problematic for financial institutions that, given the potential money-laundering risks, are likely not to get involved with the cryptocurrency. He added:\n\n“Bitcoin presents a number of challenges. The first of them is really the anonymity. (…) I think most banks in the current state of regulation have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges.\n\nAnalysts believe that more institutional investors are going to enter the cryptocurrency ecosystem, as one of the largest derivatives exchange in the world, CME Group, recently decided to launch bitcoin futures.\n\nGiven his words, Thiam now joins a list of bankers and Wall Street executives who believe bitcoin is a bubble. Among them are Berkshire Hathaway CEO and billionaire investor Warren Buffet, who warned there’s a “real bubble” in bitcoin as, according to him, the cryptocurrency cannot be valued because it isn’t a value-producing asset.\n\nEarlier this year, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon also criticized bitcoin by calling it a “a fraud” and stating he would fire anyone in his financial institution trading it. Later on, Dimon stated that the cryptocurrency was “worth nothing” before taking a third shot at the cryptocurrency and its investors, notably stating that anyone “stupid enough to buy [bitcoin] will pay the price.”\n\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, also stated that bitcoin is a bubble, as it met his firm’s criteria for it., partly because some investors buy coins to later on sell them at a higher price, and because of its volatility.\n\nOn the other hand, some aren’t as dismissive of bitcoin. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein recently told Bloomberg he wasn’t willing to “pooh pooh” the cryptocurrency, despite having a certain “level of discomfort with it” as is the case with anything new. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman also recently stated that bitcoin is “more than just a fad” that “isn’t inherently bad.”\n\nFeatured image from Flickr/Africa Progress Panel.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price remains well in the bullish zone above $7000 against the US Dollar.

The price gained a lot of pace and buyers succeeded in even breaking the $7200 resistance. A recent high was formed near $7477. Before $7477, there was a swing high formed at $7438 for a downside correction. Sellers pushed the price back towards $7000 and a low was formed at $6945.\n\nLater, the price recovered sharply and moved back above $7200. There was even a close above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $7438 high to $6945 low. It opened the doors for more gains above $7438. It seems like price would soon break $7500 and test the 1.236 Fib extension of the last drop from the $7438 high to $6945 low at $7555.

Bitcoin’s sevenfold rally this year fits the bill. It started the year at $973 and rocketed north of $7,245 as of Friday, up 644% in 10 months. In Zimbabwe -- the currency crisis mecca -- the cryptocurrency blasted to $12,400 on Halloween.\n\nInvestment strategists and financial advisors warn Bitcoin is another bubble akin to the tech boom of the late 1990s to early 2000s, the housing crash of 2006-2007 and the commodities bust of 2008-2009.\n\n“A month before the 1987 crash, my cab driver said he started day trading,” said Scott Kelly, CEO of Black Dog Venture Partners in Phoenix, Ariz. “A month before the real estate crash in 2007 in Arizona, my cab driver said he was getting into flipping real estate. Last week, my Uber driver said he just started trading Bitcoin.” CoinMarketCap.com\n\nSince debuting nine years ago, Bitcoin has graduated from the wild west of fintech to the mainstream. The crowd is piling in. CME Group the past week announced it will create futures products based Bitcoin. New companies are popping up everywhere selling you on buying Bitcoin for your retirement. Newsletters tout their Bitcoin trading strategy could make $1.64 million in 72 hours. Stories of overnight cryptocurrency millionaires abound.\n\nThe brightest minds in business and economics are shouting from rooftops that Bitcoin is in a bubble: Mark Cuban, Warren Buffet, Robert Shiller, Jamie Dimon.\n\n“But it is anybody’s guess what inning. It looks to me like we’re well ahead of the 7th-inning stretch,” said Jason R. Escamilla, CEO of ImpactAdvisor, an investment advisory firm in San Francisco. “The price level and energy usage are unsustainable. There is far better technology emerging to meet the same needs.”\n\nThose include Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Ripple, which top the list of 1,255 cryptocurrencies on the market tracked by CoinMarketCap.com.

Teaming up with London-based Blockpool, a B2B blockchain framework, Björk has allowed for four different digital currencies to be used to buy her album, reports The Times. These include bitcoin, litecoin, dashcoin, and audiocoin.\n\nThose who pre-order her album through her website or Björk’s record label One Little Indian will receive 100 AudioCoins. These can then be converted to other cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, that amounts to just over $0.25. The reward will be deposited into an e-wallet created for them by Blockpool. It may also be possible for fans to be rewarded with more audiocoins by sharing links to Björk’s music and merchandise on social media.\n\nAccording to Blockpool, current streaming services are failing to provide artists with fair incomes, stating that ‘decentralised music currency rewards fans and artists at the same time.’\n\nWith the use of the blockchain artists will receive payment from fans at the same time as fans receive the music on their computers. By cutting out the middleman, artists don’t need to worry about seeing a cut from the album sales.\n\nThis move by Björk marks a significant step by a major artist to back the use of digital currencies in the last few years. In October 2015, Imogen Heap, Grammy Award-winning U.K. singer, songwriter, and producer, released her song Tiny Human on a smart contract. Blockchain startup Ujo Music worked with Heap on the project. Fans of Heap were able to pay for her single with ether.\n\nLast October, while speaking at the Oslo Innovation Week, Heap explained that it was time that the industry reinvented the way in which people discover new content and how creators get paid. In her opinion the blockchain presents the solution to many of the issues surrounding the music industry.\n\nAccording to Kevin Bacon, Blockpool CEO, while people have done things involving cryptocurrencies and artists before, this is the first time it has been achieved on this scale by a major performer.\n\nMusic Ally reports Bacon as saying:\n\nWhile it will be interesting to see how the crypto community responds to this, Utopia is also a gateway for people to go into crypto for the first time. Björk is the best artist in the world we could imagine doing this.\n\nFeatured image from björk guðmundsdóttir.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Now that Bitcoin Cash has been around for a while, the first statistics have come to light. An analysis by Chainalysis paints a pretty interesting picture for BCH. Most of the transaction volume comes from now coins. A lot of BCH is spent within six hours of being held. Not an ideal store of value by any means, although that isn’t surprising. Speculation is the driving factor for the current BCH price, that much is rather evident.\n\nThere are a lot of different opinions regarding Bitcoin Cash these days. Not everyone is in favor of this altcoin, for obvious reasons. Moreover, its value seems to be even more speculative than that of Bitcoin right now. That is one title no other cryptocurrency would like to have right now.Moreover, people don’t seem to like holding BCH for long. With most new coins being spent within six hours, it is not a store of value by any means. This begs the question as to what Bitcoin Cash is suited for exactly.\n\nBitcoin Cash is a Speculative Tool\n\nAt the same time, the daily transaction volume seems to be going up. There are some spikes and dips, but overall, there is steady growth. A positive development for an emerging altcoin. Chainalytics didn’t indicate what the coins are being spent on, though. Moving funds to and from exchanges appears to be the main purpose right now. This also explains why 70% of BCH have a limited coin age. One in five coins is less than a month old right now. Moreover, 80% of coins spent after the fork was acquired within six hours.\n\nOn the mining front, things are a bit different. While miners have been able to abuse the mining difficulty algorithm on demand, most miners tend to keep their coins. Around 45% of coins are still unspent, compared to 33% for Bitcoin. The positive effect is how it is difficult to sell Bitcoin Cash right now. However, if there is not enough demand, none of it really matters. Right now, demand comes from Bithumb, but that volume is drying up pretty quickly.\n\nIt is evident Bitcoin Cash still has a lot to prove at this stage. Day traders benefit the most from this altcoin. This will eventually lead to even more volatility, which isn’t necessarily good or bad. New coins brought in circulation will be spent pretty quickly. It will be interesting to see if the upcoming hard fork changes this procedure in any way. Until BCH is used for regular transactions, the majority of the volume relates to trading and mining. How this will affect the BCH price, remains to be determined.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein is not comfortable with bitcoin, but he says that he understands that it may ultimately prove to be the next step in the evolution of money\n\nThe investment banking executive, who last month used a rare tweet to state that he was “thinking about bitcoin” but had not formed a definitive opinion, shared his updated thoughts on cryptocurrency in an interview with Bloomberg held at the investment banking firm’s Sustainable Finance Innovation Forum in New York.\n\nHe stated that the thought of bitcoin gave him a “level of discomfort” but conceded that he felt the same level of skepticism when he first encountered the cell phone:\n\n“I have a level discomfort with [bitcoin], as I have a level of discomfort with anything that’s new,” he said. “But I’ve learned over the years that there’s a lot of things that work out pretty well that I don’t love.”\n\nA self-described history buff, Blankfein reflected that the evolution of money has taken paths that many people from earlier eras might not have predicted. “Maybe in the new world, something gets back by consensus. Instead of a government fiat, maybe it’s a consensual arrangement by people that agree that it’s worth something,” he stated.\n\nConsequently, Blankfein does not intend to let his personal discomfort get in the way of a potentially disruptive technology. Perhaps this is why Goldman Sachs is considering launching a bitcoin trading operation at the same time that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is publicly threatening to fire “stupid” employees who engage in bitcoin trading.\n\nBlankfein added that, if bitcoin did achieve mainstream adoption, he would be able to explain how it fits into the historical narrative of monetary philosophy. “If we went into the future and bitcoins were successful, I would be able to explain how it was a natural evolution from hard money,” he stated.\n\n“Maybe 200 years from now even someone like me might be comfortable with it, but right now, I tell you: I don’t have an investment in it, but I’m not willing to pooh-pooh it and that’s why I say I’m open to it,” Blankfein concluded.\n\nFeatured image from YouTube/Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
11/05/2017,"['For the first time since March of this year, the bitcoin dominance index has surpassed 61 percent, further solidifying bitcoin’s position as the leading digital currency within the global cryptocurrency market.\n\nFrom January to September, the dominance index of bitcoin has declined from around 90 percent to 30 percent. But, in the past few months, the dominance index of bitcoin has gradually increased and earlier this week, bitcoin dominance index surpassed the 60 percent mark at last.\n\nReallocation of Funds From Alternative Cryptocurrencies (Altcoins) to Bitcoin\n\nThe dominance index of bitcoin has surged since September, as an increasing number of investors and traders started to reallocate their holdings in altcoins to bitcoin. More to that, the announcements of two of the world’s largest options exchanges CME and CBOE to launch bitcoin futures exchanges by the end of 2017 have increased the demand for bitcoin from the traditional financial industry.\n\nAt the time of reporting, LedgerX remains as the only Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-regulated Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) approved to deal with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In the first week of its launch, a period in which the LedgerX team expected to clear minimal volumes to test its systems, LedgerX settled more than $1 million in bitcoin derivatives and options trades.\n\nBased on the success of LedgerX and the rapidly growing demand for bitcoin from the traditional financial industry, CME and CBOE have begun to focus on the development, deployment, and approval of large-scale bitcoin options exchanges.\n\nIn August, Ed Tilly, CBOE Holdings Chairman and CEO, stated:\n\n“CBOE is not only a home to options, derivatives and the VIX but also ETF innovations and foreign exchange. This makes us the natural choice for the development and trading of bitcoin futures. We very much look forward to responding to the growing interest in cryptocurrencies through the creation of bitcoin futures traded on a regulated derivatives exchange, with the many expected benefits that this brings, including transparency, price discovery, deep liquidity and centralized clearing.”\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the entrance of institutional and retail traders into the bitcoin market because over the past month, that has helped bitcoin regain its dominance over the cryptocurrency market and evolve into a robust, widely recognized, and accepted store of value.\n\nCan Bitcoin Dominance Index Reach 90 Percent Again?\n\nBitcoin has established itself as a store of value and a safe haven asset since early 2016. It is unlikely that bitcoin could gain 90 percent in dominance index again in the upcoming months, given the exponential growth rate of Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, two cryptocurrencies with different philosophies and purposes in contrast to bitcoin.\n\nBut, bitcoin remains as one of the very few public blockchains and stores of value within the global cryptocurrency market that is being used by active users, traders, investors, and businesses. If the demand for bitcoin continues to increase in the mid-term, the dominance index of bitcoin will likely achieve 70 percent.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Another week, another new high for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and easily the most popular virtual currency on the planet.\n\nWhile traditional investors are used to seeing the stock market return 7% a year, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, bitcoin\'s price has surged by well over 640% since the year began, recently touching a new all-time high of $7,454 per coin. It also firmly places bitcoin\'s market cap above $120 billion.\n\nHow on Earth has bitcoin become the top-performing and most talked about investment of 2017? It really has to do with four catalysts.\n\nBlockchain could really shore up security in the financial services industry, as well as a variety of other sectors.\n\nBitcoin\'s amazing 2017, in a nutshell\n\nThe first is the excitement surrounding blockchain, which is the digital and decentralized ledger that underlies most virtual currencies and records transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank. What makes blockchain so exciting is that it\'s usually an open-source network, meaning altering logged data without someone else findings out would be practically impossible. Blockchain could really shore up security in the financial services industry, as well as a variety of other sectors.\n\nSecondly, the U.S. dollar has been sinking pretty steadily over the past year. Recently hitting multi-year lows against the euro, the weaker dollar has left investors holding cash looking for ways to protect their wealth. Usually, when the dollar is sinking, investors will buy gold. This is because of the scarcity of gold and the proven fact that it\'s a store of value (it\'s been used as a form of currency for centuries). But bitcoin is being considered a scarce asset as well. Protocols limit the number of mined bitcoin to 21 million, which some investors believe makes bitcoin a proper store of value.\n\nThird, there\'s growing excitement surrounding bitcoin as a mode of payment. Five brand-name businesses have accepted bitcoin since 2014, and a host of smaller merchants have latched on since then. As a libertarians\' dream currency, some investors are simply excited about the potential for merchant expansion.\n\nAnd lastly, emotions have played a key role in pushing bitcoin higher. Even though we\'re beginning to see a few institutional investors getting involved – Goldman Sachs is tinkering with the idea of opening trading operations in bitcoin — retail investors primarily control bitcoin\'s price movements. Since retail investors are far more susceptible to emotional trading than Wall Street institutions, it\'s led to a rush into bitcoin, with some folks not wanting to miss the boat.\n\nMore: Bitcoin\'s creator may be worth $6 billion — but people still don\'t know who it is\n\nMore: Amazon gets three cryptocurrency domain names\n\nMore: Bitcoin jumps $400 in one day and soars to a new record high\n\nWhile traditional investors are used to seeing the stock market return 7% a year, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, bitcoin\'s price has surged by well over 640% since the year began, recently touching a new all-time high of $7,454 per coin.\n\nThe costly mistake bitcoin investors are making\n\nWhile it\'s been an undeniably great year for bitcoin investors, I\'d argue that many of these investors could be making a crucial mistake. Namely, placing too much emphasis on bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nThough long-term buy-and-hold investment mogul Warren Buffett has thus far been wrong about bitcoin, he did raise an important point back in 2014. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett said:\n\nStay away from it. It\'s a mirage basically. It\'s a method of transmitting money. It\'s a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money? Just because they can transmit money? I hope bitcoin becomes a better way to do it. But you can replicate it a bunch of different ways. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.\n\nIf you were to try to live off bitcoin, there\'s a really good chance you\'d struggle to do so. Bitcoin\'s volatility, lengthy settlement times, and transaction fees work against the idea of recruiting more merchants to the virtual currency. Plus, there\'s really no floor beneath bitcoin without government backing or any concrete fundamental drivers.\n\nIt\'s also worth pointing out that the barrier to entry in the virtual currency space is pretty low. There are now nearly 1,200 global cryptocurrencies, and big businesses have in some cases banded together to create their own virtual currencies.\n\nHow on Earth has bitcoin become the top-performing and most talked about investment of 2017? It really has to do with four catalysts.\n\nOh yeah, one more thing...\n\nIt\'s also possible that investors are misplacing their faith in bitcoin\'s blockchain. Back in August, bitcoin forked into two separate virtual currencies — bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash — because the bitcoin community was at odds over how best to upgrade its blockchain. Those in Bitcoin Cash chose to expand capacity within the existing blockchain. As for bitcoin, the SegWit2x upgrade took some information off the blockchain to boost capacity, reduce transaction fees, and speed up settlement times. The move was clearly made to attract big business.\n\nHowever, bitcoin\'s blockchain may not be the preference of enterprises. There are currently more than 150 organizations testing a version of Ethereum\'s blockchain in pilot and small-scale trials via the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Bitcoin\'s biggest rival, Ethereum, also has a valuable feature known as ""smart contracts"" built into its blockchain. Smart contracts are protocols that assist with facilitating, verifying, and enforcing the negotiation of a contract. Right now, Ethereum looks to be the preferred blockchain, which is where the tangible value of cryptocurrencies really lies.\n\nIt\'s quite possible that bitcoin investors are buying into the wrong catalysts, which could turn out to be bad news over the long run.\n\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Purchasers of the album will also receive 100 Audiocoins as a bonus ‘reward’. CEO of Blockpool, Kevin Bacon, has stated “this isn’t about jumping on a bandwagon or trying to get rich quick. It’s about doing things where you use blockchain and the crypto benefits in ways that people haven’t thought of yet.”\n\nBlockpool’s website states that the collaboration employs “its proprietary blockchain integration technology to build a smart rewards system,” alongside their “cryptocurrency checkout plugin.” When a customer proceeds through the checkout after purchasing Bjork’s album, they will be invited to claim their Audiocoins using the Blockpool’s ‘myblockpool’ portal.\n\nBjork’s New Album Is Available for Purchase Using Four Cryptocurrencies\n\nAudiocoin (ADC) was launched in 2015, seeking to incentivize both consumption and production of music through distributing Audiocoins to music consumers in exchange for streaming and downloading music.

Bitcoin’s strong bull run and prominent media mentions have likely sucked the air out of the room for ETH usage over the past month.\n\nHash rate has plateaued, declining slightly, while difficulty has remained largely unchanged. The scheduled drop in difficulty will not last forever and is meant to decrease block times, which remain at a steady 23 seconds. The block reward has also been reduced from 5ETH to 3ETH in an effort to combat inflation and eventually phase out Proof of Work (PoW) in favor of Proof of Stake (PoS). If ETH price does not rise proportionally, ETH hash rate may continue to decline on scheduled difficulty increases.\n\nThe ETH developers conference, DevCon3, ran from November 1st-4th in Cancun. Vitalik closed the first day discussing his idea of a roadmap for scalability and the challenges ahead. He describes a trilemma including decentralization, scalability, and security, with sharding as a potential solution moving forward. Sharding is a type of database partitioning which uses asynchronous communication between shards, with each client only processing a portion of the blockchain at a time.\n\nVlad Zamifir also spoke on Casper the Friendly GHOST: A correct-by-construction blockchain which provided further explanation and insight into ETH’s upcoming shift from PoW to PoS.\n\nETH trading volume has been led by Bitcoin (BTC) and the US Dollar (USD) pairs on Poloniex and Bitfinex respectively. South Korean Won (KRW) has lost its multi-week reign over volume as traders have moved to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash recently.\n\nVolume from Japanese Yen (JPY) has begun to grow on Quoine for the first time. Expect this share of volume to increase greatly once ETH wakes from its slumber.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nPrice continues to be dominated by a large ascending triangle chart pattern, which holds a bullish bias, with a 1.618 fib extension and measured move of ~US$650 and ~US$800 respectively. The pattern is currently in its 169th day of consolidation and has remained above the 200EMA, reinforcing the continued bullish bias.\n\nWhen price has begun consolidating for an extended period of time, as it has currently, traders often look to Bollinger Bands (BBands), which measure volatility and attempt to predict resolution of that consolidation. BBands represent a volatility channel which will squeeze during low volatility and expand during high volatility. Several closes above or below the median line, or 20SMA (red), suggest a bullish or bearish bias pre-breakout, respectively. A candle close above or below the BBands post-contraction is also a predictive signal for the direction of the breakout.\n\nDaily BBands have not squeezed to this extent since October 2016 (not shown). That squeeze resolved in a bearish move, and prompted the beginning of a 40 day downtrend. Price has also not closed above the median line since October 2017, suggesting an imminent bearish resolution. One caveat with BBands: there is often an initial move in the wrong direction, which Bollinger calls the head fake.\n\nIchimoku Cloud on the daily chart with singled settings (10/30/60/30) for a faster signal show mixed Cloud metrics, as is often the case during extended consolidation. Trading the Cloud classically would require a long or short position every kumo breakout and TK cross accordingly, as one will eventually payoff. Traders will often ignore the Cloud altogether during price structure such as this, realizing that there are better indicators that will help decide the direction of the coming resolution.\n\nIchimoku Cloud on the daily chart with doubled settings (20/60/120/30) for a more accurate and smoother signal show all Cloud metrics essentially bullish. These signals will likely be too late to accurately capture the resolution of consolidation. Signals turning decidedly bearish would likely be a confirmation of BBands and singled Cloud.\n\nLastly, the ETH/BTC ratio continues to decline as BTC/USD increases in price and ETH/USD remains stagnant. Price has sold off to the previous lift off of the bullish flag. These triangle points are often key support or resistance horizontal levels if revisited. There is also a building bullish divergence, lower lows in price on less momentum, suggestive of a reversal soon.\n\nBoth the Ichimoku Cloud and the 50/200EMA cross have been strong signals of a trend shift, first with a bearish kumo breakout in July and then a Death Cross in October. Should ETH/BTC slide further, the previous all time high (not shown) should act as a support zone, along with the large wick that sold off to 0.025.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth the network and price have remained quiescent through the latest ETH hard fork. With ICO mania subsiding, transactions per day have decreased after peaking at 500,000. Buterin and the ETH development team continue to work on scaling solutions for the PoW to PoS transition.\n\nAfter nearly six months of consolidation, price should break its current ranging zone within the next few weeks on an expected bullish bias. With the Bitcoin SegWit2x fork on the horizon around November 15th, Bitcoin holders looking to hedge into ETH may inadvertently also trigger a new all time high. The bullish target has been US$800 since the beginning of consolidation. A bearish target would likely be 50% of the range, or ~US$240, although a breakdown on this pattern would likely bring price much lower.', 'Known for embracing all things edgy, musician Bjork has announced that her latest album, Utopia, will be available for purchase through cryptocurrencies. The artist will accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, DASH, and AudioCoin.\n\nThe move by the musician may seem like a marketing strategy of sorts to appear unique and to draw attention during a time when Bitcoin’s rise has brought cryptocurrencies into the mainstream. However, according to Kevin Bacon of Blockpool:\n\n""This really isn’t a marketing strategy with Björk. This is a decision to be a leader. In fact, it’s just the obvious thing to do for her. If I wasn’t involved in this project, I’d expect Björk to be a leader in this area, and for her team to be doing creative things with crypto.”\n\nVirtuous Satoshi cycles\n\nAs adoption of cryptocurrencies increases, the price and number of transactions increase, causing greater price stability, and stability increases mainstream adoption. This process of adoption and stability has been referred to as a Satoshi cycle, and is the underlying driver for the increase in Bitcoin price.\n\nBjork’s album offering is simply another step in the ladder of adoption and stability. As the cryptocurrency market continues to gain traction, prices follow the adoption curve and drive the adoption curve concurrently.', 'Is bitcoin a legitimate asset, or a super-bubble waiting to implode? As prices for the cryptocurrency skyrocket, investors and pundits are increasingly taking sides.\n\nWhether you’re a backer or a detractor, what’s not in doubt is bitcoin’s dizzying rally this year. The most widely used digital currency crossed the $7,000 mark on Thursday and is up more than 650% in 2017. It’s managed to whip past the $100 billion total value mark despite governmental crackdowns and mainstream market skepticism. Bitcoin was trading at $7,218 at 9:37 a.m. New York time on Friday.\n\nWith the rhetoric for and against heating up this week amid bitcoin’s barreling gains, here’s a look at where some big names in finance stand — from those who see it as the natural evolution of money, to the naysayers waiting for the asset to crash and burn.\n\nBitcoin’s Backers\n\nThe digital currency’s evangelists are led by Roger Ver, known in the industry as “Bitcoin Jesus.” Ver remains optimistic about bitcoin’s sustainability amid attempts from governments like China to curb some of the more speculative elements of trading. “The only way to stop (bitcoin) is to turn off the entire Internet in the entire world and keep it turned off,” he said in a September interview with Bloomberg News.\n\nSome countries are jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon, with Argentina’s most important futures market considering offering services to investors in digital currencies, while Turkish Central Bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya said digital currencies may contribute to financial stability if designed well.\n\nRonnie Moas, who for the past 13 years has made more than 900 stock recommendations via his one-man show at Standpoint Research, upped his 2018 price forecast to $11,000 from $7,500 on Friday. He maintained his $50,000 target for 2027, though he said it was conservative.\n\nBitcoin’s Detractors\n\nSeverin Cabannes, deputy chief executive officer at Societe Generale SA, was the latest big bank official to weigh in, saying that “Bitcoin today is in my view very clearly in a bubble,” in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday.\n\nSpeculation around bitcoin is the “very definition of a bubble,” Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Tidjane Thiam told reporters in Zurich on Thursday. “The only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money,” and such speculation “has rarely led to a happy end,” Thiam said.\n\nThemis Trading LLC raised a red flag this week after CME Group Inc. announced plans to introduce bitcoin futures, saying the world’s largest exchange owner appeared to have “caved in” to pressure from clients. “A bitcoin future would be placing a seal of approval around a very risky, unregulated instrument that has a history of fraud and manipulation,” the firm said in a blog post.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon remains one of Wall Street’s most strident bitcoin opponents, saying in October that people who buy the currency are “stupid”and that governments will eventually crush it.\n\nOn the Fence\n\nWhile CME’s decision to offer bitcoin futures by the end of the year appears to be an endorsement of the currency’s viability, CEO Terry Duffy demurred when asked whether he’s concerned about a potential bubble. “I’ve seen a lot of different bubbles over the last 37 years,” he said on Bloomberg TV. “It’s not up to me to predict if it’s a bubble or not — what I’m here to do is to help people manage risk.”\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein isn’t sure what to make of bitcoin and is unwilling to reject the digital currency just yet. “I know that once upon a time, a coin was worth $5 if it had $5 worth of gold in it,” Blankfein said in another Bloomberg TV interview. “Now we have paper that is just backed by fiat … maybe in the new world, something gets backed by consensus.”\n\nWhile Thomas J. Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors has turned cautious on bitcoin in the short term because of its big gains, he remains a long-term bull on the digital currency — maintaining a 2022 price target of $25,000.\n\n© 2017 Bloomberg', 'Finance\n\nJust recently the sponsor of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX: GBTC), Grayscale Investments, has announced its plans for the bitcoin cash (BCH) reserves the trust is currently holding. According to Grayscale, the BCH will be sold over time, and a remittance date for shareholder proceeds will be announced upon completion of the sales.\n\nAlso read: New To Bitcoin? Welcome! Here’s How To Take Those First Steps\n\nGrayscale to Sell Bitcoin Cash Reserves Currently Held by the Investment Trust\n\nTwo months ago news.Bitcoin.com reported on the firm Grayscale contemplating what it would do with the bitcoin cash reserves it received from the August hard fork. At the time the trust’s sponsor detailed it might create a separate trust for BCH or sell the reserves and credit shareholders. The trustee’s agent will sell the BCH over a period of time that will not exceed 90 days, explains the firm.\n\n“[The agent] will remit the cash proceeds from such sale, net of any administrative and other reasonable expenses incurred by the agent in connection therewith, to record date shareholders upon completion of the sale,” explains Grayscale Investments plan for bitcoin cash reserves.\n\nThe agent will thereafter sell the bitcoin cash over a period of time, currently not expected to exceed 90 days, and remit the cash proceeds from such sale, net of any administrative and other reasonable expenses incurred by the agent in connection therewith, to record date Shareholders upon completion of the sale.\n\nBCH Sale Prices Difficult for the Trustee to Determine\n\nThe New York-based digital currency investment firm explains that BCH is traded throughout multiple exchanges, and with the asset’s volatile price it’s not possible to predict the value of BCH for distribution yet. Grayscale details that BCH/USD markets reported intra-day price ranges between $310-340 per token or their equivalents measured in other cryptocurrencies. However, today’s intra-day ranges on November 4 have seen BCH between $600-650 per token as the cryptocurrency has been on a tear since Grayscale’s observation.\n\n“There is no assurance that prices in this range (before deduction of expenses) would have been realizable had the bitcoin cash currently held in the trust been liquidated on such date,” Grayscale’s announcement details.\n\nAs a result, there can be no assurance as to the price or prices for Bitcoin Cash that the Agent may realize, and the value of Bitcoin Cash may increase or decrease after any sale of Bitcoin Cash by the Agent.\n\nThe GBTC bitcoin-based trust created in 2013 has been a popular mainstream investment model for those looking for bitcoin exposure. Many of GBTC’s shareholders have been curious to how Grayscale and the GBTC fund would handle the BCH distribution or credit for the token’s associated sales. Grayscale reminds its investors that, after the completed sales on the recorded dates, shareholders should consult their tax attorneys or accountants to avoid auditing implications.\n\nWhat do you think about Grayscale selling bitcoin cash reserves and crediting shareholders? Why do you think they chose to sell rather than creating a separate BCH trust?

For instance, check out our Tools page!', 'Owning cryptocurrency isn\'t quite the Wild West experience it was at the beginning of the decade, but investors still face plenty of instability and risk. The threats aren\'t just abstract or theoretical; new scams crop up, and old ones resurge, all the time. Whether it\'s a fake wallet set up to trick users, a phishing attempt to steal private cryptographic keys, or even fake cryptocurrency schemes, there’s something to watch out for at every turn.\n\nCryptocurrencies can feel secure, because they decentralize and often anonymize digital transactions. They also validate everything on public, tamper-resistant blockchains. But those measures don\'t make cryptocurrencies any less susceptible to the types of simple, time-honored scams grifters have relied on in other venues. Just this week, scams have arisen that divert funds from users\' mining rigs to malicious wallets, because victims forgot to change default login credentials. Search engine phishing scams that tout malicious trading sites over legitimate exchanges have also spiked. And a trojan called CryptoShuffler has stolen thousands of dollars by lurking on computers, and spying on Bitcoin wallet addresses that land in copy/paste clipboards.\n\nA few simple steps, though, can help cryptocurrency proponents—be it Bitcoin or Monero or anything between—guard against a swath of common attacks. Just as you might keep your cash out of plain sight, or stash your jewelry in a safe deposit box, it pays to put a little effort into how you manage your cryptocurrency. The following won\'t defend against every conceivable attack on your digital doubloons, but it\'s a good place to start.\n\nCold, Hard (Digital) Cash\n\nA key step to protecting your cryptocurrency is to store anything of significant value in a hardware wallet—a physical device, like a USB drive, that stores your private keys and currency locally, and isn’t connected to the internet. Experts caution against storing large amounts of coins through cryptocurrency exchanges, or in digital wallet apps on your smartphone or computer. The public-facing internet offers an attacker too many inroads to attempt to infiltrate your wallet, or trick you into giving them access.\n\nSecure hardware wallets like Trezor or the Ledger Nano S cost about $100 or less and have a straightforward setup. You just choose a PIN number and a recovery ""seed"" (usually a set of words and numbers) in case you forget your PIN, or your wallet malfunctions. It\'s pretty robust security, so make sure you keep copies of your PIN and seed somewhere accessible to you, but not to home intruders. Recovering currency stored on a hardware wallet after losing both the PIN and the seed is a whole thing. Emin Gun Sirer, a distributed systems and cryptography researcher at Cornell University, goes so far as to suggest that you should ""keep a backup of the seed key in a fireproof safe."" This stuff is for real.\n\nYour setup also doesn\'t have to be fancy; you can store backups of your coins on any external storage device, like a portable hard drive. Just make sure to encrypt the data in case the device is lost or stolen. You might even consider making a backup to leave in a safe deposit box.\n\nBig Spender\n\nThe downside to a hardware wallet is that it makes approving transactions a bit cumbersome. If you want more fluid access to your cryptocurrency, experts suggest storing a small amount in a wallet app to facilitate low-value transactions. The key here: Only keep an amount you would be willing to lose in the app, and never give anyone your private key.\n\nApps like Mycelium Wallet that are interoperable with popular hardware wallets can make your setup more seamless. And some app-based options like Samourai Wallet are working to prioritize robust encryption and privacy features. Still, don\'t trust any app with too much cryptocash right now.\n\nAdditionally, consider where you store your private keys, the secret part of the public-private key set that lets you authorize revisions to a blockchain. Always keep them encrypted, and try to avoid leaving them lying around on devices that you use all the time for a lot of different tasks, like your personal PC.\n\nAlso consider your transactions carefully. There are tons of established, reliable institutions, but gimmicky new cryptocurrencies crop up all the time, as well as questionable Initial Coin Offerings that could have nothing behind them but scammers on the move. When the cryptocurrency OneCoin, marketed as a Bitcoin competitor, launched this year people bought about $350 million-worth of the coins—which has since drawn comparisons to a Ponzi scheme. And people are even being scammed during legitimate ICOs when attackers launch phishing attacks around the events, or trick would-be investors into sending money to fake wallets. (The Securities and Exchange Commission is poking hard on this.)\n\nNail the Basics\n\nIt\'s also important to remember that all the small things you\'re already doing (right?) to protect your general digital life help defend your cryptocurrency as well. ""We encourage all customers to take a few foundational, and free, actions to put them on a much more stable security footing,"" says Philip Martin, director of security at the cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase. ""Use a password manager, use two-factor authentication, leverage enhanced security protocols for your email address.""\n\nFor the especially concerned, Martin even suggests turning on Gmail\'s new Advanced Protection feature, and/or adding defenses like a PIN or password to your phone number to make it harder for attackers to grab control of your accounts by transferring your SIM to their own device.\n\nAll of these suggestions bolster your general digital security hygiene, but they are particularly helpful for reducing your exposure to the most simple (sometimes impressively so) cryptocurrency scams that can take advantage of small things, like a reused password and no second authentication requirement, to walk in the front door of one of your accounts.\n\nTake that CryptoShuffler trojan, which originally emerged more than a year ago and has been making the rounds again this week. It shows just how basic cryptocurrency scams can be. The malware works by lurking silently on a victim’s computer and passively monitoring their clipboard, waiting for the victim to copy a Bitcoin wallet address. When it sees a string of numbers that looks right, CryptoShuffler simply starts swapping the wallet ID the victim copied for its own malicious wallet address in payment fields. If the victim doesn’t spot the change, the transaction goes through and the coins go to the crooks.\n\nThe best way to defend against an attack like that (if your malware scanner doesn\'t detect the intrusion) is simply watching all transactions carefully, and taking steps to safeguard your assets so you know your data hasn\'t been exposed.\n\nAnd once you have the basics in place, make sure your friends adopt the same mindset. The more secure the ecosystem, the less attractive a target it is to bad actors. “Help newcomers to crypto with their security,” Cornell\'s Sirer says. “The area is new and we need to support the people who are just finding their way in.”\n\nLuckily, you don\'t need to be a cryptography expert to take the basic security steps that will protect you against the majority of attacks. And seriously, if nothing else, don\'t lose that wallet seed.', '']"

This means that the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse.\n\nThe 100 SMA is close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at the $6256.06 level and the ascending trend line connecting the lows over the past month. The gap between the moving averages has been maintained, which signals consistent bullish pressure.\n\nStochastic is heading south so bitcoin price could keep the following suit until buying momentum returns. RSI has more room to tumble so the correction could stay in play for a while until both oscillators indicate oversold conditions and turn back up.\n\nA larger pullback could last until the broken resistance around $5800-6000, which is closer to the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nThe bitcoin network upgrade is due to take place in a week and it’s understandable that investors are starting to pare their risk ahead of this event risk. If it turns out anything like the previous hard fork, bitcoin price could be poised to reestablish its uptrend and possibly go for new highs after the upgrade.\n\nMeanwhile, the US dollar is under a bit of selling pressure on a foreseen shift in the Fed’s bias as hawkish member Dudley announced his retirement plans in mid-2018.

It received an official seal of approval over the weekend from organized religion. According to a report on Coindesk, the cryptocurrency was a topic of discussion at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. This should be good news for its proponents, who evoke an almost-religious fervor while discussing its prospects.\n\nAccording to a blockchain security company founder, bitcoin ranks 32nd globally in its value of circulation, just behind the national currencies of Finland and UAE, and ahead of South Africa and Singapore. Finally, Chinese bitcoin exchanges are changing their business models to counter regulatory crackdowns.\n\nAccording to a Coindesk report, investors on the OKEx and Huobi Pro exchanges will be able to trade fiat currencies in exchange of cryptocurrencies on a peer-to-peer network. Previously, both exchanges only allowed conversions between cryptocurrencies. This should boost trading volumes for the Chinese yuan and impose capital controls on its export from the country using cryptocurrencies.', ""Now market watchers say a significant amount of the new money is coming from large institutional investors, many of them hedge funds looking to capitalize on the skyrocketing price.\n\nMany of the hedge funds were set up over the last year to invest exclusively in virtual currencies. The research firm Autonomous Next has said the number of such hedge funds has risen from around 30 to nearly 130 this year alone.\n\nMore general-purpose hedge funds have also been buying up Bitcoin, like one run by Bill Miller, a well known mutual fund manager who spent most of his career with Legg Mason.\n\nEven more big investors are looking at the space after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced last week that it would launch a Bitcoin futures contract in the next few months. The contract will make it easier for financial institutions plugged into the exchange to get involved with the Bitcoin market without having to worry about holding Bitcoin itself.\n\nBobby Cho, the head trader at one of the largest Bitcoin trading businesses, Cumberland, said that after years of hesitancy, institutional investors now accounted for most of his business.\n\n“The vast majority of the trading we do is with institutions,” Mr. Cho said. “The education and research have turned into real-life activity.”\n\nThe New York Times Explains...\n\nThe entrance of these big investors creates new risks for Bitcoin.\n\nKevin Zhou, a longtime trader in the space, said that hedge funds were more likely than small investors to pull out a lot of money at once, and that Bitcoin was still small enough that a single fund’s cashing out could cause the price to drop sharply.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“You could get a possible run on the bank if one large investor withdraws and that causes the price to tank,” said Mr. Zhou, a co-founder of the trading firm Galois Capital. “That could cause a cascade of withdrawals.”\n\nThe rising importance of Wall Street is an unexpected turn for a virtual currency that was invented in 2008 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto and designed to operate outside the traditional financial system.\n\nThe Soaring Price of Bitcoin Since the beginning of the year, the value of Bitcoin has jumped over 600 percent. $6,000 4,000 2,000 0 $7,377 2017 April July Oct.

Many banks, including JPMorgan, have been trying to find ways to create their own decentralized databases, like the Bitcoin blockchain, that could provide a more reliable and secure way to track information.\n\nIn the technology industry, there has been a rush this year of so-called initial coin offerings, a way for entrepreneurs to raise money by creating and selling their own custom virtual currencies. Initial coin offerings have taken over $3 billion from investors this year after attracting almost no interest before.\n\nThese coin offerings have created their own demand for Bitcoin because the new coins generally have to be bought with an existing virtual currency like Bitcoin.\n\nThe interest in Bitcoin could be dampened in the coming weeks, however, by a debate among Bitcoin followers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBitcoin start-ups and programmers have been fighting for nearly three years about the best way to update the software that governs the currency and the network on which it lives.\n\nThe battle is expected to come to a head this month when new Bitcoin software, backed by many of the biggest virtual currency start-ups, is released. The new software aims to double the number of transactions flowing through the network. Currently, the computers processing Bitcoin transactions are limited to about five transactions per second.\n\nMost of the programmers who maintain the Bitcoin software have opposed the changes because they say it would make it harder for individuals to track their own Bitcoins.\n\nSome of the computers on the network are likely to update to the new software while others stay with the existing rules, creating a split, or fork, in the network that would result in two separate Bitcoins.\n\nA Bitcoin fork could prove disruptive and drive away investors. But several signals suggest that the proposed rule changes are not likely to win enough support to survive for long, which would leave the status quo in place.\n\nBitcoin has already survived past attempts to fork the software and create imitators. In August, a group of former Bitcoin supporters created Bitcoin Cash, a totally separate virtual currency that makes it easier to do small transactions, like paying for a cup of coffee.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin temporarily wavered before Bitcoin Cash was introduced. All previous holders of Bitcoin were automatically granted the same number of Bitcoin Cash, and the value of those has also been rising, essentially doubling in the last month.\n\nChris Burniske, a co-author of a book on virtual currency investing, “Cryptoassets,” said most of the new investors weren’t too concerned about the exact design of Bitcoin or the current debates.\n\n“I don’t think a lot of the new buyers are overly concerned about the long-term technical aspects of Bitcoin,” he said. They are “simply approaching it as a financial instrument.”"", 'The cryptocurrency wave that appears to be sweeping Wall Street is not just benefiting bitcoin.\n\nThe digital currency, which has seen its price spike 600% this year, is getting a bit more respect and attention from traditional Wall Street players. Exchange groups CME and Cboe, for instance, are planning to roll out their own bitcoin futures products and Goldman Sachs is considering a bitcoin trading operation. Over 70 cryptocurrency hedge funds have sprouted up to take advantage of investment opportunities in the booming crypto space, according to analytics provider Autonomous NEXT.\n\nAnd at least two bitcoin-related companies appear to be riding the wave as well.\n\nThe stock of Bitcoin Group, a bitcoin mining company, and Hive Blockchain Technologies, another crypto mining company, have both seen their share price appreciate by more than 1,000%.\n\nOn Monday the price of Bitcoin Group, a Australia-based company, traded near $80 per share, up 1,006% since the beginning of the year. The company operates bitcoin mining facilities in Australia, Iceland, and China.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are unleashed and bitcoin transactions are processed on the underpinning blockchain network.\n\nHive Blockchain Technologies, a Canadian firm, is up 3,690% year-to-date at $4 per share.

However, the pop was short-lived, and prices soon fell back below the previous record high of $7,454.05 recorded Nov. 3.\n\nNotably, this is the third time in the last week that BTC has failed to hold above $7,400, despite having clocked a new high.\n\nSo what's stopping the bulls from attacking the $8,000 mark? Though the exact cause is unclear, the following factors could be behind the trader reticence above $7,400.\n\nTo start with, comments on social media indicate investors are seeing the likelihood of a short-term pullback, and the resulting caution may have weakened the bid tone.\n\nFurther, the realization may have seeped into the market that the upcoming Segwit2x hard fork may not mean free money.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'The break-neck speed rally of Bitcoin has left investors wondering where Bitcoin would finally stabilize. Goldman Sachs believes that $8,000 would be the consolidation level for the current rally.\n\nWhere does rally stop?\n\nBitcoin’s price may have smashed through the $5000, $6000 and $7000 levels over the past few weeks, but technical analysts expect it to go higher. The level at which consolidation is expected to occur is $8000, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a note to investors, Goldman Vice President Sheba Jafari wrote:\n\n“The market has shown evidence of an impulsive rally since breaking above 6,044. Next in focus $7,941. Might consolidate there before continuing higher.”\n\nLong term trend is up\n\nWhile Goldman Sachs has cautioned against traders expecting a rapid surge past $8000, they expect it to go higher after some consolidation.\n\nReferencing Elliott Wave Theory, Jafari writes:\n\n“Given that this is just a third of five waves up, the implications are that bitcoin has potential to run further over time.”\n\nDouble the previous target\n\nThe current target price of $8000 is double the price of $4000 predicted by Sheba Jafari just four months ago. Given multiple factors including government regulation, hard forks, and new links to mainstream finance all tend to influence the price, looking at price charts in isolation is not sufficient to make a reliable forecast. Multiple analysts, including Ronnie Moas, have revised their price predictions upward for Bitcoin.', 'Crypto-currencies may be one of the most intriguing subjects in the world of finance right now but they have failed to impress India’s central bank.\n\nIn a fairly definitive expression of its stance, a director of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has signalled that virtual currencies like bitcoin won’t be allowed in the country. “Our current position on bitcoins is that we will not be using it for any payments and settlements…though the technology underlying crypto-currencies will not end,” said S Ganesh Kumar, executive director of the RBI, at a conference in Mumbai on Nov. 06.\n\nKumar’s comments are likely to end much of the speculation over the legitimacy of virtual currencies in India. However, blockchain technology, which underlies these virtual currencies, has significant potential, added Kumar. Banks in India are already relying on blockchain to enable overseas transactions, international remittances, and other processes.\n\nFor a few months now, talk about the government curbing the use of crypto-currencies has gained momentum, although an official notification to ban their use is still awaited. The RBI had earlier hinted at the possibility of India having its own crypto-currency, backed by the central bank, adding that it lacked confidence in existing virtual currencies that are privately held.\n\nIn August, a finance ministry panel also reportedly recommended that virtual currencies should be banned in the country because of their potential misuse for money laundering and fraud. Among other reasons, the soaring price of bitcoin has made the government uneasy. On Nov. 06, for instance, a single bitcoin was worth Rs4.92 lakh ($7,610.80), more than twice its value three months ago.\n\nThe crypto-currency ecosystem in India is very small: Bitcoin is accepted at only a few restaurants, and some virtual currency exchanges allow users to make payments for books or movie tickets. It is mainly being used as an investment option.\n\nUnsurprisingly, participants in India’s virtual currency trade are displeased. “We will do our best to continue with our efforts to educate the government about crypto-currencies,” said Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of Zebpay, a bitcoin exchange. “It can be useful for India by turning the country into a fintech hub, to increase financial inclusion, and there are several other benefits of it.”', 'The Chicago Mercantile Exchange will soon begin trading Bitcoin derivatives (futures contracts), signalling the cryptocurrency is now a mainstream asset class. Bitcoin has had limited use in the mainstream economy in part because the volatility of its price. The value of the currency might go up or down significantly between the time a deal is struck and delivery.\n\nThe introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts will allow investors to manage this risk, and make it safer to hold and trade in Bitcoin. This will make the cryptocurrency more accessible to individuals and businesses, and encourage developers to build more products and services on top of the technology.\n\nFutures and other derivatives are contracts between two parties to fix the price of an underlying asset (currencies, shares, commodities etc.) over a period of time or for a future transaction. The buyer of these contracts commits to purchase the underlying asset at a set price and at a certain date, and the seller commits to sell.\n\nThere are two main uses for these contracts. First, to reduce price risk by freezing future prices. The second use is speculation. For instance, a speculator would commit to buy a commodity/share/currency at a certain time, hoping that the market price at the time of delivery is higher than the price set in the contract.\n\nAirlines commonly buy long term oil future contracts to hedge against the potential increase in fuel price, or to take advantage of what they believe to be a low price.\n\nSimilarly, future contracts will enable traders to lock in the value of Bitcoin for a defined period of time. This effectively removes the risk associated with fluctuation in value. In addition, since these contracts will be traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the exchange effectively guarantees that both buyers and sellers will abide by the agreement.\n\nRead more: Price hikes in Ether and Bitcoin aren’t the signs of a bubble\n\nIn 2010, one Bitcoin was worth less than one hundredth of an Australian cent. As of Monday the 6th of November, the price is near A$10,000.\n\nThe market capitalisation of Bitcoin is now well over A$160 billion, which is larger than the GDP of most small countries. As the price of Bitcoin has grown, so too have transaction volumes, showing an increasing use of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin is starting to look like a credible investment in any respectable financial portfolio.\n\nAlthough, this is not the first futures contract for cryptocurrency. Futures contracts already exist for both Ethereum and Monero.\n\nBut the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s futures contract is significant as the CME group manages not only the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but also the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange. Combined, these exchanges represent the largest derivative market in the world.\n\nThe decision to issue futures contracts on Bitcoin rather than another derivative is also significant. So far Bitcoin derivatives have mainly been swap agreements. A swap is a commonly used financial tool where two parties agree to swap financial instruments, such as interest or currencies. The key point is that the two parties, the buyer and seller, make a deal directly with each other.\n\nAs a swap agreement is not done through an exchange, the risk of a party not delivering on the agreement can be quite high. If one party decides to opt out, the agreement has to be terminated. This leaves the other party exposed.\n\nFutures contracts eliminate this “counterparty” risk, as the exchange clears the transaction and guarantees delivery. And unlike swaps, futures contracts are standardised (in term of size, how much is going to be traded, and maturity date etc.). This means futures contracts can be traded at any time until maturity, making them very liquid and accessible.\n\nRead more: Taking Bitcoin to the stockmarket won’t do much for its risky image\n\nThe lack of a futures market in Bitcoin was a significant barrier to it becoming a mainstream asset class. You can buy and sell forward contracts on the Fijian dollar, for instance, meaning that institutional funds anywhere in the world can hold Fijian dollars in their portfolio and manage the risks of that asset.\n\nBut they cannot yet do that with Bitcoin. Until now, there has been no way to offload the risks associated with fluctuating prices. An investor could always hold the cryptocurrency, but they would do so fully exposed to price volatility.\n\nThe introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts will allow traders to hedge against this volatility and eliminate the currency risk. This will make Bitcoin more attractive for both individuals and corporations.\n\nAs crypto-assets become a mainstream investment class, other products emerge around them (such as exchange traded funds). It will also have a similar effect to that of mainstreaming share ownership - enabling a much larger fraction of the population to diversify their asset portfolios and income streams.\n\nThis will unlock some of the value currently being built on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology - new products and services - that are currently only accessible to a relatively small number of the early enthusiasts and those helping build the technology.\n\nThe increased flow of investment funds into Bitcoin will likely push prices up further, but it will also incentivise more work to build products and services on the technology.

Comments on social media indicate that, while some traders see the potential for a healthy correction to $6,500, others predict the market is likely to stay volatile ahead of the expected Segwit2x hard fork.\n\nThe odds seem high that the pullback has legs, given that the sell-off on Monday was backed by a 30 percent surge in volumes.

Thiam described the digital currency as the ""very definition of a bubble.""\n\nA fan of one, not the other Thiam\n\nMeanwhile, both institutions are busy exploring ways to use blockchain technologies in their own businesses. As are dozens of others. Cynics have been quick to infer some kind of hypocrisy here.\n\nAfter a couple of columns two months ago, one interlocutor contacted me to level that very criticism at Dimon, noting that JPMorgan is exploring blockchain technology via its Quorum platform. I told that respondent then what I\'m telling you now: There\'s no conflict between the two stances.\n\nBitcoin is based on blockchain technology. But bitcoin is not the only application of blockchain. Ethereum is another. Beyond the ether digital currency, which is now the second most valuable with $28 billion of coins in circulation, ethereum supports many other uses, such as smart contracts. Bitcoin can\'t do this, and its underlying technology limits it to just one use: transfer of value.\n\nThat\'s one of the reasons why Dimon, Thiam and UBS AG\'s Axel Weber are among the chorus of people asserting that there\'s no intrinsic value in bitcoin.\n\nSo far, markets have vehemently disagreed.\n\nBubbly Bitcoin prices have been climbing like a rocket Source: Bloomberg\n\nThose three executives also represent the established financial order, against whom pro-bitcoin anarchists rail. The idea is that if people send money to each other directly, digitally and securely, then the need for global banks starts to diminish. By criticizing bitcoin, the anti-establishment argument goes, bankers are just talking their own book. Frankly, that may be closer to the truth than claims of chicanery.\n\nYet blockchain technology could be huge for financial institutions, and they know it. Banks are not toiling away in secret while at the same time decrying it as a fraud, as many like to suggest.\n\nThe opposite is the case: Many banks\' public proclamations about working on blockchain may be more talk than action. This has earned some the nickname ""Blockchain tourist,"" as Gadfly\'s Lionel Laurent points out, but that doesn\'t make them hypocrites.\n\nThey\'re just saying that bitcoin isn\'t the future of blockchain technology, and they can do this because -- unlike many critics -- they know the difference.\n\nValue Creation Bitcoins are now worth almost $120 billion, far ahead of Ethereum\'s digital currency Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nOther fancy terms are sometimes used to describe the technology being developed.

This could potentially reduce counterparty risk, boost liquidity, speed up processing times and cut costs.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Reuters\n\nBy Nate Raymond\n\n(Reuters) - A former U.S. Secret Service agent sentenced to nearly six years in prison for stealing bitcoins during a probe into the online drug marketplace Silk Road was sentenced on Tuesday to an additional two years for another digital currency theft.\n\nShaun Bridges, 35, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco after pleading guilty in August to money laundering in the second criminal case to be brought against the former agent, prosecutors said.\n\nBridges, who served in the Secret Service\'s Baltimore field office, was sentenced in 2015 to 71 months in prison for diverting to his personal account over $800,000 worth of bitcoins during the Silk Road probe.\n\nBefore serving that sentence, though, Bridges was arrested again on new charges related to his theft of bitcoins that were at the time worth $359,005 but today are valued at $11.3 million, according to the industry publication CoinDesk.\n\nA lawyer for Bridges declined to comment.\n\nSilk Road operated for more than two years until it was shut down in October 2013, generating more than $214 million in sales of drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoins, prosecutors said.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, who authorities say ran Silk Road under the alias ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" was sentenced in 2015 to life in prison after a federal jury in New York found him guilty of charges including distributing drugs through the internet.\n\nBridges was initially arrested in March 2015 along with another member of the Baltimore-based federal task force that investigated Silk Road, former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Carl Force.\n\nForce later pleaded guilty to charges of extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice for stealing bitcoins during the probe and for secretly soliciting payment from Ulbricht. He was sentenced in 2015 to 6-1/2 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors said the bitcoins at issue in the latest case against Bridges had been seized in 2014 from a digital currency exchange.\n\nProsecutors said that after signing a plea deal in the 2015 case, Bridges used his access to a so-called digital wallet containing the bitcoins that the government controlled to transfer the bitcoins to digital wallets he controlled.\n\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; editing by Grant McCool)', 'SAN FRANCISCO — The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, has called bitcoin a fraud and made it clear that he will not allow his bank to begin trading the virtual currency any time soon.\n\nBut that has not stopped a growing wave of big Wall Street investors — many of them hedge funds — from pouring their money into bitcoin, helping extend an eight-month spike in its price.\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin climbed from below US$6,000 two weeks ago to above US$7,400 on Monday, more than it moved in the virtual currency’s first seven years in existence. Since the beginning of the year, the value of bitcoin has jumped over 600 per cent, putting the combined value of all bitcoins at about US$120 billion, or more than many of the largest banks in the world.\n\nThe rise has been fueled by several factors, including the sudden interest in virtual currencies from small investors in Japan and South Korea. Now market watchers say a significant amount of the new money is coming from large institutional investors, many of them hedge funds looking to capitalize on the skyrocketing price.\n\nMany of the hedge funds were set up over the last year to invest exclusively in virtual currencies. The research firm Autonomous Next has said the number of such hedge funds has risen from around 30 to nearly 130 this year alone. More general-purpose hedge funds have also been buying up bitcoins, like one run by Bill Miller, a well-known mutual fund manager who spent most of his career with Legg Mason.\n\nEven more big investors are looking at the space after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced last week that it would launch a bitcoin futures contract in the next few months. The contract will make it easier for financial institutions plugged into the exchange to get involved with the bitcoin market without having to worry about holding bitcoins themselves.\n\nBobby Cho, head trader at one of the largest bitcoin trading businesses, Cumberland, said that after years of hesitancy, institutional investors now accounted for most of his business.\n\n“The vast majority of the trading we do is with institutions,” Cho said. “The education and research have turned into real-life activity.”\n\nThe entrance of these big investors creates new risks for the bitcoin. Kevin Zhou, a longtime trader in the space, said that hedge funds were more likely than small investors to pull out a lot of money at once, and that the bitcoin was still small enough that a single fund’s cashing out could cause the price to drop sharply.\n\n“You could get a possible run on the bank if one large investor withdraws and that causes the price to tank,” said Zhou, a co-founder of the trading firm Galois Capital. “That could cause a cascade of withdrawals.”\n\nThe rising importance of Wall Street is an unexpected turn for a virtual currency that was invented in 2008 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto and designed to operate outside the traditional financial system.\n\nBitcoins, even those held by hedge funds, are recorded and stored on a decentralized database known as the blockchain, kept on a network of computers around the world. The whole system is governed by open source software that is maintained by a community of volunteer programmers.\n\nThe lack of backing from any government or established institution has concerned many large banks. The chief executive of Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam, said last week that he saw no inherent value in bitcoin, joining the list of bankers who have called the market a bubble.\n\nBut some financial leaders, including Goldman Sachs’ chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, and Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, have defended the idea that virtual currencies could one day play a role in the global financial system because they can be obtained by anyone with internet access.\n\nThe debate about bitcoin has been part of a broader explosion of interest this year in the various technological concepts introduced by the virtual currency. Many banks, including JPMorgan, have been trying to find ways to create their own decentralized databases, like the bitcoin blockchain, that could provide a more reliable and secure way to track information.\n\nIn the technology industry, there has been a rush this year of initial coin offerings, a way for entrepreneurs to raise money by creating and selling their own custom virtual currencies. Initial coin offerings have taken over US$3 billion from investors this year after attracting almost no interest before. These coin offerings have created their own demand for bitcoins because the new coins generally have to be bought with an existing virtual currency like bitcoin.\n\nThe interest in bitcoin could be dampened in the coming weeks, however, by a debate among bitcoin followers. Bitcoin startups and programmers have been fighting for nearly three years about the best way to update the software that governs the currency and the network on which it lives.\n\nThe battle is expected to come to a head this month when new bitcoin software, backed by many of the biggest virtual currency startups, is released. The new software aims to double the number of transactions flowing through the network. Currently, the computers processing bitcoin transactions are limited to about five transactions per second.\n\nMost of the programmers who maintain the bitcoin software have opposed the changes because they say it would make it harder for individuals to track their own bitcoins. Some of the computers on the network are likely to update to the new software while others stay with the existing rules, creating a split, or fork, in the network that would result in two separate bitcoins.\n\nA bitcoin fork could prove disruptive and drive away investors. But several signals suggest that the proposed rule changes are not likely to win enough support to survive for long, which would leave the status quo in place.\n\nBitcoin has already survived past attempts to fork the software and create imitators. In August, a group of former bitcoin supporters created Bitcoin Cash, a totally separate virtual currency that makes it easier to do small transactions, like paying for a cup of coffee.\n\nThe price of bitcoin temporarily wavered before Bitcoin Cash was introduced. All previous holders of bitcoins were automatically granted the same number of Bitcoin Cash, and the value of those has also been rising, essentially doubling in the last month.\n\nChris Burniske, a co-author of a book on virtual currency investing, “Cryptoassets,” said most of the new investors were not too concerned about the exact design of a bitcoin or the current debates.\n\n“I don’t think a lot of the new buyers are overly concerned about the long-term technical aspects of bitcoin,” he said. They are “simply approaching it as a financial instrument.”', ""In Brief Bitcoin has been increasing in value at an incredible rate over the last few months. According to a high-ranking Goldman Sachs analyst, it won't be long before the cryptocurrency breaks the $8,000 mark.\n\nGoldman Sachs Imagines New Heights for Bitcoin\n\nEarlier this month, Bitcoin continued its upward trend by reaching a new record high, breaking the $7,000 barrier. Unprecedented it may be; but now Goldman Sachs has issued a prediction that the cryptocurrency will consolidate somewhere around a value of $8,000.\n\nSheba Jafari, the vice president of the Goldman Sachs FICC market strategies team, made the forecast over the weekend. “The market has shown evidence of an impulsive rally since breaking above 6,044,” she wrote, according to a report from Coin Telegraph. “Next in focus $7,941. Might consolidate there before continuing higher.”\n\nHowever, we should note that Jafari made very different predictions for the future of Bitcoin only a few months ago. In August she suggested that the currency could hit a high of $4,800 – but that it would subsequently dip down to somewhere in the region of $2,200.\n\nJafari no longer believes that a major downturn is on the cards for Bitcoin. After a brief period consolidating around $8,000, she projects that it will increase in value even further – and given the increases we’ve seen over the course of this year, it’s perhaps unsurprising that he’s reticent to set an upper bound.\n\nMoney Talks\n\nThere are still dissenting opinions in the room regarding Bitcoin. In September, JPMorgan Chase CEO James Dimon stated his opinion that the cryptocurrency is a “fraud,” and called any trader working for his company that was trading in the coin “stupid” – even though the group is itself investigating blockchain technology.\n\nOne short month ago, as Bitcoin was enjoying a period of enormous growth, Harvard’s Kenneth Rogoff stated that its price couldn’t continue to increase indefinitely. He cited the potential for governmental restrictions impeding its utility as the biggest threat to cryptocurrencies’ continued good health.\n\nThat said, there are many holding to optimism. One respected Bitcoin trader theorized that it could hit a value of $15,000 before the end of the year, which now seems admittedly ambitious. Other experts have made more reserved predictions that it might reach $20,000 over the next three years.\n\nThere are more aspects of Bitcoin beyond investment opportunities seeing great praise. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak recently said that Bitcoin is better than gold, because its capacity to resist arbitrary supply changes translates into reliable stability.\n\nObviously, there are still numerous unanswered questions about the future of Bitcoin. However, Jafari’s comments from this weekend suggest that even those who’ve harbored doubts about the cryptocurrency’s longevity are beginning to change their tune.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets. Their personal investment perspectives have no impact on editorial content."", 'Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song has said none of the most common predictions for SegWit2x will in fact come true.\n\nIn an analysis Tuesday, Song said that the result of the upcoming Bitcoin hard fork will be more nuanced and that straight cancellation 2x or full surrender by Bitcoin Core were “highly unlikely.”\n\n“Big caveat is that I don’t expect any of these scenarios to come to pass,” he said introducing the current and future landscape.\n\nWarnings surrounding Bitcoin following Nov. 16’s hard fork have tended to center on an all-or-nothing scenario, where the industry selects either the 2x chain or shuns it within a short space of time.\n\nSong says the reality will be more complex, revolving around miner profitability over the next six months.\n\nSegWit2x futures prices, currently around $1,200, are not sufficiently reliable.\n\n“A static, first-order estimation of the current situation suggests that the current futures market price and current mining split is not stable economically,” he explains. “The people on different sides of the debate essentially stand on different sides of what will correct.”\n\nSong added he would produce technical details of the more likely situations in due course.\n\nCryptocurrency businesses have broadly divested themselves of pressure regarding the hard fork, opting for a wait-and-see attitude with more or less interaction with the new chain.\n\nBitcoin.org co-founder Cobra meanwhile has appealed to the community to forge a further hard fork which will become the new Bitcoin.', 'An official for the Reserve Bank of India, the country’s central bank, has reaffirmed the authority’s stance in avoiding cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nA director at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has drawn a line on the central bank’s current stance on bitcoin, predictably stating the authority isn’t interested in adopting the cryptocurrency.\n\nRBI director Ganesh Kumar was speaking at a banking event when he fielded a query about bitcoin from the audience. In a statement reported by Money Control, the official stated:\n\nOur current position on bitcoins is that we will not be using it for any payments and settlements…though the technology underlying cryptocurrencies [the blockchain] will not end.\n\nIndia’s central bank is also researching a “fiat cryptocurrency” that will deliver a digital rupee, a digitized alternative to India’s fiat currency. As Kumar suggests, the central bank will not be using bitcoin for the initiative, a stance that was recently revealed by RBI executive director Sudarshan Sen.\n\n“[In] regards to non-fiat cryptocurrencies…we are not comfortable,” Sen stated at a FinTech conference in September. “Bitcoins for example. That’s a private cryptocurrency.”\n\nAs bitcoin permeates into the mainstream, gaining awareness and adoption in society, central bankers are increasingly fielding questions about decentralized cryptocurrencies that are independent of state controls. Such is their aversion that central banks around the world are working toward developing their own central bank-issued digital currencies, issued under their control. Singapore, China, Canada, and Russia are among a handful of notable examples.\n\nMeanwhile, the RBI’s official stance on bitcoin remains a public notice advising retail investors and citizens to be wary of bitcoin investments or usage in the country, a rehash of a similar statement from December 2013. The recent boom in adoption – India’s finance minister Arun Jaitley underlined a ‘notable growth’ of the country’s bitcoin market this year- has since led to Indian authorities establishing a digital currency committee to develop a framework for the legal and regulatory future for cryptocurrencies in India.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'While Bitcoin peaks, gold is looking decidedly peaky as crypto Google search trends outnumber the precious metal for the first time.\n\nAs Bloomberg reports Tuesday, the search term “buy Bitcoin” is now more frequent than “buy gold,” adding insult to injury for gold after an ounce began to cost less than one BTC for the first time this year.\n\n“With the US stock market setting fresh all-time highs day after day, it’s no surprise gold prices have retreated,” the publication quotes UK-based BullionVault research director Adrian Ash as saying.\n\n“Some investors are also being distracted by the noise around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”\n\nA glance at gold profits for 2017 makes an easy case for Bitcoin being the investment short of choice for the year, a tip publicly echoed by mainstream finance commentators.\n\nAsh added BullionVault had seen 30 percent declines in monthly gold trading for October compared to the yearly average. The trend came a gold dipped six percent from one-year highs in early September.\n\nMeanwhile, the precious metals industry is getting backdoor innovation from Blockchain technology.\n\nCointelegraph reported on the weekend how the UK’s Royal Mint had successfully trialed a gold tracking system using Blockchain, with 50,000 blocks already verified before its public launch.', 'The Bitcoin bubble rolled on this week. As of Nov. 3, the leading cryptocurrency was worth $7,337, and represented 61% of total crypto investment. That’s a one-week gain of nearly 25% from the previous week’s price of $5,861. The high for the week was $7,447.\n\nThis has created a gold rush fever. Digiconomist estimates as much electricity is now going into Bitcoin mining and trading as it is consumed by the whole country of Nigeria. The increased difficulty of finding answers to Bitcoin’s crypto puzzle (“mining” them) and of exchanging cryptographic keys (“trading” them) has made Bitcoin a significant contributor to global warming.\n\nWhat’s fueling this? Scarcity. Forks meant to increase supply and reduce trading costs have fallen flat. Miners and traders keep the price rising by hoarding what they have.\n\nAnother fuel is the Initial Coin Offering, or “ICO” market.\n\nHow ICOs Fuel the Bubble\n\nIn an ICO, a business promises to automate some marketplace using the same blockchain technology that created Bitcoin, and requests investors to submit coins rather than cash.\n\nThis soaks up Bitcoin supplies, increases Bitcoin transactions, but doesn’t turn any Bitcoins into cash until after the ICO is complete and the sponsor starts trying to build what was promised. In the first six months of 2017, $1.5 billion came out of the global economy to fund ICOs.\n\nBut with Bitcoin prices continuing to rise, it’s more profitable for the ICO sponsor to simply sit on the coins, to hoard them like any other investor. Thus, cash goes into the Bitcoin market, obtaining the coins needed to buy ICOs, but cash doesn’t come out, as ICOs are profiting from just holding them.\n\nICOs create their own financial subculture. A new support structure of hedge funds, trading platforms, financial managers and even PR people has risen to support the market, all fueled by coins. This also increases demand for Bitcoins.\n\nICOs are not regulated. Most governments that acknowledge them call them securities, but there is no regulatory structure, as there is for stocks and bonds. Thus, a sub-regulatory dance has developed between lawyers and developers on the one hand, and governments on the other, with claims and threats the order of the day.\n\nSome governments, like Ukraine, make promises to encourage ICOs to move there, while others, like China, ban the trade outright. Regulation itself is a market-driven process.\n\nHow the Bubble Bursts\n\nMoney goes into the ICO craze as new companies are funded. In exchange for Bitcoins or other tokens, each market supplies its own tokens to investors.\n\nIt’s here that the bubble can burst. Bancor, an Israeli start-up backed by venture capitalist Tim Draper, whose software is supposed to ease trading in digital coins, raised $153 million in tokens in June, but is now worth less than half that. Regulators keep warning investors they could lose all their investment in an ICO, but few are listening.\n\nMost traders feel Bitcoin is secure because it recovered from China’s ICO ban in September. But it’s not governments that will crash the Bitcoin market. It’s ICOs themselves.\n\nTake Tezos as an example. They raised $232 million in July, and the coins gathered had a value of $400 million a few months later. But disputes among the principals have since sent the value of Tezos crashing.\n\nAs stories like this proliferate and the value of what ICOs build is shown to be less than the value of what they are collecting in coins, that’s when I expect the Bitcoin crash to happen.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

The SegWit2x fork, which you can find out more about here, could split the currency in two.\n\nThe recent run has also been helped by news that CME Group, the world\'s largest exchange operator, plans to introduce bitcoin future contracts in response to client demand. This is seen as a stamp of legitimacy from the world of traditional finance for bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has had a great 2017, rising by over 600% against the dollar this year. The price rise has been driven by increasing mainstream adoption and awareness of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. At least 55 cryptocurrency hedge funds have sprung up this year, most focusing on bitcoin.', 'NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin hit a record high just shy of $8,000 on Wednesday after a coalition of developers and investors suspended a software upgrade planned for next Thursday that could have split the digital currency in two.\n\nIn an email on Wednesday, the lead developer of the team planning to carry out the upgrade said “Segwit2x” would be scrapped for now as it could “divide the community.” The email by Mike Belshe, chief executive of blockchain security firm BitGo, was also signed by some of the biggest names in the bitcoin world.\n\nSegWit2x is an agreement among high-profile figures in the bitcoin world aimed at upgrading the bitcoin network’s capacity. It received significant support when it was announced in May but many bitcoin developers had withdrawn support for the upgrade over the last few months, analysts said.\n\nThe software upgrade would have attempted to address the bitcoin network’s limitations in processing millions of daily transactions. The network has not kept pace with growth and is unable to process transactions fast enough.\n\nThe upgrade would have changed bitcoin’s rules leading to a so-called fork, effectively cloning the existing bitcoin to create another crypto-currency.\n\nSegwit2x was supposed to be the second step in a broad two-step process to enhance transaction capacity. The first step occurred over the summer.\n\n“Indefinitely postponing the fork is a healthy move for crypto assets,” said Guy Zyskind, CEO and co-founder of Enigma, a data-driven, crypto-investment platform.\n\n“The ability of the bitcoin community to self-correct and avoid a contentious fork inspires confidence and shows how the ecosystem is entering a more mature phase,” he added.\n\nBitcoin surged to a record high of $7,888 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange in the 20 minutes that followed the statement. It was last traded up 3 percent on the day at $7,354.10 BTC=BTSP.\n\n“Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for bitcoin,” BitGo’s Belshe said in his email. “Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together.”\n\nCharlie Lee, creator of the Litecoin crypto-currency and a leading industry expert, said in a post on Twitter the bitcoin community may need to implement Segwit2x in the future anyway, but it should be done when there is consensus.', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

In light of this increased exposure, we decided to take the pulse of the country to gauge awareness and sentiment toward Bitcoin and get a better sense of where Bitcoin is in the adoption curve.\n\nThe results are based on responses from a recent survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults ages 18+ conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Blockchain Capital—many of the results are quite remarkable.\n\nIn particular, the results highlight a millennial (we define as 18-34 years old) proclivity for Bitcoin that may be indicative of a bright future for the digital asset. [Disclosure: Investing in Bitcoin is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin.]\n\nFor example, more than 1 in 4 millennials prefer Bitcoin to stocks: 27% of whom said they would prefer to own $1,000 of Bitcoin over $1,000 in stocks. The number was even higher for male millennials—38% of whom said they prefer Bitcoin.\n\nNot just stocks, many millennials prefer Bitcoin to other traditional financial assets as well. Given the choice of either $1,000 of Bitcoin or $1,000 of a traditional financial asset, 30% of millennials said they would choose Bitcoin over government bonds, 22% would choose Bitcoin over real estate, and 19% would choose Bitcoin over gold.\n\nBlockchain Capital\n\nThe preference for Bitcoin is especially true for millennial men – at least one quarter would prefer $1,000 of Bitcoin over $1,000 worth of: government bonds (43%), stocks (38%), real estate (26%), and gold (31%).\n\nHowever, the results also show that only 4% of millennials have owned or currently own Bitcoin—indicating there’s a significant gap between preferred and actual ownership rates. If millennials close that gap as their purchasing power increases, it would be a significant and meaningful tailwind for Bitcoin adoption.\n\nBlockchain Capital\n\nYounger demographics are often a leading indicator of the future—especially as it relates to technology. So, what’s going on here? Why is Bitcoin more appealing to younger demographics?\n\nBitcoin awareness and ownership is much higher among Millennials\n\nFirst, and perhaps most importantly, more millennials are relatively knowledgeable and aware of Bitcoin than older demographics.\n\nBlockchain Capital\n\nOverall, Bitcoin awareness is more than two times higher among millennials than older demographics: 42% of millennials say they are familiar with Bitcoin, compared to 15% among those ages 65+.\n\nMillennials are more likely to view Bitcoin positively\n\nPerhaps as a result of their greater awareness, millennials are significantly more likely to view Bitcoin favorably compared to older demographics.\n\nBlockchain Capital\n\nMillennials are 10 times as likely as those ages 65+ to “strongly agree” that Bitcoin is a positive innovation in financial technology (20% vs. 2%). Roughly half of millennials (48%)—including 63% of male millennials—agree that Bitcoin is a positive innovation versus 19% of those ages 65+.\n\nOverall, 20% of millennials “strongly agree” that Bitcoin is a positive innovation in financial technology. This is particularly high if we consider that only 42% of millennials described themselves as at least “somewhat familiar” with Bitcoin—so, presumably, the conversion rate from those that are informed to those that are strong believers is quite high.\n\nBlockchain Capital\n\nMillennials don’t seem to view big banks as particularly trustworthy\n\nWhen given the choice of whether Bitcoin or big banks are more trustworthy, millennials choose Bitcoin (8+ year history) over big banks (400+ year history) at a surprising rate.\n\nBlockchain Capital\n\nOverall, more than 1 in 4 millennials (27%) think that Bitcoin is more trustworthy than big banks. Talk about software eating the world!\n\nThe figure is particularly impressive if we again consider that only 42% of millennials described themselves as at least “somewhat familiar” with Bitcoin. We can reasonably assume that those who identify as less than “somewhat familiar” with Bitcoin (58% of millennials) would not choose Bitcoin as more trustworthy than big banks—or least not at a meaningfully high rate.\n\nIn this light, the fact that 27% of millennials see Bitcoin as more trustworthy than big banks despite only 42% self-identifying as at least somewhat familiar with Bitcoin is astonishingly high.\n\nMillennials have more conviction regarding Bitcoin’s future\n\nBlockchain Capital\n\nOne in five millennials “strongly agree” it’s likely that most people will be using Bitcoin in the next 10 years—including 29% of male millennials.', 'Shaun Bridges, the secret service agent twice arrested for theft of Silk Road Bitcoins, has received a further two-year jail sentence for his second offense.\n\nAs Reuters, Ars Technica and others report Wednesday, Bridges who is already serving six-and-a-half years for theft, plead guilty to extended charges in August and received the verdict this week.\n\nCalifornia judge Richard Seeborg commented on the events transpiring after Bridges’ first indictment:\n\n“Particularly troubling is the fact that Mr. Bridges did engage in further efforts to conceal and need to steal after he had entered the plea agreement.”\n\nRevelations about corruption within the Silk Road case first surfaced in 2015 after alleged leader Ross Ulbricht received life imprisonment for online drugs distribution.\n\n“On or about July 28, 2015, while on release from the pending case… Bridges caused transfer of the approximately 1606.6488 seized Bitstamp funds in the online wallet that belonged to the US government into a separate online wallet at BTC-e controlled by Bridges,” the charges from August read.\n\nBTC-e, now trading as WEX, had also seen its assets part frozen by the FBI as in ongoing investigations over money laundering.\n\nIn October meanwhile, US federal authorities finally gained access to the proceeds of the huge Silk Road sell-off, which now infamously came at the rock-bottom price of just $334 per Bitcoin.', 'Is Bitcoin Good for Diamonds? While Some See Opportunity, Others Question Its Stability Email Print Share Reddit Stumbleupon Delicious Digg\n\n\n\nPicture this: You’re helping a customer who is very close to making a purchase on a good-quality, high-value diamond. The topic of payment comes up, and instead of using Apple Pay or pulling out a recognizable credit card, this client asks if you’re willing to accept Bitcoin. You pause — you’re not sure how to answer. Nearly a decade after the cryptocurrency first appeared from the depths of the internet, the very idea of it still feels risky and abstract, like an underground point system used only by criminals and hackers.\n\n\n\nBut while Bitcoin has certainly earned its dubious reputation — a Russian crime boss was recently discovered to have laundered over $4 billion using Bitcoin accounts — it’s also becoming increasingly mainstream. Major companies like PayPal, Microsoft and Overstock now accept it. IBM has wholeheartedly embraced blockchain, the sophisticated ledger technology that tracks each bitcoin’s movements. And slowly but surely, retailers are coming to regard Bitcoin as a legitimate form of payment. This leaves jewelers and other diamond sellers in a position to answer an almost unprecedented question: Is it time to embrace a new form of money?\n\n\n\nBoom or bubble?\n\n\n\nBitcoin was conceived as an alternative digital currency, insulated from the tides of global instability and government control. There is no such thing as a physical bitcoin; it’s simply a unit of measure that represents a given sum. When the system went live in January 2009, an individual bitcoin, or BTC, wasn’t worth much. Today, things have changed. On October 12, 2017, the price of one bitcoin surged past $5,000, an all-time high. This means that what started out as an offbeat cyber experiment has become a real financial system; there have even been rumors that old-school power player Goldman Sachs is planning to open a Bitcoin trading desk soon, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, skeptics argue that we’re in the throes of a Bitcoin bubble. What makes the currency so appealing to some is precisely what makes it seem dangerous to others. Proponents of Bitcoin love that the system is decentralized and therefore protected against the kinds of global events that caused the 2008 financial crisis. In that way, bitcoins are not altogether different from diamonds or other precious gemstones — they’re all alternative, portable means of wealth for investors who are skeptical of the long-term value of traditional purchases, like real estate and stocks. However, critics of Bitcoin argue that government regulation, at least in the US, is inevitable, and once that happens, the cryptocurrency’s value will plummet.\n\n\n\nStill, that hasn’t stopped international celebrity jeweler Samer Halimeh from making the decision to honor Bitcoin as of this past September after noticing a rapid increase in requests from his clients to do so. In his view, the marriage of Bitcoin and luxury retail is an obvious one.\n\n\n\n“Over the last couple of years, [Bitcoin] has gradually gone upmarket with portals buying and selling previously owned but high-quality goods [like] Ferrari cars, Mercedes-Benz sports cars, Rolex watches and jewelry,” he says. “What is now happening is, retailers like ourselves are directly accepting bitcoins for brand new luxury goods.”\n\n\n\nCommodity exchange\n\n\n\nSo what does it mean to trade bitcoins for diamonds? (“Trade” is probably the most appropriate word, considering that for tax purposes, the IRS currently regards virtual currency as property, not money.) At best, it’s a quick, anonymous way to pay, with fewer potential glitches than credit cards and very low fees. In theory, it’s safer to accept Bitcoin than cash, as the blockchain protects against issues like counterfeiting. But at worst, the diamond seller who trades jewels for bitcoins is putting undue faith in a volatile, unregulated currency with no proven track record. It’s exchanging one unpegged commodity — a diamond — for another one, but in the case of a bitcoin, it’s neither a time-tested system nor a shiny physical product.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, Bitcoin’s success shows there’s a worldwide appetite for alternative capital, especially among people who don’t trust traditional financial institutions anymore. Perhaps that’s why the Israel Diamond Exchange (IDE) has partnered with the startup CARATS.IO to create an official diamond-backed digital currency called CDC. While there’s a long history of the stones being used in lieu of cash, this experiment will formalize the notion of diamonds-as-money. As CARATS.IO has revealed, it wants to create a digital currency that’s potentially less volatile than Bitcoin, because it will be linked to an existing commodity.\n\n\n\nA risky business\n\n\n\nIs this good news for the diamond world? The Israeli bourse thinks so, hoping the collaboration will increase trades. That said, it’s another step toward standardizing the price of diamonds, which — at least in the past — the industry has resisted. Overall, while it’s risky for a luxury retailer or diamond trader to take a few rare payments in Bitcoin, it’s unlikely to be disastrous.

To educate himself, he spent half a day in “a den of bitcoin enthusiasts in Silicon Valley.”\n\nLewis wanted to know, “Am I going to be able to spend this stuff?” The experts told him yes, and got Lewis set up with a digital wallet and $5 in bitcoin. The group then took him to buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin in Palo Alto.\n\n“It was a disaster,” Lewis shares. “Of course it didn’t work. I said, ‘Why don’t you call me when I can buy something with bitcoin,’ and I kept the $5 on my phone.”\n\nWith bitcoin now trading above $7,000, Lewis’ balance is still sitting in the same digital wallet, and has swollen to $378.\n\nNo story, no book, no cup of coffee, but as Lewis notes: “The bitcoin is now more valuable than my phone.”\n\n—\n\nRead more about bitcoin from Yahoo Finance:\n\nWhy bitcoin matters\n\nJapan is poised to become the leading bitcoin market\n\nWhy China’s central bank fears bitcoin\n\nWhy Ethereum is the hottest new thing in digital currency\n\nMore than 75 banks are now on Ripple’s blockchain network\n\nExpect more blockchain hype in 2017', 'What if the feds got in on the cryptocurrency craze?\n\nThere’s now one Wall Street chief executive officer who says bitcoin presents a real enough threat to the financial system that governments will have no choice but to issue versions of their own.\n\n“I don’t think governments are going to take lightly other people coming in and potentially disrupting their abilities around data, around tax collection, around money laundering, around know-your-customer,” Citigroup Inc. CEO Michael Corbat said Wednesday in an interview at the Bloomberg Year Ahead summit in New York. “It’s likely that we’re going to see governments introduce, not cryptocurrencies -- I think cryptocurrency is a bad moniker for that -- but a digital currency.”\n\nThat’s a fresh perspective from an industry in which some leaders have dismissed bitcoin’s viability as a currency and its run past $7,000. Instead of focusing on what bitcoin can’t do, such as replace money or function as a store of value like gold, Corbat is more concerned by its ability to bypass many of the protections built into regulated banking.\n\nFor example, U.S. law requires banks to ensure that transactions aren’t used for money laundering, bribery, corruption and terrorism financing. Meanwhile, trading in bitcoin, thanks to the nature of its programming, is anonymous and almost impossible to trace.\n\nOther CEOs have weighed in, with JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon saying he’s skeptical authorities will allow a currency to exist without state oversight, especially if something goes wrong. “Someone’s going to get killed and then the government’s going to come down,” he said in September. “Governments like to control their money supply.”\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein isn’t sure what to make of bitcoin, but he said he’s unwilling to reject the digital currency just yet.\n\nCorbat made clear that he’s still very positive on the underlying technology. His bank is experimenting internally with its own currency, dubbed Citicoin, which can reduce friction in international foreign-exchange transactions. It’s also partnered with Nasdaq Inc. to use blockchain to help trade private shares.\n\n“You won’t hear us be dismissive in terms of the nascent technology because it’s real and there is something there,” he said.', 'The man who predicted the 2008 financial crisis is skeptical about bitcoin. Nouriel Roubini warns the cryptocurrency will become so regulated it will “find its end.”\n\nRead more\n\n“In my opinion, there is a gigantic speculative bubble related to the bitcoin because this is neither a serious method of payment nor a good way to store capital,” the economist told Business Insider. He explained that “bitcoin feeds on itself” and there are no fundamental reasons for its price to reach such levels.\n\nThe price of the virtual currency skyrocketed to $7,600 over the weekend, up over 750 percent in 10 months. Bitcoin was trading at $7,380 on Wednesday.\n\n“What’s more – it is also used by criminals, for their shady business. I think that more and more countries will start to make cryptocurrency exchanges illegal like China did,” Roubini said, adding new regulations will be adopted. “So, this will find its end.”\n\nHe also said the blockchain technology should be separated from bitcoin. “Blockchain creates an enormous chance to increase productivity in many companies, and I think the technology to be something very good.” There’s something entirely different with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, according to Roubini.\n\nLooking back at the global recession of 2008, he noticed a distinctive change in the banking sector, both in the US and Europe. “Earlier, we had to face high leverage, elevated risk or lack of liquidity. Since then, a lot of solutions have been launched to make the banking sector more stable.”\n\nThe improvement is obvious but there are “still some banks, especially on the fringes of the eurozone, that need their balance sheets being put into order, especially due to bad loans,” said the economist.']"
11/09/2017,"[""In Brief Bitcoin's controversial upcoming hard fork has been averted for the time being. Uncertainty and a lack of consensus caused organizers to pull the plug on the split.\n\nIn a surprising, yet seemingly welcome move, the organizers of the next hard fork in Bitcoin’s lifespan have suddenly decided to suspend their plans to start increasing the block size of the cryptocurrency. The plan was originally scheduled to commence around November 16th.\n\nIn an email, Mike Belshe, the CEO and co-founder of bitcoin wallet software provider BitGo, explained the decision to not move forward. “Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x.”\n\nSegwit2x hardfork has been called off! Common sense prevails. Let’s now work together towards scaling safely. We may need something like a 2x hardfork in the future, but let’s do it when there’s consensus and not rushed. ? (Removing my NO2X tag now.) ? https://t.co/FuaUy2Kzex — Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) November 8, 2017\n\nCoinDesk is reporting that the general consensus is an echoing sigh of relief throughout the Twittersphere. There have been exclamations of “Common sense prevails,” “Bitcoin wins,” and “I am glad it is over.” Segwit2x developer Jean-Pierre Rupp stated, “I guess I can now pay more attention to more fruitful technical pursuits than following the news and fighting trolls online.”\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been volatile this week, with more new records followed by significant dips and renewed rallying. At the time of writing, prices are showing a slight dip, sitting at $7,421."", 'After CME announced that they would soon be offering Bitcoin futures, the price of the digital currency took a big upward swing. However, CME is of the opinion that futures could actually put a stop to Bitcoin’s synonymous volatility.\n\nCME will be putting in place special price fluctuation limits that will help protect investors from the notorious price swings, but these same protections could also help ease the price swings and make the digital currency settle down somewhat.\n\nBitcoin price protection\n\nCME will implement special price fluctuation limits at seven percent and 13 percent above or below the prior settlement price, and prevent trading outside the 20 percent range, according to details the exchange released.\n\nThese protections sound familiar to some as they are based on what is allowed on US stock index futures. The thoughts are that these same protections have helped the stock exchange, but it is more important for the violently volatile Bitcoin.\n\nFor new investors, Bitcoin is a terrifying yet exhilarating ride. It can fluctuate hundreds of dollars a day and is even prone to drops of as big as 40 percent. The last big drop happened as early back as September.\n\nVolatility already easing\n\nBecause Bitcoin is such a new concept, and even a new asset class, it has seen its introduction into the market as violent. Volatility in the early days was incredibly high and quite erratic. However, it is starting to settle somewhat and is also less affected by changes.\n\nMany believe that it is these violent swings that are stopping mass adoption of the digital currency, especially as a currency. If there was a more steady rate, then Bitcoin would be able to stretch more towards being a currency while still holding onto its power as a store of value.\n\nFutures on the menu\n\nAs is often the case in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it often just needs one to take the first plunge. CME opened the door for futures and that could well be opening the doors for ETFs.\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest US options exchange now known as Cboe Options is also planning to offer Bitcoin futures by early next year.\n\nChris Concannon, president and chief operating officer at Cboe Global Markets, said Tuesday that having regulated futures for Bitcoin helps the case for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n""And over time, we do envision ETFs coming to market once the regulated futures market is built and liquid,"" Concannon said.', 'Millennials, who came of age during the Great Recession, have an uneasy relationship with stocks . They’re more likely than other generations to view stocks as risky investments. But when it comes to Bitcoin, the highly volatile digital asset that sometimes rises or drops 10% in just one day, they’re much more optimistic than their grandparents. It doesn’t hurt that Bitcoin has jumped more than 600% this year.

Bitcoin is built on a technology called blockchain that records transactions in a series of digital blocks.\n\nMillennials are much more knowledgeable about Bitcoin than people who are 65 and older, according to the survey. While 15% of the older generation is at least somewhat familiar with Bitcoin, 42% of Millennials are somewhat familiar.

That upgrade was originally scheduled to go into effect November 16, but saw support for the plan diminish in recent months.\n\nAfter the announcement, Bitcoin’s price jumped to a new high of $7,879.06, but then settled back to around $7,200 later in the day.\n\nThe developers acknowledged that SegWit2x lacks the consensus needed to move forward at this time:\n\n“Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x.“\n\nThe announcement was signed by six leading members of the Bitcoin community: Mike Belshe, Wences Casares, Jihan Wu, Jeff Garzik, Peter Smith and Erik Voorhees.

These find “the best proof of space they have,” after which proof-of-time servers begin validation and publish a verified block to the network.\n\nThis procedure should take away mining power from a select few miners, as occurs with Bitcoin, Cohen says.\n\n“It’s technically ambitious and there’s a big meaty chunk of work to do. I’ve done enough raising money and recruiting. Now for the real work,” he added.\n\nWhile Bitcoin continues to find stability after its latest hard fork was canceled by developers this week, Cohen maintains a late-2018 or later release for his altcoin will still be timely.\n\nHe is not alone in his plans, with MegaUpload creator Kim Dotcom likely to beat him to issuing a cryptocurrency, this time for his own decentralized file sharing network.

As per data from CoinMarketCap, bitcoin has dropped 4.76 percent in the last 24 hours.\n\nFollowing the setting of a new record high of $7,879 Wednesday, the bull grip now looks to be weakening – likely due to the rotation of money out of bitcoin and into alternative currencies following the suspension of the Segwit2x hard fork on Wednesday.\n\nThe odds look high that the sell-off will continue too, given the month's rally from $5,000 was in part a product of the perception that holders of bitcoin might receive free money should the hard fork result in a split of the bitcoin blockchain.

And why is cryptocurrency suddenly so hot?\n\nJust last week, bitcoin soared past the $7,000 mark, which means the cryptocurrency has now climbed more than 600% since the beginning of the year. At the same time, the price of the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has increased by over 2,080%. The technology underpinning these digital currencies is known as blockchain.\n\nWhat is blockchain and how does it work?\n\nAt its core, blockchain is an accounting system, allowing a decentralised record of all transactions that have been made, updated and held by all users of the network – essentially a shared database or public ledger. Its distributed nature means making retroactive amendments to the ledger (i.e. to fraudulently amend transactions) is next to impossible. This networked approach removes the need for a central counterparty – like your bank – keeping score, in turn offering a secure alternative to a variety of financial processes.\n\nMining cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies don’t just appear in your (virtual) wallet. Like any other form of currency, it takes work to earn them. Unlike traditional currencies, where a central bank decides how much currency is in circulation, cryptocurrencies are governed by pre-defined rules.\n\nWith cryptocurrency, ‘miners’ use special software to authenticate entries on the public ledger, earning bitcoin in exchange. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine. Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in creating new coins.\n\nWhy are they growing so fast?\n\nWhen it comes to the future of money, there is a growing interest in cryptocurrencies and the potential role they could play. Indeed, traditional central banks, governments and financial markets regulators alike are all investigating digital currencies to the point where the Swedish central bank (the Riksbank) is reported to be debating whether to become the first significant central bank to issue a digital currency as it responds to an increasing move away from cash in the Scandinavian economy.\n\nBitcoin surge\n\nThe soaring valuations of cryptocurrencies have been driven by speculation and a massive influx of capital from countries such as China and Russia, whose citizens had used cryptocurrencies as an avenue for capital to escape those countries’ capital controls. Although China banned the trading of virtual currencies on domestic exchanges in September, over the counter transactions are still permitted.\n\nAre these currencies actually worth anything?\n\nThey don’t have intrinsic value in the same way as, say, raw commodities and they don’t offer ownership or income like equities and bonds. It is difficult to consider them as long-term investments or a store of ‘value’. Rather, we consider them more as speculative assets, and this is seen in the exceptionally high volatility of their prices.\n\nRealistically, it seems too early to determine what value they hold. For example, the supply of Bitcoin is finite, capped at 21 million coins. This cap is due to be reached in 2040 at current mining rates. Ethereum is the leading alternative to Bitcoin and it is built to overcome many of its limitations, such as transaction speed (Bitcoin’s 10 minutes versus Ethereum’s 12 seconds) and the ability to handle smart contracts (helping exchange anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way). There is much to overcome both in tackling development of the network as it grows and the pending regulatory reactions from countries around the world.\n\nWider adoption\n\nMuch like the initial stages of the internet in the 1990s, the technology is out there and it can’t be put back in the box. However it does face several barriers to mainstream adoption in its current form. Bitcoin, Ethereum and the many other cryptocurrencies are too volatile to be widely used as traditional currencies – if you pop into an Apple store to buy the new iPhone X, it’s pretty certain you will be paying £999 for at least the next year or so. Try to pay with Bitcoin and it could cost anywhere from 0.18 coins today versus 0.29 coins a month ago (that’s a 48% difference, in a month).\n\nThe encryption that makes these technologies so secure also provides anonymity to users and allows more nefarious users to hide and move funds unchallenged. Regulation is in its infancy, it is unlikely governments and regulators will tolerate it in its current form where identity of ownership is easy to hide. Corporates have long been looking at uses and many large companies (UBS, Fidelity, PwC to name a few) have dedicated whole new departments to the exploration of its application.\n\nFreddie Cleworth is client director at EQ Investors', 'EUGENE, Ore.

And if not, why?\n\n[ibd-display-video id=2633855 width=50 float=left autostart=true]Bitcoin, the leading digital money, hit a new record high of $8,224 early Monday. It\'s now risen nearly 750% this year and is up 3,700% since a low in January 2015. Nearly every day Bitcoin and other cryptos are making headlines. Some experts call them the new gold.\n\nBut are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator\'s game? And what about initial coin offerings, a hybrid of initial public offering and crowdfunding that has spawned Etherum and other projects? Even Wall Street is divided, so many experts warn Main Street investors to stay away or proceed with great caution.\n\nNo less than Goldman Sachs ( GS ) is said to be considering a cryptocurrency trading operation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Yet JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon recently called Bitcoin ""a fraud"" and said it would likely stay on the black market.\n\nFar from being safe for widows and orphans, like utilities, the Bitcoin market - which hit $150 billion in August - looks more like the 1840s gold rush. Many rushed in, but few got rich.\n\nOn Nov. 12, Bitcoin fell to around $5,500, wiping out a rally on news that a plan to split the crypto currency was called off. It\'s bounced back since and was trading around $7,192 Wednesday.\n\nOne risk is that governments likely will limit the currencies\' use, such as barring them for tax payments, which would keep them out of the mainstream, according to UBS . China recently banned initial coin offerings and trading in cryptocurrencies, and it may not be the last government to act on concerns about giving up control over the flow of funds, the ability to monitor taxable gains or appearing vigilant in protecting investors.\n\nBut many retailers are accepting Bitcoins as payment, including Microsoft, Target, Home Depot and Subway. And more uses are in the works.\n\nCryptocurrency Investment Vehicles\n\nOnly a handful of ETFs and other exchange traded products have significant exposure to Bitcoin or other cryptos. One is Grayscale\'s Bitcoin Investment Trust ( GBTC ). It\'s attracted $1.4 billion in assets and is up more than 680% this year.\n\nMore vehicles could emerge soon if plans to offer futures contracts proceed at CME and CBOE. ETF provider VanEck\'s recent SEC filing to create a Bitcoin ETF was withdrawn because of a lack of futures.\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin\'s value is a boon for Coinbase, an exchange where crytpocoins can be bought, sold and stored in wallets. Coinbase added more than 100,000 users Nov. 2 in a 24-hour period after CME Group announced its plans to introduce Bitcoin futures by the year\'s end, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn a picks-and-shovels move vs. actually holding Bitcoins, ETF provider Reality Shares has filed to offer Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy ETF, which would invest in companies that commit significant resources to blockchain technology, the Street.com reported. Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptos.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin arrived on the scene in 2009. The digital currency is created and held electronically. Its value stems partly from the fact that it\'s decentralized; no single institution or government controls the network. It was developed based on a proposal from a software developer called Satoshi Nakamoto, according to CoinDesk, which tracks cryptocurrency prices and reports on events in the crypto space. Low transaction costs are another feature along with instantaneous transfers.\n\nPerhaps its biggest attraction is that its supply can\'t be increased or decreased at the whim of a controlling entity. Similar to gold and other precious metals, Bitcoins can be ""mined,"" but it\'s done by using computing power in a distributed network. And like gold, Bitcoin supply is limited. And it\'s headed toward terminal creation.\n\nBitcoin rules state that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created, though the coins can be split into smaller parts. That could make Bitcoin, like gold, an attractive inflation hedge, backers say. There are 16.67 million Bitcoin in circulation now.\n\nOn the other hand, the potential creation of new digital currencies creates ""the possibility of limitless supply of different cryptocurrencies,"" undermining the value of existing ones, UBS warned recently.\n\nBitcoin Vs. Gold\n\nSPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ), an ETF that tracks the price of gold bullion, is up about 11% this year. That might look meager next to Bitcoin\'s surge. Hence, internet news searches for Bitcoin now outnumber those for gold.\n\nBut cryptocurrencies have been volatile. On the way to its all-time high this year, Bitcoin plunged 28% from $2,682.59 on June 12 to $1,938.94. And it plummeted 35% from $4,950.72 on Sept. 1 to $3,336.41 on Sept. 14.\n\nCritics warn of a bubble. ""The relatively high volume of cryptocurrency turnover, against limited real-world use, suggests that many buyers are seeking speculative gain, never intending to use cryptocurrencies to make a real-world transaction,"" UBS analysts said in report quoted by CNBC.\n\nThe blockchain software behind Bitcoin makes the digital currency a method of transferring value, but unlike at, say, a bank or real estate company. With blockchain, those expensive middlemen are no longer needed to ensure a transaction takes place as intended, a protection supplied by the blockchain software itself. The result: faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nAnd since blockchain and cryptocurrencies offer various layers of anonymity, they are seen as attractive to those living in countries where transfer of wealth is restricted. Detractors say cryptos also draw drug dealers, money launderers and tax dodgers along with legitimate investors.\n\nCoinbase is involved in a lawsuit in which it\'s trying to fend off IRS attempts to scan customer accounts for unreported taxable gains, Bloomberg reported.\n\nHow People Invest In Digital Currencies\n\nThose who want to own cryptocurrencies directly can go to exchanges to buy and trade them. Some of the largest are U.S.-based Coinsetter, Coinbase, Cryptsy, London-based Bitsamp and Bulgaria-based BTC-e.\n\nThey\'ll need what the industry calls a wallet to store the private keys that give access to cryptos. Major exchanges offer soft, or hot, wallets for customers. Such wallets are available for desktop computers and mobile devices and include Bitcoin wallet, Mycelium, Xapo and Blockchain, according to Coindesk.\n\nHard wallets in the form of flash-drive like devices bring an extra layer of security, by limiting exposure to the internet. They have to be plugged into a computer or phone before they can be spent. Three popular ones, according to Buybitcoinworldwide.com, are Ledger Nano S, KeepKey and Trezor. Just remember, don\'t lose it, forget your password or fail to back it up, or you might lose your cryptocurrency forever.\n\nWhile proponents extol the fraud-proof safety of blockchain technology, wallets have proved vulnerable. In the latest mishap, an estimated $280 million of Ethereum ether coins were locked up after a user accidentally deleted the code needed to access digital wallets hosted by Parity Technologies. The freeze affects all multisignature wallets created on Parity after July 20.\n\nEthereum has jumped 4,356% this year from $8.03 on Dec. 31 to $357.82 on Nov. 19. It\'s 8% off its Sept. 1 high of $390.34.\n\nMeanwhile, the financial industry is moving ahead .\n\nIn other moves by financial companies to bring Bitcoin to investors, on Sept. 6, CoinIRA , Goldco \'s digital currency unit, launched its new Digital IRA Bundles. The bundles, available in amounts of $25,000, $50,000 and $100,000, come prepackaged with digital currencies. Investors can choose from three portfolios based on their risk appetite: conservative, moderate or aggressive. The conservative bundle is made up of 50% Bitcoin, 41% Ethereum and 3% each in Ether classic, Litecoin and Ripple.\n\nCould exchange traded funds make digital cash more widely accessible?\n\nCryptocurrency Investing Like Juggling Chain Saws?\n\n""A diversified ETF that has some exposure to cryptocurrencies will likely be somewhat less risky than direct investment,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, told IBD. ""But that\'s a bit like comparing the risks associated with juggling knives to those you\'d face juggling chain saws.""\n\nThus far no exchange traded funds trade on a major exchange like SPDR Gold Shares or iShares Gold Trust ( IAU ). Grayscale Investments\' Bitcoin Investment Trust, which launched May 4, 2015, trades over the counter. Grayscale had filed for SEC approval to trade GBTC on NYSE Arca, but on Sept. 27 withdrew the application, remaining as a less-regulated investment trust.\n\nMorningstar Direct lists GBTC with its ETFs, but there doesn\'t appear to be an efficient arbitrage mechanism that keeps the price and NAV in balance. GBTC recently traded at a 44% premium to its holdings.\n\nGBTC shares fell as much as 54% from an Aug. 31 high but are still up nearly 700% this year. They started tumbling 20% Sept. 1 after short-seller Citron Research called GBTC the ""most dangerous way to own Bitcoin"" and said it should trade no higher than $550 a share.\n\n""Right now, many investors are using the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is arguably even riskier than Bitcoin because it trades at high premiums, which means you could lose money even if Bitcoin doesn\'t go down,"" Eric Balchunas, ETF Analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, told IBD. ""In contrast, the ETF structure and its creation/redemption process would give investors the best possible chance to get A fair deal on investing in Bitcoin. ETFs have proved themselves in terms of being able to handle all kinds of non-equity holdings, such as bonds, physical gold and derivatives.""\n\nProposed ETFs In The SEC Review Process\n\nPotential ETFs under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission include Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, which the SEC rejected in March amid concerns including lack of liquidity and regulation. Officials are again reviewing the ETF candidate, a seemingly recurring process over the past three years.\n\nETF provider ProShares on Sept. 27 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. Instead of owning the currency, both ETFs plan to track Bitcoin futures contracts, which are not yet available.\n\nCME Group and Cboe Global Markets have said they plan to offer Bitcoin futures as early as this year, pending regulatory review.\n\nBut the same day, VanEck withdrew its Aug. 11 application for VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which would have also invested in Bitcoin futures. According to VanEck\'s application withdrawal letter, the SEC\'s policy is to not review a registration statement until the underlying instruments (Bitcoin futures contracts) become available.\n\nEven Fidelity Investments is dipping its toes in the cryptocurrency field by teaming up with Coinbase. Fidelity\'s innovation unit on Aug. 9 said it will allow Fidelity customers to view their Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin balances in their Coinbase wallet accounts.\n\nBalchunas puts the odds at about 50/50 of a new ETF option in the next two years.\n\n""There have been two key developments since the SEC rejected it in March,"" he told IBD. ""One is the likelihood of a regulated Bitcoin futures and options markets, and the second is that the SEC\'s changing with the new administration, and its brand-new head of the division of investment management was a lawyer at the same firm that represented the Winklevoss twins\' Bitcoin filing.""\n\nStill, caution is warranted.\n\nOther ETF Choices\n\n""In an ETF wrapper, volatility of Bitcoin could prove higher than alternative currency-based products and investors will need to be prepared,"" Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA\'s Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research, told IBD. ""Interestingly, ARK Innovation (ARKK) and ARK Web X.0 (ARKW) provide exposure to Bitcoin, but have diversification to more traditional equity investments such as Amazon.com, Tesla and Twitter, dampening the risk.""\n\nARK Investment Management, which runs six ETFs, offers exposure to Bitcoin and was the first ETF to own GTBC shares, which has helped boost the funds\' performance.\n\nARKK and ARKW were the top two sector ETFs based on their year-to-date returns through Nov. 17, according to Morningstar Direct, with respective gains of 77% and 76%.\n\nARKK has attracted $214 million in assets since its October 2014 launch; ARKW has gathered $147 million since September 2014. Both funds bear a 0.75% expense ratio.\n\nKinetics Internet (WWWFX) and Kinetics Market Opportunities (KMKNX) are among several Kinetics Mutual Funds that also own GBTC.\n\nEven as more options unfold for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, investors should keep in mind potential risks.\n\n""If market prices retain any useful informational content, which theory suggests they do, then the 10x run-up in the crypto market capitalization over the last year signals there is something important taking place,"" ZenCash co-founder Rob Viglione said. ""Whether that something ends up being radically transformational, or simply a speculative delusion is yet to be seen.""\n\nRELATED:\n\nHow To Invest In Stocks For Free With New Apps For Beginners\n\nHere\'s The Latest Bitcoin Rival That\'s About To Hit The Market\n\nFidelity Starts Test To Let Customers See Their Holdings In Bitcoin, Other Digital Currencies\n\nMore Than Bitcoin: Blockchain\'s Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Wal-Mart\n\nBirth Of An Industry: Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence', 'In our last discussion of the bitcoin market, an emphasis was placed on the $7,000 support level because it represented a historic point of interest and it showed strong signs of support — a break of which would ultimately prove to have a strong downward move following afterward.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has since broken the $7,000 support level. It then took an immediate $500–$600 move downward and has, thus far, shown little interest in bouncing upward. Taking the whole move into view, we can see quite clearly that we completed a Wyckoff Distribution phase on the 30-minute candle; we are now heading downward as the supply is overwhelming the market:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 30-Minute Candles, Wyckoff Distribution\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows a breakdown of the $7,000 support level, ultimately timed with the Last Point of Supply (LPSY) for this distribution phase. The LPSY represents the final, overwhelming abundance of supply in the market. As the price pushes lower, the supply outweighs the demand in the market and, as we are seeing in the current market, there is very little desire to buy at these prices.\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Parabolic Trend\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the rejection of the linear ascending resistance line (shown in pink). This trendline has historically proven to be a point of reversal and, at the time of the article, is rejecting the trendline for the fourth time.

Historically, these values haven’t proven to be a significant market value, so I would not at all be surprised to see a test of the 38% values sometime soon. Figure 3 shows a lot of market activity and a well-established baseline of support in the 38% values. If the 23% values break and don’t hold support, we can definitely expect strong support in the 38% values that will require multiple tests if it tries to break the 38% support.\n\nSummary:\n\nBitcoin broke below the $7,000 support level and ultimately completed a Wyckoff Distribution phase. Prior to the breakdown in price, the market rejected the historic resistance line, which has signaled a strong reversal point throughout the market’s history. We are currently finding support on the 23% retracement values, but ultimately the stronger support will be found on the 38% values in the $5,800s.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

11/11/2017,"['Update, Sunday, November 12, 2017, 1:33pm EST: This post has been updated with quotes from Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, two of the biggest supporters of Bitcoin Cash, and with information on how trading in Korea might have affected price.\n\nWell, get your popcorn after all.\n\nEarlier this week, a planned hard fork on the Bitcoin blockchain that threatened to create two new coins, causing disruptions on exchanges and potential losses for users on both sides -- but also possibly one of the most exciting chapters in Bitcoin\'s history -- was called off.\n\nBut in the last few days, a previous fork of Bitcoin (BTC) called Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that was launched in August and immediately dismissed by many Bitcoiners and the wider crypto world alike, has skyrocketed in value. After languishing in the $300 range for a while and jumping up to the $600 range in November, it has now nearly quadrupled to around $2,500 a coin as of press time -- it had traded as low as $650 on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin, which was trading at an all-time high of around $7,800 on Wednesday, is now down to around $6,000 as of press time but had dipped as low as about $5,500.\n\n[Update: shortly after publishing, the Bitcoin price took back some ground and Bitcoin Cash lost some. For the latest, check Coinmarketcap.com.]\n\n[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.]\n\nThe surge by Bitcoin Cash led it to overtake Ethereum in market capitalization to $40 billion and become the second-largest crypto. (Earlier this year, as Bitcoin\'s market share of all crypto tokens was dropping precipitously and Ethereum was on a tear, many in the crypto community wondered about when they might see what they called ""the flippening"" -- when the market capitalization of Ethereum would overtake that of Bitcoin\'s. Instead, a different kind of flippening has occurred: Bitcoin Cash surpassing Ethereum. Even Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin congratulated the most vocal early supporters of Bitcoin Cash on Twitter.)\n\nSeveral active crypto players surmised that the market moves had to do with the disaffected group who did not get the hard fork that they supported, known as SegWit2x, shifting their money over to Bitcoin Cash, which is more in line with their vision of Bitcoin. The side that prevailed regarding the hard fork were known as 1xers because they supported keeping the block size limit at 1MB as opposed to increasing to 2MB as the supporters of the hard fork (so-called 2xers) wanted. The 2xers felt increasing the block size limit was necessary because blocks have become full, causing transaction fees to rise, making it hard to justify using Bitcoin for small transactions.\n\nBut in the weeks leading up to the proposed split, Bitcoin futures markets seemed to indicate that 1x coins would retain 85% of Bitcoin\'s current value and 2x coins only 15%. The 2x side eventually decided not to go through with the proposed hard fork, and the day the news was announced, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high.\n\nThat was Wednesday. Saturday has been an entirely different story as the price of Bitcoin Cash has skyrocketed and that of Bitcoin slumped.\n\n""What a plot twist,"" wrote Jacob Eliosoff, manager of Trevi Digital Assets Fund, in a message. ""Right after 1x\'s big day of glory, and especially after 1xers spent the last month talking about how the market would decide and was clearly validating them!""\n\nBut overall, he said, it\'s natural that backers of SegWit2x ""have nowhere to turn but BCH. It\'s not surprising that SegWit2x\'s loss has been Bitcoin Cash\'s gain.""\n\nKyle Samani, managing partner of MultiCoin Capital, wrote in a message, ""There were lots of Bitcoin Cash whales who were in early on Bitcoin who were waiting to see what would happen with 2x. Now they\'re making their move. They\'re dumping BTC for BCH....I know many Bitcoin OGs who have dumped $10m+ of BTC for BCH ... Turns out there were a lot more BCH ideologues than we all thought.""\n\nSamani said Multicoin sold BTC for BCH in the last 48 hours as well. ""Ideologically, I gave up on Bitcoin long ago but I\'m a fiduciary now so I have to make money on the swings,"" he wrote.\n\nOne such whale, Roger Ver, nicknamed Bitcoin Jesus for his personal proselytizing of Bitcoin during its early years and one of the biggest holders of Bitcoin historically, told Forbes via email that he is selling his Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash. ""Bitcoin Cash is useful in commerce, and therefore can also be used as a store of value,"" he wrote, referring indirectly to the high transaction fees on Bitcoin; Bitcoin Cash has much lower fees. When asked if he was trying to move the price, he said, ""Of course not. No trader ever wants to be the one to move the price.""\n\nAnother big proponent of Bitcoin Cash, Jihan Wu, the CEO of Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer Bitmain and mining pool Antpool, wrote via WeChat, ""Right now we have both BCH and BTC, but we believe BCH has more potential."" He denied that he or his companies sold Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash on Friday or Saturday during the price gyrations.\n\nAccording to Coinmarketcap, the price of Bitcoin Cash on Korean exchanges was slightly higher than on other exchanges around the world, suggesting it also played a role in the price movement. However, data from CryptoCompare showed overall trading volume of Korean Won to Bitcoin Cash was down compared to recent weeks, while trading of Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was up.\n\nPart of the debate around the potential hard fork was around the vision for Bitcoin: whether it should be a store of value only, like digital gold, or a store of value as well as a means of exchange, like digital cash.\n\n""The OGs believe in Bitcoin as digital cash and not as gold,"" wrote Samani, ""and they\'re sick of core,"" he said, referring to the Bitcoin core developers who mainly led the crowd who believed Bitcoin should mainly be a store of value and that payments should occur in a layer built on top of Bitcoin but not processed on the Bitcoin blockchain itself.\n\nBitcoin Cash has a few other things going for it -- namely the fact that it is now 2.2 times as profitable for miners who can secure blockchains to mine Bitcoin Cash than to mine Bitcoin. That means the Bitcoin blockchain has lost so-called hash power, which will mean it will take longer for transactions to be processed.\n\nAs Eliosoff explained, ""As BTC loses hash, its blocks slow down, confirmations take longer, and of course fees spike up as we\'re seeing now."" While that could take weeks to correct, it could also cause a downward spiral as people flee to another blockchain that doesn\'t have those problems -- such as Bitcoin Cash.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin Cash\'s recent streak may not last. Even during the writing of this article, it began to reverse some gains and Bitcoin took back some losses. The ideological battle marches on.\n\nUpdate, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017, 2:57am EST: Bitcoin\'s all-time high was reached Wednesday, not Thursday as originally reported.', 'US Treasury Department Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that his department is conducting an investigation on the illegal applications of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin. He claimed that the probe is intended to ensure that the digital currency is not utilized for “unlawful purposes.”\n\nDuring an interview with Yahoo Finance as of early November 2017, the secretary claimed that the alleged illicit use of Bitcoin should be reviewed “very carefully” to make sure that the dark web is not financed in Bitcoin.\n\n""So we want to make sure that you don\'t have the dark web funded in Bitcoins. And that\'s something that is a concern of ours today.""\n\nActions by the agency on cryptocurrencies\n\nEarlier, the Treasury department announced a plan to assess the digital currency practices of the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).\n\nIn the same announcement, the agency claimed that the audit is related to FinCEN’s strategy in addressing money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with cryptocurrencies.\n\n“We plan to determine how FinCEN identifies, prioritizes, and addresses money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with virtual currencies.""\n\nMeanwhile, Mnuchin claimed in the interview that the issues involving the use of Bitcoin are also being discussed with their international counterparts. He further stated that dealers of the top-dog virtual currency in the US should meet the requirements of know-your-customer (KYC) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). These requirements are intended to prevent or counter money laundering activities and fraud in the country.', 'The value of cryptocurrencies is rising fast. But is it sustainable? And how does it work, anyway? These questions, and many more, answered…\n\nThe money has become too much to ignore and so bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are back in the news. You may have heard about Ethereum, a cryptocurrency that has risen in value by more than 2,500% over the course of 2017. Or maybe you’ve heard about one of the many smaller cryptocurrencies that raised hundreds of millions of dollars in the first few days they were on sale, during their “initial coin offering”. Or you’ve just spotted that bitcoin, which made headlines in 2013 for hitting a high of $200, is now worth nearly $7,000 (£5,250), making a lot of people very rich in the process.\n\nAre these cryptocurrencies simply speculative bubbles or will they actually transform our financial system? It’s time to answer a few common questions about this new technology – and assess whether a lot of people have just pulled off the investment of their lifetime or made a huge mistake.\n\nWhat actually is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, the first and still the biggest example of its type. At its core, it’s a new form of digital asset, created through a canny combination of encryption (the same technology that protects WhatsApp from eavesdropping) and peer-to-peer networking (which allowed music piracy to blossom in the 00s through services such as Kazaa).\n\nIf you own a bitcoin, what you actually control is a secret digital key you can use to prove to anyone on the network that a certain amount of bitcoin is yours.\n\nIf you spend that bitcoin, you tell the entire network that you have transferred ownership of it and use the same key to prove that you are really you. In that respect, your key is similar to a password that allows you access to your money, except with no possibility of resetting your key if you lose it. Anyone else who manages to discover your key would gain total, irreversible control over your cash. The history of all the transactions made is a lasting record of who owns which bitcoin: that record is called the “blockchain”.\n\nWhat are its advantages over money created by central banks?\n\nBitcoin advocates will point to a number of possible advantages, from the ability to use the blockchain to track things other than simple money to the built-in support for “smart contracts”, which execute automatically when certain conditions are met.\n\nBut the biggest advantage, and the only one everybody agrees on, is that bitcoin is decentralised and so extremely resistant to censorship.\n\nAlthough it’s possible to observe a bitcoin payment in process, it’s not practicably possible to stop it. That makes it radically different from conventional banking, where banks can, and do, intervene to freeze accounts, vet payments for money laundering or enforce regulations. That has made it a haven for activities from cybercrime and drug trading to enabling international payments to closed economies and supporting radically off-grid living.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bitcoin ATMs in a shop in Kazan, Russia. Photograph: Yegor Aleyev/TASS\n\nSo will I need to start taking bitcoin to Tesco for my weekly shop?\n\nUnlikely. Bitcoin has one major hurdle to being used at scale for physical transactions: payments are only confirmed once every 10 minutes (and that’s when everything’s working well; in practice, it can take days for confirmation to occur). This means theoretically that it’s possible to spend a bitcoin, then walk next door and spend exactly the same bitcoin at a second establishment. Only one of those transactions will ultimately be confirmed, leaving the other place out of pocket.\n\nMore generally, bitcoin has limited advantages for payments between big companies and normal consumers. It’s no easier or quicker than any other mobile payment, it introduces considerable volatility to your daily holdings (or a sizable hedging cost to guard against swings in the value of the currency) and remains a pain to integrate with the conventional banking system.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped some large companies experimenting. Microsoft accepts bitcoin for payments on its online store and PayPal offers integration for merchants to offer the cryptocurrency as a payment option.\n\nIs it really the new gold?\n\nProbably not, but the comparison isn’t completely spurious. One of the interesting quirks of bitcoin is that there will never be more than 21m of them in existence. That figure is written into the currency at its source code and is a function of how the network rewards those people who provide the computing power (called “miners” – because of that gold analogy) that keeps it ticking over.\n\nEvery 10 minutes, one of the miners is rewarded with a sum of bitcoin. That reward doesn’t come from anyone: it is created out of thin air and added to the bitcoin wallet of the miner. Initially, that reward was 50 bitcoin, but it gets halved every four years, until, midway through the 22nd century, the last bitcoin ever will be produced.\n\nFor a certain type of economist, that hard limit is an extremely good thing. If you believe that the key problem with the financial system over the past 100 years has been that central banks print money, creating inflation in the process, then bitcoin provides an alternative ecosystem where inflation is capped forever.\n\nDoes it really create more carbon dioxide than Ecuador?\n\nYup. And then some. Citibank estimates that the bitcoin network will eventually consume roughly the same amount of electricity as Japan. The problem is that the mining process is incredibly wasteful – and deliberately so. Those miners are all competing to be the first to solve an arbitrarily difficult computing problem, one that takes enormous amounts of processor cycles to do and still comes down mostly to luck. The computer that does solve it first, every 10 minutes, gets a sizable reward – currently in the region of £65,000 in bitcoin – but every computer, not just the winner, has had to spend that processing time to do the maths.\n\nThe reason for the mining requirement, which is essentially asking a computer to continue rolling a dice until it rolls a few thousand sixes in a row, is that it ensures that no single person can dictate what happens on the network. The proof that the miner has solved the problem is what it uses to claim its reward, but it also becomes the seal that it uses to verify the last 10 minutes of transactions.\n\n“I, miner number 2357398, have solved this problem, and the answer is [extremely long string of digits]. By the authority vested in me by the network, I declare that the following list of transactions to be confirmed:” and then they list every transaction that they have heard about in the last ten minutes.\n\nFrom that point on, every machine on the network begins solving a new problem, set by the last miner. But, crucially, they only do so if they agree with the miner’s list of transactions. That means that even if you do win the race, it’s not enough to simply insert your own lies in the block, and declare that everyone sent you all their money, because everyone else will simply ignore you and listen to the next miner in the chain.\n\n(The reward itself isn’t really necessary to Bitcoin, but it’s there to ensure that miners have some reason to throw their electricity at the network. In the long-run, the hope is that voluntary transaction fees for quicker confirmations will take over that role.)Because the problem is so processor-intensive and so randomly rewarded, it’s prohibitively expensive – in electricity and computing power – to attempt to fake it. But it’s also a vast use of electricity, worldwide, used to do little other than satisfy an arbitrary requirement for spending money.\n\nIs bitcoin the only cryptocurrency?\n\nNot at all, although it’s still the most valuable. After bitcoin’s creation in 2009, a number of other cryptocurrencies sought to replicate its success by taking its free, public code and tweaking it for different purposes.\n\nSome had a very defined goal. Filecoin aims to produce a sort of decentralised Dropbox; as well as simply telling the network that you have some Filecoins, you can tell it to store some encrypted data and pay Filecoins to whoever stores it on their computer.Why would you want that? Well, it again comes back to censorship resistance. If you store something on your Dropbox that the company doesn’t like, it can just delete the data and ban you. With Filecoin, it’s impossible to tell what’s being stored, and impossible to force the network to block any given user anyway.\n\nOthers are more nebulous. Ethereum, now the second biggest name after bitcoin, is essentially a cryptocurrency for making cryptocurrencies. Users can write “smart contracts”, effectively programs that can be run on the computer of any user of the network if they’re paid enough Ether tokens.Think, for instance, of offering a small sum every time someone responds to a particular signal with today’s headlines: you’ve built a decentralised news website, then. Or you could write a small program and reward someone every time it’s run: that way, you’ve created a decentralised cloud computer.\n\nAs a category, these new cryptocurrencies are increasingly referred to as “decentralised apps”, or “dapps”, with the focus being not on the specific currency used to make the system work, but on its overall goal.It might even be best not to think of the coins that lie at their heart as “currency” at all: when the token could represent a services contract, a land registry record, or the right to five minutes of computing time, the analogy to pounds and dollars has rather broken down.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mike Tyson, who launched a bitcoin wallet app in 2016. Photograph: David Becker/Getty Images\n\nWhat is driving the price rise?\n\nThat’s the billion-dollar question. A few different explanations have been offered.\n\nSome fans will say that the price rise is simply a correction to the natural rate of growth for bitcoin. Sure, they argue, the technology has had its booms and its busts, but if it is to become a worldwide digital currency, its value will definitely be higher than it is today. In that narrative, the price rise is simply a reflection of the growing acceptance of bitcoin.\n\nOther fans point to the growth in novel cryptocurrencies. Because of bitcoin’s maturity, and its focus on finance, if you want to buy some Ether, some Filecoins or any other cryptocurrency, it’s usually easiest to buy bitcoin with your conventional currency and then trade bitcoin for the cryptocurrency of your choice. Naturally, then, booms in those currencies are leading to booms in bitcoin itself, as more and more people attempt to buy into the whole system.\n\nThen there’s the bubble argument. There, people argue that the majority of the price rise is due simply to people buying bitcoin in the hope that they can sell it later for a profit. A classic speculative bubble, some people will make a lot of money – while others will lose everything.\n\nSo is it a bubble?\n\nFew would argue that there isn’t a lot of speculation in the cryptocurrency market. There are adverts on the London underground, and all over Instagram and Facebook, encouraging viewers to “invest in cryptocurrencies” and, judging by the amount of money flowing in to the ecosystem, a lot of people are taking up the offer.\n\nAt some point, those people will get flighty and try to cash out their gains. If enough do at once, the price of bitcoin will take such a tumble that it will prompt a run and we’ll see the classic crash.\n\nBut the real question is not whether this will happen, but when – and how big the crash is. Three times now, bitcoin has had boom-and-bust cycles that have seen vast amounts of value destroyed, but have still left the currency valued higher than it was before the previous boom began. (Personally, I first called bitcoin a “bubble” in print when one coin was worth $30. After the crash that followed, one coin was worth $120.) It’s not a smooth ride up, but that doesn’t mean it’s a total bubble.\n\nWhat is a “hard fork”?\n\nAs the bitcoin network has grown, it’s hit problems. For dull, technical reasons, the network as it was initially designed struggles to deal with the amount of traffic that flows through it these days, leaving huge delays in the amount of time it takes for a transaction to be confirmed.\n\nIn a normal, centralised, business, that wouldn’t be a problem: simply update the software and move on. But a bitcoin update requires convincing every single miner to accept the new software – otherwise, the miners who carry on running the old version are effectively running a completely different currency from those who have updated.\n\nThis is known as a “hard fork”, and for the first six years of bitcoin’s life, it was the nightmare every developer tried to avoid. But recently, divisions among the community have become so fractious that multiple hard forks have occurred, all around how to deal with this traffic slowdown.\n\nWith names like Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, and Bitcoin Gold, each claims that it is the true heir to the original vision – but with each fork, the playing field becomes more crowded.\n\nNothing is destroyed with each fork: if you had 100 bitcoin before Bitcoin Cash split off, after the split you still had 100 bitcoin and you had 100 Bitcoin Cash. But with each fork, the playing field becomes more crowded, more confusing for newcomers, and the overall reputation for (relative) stability becomes more eroded. Another fork, SegWit2x, was due to happen in late November, but its backers decided at the last minute it didn’t have enough support and called it off.\n\nWhat’s the banking establishment’s view of bitcoin?\n\nIt varies greatly. Some, such as JP Morgan Chase head, Jamie Dimon, are extremely dismissive of the whole thing, arguing that the very properties of bitcoin that make it so appealing as a form of digital gold are why it’s doomed to remain a niche prospect. For Dimon and co, the volatility of its exchange rate, lack of any economic oversight to control monetary policy and absence of support from major nation states mean bitcoin can’t ever truly replace pounds and dollars and is therefore a failure.\n\nFew disagree with that conclusion, but some bankers point to other advantages of the technology. The blockchain concept, they say, might be useful in conventional banking too. Forget bitcoin itself and focus instead on the value of a “distributed ledger”. What if all the major banks replaced their normal book-keeping with one shared, but still closed, database? Might that help cut down on fraud and ensure a more level playing field?\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the advantages of bitcoin that conventional banking can’t hope to compete with - and doesn’t want to. Can a shadow currency exist purely on the back of drug dealing and cybercrime? Quite possibly: both are big businesses, and neither shows any sign of going away.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Craig Wright, who claimed to be “Satoshi Nakamoto”, the elusive bitcoin inventor. Photograph: Mark Harrison/PA\n\nWhat’s the latest on the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nHe’s still a mystery. The pseudonymous founder of bitcoin, Nakamoto appeared out of nowhere in 2008 when he published the white paper that described how his proposed digital currency would work. While he was active in the online community around bitcoin for the first couple of years of the currency’s life, he posted less and less, making his last ever post on 12 December 2010.\n\nSince then, a lot of people have been accused by others of being the real identity behind Nakamoto. Some of those accusations have been farcical – Newsweek fingered a Japanese-American man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the inventor, leading to a slow-motion car chase around LA before the man had a sushi dinner with one hand-picked reporter, during which he repeatedly referred to “bitcom” and begged to be left alone.\n\nOthers have been based on the background discussion around cryptocurrencies at the time: leading thinkers such as Hal Finney and Nick Szabo were named, on the basis of similar areas of research. Both men denied being Nakamoto and pointed out that they were active under their own names at the time bitcoin was launched, with Finney (who died in 2014) being the currency’s second?ever user.\n\nOnly one person has credibly claimed to be Nakamoto himself: Australian computer scientist Craig Wright. In 2016, Wright went public and gave a number of long interviews to the BBC, GQ, the Economist and London Review of Books, in which he claimed that he would provide evidence proving he is Nakamoto. When the evidence was released, however, it was flawed, proving nothing and leading some to accuse him of “scammery”.\n\nSince then, there have been no other major names linked to Nakamoto’s identity and no action on the bitcoin holdings linked to his account, currently worth around $7bn. It is possible the world may never know who invented bitcoin. For many in the field, that’s how it should be.', 'Bitcoin price struggled and moved below $6500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD might continue to decline and it could even break $6000.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price struggled to move above the $7770 level against the US Dollar and started a downside move.\n\nThere was a break below a major bullish trend line with support at $6780 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX).\n\nThe pair is now well below the $6500 level and remains in the bearish zone.\n\nBitcoin price struggled and moved below $6500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD might continue to decline and it could even break $6000.\n\nBitcoin Price Turned Bearish?\n\nIt was yet another bullish week for bitcoin price as it moved above the $7500 level against the US Dollar. The price even managed to move above $7700 and traded to a new all-time high of $7773. Later, it failed to hold gains and started a downside move. It broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $5362 low to $7773 high. The downside move was strong as the price broke the $7000 level and the 100 simple moving average (H4).\n\nSellers even broke a major bullish trend line with support at $6780 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. Moreover, the pair is now well below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $5362 low to $7773 high. That’s why, there are chances of it extending declines in the near term. At present, the pair seems to be approaching the $6000 handle, which might act as a support. Once there is a break of the $6000 level, there are chances of more declines toward $5650.\n\nOn the upside, the broken support near $6750 and the 100 simple moving average (H4) are resistance zones. Selling rallies near $6750 can be opted in the short term as long as the price is below $7000.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently near the oversold levels.\n\nMajor Support Level – $6000\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $6750\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Those who had owned Bitcoin on the site, on the other hand, stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars generated by the cryptocurrency’s rising value.\n\nMt. Gox was one of the first convenient platforms for buying and selling Bitcoin online. Much like a bank, it retained direct control of the Bitcoin that belonged to many of its users. But it shut down in early 2014, claiming that hackers had stolen hundreds of thousands of its customers’ Bitcoins. Karpeles, in addition to being publicly condemned for mismanagement, faces criminal charges of embezzlement in the case.\n\nNonetheless, according to the Wall Street Journal, Karpeles could make in the neighborhood of $1 billion from the bankruptcy, thanks to Japanese law’s treatment of the Gox Bitcoins.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nArticle 124 of Japan’s bankruptcy codes required that liabilities be registered at market values when proceedings were opened in April of 2014. At that point, one Bitcoin was worth roughly $500, but the price has since risen to more than $6,300. Mt. Gox later recovered some of the allegedly hacked cryptocurrency, and still holds 202,195 Bitcoins, now worth around $1.5 billion.\n\nBut at a Sept. 27 hearing, Karpeles’ lawyer argued that those market gains belonged primarily to the collapsed Bitcoin exchange, not to the users who lost them years ago. According to the Journal’s calculations, based on a higher Bitcoin price earlier this week, selling off Mt. Gox’s remaining Bitcoin holdings at today’s prices while paying back creditors at April 2014 prices could leave a $977 million surplus. According to the Journal, Karpeles’ holding company, Tibanne, owns about 88% of Mt. Gox, meaning he could pocket a large portion of those gains.\n\nAccording to Fortune’s prior reporting, Japan’s bankruptcy code does allow for liabilities in a bankruptcy to be marked to market values, but the Journal reports that the period for creditors to dispute such decisions has ended.', 'In early 2016, the masternodes that comprise Dash’s governance system voted overwhelmingly to upgrade to 2MB blocks, with 99 percent of the network in favor. Many in the cryptocurrency world saw this as a simple attention-getting gimmick, as Dash’s development priorities became focused elsewhere. However, with the recent release of Dash version 12.2, it looks like larger blocks will be implemented soon.\n\nThe version 12.2 upgrade is one step on the way to Dash Evolution, the currency’s plan to make “digital [currencies] be so easy to use your Grandma would use them.” Core developer UdjinM6 wrote of the recent update:\n\nThe most notable changes are: DIP0001 implementation (which is a 2MB block upgrade);\n\nTransaction fee reduction 10x (activates via DIP0001 activation);\n\nInstantSend vulnerability fix (activates via DIP0001 lock in);\n\nPrivateSend improvement which should allow user to have mixed funds available much faster;\n\nVarious RPC changes;\n\nLots of backports from Bitcoin Core and refactoring of our own legacy code which should improve performance and make code more reliable and easier to review;\n\nExperimental HD wallet with BIP39/BIP44 support.\n\nNot needed yet\n\nOf course, larger blocks aren’t needed yet, as the currency does not process enough transactions to fill its current blocks. However, this blocksize increase follows the on-chain scaling plan announced by founder Evan Duffield earlier this year. Duffield announced that through the use of custom hardware, Dash will create a network that can scale to large numbers of transactions by using big blocks.\n\nDuffield wrote:\n\nMany projects in the space believe that on-chain scaling is impossible. That’s simply because they haven’t explored alternative P2P architectures for higher performance. We intend to show just how far an incentivized second tier [masternode] architecture can take a project like Dash.\n\nBitcoin’s path...and Ethereum’s too\n\nBitcoin, of course, has chosen to follow a different path. With the planned SegWit2x upgrade officially dead, the currency is now firmly on the path of off-chain scaling through the lightning network or similar solutions. The lightning network is intended to work by moving transactions off-chain onto “payment channels” and then “settling” the result to the Bitcoin Blockchain periodically.\n\nFor instance, if Bob pays Alice one BTC, then he later pays her two BTC, and finally sends her 1.5 BTC, that’s three separate transactions that need to be recorded to the Blockchain. With lightning network, however, only the net transaction would need to be posted to the Blockchain once the payment channel was closed. In this case, only one transaction would be posted for a total of 4.5 BTC sent from Bob to Alice.\n\nCritics have asked how often payment channels will really be used, but until the network is deployed, it’s impossible to say. Others suggest that moving transactions off-chain damages the decentralized and immutable nature of Bitcoin. Supporters point out that transactions happen off-chain all the time, for instance on exchanges. No Bitcoin exchange posts a separate transaction to the Blockchain every time funds are moved internally. Only the final result is posted, once a user withdraws funds.\n\nNumber two cryptocurrency Ethereum isn’t just sitting on the sidelines, either. The currency plans to implement the “Raiden Network” which will utilize payment channels similar to Bitcoin’s proposed lightning network.\n\nForks welcome\n\nWhile Bitcoin assiduously avoids hard forks whenever possible, Dash welcomes them. The key to Dash’s upgrade strategy is the “spork” a mechanism that allows portions of the upgrade to be “turned off” if there is a problem on the network. An example is something called “enforcement.” The Dash network normally requires miners to share the block reward with masternodes; miners who attempt to keep the entire reward to themselves will find their blocks rejected by the network.\n\nHowever, during an upgrade, enforcement can (and usually is) be turned off. This allows both miners and masternodes a reasonable amount of time to upgrade their software while eliminating the risk of uncontrollable forking caused by one part of the network rejecting the other part.\n\nBest path uncertain\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Bitcoin, Ethereum or Dash will be successful in solving the scalability problem. Both the “payment channels” and “really big blocks” scaling methods have their critics, and neither has been thoroughly vetted yet. It’s possible that another solution might emerge in the interim, or that both solutions could be workable.\n\nThe one thing that’s certain, however, is that for digital currency to become a real force in the world, tens of thousands of people will need to be able to transact all at the same time. A successful mainstream cryptocurrency must be able to scale to Visa’s level or beyond.', 'The cryptocurrency world is in a fuss about Bitcoin and rightly so, with the cancellation of the SegWit2x hardfork and the sudden drop in pricing by nearly $1000 per BTC. However, the price drops and news has kept Bitcoin in the limelight while Ethereum has slowly been making improvements and growing its network.\n\nThe second largest market cap coin has seen substantial use cases arise as the ICO world continues to flourish and new ERC20 and ERC223 tokens are created. Recent reports by the Ethereum Foundation indicate that Ethereum processed 44 percent more transactions than the Bitcoin Blockchain, showing the power of the Ethereum system.\n\nFurther, the total number of pending transactions for Ethereum has been stable between 30 and 300, while the same figure for Bitcoin has fluctuated anywhere from 39,000 to 47,000.\n\nQuantum protection\n\nThe ZK-SNARK protocol, released on the Ethereum platform with the Byzantium hardfork, was quickly criticized by some tech insiders because of its risk of attack from quantum computers. While some had posited that the Ethereum fork would produce a Wall Street adoption boom, the risk from quantum computers has kept adoption steady.\n\nA recent paper by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin indicates, however, that a new protocol called the ZK-STARK has been conceptualized in order to protect a full zero-knowledge transaction, even from quantum computing. This protocol relies only on hashes and information theory, rather than the ‘trusted setup’ of its ZK-SNARK cousin.\n\nThe upgraded anonymity, while perhaps necessary for such applications as public or fiscal Blockchain transactions, does come at a data cost - from 288 bytes to a few hundred kilobytes according to Buterin. However, in fields where anonymity is paramount, the additional data would provide something that no other system to date can accomplish - fully secure and fully anonymous transactions.\n\nWith the rise in transaction volume, the increased speed of transactions, and burgeoning technology use cases, Ethereum may be poised for greater market growth in the coming months.', 'This week the Bitcoin.com wallet has reached a significant milestone as we are pleased to announce our wallet app has been downloaded 500,000 times since launching the platform.

In 2016 it emerged that Bridges had also embezzled additional coins while he was still in custody. On November 2 he was sentenced to an additional 2 years in jail and ordered to forfeit the stolen 1,600 Bitcoins, currently worth over $10 million.\n\nBridges Secret Service Work\n\nBridges had been assigned to the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force to investigate and shut down the online black market. His responsibilities were to conduct forensic computer investigations in order to locate, identify and prosecute targets including Silk Road chief Ross Ulbricht, aka “Dread Pirate Roberts”. Bridges had been employed by the US Secret Service for 6 years.\n\nFool Me Once Shame on You, Fool Me Twice Shame on Me\n\nBridges was just a day away from starting his initial jail term when the additional charges were made in January 2016. According to admissions made in connection with his guilty plea, Bridges admitted to using a private key to access a digital wallet belonging to the U.S. government, subsequently transferring the seized bitcoins to a series of bitcoin exchanges to which only he had access.\n\nAssistant United States Attorney William Frentzen stated:\n\nHe walked out with, among other things, a private key in order to be able to access a digital wallet containing approximately 1,606 bitcoin.

Mnuchin said that top regulators in the agency are scrutinizing cryptocurrencies in general more than ever before.\n\n“It’s something we are looking at very carefully,” Mnuchin said, “and will continue to look at.”\n\nThe regulatory scrutiny, of course, comes as no surprise as U.S. regulators have been commenting on Bitcoin with increased frequency over the past several months.\n\nWhat did come as a jolt, though, is the frankness – even sharpness – of the Treasury Sec.’s concerns with Bitcoin. His comments aren’t bullish sentiments, to say the least:\n\nThe first issue and the most important issue is to make sure that people can’t use bitcoin for illicit activities […] we want to make sure that you don’t have the dark web funded in bitcoins. And that’s something that is a concern of ours today.\n\nMnuchin’s Focus Is on Money Laundering\n\nAs the top financial regulator in the United States, Sec. Mnuchin sees Bitcoin falling under his regulatory purview according to its money laundering potentials.\n\nWhile he stayed mum on when his department would issue any further guidelines, Mnuchin noted the goal was to watch and adapt as the space unfolds:\n\nSo, if you’re a bitcoin dealer in the United States, you have […] customer requirements and BSA requirements.

11/12/2017,"['One bitcoin is now worth less than $5,900, down 25 percent from Wednesday\'s high above $7,800. Meanwhile, the currency of a rival, spinoff network called Bitcoin Cash, has doubled to more than $1,500 over the same four-day period.\n\nThis is good news for one side in Bitcoin\'s ongoing civil war—the side that sees an urgent need to boost the network\'s capacity to deal with growing congestion and rising transaction fees. People in this camp have been flocking to Bitcoin Cash after a plan to expand the capacity of the main Bitcoin network fell apart on Wednesday.\n\n""Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010,"" tweeted Gavin Andresen on Saturday. ""A store of value AND means of exchange."" It was a pointed dig to the mainstream Bitcoin network, where slow transactions and rising fees have made it an increasingly unappealing way to make everyday payments.\n\nThe endorsement is significant because Andresen was chosen by founder Satoshi Nakamoto to lead the Bitcoin project after Nakamoto faded from the scene in 2011. Andresen was frozen out of the Bitcoin Core development team last year in the midst of a bitter debate over the network\'s future.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin Cash is still the underdog, as the value of conventional bitcoins is about four times the value of ""cash"" bitcoins. But supporters are betting that this will change as demand for both networks continues to grow. The Bitcoin Cash network has greater capacity now, and it has a community that is committed to expand the network further as needed.\n\nBitcoin Cash backers believe that with the leaders of the mainstream Bitcoin network stubbornly resisting such capacity increases, it\'s only a matter of time before these advantages make it the dominant payment network in the Bitcoin world.\n\nWhy some have opposed expanding Bitcoin\'s capacity\n\nUntil recently, a hard-coded limit in the Bitcoin software—one megabyte per block—limited the network to processing no more than about seven transactions per second. The big-block faction has argued that this limit should be raised to accommodate further network growth.\n\nBut others saw decentralization as the essential attribute of the Bitcoin network. They worried that enabling a flood of transactions would make it too difficult for ordinary people to participate in Bitcoin\'s transaction-clearing process. They have promoted a hack called segregated witness that helps to squeeze more transactions into each one-megabyte block. But beyond that, they have argued that it\'s actually healthy for Bitcoin fees to rise over time to prevent the network from getting cluttered with low-value transactions.\n\nThe conflict came to a head in recent months. In August, some in the big-block camp split off from the main Bitcoin network to create rival network Bitcoin Cash, which supports blocks up to eight megabytes. This provided an alternative platform for those who were frustrated with the lack of growth in the main Bitcoin network.\n\nLater that month, the main Bitcoin network activated the segregated witness hack, which moves cryptographic signatures outside the one-megabyte block limit. This change has roughly doubled the capacity of the network and brought some temporary relief to congestion that had plagued the network for months.\n\nUnder the terms of a May compromise, the activation of segregated witness—long favored by the small-block faction—would be followed by an increase in the block size limit to 2 megabytes. That change was supposed to take place in mid-November. But after segregated witness went into effect in August, the apparent consensus began to evaporate.\n\nBy the start of November, the proposal to double the block size had become hotly contested. The Bitcoin network is based on consensus, so it\'s risky to make changes unless they\'ll be broadly supported. Last week, the leaders of the effort to double block sizes threw in the towel, announcing that the controversial change would not take place after all.\n\nBitcoin Cash has deepened polarization in the Bitcoin world\n\nObviously, the fact that Bitcoin won\'t get a capacity increase this week doesn\'t mean it can never get a capacity increase. As congestion in the Bitcoin network gets worse, a consensus might still emerge about the need to allow larger blocks.\n\nBut it also might not. Many small-block advocates envision an alternative future for Bitcoin in which Bitcoin itself becomes a low-volume settlement layer for high-value transactions—much as banks once shipped gold bars to each other to settle their obligations.\n\nSmall-block fans have pinned their hopes on Lightning, a new type of payment network that allows people to make fast, small Bitcoin payments without having to post every transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain. In theory, Lightning could allow millions of bitcoin-denominated payments to happen every day without changing Bitcoin\'s one-megabyte block size limit. But Lightning is still in development, and it\'s far from clear if it will work as well as advocates hope.\n\nIn any event, excitement about Lightning has convinced some small-block advocates that block size increases won\'t be necessary for years—even decades. And as more big-blockers flee to Bitcoin Cash, opponents of larger blocks will gain the upper hand in Bitcoin\'s internal politics. That could leave Bitcoin stuck with one-megabyte blocks indefinitely.\n\nMeanwhile, the big-block faction has broad support from Bitcoin\'s business community—including well-funded Silicon Valley startups. So far, a lot of these companies have continued focusing on mainstream Bitcoin. But with proposals to upgrade the Bitcoin network stalled, it wouldn\'t be surprising if these companies have a change of heart, concluding that the future of Bitcoin rests with Bitcoin Cash.\n\nAnd these companies are the main way that many users interact with Bitcoin. If they made it as easy to use Bitcoin Cash as it is to use mainstream Bitcoin—and if capacity constraints continue to cause slow transactions and high fees on the conventional Bitcoin network—users could start switching over to Bitcoin Cash as their preferred network. Which might be why markets have shifted so dramatically toward Bitcoin Cash in the last four days.', 'The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a complex shakeup this weekend, with a recently created digital token called Bitcoin Cash (BCH) up nearly 130% in two days, even after retreating substantially from an even bigger spike. Meanwhile, the original Bitcoin (BTC) is down by roughly 15% over the same span. Bitcoin Cash’s total market value, after briefly overtaking Ethereum’s to make BCH the second most valuable cryptocurrency, now stands at $25 billion.\n\nMore profoundly, Bitcoin Cash’s hashrate, or network-wide cryptographic processing power, has surpassed Bitcoin’s.\n\nThe swings come in the wake of this week’s cancellation of a ‘hard fork,’ or forced split, of Bitcoin. The proposed fork would have created a new version of Bitcoin, known tentatively as Bitcoin 2x after the upgrade plan behind it, Segwit2x. Bitcoin Cash appears to be attracting investors and network operators, or miners, who had supported the 2x fork.\n\nAs recently as September, Segwit2x was being touted as a strong solution to Bitcoin’s years-long block size dispute. Bitcoin upgrades are implemented democratically, but the block size fight has resisted consensus solutions, even as the problem it seeks to address — slow confirmation of Bitcoin transactions— has become increasingly serious.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nOne faction believes that Bitcoin should allow its transaction records, or blocks, to be bigger. That would make transactions cheaper and faster for users, but servers (also known as miners) more power hungry, risking dangerous centralization. Their opponents believe that Bitcoin should be a gold-like “store of value” more than a cash-like instrument, and that congestion can be mitigated without drastically changing the size of archive files — mostly by using secondary systems to conduct more transactions outside of the main blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Cash was itself an outcome of this dispute. It was created through a hard fork in early August — an event seen as something of a footnote at the time – and is distinguished from Bitcoin primarily by its larger block size.\n\nSegwit2x was intended to be a more moderate solution, giving both factions a bit of what they wanted. But it still couldn’t gain enough support to be implemented on the primary Bitcoin blockchain. When they announced its cancellation this week, Segwit2x organizers concluded that forcing a fork, or the creation of a separate 2x network, would “divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth.”\n\nWhile many supporters of smaller blocks celebrated the cancellation of the 2x fork, we may be seeing a functionally similar weakening of Bitcoin play out anyway. According to CoinDesk and the tracking site Fork.lol, Bitcoin Cash’s total cryptographic power, or hashrate, passed Bitcoin’s early Sunday morning (GMT).\n\nBitcoin’s total dollar value is still more than four times higher than Bitcoin Cash’s, but the hashrate and price shifts have led some to predict that Bitcoin Cash will supplant Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency blockchain within months. That may be a stretch, but it’s true that transaction backlogs on the classic Bitcoin network are still an issue, and Bitcoin Cash claims to solve it. Moreover, analyst Willy Woo told CoinDesk that Bitcoin Cash is now heavily backed by Chinese traders and miners, making BCH a “strategic and geopolitical bet” on Chinese influence.\n\nUPDATE: After its wild weekend ride, Bitcoin Cash crashed on Monday, while bitcoin regained lost ground.', ""HARARE (Reuters) - For most investors around the world, bitcoin is a volatile and highly speculative bet. For Zimbabweans, however, the cryptocurrency seems to offer rare protection from the onset of hyperinflation and financial implosion.\n\nSome are turning to bitcoin out of desperation as their bank deposits lose value almost by the day, while others are using the online currency for housekeeping such as funding family members studying abroad.\n\nThe result is startling. Bitcoin's BTC=BTSP global surge to a record high of $7,888 last week - a sevenfold increase since the start of the year - has been spectacular enough. But on Harare's bitcoin exchange, Golix (golix.io), the price hit $13,900, a 40-fold jump in the same period.\n\nWarnings abound internationally that bitcoin may be a bubble waiting to burst. But the dire state of the Zimbabwean financial system under President Robert Mugabe is encouraging risk-taking.\n\n“I have now changed all my reserves to bitcoin because that is the only way I can protect my investment,” said Arnold Manhizwa, who works for an IT and telecoms company in Harare.\n\nThe government adopted the U.S. dollar in 2009 after a bout of hyperinflation rendered the Zimbabwean dollar worthless, wiping out savings in the now defunct national currency.\n\nAfter a period of relative stability, acute shortages of dollar cash have set in, leaving Zimbabweans with electronic units in their bank accounts which are officially called dollars but have a far lower - and rapidly decreasing - value.\n\nIn January if they wanted to buy $100 in cash they had to transfer $120 out of their account to a seller on the parallel market. Now the price is $180 in what are nicknamed “zollars”.\n\nGRAPHIC: Devalued zollars tmsnrt.rs/2mwbtLU\n\nNearly all domestic transactions are made via debit card or transfers using mobile phones. But some economists estimate inflation is more than 50 percent a month in zollar terms, far from the official, dollar-calculated rate of 0.38 percent.\n\nZimbabweans are therefore piling into anything they think might retain value. Prices of cars, real estate and stocks have all soared, with the Harare bourse's main industrial index .INDZI doubling in the last two months.\n\nFor people like Manhizwa, a 34-year-old father of two, bitcoin is almost a safe-haven asset. “If I have $500 in the bank I won’t get it back and I will be losing value, but when I have my bitcoin it is going up every day,” he told Reuters.\n\nManhizwa, who participates in online chatrooms discussing cryptocurrencies, says he deposited $20 in bitcoin for his newly-born daughter a few months ago. Now it’s worth over $200. “If I put that money in a bank right now in Zimbabwe I will be left with nothing,” he said.\n\nCLEAR RISKS\n\nFILE PHOTO: People queue to withdraw money from a bank in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, March 8, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo\n\nGlobally, the value of all cryptocurrencies is more than $170 billion and bitcoin, the biggest and best-known, has outperformed all traditional currencies every year since 2011, except for 2014. But many international investors still view it as an opaque instrument used by gun-runners and drug-dealers on the Dark Web that should be avoided.\n\nThe risks are clear. After reaching the record peak, the international price of bitcoin slid over $1,000 in less than 48 hours last week. In Zimbabwe, the Golix exchange’s website showed at one point on Sunday that the price had tumbled below $11,000, a drop of around eight percent in 24 hours.\n\nBut all this has to be compared with the zollar. “Many people view bitcoin, despite its volatile nature, as a better store of value,” said in-house Golix cryptocurrency analyst Taurai Chinyamakobvu.\n\nThe same is true in other financially troubled countries such as Venezuela, where the currency has also been eroded by rocketing inflation, pushing bitcoin prices sharply higher.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, bitcoin’s attraction looks set to endure after Mugabe fired vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, paving the way for his wife, Grace, to get to the front of the queue to succeed the 93-year-old.\n\nMnangagwa had been given a mandate by Mugabe in 2015 to steer the economy and had backed former finance minister Patrick Chinamasa, who was trying to re-engage with foreign lenders such as the International Monetary Fund.\n\nFOREIGN PAYMENTS\n\nBesides acting as an inflation hedge, bitcoin’s attraction to Zimbabweans lies in the difficulty of making foreign payments due to banks capping or halting transactions by Mastercard and Visa cards.\n\nWith bitcoin, Zimbabweans can bypass the need to seek foreign currency from the bank, and can even buy goods or services from the growing number of overseas merchants that accept the digital currency.\n\nThe central bank, which has to approve official overseas transactions and prioritizes necessities such as fuel and medicines, has previously said Zimbabwe had a backlog of more than $500 million in pending foreign payments.\n\n“A software developer that wants to buy a software download would never get that prioritized by their bank. They can use bitcoin to make payments,” Golix said in response to Reuters questions. “Others use it to send funds to their children in schools outside the country.”\n\nSome better-off families send their sons and daughters for secondary and university education in countries such as South Africa or Britain but they are struggling to support them due to the currency shortage.\n\nGolix data shows it handled bitcoin transactions worth $1 million in October.\n\nBut it is a market from which foreigners are largely absent. Technically, overseas-based investors could buy bitcoin on the international market and sell them for almost twice the price in Zimbabwe. The snag is that payment would be in zollars.\n\nOne analyst who is setting up a bitcoin trading desk at a Harare bank acknowledged that the local price appeared attractive, but added: “Once foreigners sell their bitcoin, they won’t have a way of getting their money out.”"", 'The price of bitcoin appears to be stabilizing.\n\nAmid what has been a wild weekend in the crypto markets, BTC is now down just 5 percent in the last 24 hours to a value of $6,102. Yet, that number doesn\'t tell the whole story, as the cryptocurrency has been in the midst of heavy volatility after hitting a near three-week low below $5,600 earlier today.\n\nAs the charts show, the record rally from the September lows below $3,000 now appears to have topped out at $7,850 last week after a decision to abandon a controversial software upgrade triggered an unwinding of trading positions. The move appears to be sparking a migration of funds to alternative protocols, with bitcoin cash emerging as the primary beneficiary – effectively tripling in price since Thursday.\n\nSo far, the bitcoin sell-off appears for real as volumes jumped 61 percent yesterday. A high volume sell-off is often considered as a sign of ""panic,"" and the fact that Google search volumes revisited record highs further corroborates this view.\n\nSo, the question now is, how low can prices go?\n\nIf history is any guide, the current sell-off in bitcoin is likely to run out of steam below $5,000.\n\nCase I: Rally from July low to September high\n\nBitcoin chart\n\nThe rally topped out after the confirmation of the bearish relative strength index (RSI) divergence.\n\nThe sell-off ended around (marked by a circle) – 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level ($2,988) and below the 100-day MA.\n\nThe RSI was oversold as well (marked by a circle).\n\nCase II: Rally from April low to June high\n\nAgain, the rally ended after the confirmation of the bearish relative strength index (RSI) divergence.\n\nThe price drop came to a halt around (marked by a circle) – 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level ($1,702) & below the 100-day MA. The RSI was oversold as well (marked by a circle).\n\nIt is quite clear that:\n\nThe rally ends with a bearish price RSI divergence.\n\nThe sell-off comes to a halt around the 61.8 percent Fib and below the 100-day MA.\n\nWhere is the floor?\n\nThe current retreat in prices looks similar to Case I and Case II as the rally ended with a bearish price RSI divergence.\n\nBitcoin chart\n\nThe RSI is trending lower and well short of the oversold territory. Thus, there is potential for a continued sell-off.\n\nThe sharp recovery from the 50-day MA seen today indicates bitcoin could trade sideways for the next couple of days before resuming the drop.\n\nAs historical data shows, the current sell-off is likely to leave a major higher low around the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement ($4,855.59) and below the 100-day MA ($4,818). Over the next few days, the 100-day MA is seen sloping upwards to $5,000-$5,100 range.\n\nView\n\nPrices could trade sideways over the next few days.\n\nThe current sell-off could come to a halt around $4,900-$5,000.\n\nOnly a multiple 1-hour closes above $6,500 would warrant caution on the part of the aggressive bears.\n\nPrice action discussed below could be considered as a sign of a bullish trend reversal:\n\nA solid rebound from near 100-day MA & 61.8% Fibonacci retracement (as history suggests) or\n\nThe prices close today around $6,200 and tomorrow\'s candle ends beyond $6,900.\n\nCarpet tiles image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin cash, a rival that split from the original bitcoin in August, has jumped nearly 40% since Friday.\n\nBitcoin cash is gaining popularity because of its larger block size, a characteristic that makes transactions cheaper and faster than the original. When a faction of the cryptocurrency community cancelled plans to increase bitcoin’s block size on Wednesday — a move that would have created another offshoot — some supporters of bigger blocks rallied around bitcoin cash.\n\nSupporters of bitcoin’s technology upgrade are now switching support to bitcoin cash There’s a panic about what’s happening. People shouldn’t panic\n\nThe resulting volatility has been extreme even by bitcoin’s wild standards and comes amid growing interest in cryptocurrencies among regulators, banks and fund managers. While sceptics have called bitcoin’s rapid advance a bubble, it has become too big for many on Wall Street to ignore. Even after shrinking by as much as US$38bn since Wednesday, bitcoin boasts a market value of $101bn.\n\nSupporters of bitcoin’s technology upgrade “are now switching support to bitcoin cash”, said Mike Kayamori, head of Tokyo-based Quoine, the world’s second most active bitcoin exchange over the past day. “There’s a panic about what’s happening. People shouldn’t panic. Just hold on to both coins until we see how it plays out.”\n\nBitcoin’s slump dragged down shares of cryptocurrency-related companies, including Hong Kong-based PC Partner Group, maker of graphics cards that can be used in the mining of digital coins. But there were few signs of wider ripple effects. Asian stocks were mixed as investors awaited continuing talks on tax legislation in the US this week.\n\nNo upgrade\n\nThe cancellation of last week’s bitcoin upgrade has left users to choose between the two versions of the cryptocurrency. On one side is the original bitcoin, powered by so-called SegWit technology, which aims to improve its performance by moving unessential data off of its underlying blockchain. On the other side is bitcoin cash, which allows its blockchain to handle eight times as much data as the original.\n\nProponents of bitcoin cash believe their approach is simpler and closer to the original goal of bitcoin, which was described primarily as a payment system in its white paper. Supporters of the original bitcoin say that vision is too limited, and that by improving the blockchain with SegWit technology, bitcoin can become a new digital asset class that not only supports payments but countless other functions.\n\nWhile bitcoin cash has been around for months, it saw limited support as the community awaited last week’s technology upgrade for the original bitcoin\n\nWhile bitcoin cash has been around for months, it saw limited support as the community awaited last week’s technology upgrade for the original bitcoin, which promised similar features. Now that the upgrade has been called off, businesses that use the cryptocurrency primarily as a payment method are expected to increase adoption of bitcoin cash.\n\nWhile bitcoin cash surged over the weekend, it hasn’t been a straight line up. The cryptocurrency was trading at $1 325 at 11.53am in Hong Kong, down from a high of about $2 478 on Sunday, Coinmarketcap.com prices show.\n\nBitcoin has been similarly volatile; it initially rose after news that it would avoid another split, but the gains were short-lived. It’s now trading at $5 948 after touching a record $7 882 on Wednesday. — Reported by Justina Lee and Yuji Nakamura', 'Depending on who you ask, Bitcoin is a bubble, a fraud, a money-laundering vehicle, a volatile mess or a crucial, necessary phase in monetary evolution.\n\n[ibd-display-video id=2544553 width=50 float=left autostart=true]Still, the currency, down sharply on Friday and over the weekend before a partial rebound Monday morning, has skyrocketed in value this year.

The constant launching of new projects and token start-ups that are designed, either directly or indirectly, to help other projects see greater functionality and efficiency.\n\nTo this end, the so-called “maximalists” in the community would be better served to become “agnostics”; this is simply to say that there’s no point in hedging all your bets on one cryptocoin when so many chains will succeed together precisely in many cases because they work together.\n\nThis increasingly collaborative environment seems to indicate a cryptocurrency renaissance is much more likely than a cryptocurrency die-off over the next two decades.\n\nAs high-profile crypto venture capitalist Tim Draper put it in recent comments to the press, fiat currencies may soon go extinct as the number of cryptocurrencies—and their use-cases—explodes:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be so relevant […] there will be no reason to have the fiat currencies…They’re all going to interrelate […] and there will be exchange rates for all of them. My guess is that it will centralize around a wallet that you have, and when you pay for that Starbucks, your wallet will optimize to whichever currency has most value.”\n\nTo Draper, then, a future with thousands of cryptocurrencies working in unison seems exponentially more likely at this point than a future in which paper money endures for several more decades.\n\nRaiden & Ethereum and ChainLink & Confido\n\nAs cryptocurrencies that enhance other cryptocurrencies continue to proliferate, soon enough the crypto users of the world will behold an interconnected web of blockchains that will be used to bolster one another.\n\nFor example, consider the new ERC-20 token, Raiden (RDN). Raiden provides an off-chain scaling solution for Ethereum through creating what’s known as state-channels—transaction process zones that lie off-chain and can facilitate extremely affordable and nearly instantaneous microtransactions.\n\nIn a specific sense, then, Raiden “attaches” itself to bolster the performance of the Ethereum network, bolstering the value and utilities of both itself and Ethereum in the process.\n\nAlso, consider the case of Confido and ChainLink. Confido combines with ChainLink’s smart contract capabilities to make an innovative crypto escrow payment service that could gain a lot of traction in the coming years.\n\nThese are but two examples of what will be a seemingly limitless array of interconnected cryptos. This massive web of collaborative projects will boost the success of the entire space.', 'Bitcoin mining is a very common practice today with the price of the cryptocurrency soaring to over $7,000 earlier this month before settling back down in the $6,000 range. With prices soaring more and more people are getting into mining, there has been a marked effect not only on pricing and availability of video cards, but on electricity consumption as well. Most computer users simply plug in their PC and leave it connected never thinking about how much power that machine is slurping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Digiconmist, it would be profitable for Bitcoin miners to consume over 24 terawatt-hours of electricity annually as they try and mine the cryptocurrency. That is around as much electricity as the entire country of Nigeria uses in a year. When you break that down further, 215KWh of electricity is used by miners for each Bitcoin transaction made each day, and there are roughly 300,000 transactions per day.\n\nAnother way to look at the energy consumption is based on what the average home in the U.S. uses as far as electricity per month (The U.S. Energy Information Administration cites 897 kWh on average). That means that each Bitcoin transactions uses a bit less than a quarter of the electricity your average home consumes monthly. Globally, Bitcoin miners are consuming enough power to run about 2.26 million American homes.\n\nLooking at a global scale, Bitcoin mining represents at least 77KWh of energy consumed per Bitcoin transaction. One analyst says that the 215 KWh of electricity could run his home in the Netherlands for about two weeks. That same 215kWh of electricity could fill two Tesla batteries, run your refrigerator for a year, or boil 1872 liters of water.', 'According to a recent survey by Blockchain Capital, 1 out 3 Millennials would rather invest in Bitcoin than traditional stocks.\n\nIs the Stock Market Old-School for Millennials?\n\nMost millennials nowadays aren’t thinking about financial investments and savings yet. The stock market might not be the most popular topic for millennials, but social media apps like Snapchat and Instagram are. Data shows millennials aren’t investing as much in stocks and bonds like baby boomers do.\n\nA recent article in Barron’s states that most millennials prefer cash over stocks as investments. Experts are blaming this phenomenon on the famous dot-com bubble and the big stock market crash of 2008. Apparently, these major events are the reason why millennials aren’t trusting the stock market as their parents did. Stocks may seem too risky for most millennials, but some think that Bitcoin might be an alternative investment form for them.\n\nBitcoin over Stocks\n\nBitcoin has drawn a lot of attention over this year. Recently, the digital currency hit a new all-time high price of $7751 and a total market cap valuation of over $129 billion. As Bitcoin is rapidly growing, more and more traditional investors are looking to invest into the cryptocurrency. Some of these investors include young millennials.\n\nAccording to a new survey done by noted Bitcoin venture capital firm, Blockchain Capital, 27% of the questioned millennials would rather own $1,000 worth of Bitcoin than stocks. These results might not be as surprising as it seems since Bitcoin has outperformed every other future, commodity or stock this year. The survey also showed that 42% of the questioned millennials are familiar with Bitcoin, and 15% of people over 65 were somewhat familiar with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nA security called Bitcoin Investment Fund, that is tracking the bitcoin price, has already risen this year by as much as 661%. Experts believe that as Bitcoin ETFs officially become available, more and more people will start investing in the digital currency.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on millennials stance about the stock market and bitcoin?

11/13/2017,"[""Bitcoin is in recovery mode today.\n\nAs of writing, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is at $6,523, having reached a high of $6,559 so far. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has gained 3.54 percent in the last 24 hours.\n\nStill, chart analysis indicates that BTC has retraced 38.2 percent of the sell-off from Nov. 8 high to Nov. 12 low. That's when prices hit a two-and-a-half week low near $5,500 – a near 30 percent sell-off from last week's record highs.\n\nLargely believed to be triggered by the suspension of the Segwit2x hard fork, a software upgrade that might have brought a transactional boost for the cryptocurrency, investors had reportedly begun moving funds across to bitcoin cash (BCH) following its abandonment, resulting in a rally for the rival cryptocurrency.\n\nIn this way, the sharp recovery seen today has been accompanied by an equally sharp pullback for bitcoin cash, which rose more than 30 percent last week, and briefly overtook ethereum as the number two cryptocurrency by total value over the weekend.\n\nStill, it is too early to say that bitcoin prices have found a bottom.\n\nAs discussed yesterday, the price chart analysis shows the current pullback could find a bottom around $5,000 levels. The latest chart shows the prices have moved above the key trendline hurdle, but continued gains are less than certain.\n\nBitcoin chart\n\nThe above chart shows:\n\nThe trendline from the May. 15 low and Oct. 5 low is capping the recovery in BTC.\n\nThe 5-day MA and 10-day MA adopted a short-term bearish bias last week.\n\nThe relative strength index remains below 50.00 (in the bearish territory).\n\nOn the 4-hour time frame, the 50-DMA has adopted a bearish bias, while the 100-MA is moving sideways (neutral).\n\nView\n\nA move above 5-day MA of $6,482 is likely to be short-lived.\n\nAs noted yesterday, BTC is likely to trade sideways in the short-run, before resuming the sell-off and eventually finding a floor around $5,000 levels.\n\nOnly a close today above $6,900 would signal a revival of the bull market.\n\nTrading chart image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The fork is a change to the decentralized currency’s consensus rules and aims to upgrade the network’s Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA).\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin.com Wallet Celebrates 500,000 Downloads in Three Months\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash Network Has Successfully Hard Forked\n\nNovember 13 is a memorable day for bitcoin cash supporters, as the network is forking in order to fix the BCH blockchain’s DAA. The primary development teams who have been working on the bitcoin cash protocol consensus change include Bitcoin ABC, Unlimited, Nchain, and XT developers. The original DAA applied to the BCH network allowed the currency to thrive but also produced wild hashrate fluctuations. After several DAA proposals were researched and tested by the above-mentioned development teams, the community chose to implement a DAA proposal from Bitcoin ABC’s lead developer Amaury Sechet.\n\nThe new BCH consensus change hopes to adjust the difficulty to hashrate to target a mean block interval of 600 seconds. Alongside this, the DAA aims to make sudden difficulty drops and spikes avoidable. For instance, the network will adjust difficulty rapidly when the hashrate changes exponentially, while also avoiding feedback oscillations. Sechet’s DAA is based on a 144-period simple moving average according to the ABC team.\n\n“The difficulty is adjusted each block, based on the amount of work done and the elapsed time of the previous 144 blocks,” explains the Bitcoin ABC development team.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash DAA Should Keep Block Times Consistent and the Mining Ecosystem Honest\n\nEssentially the consensus change means the new DAA should keep block times stable and consistent at roughly 10 minutes per block. So far this goal of 10-minute block intervals has come to fruition. Now that the fork has happened BCH network participants will wait and see what happens with miners who have been hopping back and forth between two chains. Many BCH supporters believe this will level the playing field and from here on out, as the BTC and BCH competition should be fair without any miners gaming the system.\n\nMiners will now have to choose the best solution and be more confident in the chain they are targeting. Both cryptocurrencies market values will be weighed heavily as the price will have more of an impact on the mining profitability for both networks. At the moment, one bitcoin cash is trading at just above $1300 per BCH, and BCH mining profitability has been on parity with BTC for the last hour. Presently it is 2 percent more profitable to mine on the bitcoin cash chain.\n\nOverall bitcoin cash supporters seem very pleased with the successful DAA upgrade, but it will take some time to see its full progression. For now, many BCH supporters continue to believe in the cryptocurrency’s ultimate goal of becoming a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This week a great number of early BTC adopters vouched for the BCH protocol as a store of value and means of exchange.\n\nNews.Bitcoin.com will be following the network change closely and will keep our readers informed of any upcoming developments concerning this hard fork.\n\nWhat do you think about the bitcoin cash network’s hard fork? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nImages via Bitcoincash.org, Coin Dance, and the Bitcointalk user Mjbmonetarymetals\n\nNeed to calculate your bitcoin holdings?

Since then, Bitcoin price has stabilized at $6,450, recording a daily increase of around $890.\n\nTriggered by the sell-off of major Bitcoin investors and the rapid surge in the value of Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin price plunged over the past weekend. However, as expected, Bitcoin price recovered relatively quickly as the Bitcoin Cash price declined from over $2,800 to $1,200.\n\nShort-term indicators for Bitcoin price increase\n\nThe sell-off of large sums of Bitcoin in the past few days led to a domino effect, wherein traders started to panic selling their Bitcoin in fear of market uncertainty and a major Bitcoin price correction. Consequently, the daily trading volume of both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash surpassed the $10 bln mark, for the first time in history.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin has demonstrated several times in the past year, it has recovered significantly faster than most analysts had expected in the short-term to around $6,500.\n\nHistorically, after achieving a new all-time high, Bitcoin tends to correct itself to the point that is higher than the previous all-time high and initiate a new rally to achieve a new all-time high. For instance, when Bitcoin price achieved a new all-time high at $4,500 earlier this year, it corrected itself to around $3,300 and initiated a new rally which allowed it to climb to the $5,000 region.\n\nA similar trend will likely occur in the upcoming weeks with the US market. The second largest Bitcoin market behind Japan is highly optimistic in regards to the entrance of institutional and retail investors into the Bitcoin market, alongside tens of billions of dollars in new funds.\n\nCME Group and CBOE, two of the largest options exchange domestically and globally, will launch Bitcoin futures exchanges by the end of 2017, to provide an infrastructure and sufficient liquidity to institutional investors.\n\nPreviously, Mike Novogratz, the billionaire hedge fund legend, revealed that a herd of institutional investors are preparing to engage in Bitcoin trading. Such movement will be made possible with the launch of large-scale Bitcoin futures exchanges approved by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin futures exchanges by CFTC is fundamentally different than the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March of 2017 because the CFTC has already approved LedgerX to operate as a Bitcoin derivatives, options and futures exchange for retail investors. Thus, the approval of CME Group and CBOE to launch Bitcoin futures exchanges is guaranteed and is not conditional.\n\nBillions of money on the sidelines to come to Bitcoin\n\nThrough strictly regulated Bitcoin futures exchanges, the so-called “money on the sidelines” invested in offshore banking accounts, wealth management products (WMPs) and traditional assets will migrate to Bitcoin in the mid-term. As Novogratz explained:\n\n“I can hear the herd coming. I was just in San Francisco, met with a few big institutional investors and their still a ways away but they’re coming. Lots of funds are being raised and so I’m pretty confident to say that it [Bitcoin price] is going higher.”\n\nSuch movement will allow Bitcoin price to achieve new highs before the end of 2017 and potentially gear towards the $10,000 mid-term price target of highly regarded financial analyst Max Keiser.', 'Residents line up to transfer and withdraw money from a bank in Harare, Zimbabwe, in March 2017.\n\n—For most investors around the world, bitcoin is a volatile and highly speculative bet. For Zimbabweans, however, the cryptocurrency seems to offer rare protection from the onset of hyperinflation and financial implosion.\n\nSome are turning to bitcoin out of desperation as their bank deposits lose value almost by the day, while others are using the online currency for housekeeping such as funding family members studying abroad.\n\nThe result is startling. Bitcoin\'s global surge to a record high of $7,888 last week – a sevenfold increase since the start of the year – has been spectacular enough. But on Harare\'s bitcoin exchange, Golix, the price hit $13,900, a 40-fold jump in the same period.\n\nWarnings abound internationally that bitcoin may be a bubble waiting to burst. But the dire state of the Zimbabwean financial system under President Robert Mugabe is encouraging risk-taking.\n\n""I have now changed all my reserves to bitcoin because that is the only way I can protect my investment,"" said Arnold Manhizwa, who works for an IT and telecoms company in Harare.\n\nThe government adopted the US dollar in 2009 after a bout of hyperinflation rendered the Zimbabwean dollar worthless, wiping out savings in the now defunct national currency.\n\nAfter a period of relative stability, acute shortages of dollar cash have set in, leaving Zimbabweans with electronic units in their bank accounts which are officially called dollars but have a far lower – and rapidly decreasing – value.\n\nIn January if they wanted to buy $100 in cash they had to transfer $120 out of their account to a seller on the parallel market. Now the price is $180 in what are nicknamed ""zollars.""\n\nNearly all domestic transactions are made via debit card or transfers using mobile phones. But some economists estimate inflation is more than 50 percent a month in zollar terms, far from the official, dollar-calculated rate of 0.38 percent.\n\nZimbabweans are therefore piling into anything they think might retain value. Prices of cars, real estate, and stocks have all soared, with the Harare bourse\'s main industrial index doubling in the past two months.\n\nFor people like Mr. Manhizwa, a father of two, bitcoin is almost a safe-haven asset. ""If I have $500 in the bank I won\'t get it back and I will be losing value, but when I have my bitcoin it is going up every day,"" he told Reuters.\n\nManhizwa, who participates in online chatrooms discussing cryptocurrencies, says he deposited $20 in bitcoin for his newly born daughter a few months ago. Now it\'s worth over $200. ""If I put that money in a bank right now in Zimbabwe I will be left with nothing,"" he said.\n\nGlobally, the value of all cryptocurrencies is more than $170 billion and bitcoin, the biggest and best-known, has outperformed all traditional currencies every year since 2011, except for 2014. But many international investors still view it as an opaque instrument used by gun-runners and drug-dealers on the Dark Web that should be avoided.\n\nThe risks are clear. After reaching the record peak, the international price of bitcoin slid over $1,000 in less than 48 hours last week. In Zimbabwe, the Golix exchange\'s website showed at one point on Sunday that the price had tumbled below $11,000, a drop of around eight percent in 24 hours.\n\nBut all this has to be compared with the zollar. ""Many people view bitcoin, despite its volatile nature, as a better store of value,"" said in-house Golix cryptocurrency analyst Taurai Chinyamakobvu.\n\nThe same is true in other financially troubled countries such as Venezuela, where the currency has also been eroded by rocketing inflation, pushing bitcoin prices sharply higher.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, bitcoin\'s attraction looks set to endure after Mr. Mugabe fired vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, paving the way for his wife, Grace, to get to the front of the queue to succeed Mugabe.\n\nMr. Mnangagwa had been given a mandate by Mugabe in 2015 to steer the economy and had backed former finance minister Patrick Chinamasa, who was trying to re-engage with foreign lenders such as the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBesides acting as an inflation hedge, bitcoin\'s attraction to Zimbabweans lies in the difficulty of making foreign payments due to banks capping or halting transactions by Mastercard and Visa cards.\n\nWith bitcoin, Zimbabweans can bypass the need to seek foreign currency from the bank, and can even buy goods or services from the growing number of overseas merchants that accept the digital currency.\n\nThe central bank, which has to approve official overseas transactions and prioritizes necessities such as fuel and medicines, has previously said Zimbabwe had a backlog of more than $500 million in pending foreign payments.\n\n""A software developer that wants to buy a software download would never get that prioritized by their bank. They can use bitcoin to make payments,"" Golix said in response to Reuters questions. ""Others use it to send funds to their children in schools outside the country.""\n\nSome better-off families send their sons and daughters for secondary and university education in countries such as South Africa or Britain but they are struggling to support them due to the currency shortage.\n\nGolix data shows it handled bitcoin transactions worth $1 million in October.\n\nBut it is a market from which foreigners are largely absent. Technically, overseas-based investors could buy bitcoin on the international market and sell them for almost twice the price in Zimbabwe. The snag is that payment would be in zollars.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\nOne analyst who is setting up a bitcoin trading desk at a Harare bank acknowledged that the local price appeared attractive, but added: ""Once foreigners sell their bitcoin, they won\'t have a way of getting their money out.""\n\nThis story was reported by Reuters.', ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mike Novogratz, the former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group who has joined the mad dash for crypto-currencies, said on Monday that mainstream institutional investors are about six to eight months from adopting bitcoin.\n\nNovogratz said he expects major financial firms will soon start to offer bitcoin or similar products as an investment option, one that could be easily purchased over the phone.\n\nA turning-point product from a big financial firm could arrive within six months, he said, though he declined to name a specific company.\n\n“When it’s that easy, the price of bitcoin or ethereum is going to go much higher. And that is a lot closer than people think,” said Novogratz, who spoke at the Reuters Global 2018 Investment Outlook Summit in New York.\n\nNovogratz is now chief executive of Galaxy Investment Partners, a firm that bets on cryptocurrencies and related businesses.\n\n“The institutionalization of this space is coming. It’s coming pretty quick,” he said.\n\nFor the most part though, institutional investors have stayed away from bitcoin BTC=BTSP, the original and largest crypto-currency in terms of market capitalization, despite outperforming all the world's traditional currencies.\n\nTraditional investors still view bitcoin as opaque and highly speculative with potential to collapse even though so far this year bitcoin has soared nearly 580 percent.\n\nBitcoin surged on Monday to $6,487, recovering more than $1,000 after losing almost a third of its value in less than four days as traders bought back into the volatile cryptocurrency.\n\nIt hit a record peak last week just shy of $8,000.\n\nDuring the latest pullback over the weekend though, Novogratz said he bought $15 million to $20 million worth of bitcoins.\n\nEarly enthusiasts for the crypto-currency were drawn to its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. The risks of dealing in bitcoin were laid bare in 2013 when Tokyo-based exchange Mt Gox collapsed after admitting it had lost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds.\n\nThe currency’s earlier ties to gambling and criminal websites did not endear it to traditional investors.\n\nBut bitcoin has since overcome some of those challenges. “We’re past that,” he said.\n\nBIGGEST REGRET FOR 2017\n\nNovogratz’s biggest regret this year has been not buying more cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, when prices fell, because he knew that they would keep going up.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nEthereum is another public blockchain, essentially a shared database, similar to that of bitcoin. Ethereum’s token is called ether.\n\nHe felt that he made a psychological mistake, comparing the original price he paid to ethereum’s value over the summer. “When it was time to buy it back, I didn’t buy enough back,” he said.\n\nHe sees bitcoin, for instance, hitting $10,000 by March.\n\nThe former Fortress executive recently created his own crypto-hedge fund, putting in about $100 million of his own money. He hopes to raise about $500 million, making it the largest fund of its kind.\n\nNovogratz said Galaxy’s largest investment is in bitcoin. It has a “very big” holding of ethereum and about 30-35 different tokens and companies. He declined to give the percentages of each holding, citing competitive reasons.\n\nOne of those investments is in the token sale of Worldwide Asset Exchange, an online marketplace for so-called “skins,” which are essentially virtual accessories of video game characters. The total market for “skins” is $50 billion.\n\nThe skins don’t have much application except to change how a character or a weapon looks.\n\nHe is also an investor in FunFair, a decentralized gaming platform.\n\nFORTRESS EXIT\n\nNovogratz, a former Princeton University wrestler, U.S. Army helicopter pilot, and Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) partner, is best known as a swaggering “macro” investor in the mold of George Soros who made big wagers on global economic movements.\n\nNovogratz worked at Fortress from 2002 to 2015, where he was a principal and ran its macro hedge funds. They grew to manage billions of dollars and made “Novo” a Wall Street star. But the funds were shut in 2015 following investment losses. Novogratz retired from the firm.\n\n“Very few people have graceful exits from Wall Street. Mine wasn’t as graceful as I would have liked,” he told Reuters.\n\nAfter Fortress, Novogratz planned to focus running his own money and avoid the complications of external investors. But he fell in love with the promise of blockchain technology after successfully investing in bitcoin, ethereum and other assets.\n\nHe has quickly become one of the most prominent advocates of blockchain and has been working to convince larger, more conservative asset managers to get involved.\n\n“It’s potentially wildly disruptive and revolutionary,” Novogratz said.\n\nFor other news from Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit, see: here"", 'Bitcoin is on an exceptionally wild ride.\n\nThe digital currency gained as much as $920 on Monday, before losing some ground to trade near $6,500.

A rival cryptocurrency that split from Bitcoin in August dubbed ‘Bitcoin Cash’ surged past the $2000 price point on Sunday and briefly overtook Ethereum as the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. In turn, Bitcoin took a knock, shedding as much as 29% in value, erasing around $38bn. On Monday, Bitcoin started recovering while Bitcoin Cash was trading at the $1250 mark. At the centre of the dramatic swing is a raging scaling debate within the community. Last week, a group within the Bitcoin community abandoned its push for an update to the cryptocurrency that would ensure faster transaction speeds called ‘Segwit2x’. The drop of the Segwit2x plan means that there’s no solution to Bitcoin’s scaling problems: Currently, it can take hours and even up to a day for a Bitcoin transaction to be completed. Bitcoin Cash, meanwhile, allows for up to eight times more data processing on its blockchain and faster transactions. Prior to last week, Bitcoin Cash was on the fringes of the cryptocurrency world, but the awakening around transactions speeds could spark off a new era in cryptocurrencies where developers seek to ramp up the ability for people to use these currencies in their everyday lives. – Gareth van Zyl\n\nBy Justina Lee and Yuji Nakamura\n\n(Bloomberg) — Bitcoin slumped as the cancellation of a technology upgrade prompted some users to switch out of the cryptocurrency, spooking speculators who had profited from a more than 500 percent surge this year.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has dropped 5.6 percent since late Friday, and at one point extended its slide from last week’s record to as much as 29 percent. Bitcoin cash, a rival that split from the original bitcoin in August, has jumped 32 percent since Friday, according to data compiled by Coinmarketcap.com.\n\nBitcoin cash is gaining popularity because of its larger block size, a characteristic that makes transactions cheaper and faster than the original. When a faction of the cryptocurrency community canceled plans to increase bitcoin’s block size on Wednesday — a move that would have created another offshoot — some supporters of bigger blocks rallied around bitcoin cash.\n\nThe resulting volatility has been extreme even by bitcoin’s wild standards and comes amid growing interest in cryptocurrencies among regulators, banks and fund managers. While skeptics have called bitcoin’s rapid advance a bubble, it has become too big for many on Wall Street to ignore. Even after shrinking by as much as $38 billion since Wednesday, bitcoin boasts a market value of $105 billion.\n\nSupporters of bitcoin’s technology upgrade “are now switching support to bitcoin cash,” said Mike Kayamori, head of Tokyo-based Quoine, the world’s second most-active bitcoin exchange over the past day. “There’s a panic about what’s happening. People shouldn’t panic. Just hold on to both coins until we see how it plays out.”\n\nBitcoin’s slump dragged down shares of cryptocurrency-related companies, including Hong Kong-based PC Partner Group Ltd., maker of graphics cards that can be used in the mining of digital coins. But there were few signs of wider ripple effects. Asian stocks were mixed as investors awaited continuing talks on tax legislation in the U.S. this week.\n\nThe cancellation of last week’s bitcoin upgrade has left users to choose between the two versions of the cryptocurrency. On one side is the original bitcoin, powered by so-called SegWit technology, which aims to improve its performance by moving unessential data off of its underlying blockchain. On the other side is bitcoin cash, which allows its blockchain to handle eight times as much data as the original.\n\nProponents of bitcoin cash believe their approach is simpler and closer to the original goal of bitcoin, which was described primarily as a payment system in its white paper. Supporters of the original bitcoin say that vision is too limited, and that by improving the blockchain with SegWit technology, bitcoin can become a new digital asset class that not only supports payments but countless other functions.\n\nWhile bitcoin cash has been around for months, it saw limited support as the community awaited last week’s technology upgrade for the original bitcoin, which promised similar features. Now that the upgrade has been called off, businesses that use the cryptocurrency primarily as a payment method are expected to increase adoption of bitcoin cash.\n\nWhile bitcoin cash surged over the weekend, it hasn’t been a straight line up. The cryptocurrency was trading at $1,246 at 7:54 a.m. in London, down from a high of about $2,478 on Sunday, Coinmarketcap.com prices show.\n\nBitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will coexist and serve different use cases, just like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its not a zero sum game. Work on building your project, not on destroying the other — Andreas (@aantonop) November 12, 2017\n\nBitcoin has been similarly volatile; it initially rose after news that it would avoid another split, but the gains were short-lived. It’s now trading at $6,242 after touching a record $7,882 on Wednesday.\n\nVolume across bitcoin exchanges jumped to 436,021 bitcoins on Sunday, the highest since September, Bitcoinity.org data show. BitMEX, an exchange for cryptocurrency derivatives that allows shorting, saw record activity on Sunday, Chief Executive Officer Arthur Hayes said.\n\n“Crypto trading is not for the novice investor,” said John Spallanzani, chief macro strategist at GFI Securities LLC in New York.', 'It is a while since I have written about Bitcoin, but I continue to be fascinated by it. In particular, by Bitcoin’s ability to endure and continue serenely on in the face of all manner of controversies and headwinds.\n\nPossible Outcomes\n\nI have a long-held view there are only two possible outcomes for Bitcoin – it will either disappear, or it will become mainstream as a digital asset (a new asset class). There are many who wish it to disappear and write or speak out to promote this view, but in this blog I examine what mainstream Bitcoin might look like.\n\nIn this scenario, there are a range of possibilities - at one end Bitcoin is primarily a store-of-value, and at the other end, Bitcoin is a high volume payment system.\n\nEconomics\n\nBefore explaining these, I will first recap Bitcoin economics with some figures.\n\nMiners are the backbone of the Bitcoin network. They compete to generate Bitcoin blocks and validate transactions, costing them huge sums in computing hardware and electricity costs. They get rewarded in bitcoins for each block they generate, and for each transaction they validate. While the block reward is fixed, currently 12.5 bitcoins per block, transaction fees are set by the sender and need to be sufficient for a miner to make the effort to validate the transaction.\n\nIn the 12 months to 10 Nov 2017, miners created about 55,000 blocks and validated about 100 million transactions. This earned them an astonishing $1.8 billion in revenue, of which about 11%, or $205m was in transaction fees, the rest in block rewards.\n\nTwo Key Factors\n\nComing back to the spectrum of possibilities for mainstream Bitcoin, there are two key factors to consider.\n\nOne is the block reward which halves approximately every four years, reducing to 6.25 bitcoins per block around mid 2020, then again to 3.125 bitcoins per block around mid-2024 and so on. The other is the current limit on capacity, which the network has already reached, at around 100 million transactions per year.\n\nThe block halving means that miners revenue will also halve every four years unless the price of Bitcoin increases to compensate, or unless the capacity limit is increased so that more transactions are processed, generating more transaction fees.\n\nImplications\n\nTo examine our two scenarios with these factors in mind, we need to make some assumptions. The current Bitcoin price is around $6,500, which if sustained, would give miners around $5 billion in revenue over the next 12 months, including about $500 million in transaction fees at the current average rate of $5 per transaction.\n\nIf we assume that $5 billion (sic – that would be the value of the 695,000 bitcoins to be mined over the next 12 months at $6,500 each, plus transaction fees) is the steady state annual running cost of the network, then for the store-of-value scenario to materialise, the Bitcoin price will have to rise to achieve this with each block-halving, for example I calculate to around $26,000 in 2024, $52,000 in 2028 and so on. Alternatively, if $6,500 becomes the steady price in the payment system scenario and we assume the transaction limit problem is solved with limitless capacity, then block revenue would only be $1 billion from 2024, and transaction revenue would have to rise to around $4 billion, or 80% of revenue. Assuming a transaction fee of 5 cents (the average value in 2015 before the capacity limit was hit), that would equate to around 80 billion transactions per year.\n\nClearly these assumptions will turn out differently, little is steady in the Bitcoin domain, but they serve to support this illustration for each end of the spectrum of outcomes for Bitcoin, should it become mainstream.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn my view, it is difficult to believe that the store-of-value outcome is sustainable, as the price of Bitcoin will have to keep doubling every four years for the miners to keep the network running, but with no clear reason to do so other than the increasing price, a virtuous circle that surely would have to end at some point. This highlights that for Bitcoin to endure, the capacity problem must be solved, and the network must start to be used for high volume payment transactions. With the Segwit2x capacity improvement cancelled this week, the day when this problem is solved appears to be looking more and more distant.\n\nHowever, this story will continue to unfold in unforeseen ways, and as ever will be fascinating to watch.', 'Bitcoin, the red-hot digital currency known for its volatile price, was on a wild ride this weekend.\n\nBitcoin crashed more than 25% from its all-time high of $7,721 set Wednesday to a low of $5,617 per coin on Sunday, according to data from cryptocurrency watcher CoinDesk.\n\nBitcoin cash, on the other hand, propelled to a record-high of $2,500 early Sunday morning.\n\nTrading volumes on Sunday peaked at over $26 billion, according to cryptocurrency data site CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nThat\'s higher than the 5-day average trading volume for some US equity exchanges.\n\nBitcoin, the red-hot digital currency, had a wild weekend and that appears to have translated into record-breaking trading volumes across the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin crashed more than 25% from Wednesday\'s all-time high of $7,721 to a low of $5,617 Sunday. Bitcoin cash, the rival clone of bitcoin, witnessed an impressive rally that propelled the coin to a record-high of $2,500 early Sunday morning.\n\n24-hour trading volumes for cryptocurrencies reached a record high above $26 billion on Sunday, according to data site CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nTo put that in perspective, that is higher than the 5-day average trading volumes for two US stock exchanges. Both IEX, the upstart exchange based in New York, and the Chicago Stock Exchange averaged less than $10 billion in trading each day for the last five days, according to data by Cboe Global Markets.\n\nIEX saw $7.8 billion worth of shares exchange on its venue, whereas CHX saw $3.1 billion in trading volumes.\n\nNew York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, on the other hand, saw more than $50 billion worth of shares exchange daily on average over the last 5 trading days.\n\nStill, the record cryptocurrency volumes over the weekend indicate the growing interest in the red-hot market, which until very recently has rarely witnessed daily trading volumes over $10 billion.\n\nIn an October 16 note to clients, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said cryptocurrencies present a $1.6 billion opportunity for Wall Street. The figure was based on the assumption that cryptocurrency volumes end up at about 10% of current fiat currency trading volumes. Here\'s the bank:\n\n""The FX market is highly liquid. For example, spot FX volumes were $1.65tr as of the most recent BIT Triennial survey in April 2016. If these volumes were to materialize, with the same relationship between spot market and futures, and the same revenue per contract, the revenue pool would be about $1.6bn.""\n\nAlready, exchange giants Cboe and CME are looking to capitalize on the nascent space. They have both announced they are preparing to launch bitcoin futures products in the near term.\n\nHigher volumes, according to Bank of America, could help legitimize cryptocurrencies across Wall Street, which still remains widely skeptical of their credibility.\n\nMany top Wall Streeters have derided bitcoin, for instance, as a vehicle used mainly by criminals.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News, Larry Fink, the head of the largest investor in the world, BlackRock said the explosive growth of bitcoin points to ""how much money laundering is being done in the world.""\n\nAnd JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon once said bitcoin was only useful for murderers and drug dealers.', ""The cryptocurrency craze has been a major tailwind for both Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). However, should cryptocurrency lose favor among investors, one analyst says AMD may have much more to lose.\n\nThe Analyst\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore maintains an Underweight rating and $8 price target for AMD stock and an Equal-Weight rating and $222 target for Nvidia.\n\nThe Thesis\n\nAMD and Nvidia have been two of the hottest stocks on Wall Street in recent years, and surprise GPU demand from cryptocurrency miners has been largely responsible. According to Moore, that demand boost was likely only temporary, and could drop off significantly in 2018.\n\nMoore said that, contrary to popular belief, bitcoin is irrelevant to graphics vendors because it moved to application-specific integrated circuit chips several years ago. Instead, most graphics-based mining is being driven by bitcoin rival Ethereum at this point.\n\n“We believe that total graphics sales for Ethereum mining in 2017 will be $800 mn or so, and will decline by 50% in 2018; we can validate the 2017 number by looking at the increased complexity of the algorithm,” Moore said.\n\nAMD Risks\n\nWhile Nvidia has clearly defined its exposure to the cryptocurrency market and has assured investors that its projections incorporate downside risks, Moore said AMD has been tight-lipped about its cryptocurrency risks.\n\nMoore says Ethereum mining is down 80 percent in the past four months and that it will soon shift to a technology called the Casper “hard fork,” that will render current Ethereum mining hardware obsolete.\n\nUnless demand for other currencies picks up, it could be bad news for investors.\n\nPrice Action\n\nAMD stock traded lower by 2.5 percent on Monday, while Nvidia shares dipped 1.3 percent.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nA Look At Bitcoin's Weekend Crash\n\nWhat Wall Street Thinks Of Nvidia's Huge Quarter""]"
11/14/2017,"[""Bitcoin's price is holding its ground so far today.\n\nAs of writing, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands for $6,495, as per the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. According to CoinMarketCap, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate has dropped by 1.74 percent in the last 24 hours.\n\nStill, the small decrease hides the fact that BTC retraced more than 50 percent of its recent sell-off yesterday. In the time since, the downside has been capped around $6,400, while a ceiling has formed around $6,800.\n\nSo is the short-term bottom in place?\n\nMonday's sharp recovery and the overnight resilience suggests that the rumored rotation of money out of bitcoin and into bitcoin cash and other alternative currencies may have largely come to a halt. However, it seems the market is still pricing in the recent suspension of the Segwit2x hard fork and and redetermining the value of competing protocols.\n\nFurther, the price action analysis indicates the bears need to push bitcoin below the 5-day moving average by today's close to avoid losing control.\n\nBitcoin chart\n\nThe above chart shows:\n\nDespite the sharp recovery from near $5,500 levels, the chart still favors the bears, given the descending 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) may have moved above 50.00 (bullish territory), but lacks directional strength.\n\nHowever, BTC moved back above the ascending trend line (drawn from the Sep. 15 low and Oct. 10 low) yesterday and is holding the trendline today. This is a cause of concern for the bears.\n\nView\n\nThe longer prices stay above the trendline, the lower will be the odds of history repeating itself, (i.e. prices resuming sell-off and eventually finding a bottom around $5,000). A fresh rally towards record highs could be seen if prices hold above the rising trend line till the weekend.\n\nA bearish move is likely to gather pace during the week ahead if prices close today below the 5-day MA (currently at $6,392).\n\nA move above the 10-day MA is likely to be short-lived, given the descending nature of the moving average.\n\n4-hour chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the 50-MA has topped out and is about to cross the 100-MA from upside (bearish crossover).\n\nAgain, the descending 50-MA and a potential bearish crossover is likely to ensure that a move above $6,850 is temporary.\n\nBoat at anchor image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

At 14:48 UTC, bitcoin was trading at $6,559.10, more or less unchanged from its price 24 hours ago.\n\nBitcoin cash, which rose over the weekend and plunged Monday, gained in trading. As of this writing, it was trading at $1326.96, up 11.25% in the last 24 hours. That figure represents a drop of approximately 47% from its weekend highs.\n\nEthereum Classic was the second-biggest gainer in the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies. It rose by 10.81% to $17.22. The total market capitalization for cryptocurrencies was $207 billion at 14:50 UTC, an increase of 1.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe sideways movement in bitcoin’s price is significant, especially since it comes in wake of a Bitcoin Cash hard fork that was designed to make it more profitable to mine the cryptocurrency as compared to bitcoin. (See also: How November\'s Hard Fork Affects Bitcoin Miners.)\n\nPer latest data, bitcoin still accounts for more than 50% of the overall hashrate or network capacity in its blockchain. In turn, this means the numbers of bitcoin being mined in the cryptocurrency’s blockchain network is greater than those for bitcoin cash. In recent times, miners had spoken out in favor of deploying their systems to mine bitcoin as opposed to bitcoin cash. (See also: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?)\n\nAlso, CME Group Chairman Terry Duffy has told CNBC that the trading exchange may introduce Bitcoin Futures during the first week of December. That move may serve to smooth out volatility in bitcoin’s price. “If the market drops precipitously, we’ll stop trading,"" he said. ""And if we think a product is going away, we have the longs, we have the shorts; we’ll match them up at a price, and that’s the way our rules read today.""\n\nA Future Spike?\n\nIn the meanwhile, a spike may be on the cards for bitcoin in the near future. According to a CNBC report, which cites data from Genesis Global Trading, the price for bitcoin could move up by as much as 61.5% by the end of four weeks. Genesis analyzed bitcoin’s recent price history and found that each time the cryptocurrency has fallen by more than 20 percent this year, it has gained an average of 28 percent in the following two weeks.', ""Although I don?t have plans to invest in Bitcoin at this point, I do believe there is a strong probability that the cryptocurrency could climb to a new high before Christmas.

Kay Van-Peterson from Saxo Bank believes this could happen in the space of 10 years if cryptocurrencies can grow to account for 10% of the average daily volumes (ADV) of fiat currency trade. Van-Petersen, according to CNBC, estimates that Bitcoin could account for 35% of this, giving it an ADV of US$175 billion. At 10x ADV, Bitcoin would have a market cap of US$1.75 trillion. Divided by an estimated 17 million Bitcoin, this equates to a price of just over US$100,000 per coin.\n\nRisk events.\n\nAlthough gold is still by far the number one destination for many investors during risk events, more and more investors are now turning to Bitcoin as a safe haven. I believe that as the correlation between Bitcoin rises and risk events strengthens, even more investors will start to utilise the cryptocurrency. And although tensions in Korea appear to have cooled, should they flare up I think the Bitcoin price will be one to watch.\n\nAdoption.\n\nAlthough companies such as Digitalx Ltd (ASX: DCC) are intent on bringing Bitcoin to the masses through ICOs and Bitcoin ATMs, right now most consumers don’t come across Bitcoin in their day-to-day lives. But this could change very quickly if a retail giant such as Amazon were to start to accept it as a form of payment. The e-commerce giant has recently registered some web domains that include popular cryptocurrency names. For example, Amazonbitcoin.com redirects through to its Amazon.com website. However, this may be less about it accepting it as a payment and more about protecting its business name from those looking to leverage it.\n\nFoolish Takeaway.\n\nOverall, I think it is very likely that the Bitcoin price will continue to climb higher and higher over the next few months. However, it does carry an enormous amount of risk and should be handled very carefully.\n\nI would suggest that anyone looking to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency limits it to just a small part of their portfolio."", 'Man Group, a UK-based investment management firm, said it would include bitcoin in its ""investment universe"" if bitcoin futures successfully launch.\n\nCME, the world\'s largest exchange group, said it would launch a bitcoin futures product by year-end.\n\nSuch a product could open the door to more traditional Wall Street firms entering the bitcoin market.\n\n\n\nOne of the largest hedge funds in the world might hop on the bitcoin trade.\n\nLuke Ellis, the CEO of Man Group, the UK-based investor with $103.5 billion in funds under management, said the firm would include bitcoin in its ""investment universe"" if bitcoin futures successfully launch, according to a Reuters report.\n\nEllis said during the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in the UK that cryptocurrencies ""are an interesting thing.""\n\n""It’s not part of our investment universe today – it could be,"" Ellis said.

And that is a lot closer than people think. The institutionalization of this space is coming. It\'s coming pretty quick.”\n\n$10,000 interim Bitcoin price target of Novogratz\n\nLast month, Novogratz, who has shifted his funds and venture from the traditional finance sector to the cryptocurrency market, revealed his interim or mid-term price target of Bitcoin at $10,000.\n\nThe basis of the price target of Novogratz was established by several indicators including the Metcalfe’s law, a widely acknowledged metric which has been utilized to measure the growth rate of communication networks like Facebook, and the likelihood of the entrance of institutional investors and retail traders into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin price has been extremely volatile, primarily due to the abrupt cancellation of the SegWit2x hard fork and the rise in popularity of Bitcoin Cash, which has become the main beneficiary of the SegWit2x hard fork termination.\n\nBut, Bitcoin price has been recovering with optimism surrounding CME Group’s launch of a Bitcoin futures exchange and the infrastructure Wall Street hedge funds, investment firms and exchanges have been building around Bitcoin to provide more liquidity to large-scale investors.\n\nEarlier today on Nov. 14, Multicoin Capital Managing Partner Kyle Samani revealed that he had met with an institutional investor with a $30 bln fund. The investor disclosed the fact that fund managers within the company are restricted to issuing checks with the minimum value or $300 mln.\n\n“More. Just met with an institutional manager. $30 bln fund. Minimum check size $300 mln. Current crypto allocation: $0. We aren\'t even close to the top,” said Samani.\n\nPreviously, even up until early 2017, it was not possible for institutional investors to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin because the market was premature and the liquidity was limited. In January of 2017, the market cap of Bitcoin was only $15 bln. The market was simply not deep and mature enough for institutional investors and large-scale hedge funds to commit.\n\nIn the past 10 months, the market valuation of Bitcoin has grown to $110 bln, with a daily trading volume of $4 bln. As such, Bitcoin has become more liquid than the most liquid stock on earth, Apple.\n\n2018: expect mainstream adoption of Bitcoi\n\nAri Paul, the co-founder and CIO of BlockTower Capital, a cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund co-established by former Goldman Sachs vice president, stated “things are gonna get weird next year,” given that the interest for Bitcoin from the traditional finance industry and institutional investors is clearing increasing at an exponential rate.\n\nAs explained by Samani, institutional investors will be engaging in Bitcoin trading and enter the Bitcoin market with tens of billions of dollars in the short-term. Hence, analysts like Novogratz expect Bitcoin price to surpass the $10,000 mark with ease in the upcoming months, and potentially gear towards new all-time highs in late 2018, after achieving $10,000.\n\nSince 2016, Bitcoin has successfully evolved into a robust and widely accepted store of value. As institutional investors participate in the market and liquidity of Bitcoin further increases, the value of Bitcoin will inevitably rise at an unprecedented rate in the mid to long-term.', ""LONDON - With Pep Guardiola's record-breaking Manchester City team galloping away towards the Premier League title, attention is starting to shift to the jostling for Champions League positions.\n\nBERLIN - Bayern Munich travel to Stuttgart on Saturday for their final match before the Bundesliga's winter break with a nine-point lead and on a run of 13 wins in 14 games in all competitions.\n\nMADRID - Real Madrid's Club World Cup commitments mean Barcelona, Valencia and Atletico Madrid have a huge chance to put even more distance between themselves and the European champions this weekend.\n\nEntertainment\n\n2017-12-15 Frontlining on Twitter read more TwitterCAN one of the things we leave in 2017 be our careless disregard for road safety.

The rapid growth in knowledge and value of the digital cryptocurrency is certainly a story that grabs the headlines, but underneath is a potential to change how money could be used in the future.\n\nSo, how can you actually get hold of Bitcoin? After all, your local bank branch won’t be handing out the digital currency any time soon. We show you where you can exchange your cash for the money of the brave new, online, world.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with cryptocurrencies, then you might find our What is Bitcoin? and What is Ethereum? features a helpful introduction.\n\nSet up a Bitcoin wallet\n\nBefore you can buy any Bitcoins, you’ll need somewhere to keep them. This is done by creating an online wallet. These are offered by a number of online sites, often with apps for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.\n\nThe Bitcoin.org site lists several wallets from different creators, but you can also try popular apps like Mycellium, Coinbase, or Blockchain, which claims to be the world’s most popular digital wallet.\n\nThe most important things to look for when selecting a wallet is security and ease of use. The more secure the better, as Bitcoin theft has been a problem in the past. This was proven in spectacular fashion in 2014 when the most popular exchange in the world was brought to its knees after 850,000 Bitcoin were stolen.\n\nBe sure to find a wallet provider that allows two-step authentication, always use a strong password (don’t forget it!), and if possible look for the ability to backup your wallet offline.\n\nMost modern providers offer high-levels of security, but in your mind you need to think of a Bitcoin wallet as an actual wallet. If you lose your cash, you’re not getting it back. The same is true of Bitcoin. So protect it judiciously.\n\nTake your time, do some research on any potential wallet providers you prefer, and things should go smoothly.\n\nFor more details on how to secure your wallet, and the potential risks involved, read this helpful guide on the Bitcoin.org site.\n\nDo I have to buy Bitcoin from an exchange?\n\nThe easiest way to buy, and sell, Bitcoin is on one of the many exchanges now in operation around the world. These function in the same way as popping down to the Post Office to buy foreign currencies when going on holiday, except everything takes place online.\n\nYou’ll need to create an account on the exchange, and enter your bank details so payments can be made to and from your account. Many also support PayPal if you’d prefer to keep everything digital.\n\nSome of the most trusted exchanges include the aforementioned Coinbase, eToro, and Coinify, but you can search around for others too.\n\nAs the value of a single Bitcoin at the time of writing this article is around the £5000 mark, you probably won’t be buying a whole one to start with. Instead you’ll purchase a percentage based on value.\n\nTherefore, if you want to invest £100, then the exchanges will sell you £100 worth of Bitcoin, no matter what percentage that amounts to. These can then be spent online at supporting outlets, or you can trade them on the exchange.\n\nFor more details on these digital markets read our Best Bitcoin Exchanges guide.\n\nBuying Bitcoin from a cash machine\n\nBelieve it or not you can actually buy or redeem Bitcoins at cash machines around the UK, US, Canada, and other countries worldwide.\n\nThese kiosks are connected to online exchanges and allow users to make purchases by depositing cash into the machine itself. They can also dispense the local currency in exchange for Bitcoin already bought online.\n\nYou can see the locations of Bitcoin ATM on the very handy Coin ATM Radar site.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind though, is that there have been several reports of quite high transaction charges when using the machines. So, if you do want to get your Bitcoin from a hole in the wall, be sure to check what it will cost before you begin.\n\nNow you just have to decide whether to head out into the marketplace to spend your Bitcoins, or hang onto them for a while. Those who opted for the latter a few years ago are very happy they did so now.', 'New startup London Block Exchange is launching a prepaid card linked to an app that will let people spend and hold cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe startup has raised £2 million from private investors and is headed by an 18-year Credit Suisse veteran.\n\n\n\nA London-startup headed by a Credit Suisse veteran is launching a new debit card that it claims will allow people to spend cryptocurrencies across the UK.\n\nThe London Block Exchange (LBX) launched on Tuesday. It plans to launch a sterling-to-cryptocurrency exchange and a prepaid Visa debit card, dubbed ""Dragoncard,"" that will allow people to convert bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, litecoin and monero to sterling and spend it across the UK. The startup plans to add more cryptocurrencies in future.\n\nThe Visa card, which will be issued by Gibraltar-based pre-paid card provider Wavecrest, will be linked to an app that allows users to buy and hold cryptocurrencies through the LBX exchange. Customers will also be able to withdraw money using the card. Cryptocurrencies will be converted to sterling at the time of withdrawal.\n\nLBX CEO and founder Ben Dives said in a statement: ""Despite being the financial capital of the world, London is a difficult place for investors to enter and trade in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n""We’ll bring it into the mainstream by removing the barriers to access, and by helping people understand and have confidence in what we believe is the future of money.""\n\nLBX has so far raised £2 million from a consortium of private investors who the company declined to name. Prior to setting up LBX earlier this year, Dives founded brainstorming tool Ideaflip.\n\nEx-Credit Suisse and UBS banker Adam Bryant serves as LBX\'s executive chairman. Bryant spent 18 years at Credit Suisse and almost two years at UBS before joining LBX, running the macro hedge fund teams at both banks.\n\nBryant said in a statement: ""We’re offering a grown up and robust experience for those who wish to safely and easily understand and invest in digital currencies. We’re confident we’ll transform this market in the UK and will become the leading cryptocurrency and blockchain consultancy for institutional investors and consumers alike.""\n\nCustomers will be charged a 0.5% for buying and selling cryptocurrencies on its platform and the Dragoncard has an up-front fee of £20. LBX says card provider Wavecrest will also charge a small fee for ATM withdrawals.\n\nLBX\'s launch coincides with an explosion of interest in cryptocurrency in 2017. Bitcoin has rocketed over 500% so far this year and the total cryptocurrency market has ballooned to close to $200 billion thanks to the popularity of ""initial coin offerings,"" where startups issue digital coins as a way of raising money.\n\nWhile LBX is one of the first companies to offer a cryptocurrency card in the UK, it is likely to soon face competition. Revolut, the well-funded foreign exchange startup, is developing cryptocurrency trading capacities within its app and may well let consumers spend the currencies on its prepaid card.', 'Crytocurrencies such as bitcoin are starting to gain adoption in UK property sales.\n\nDual-advantage of generating publicity for the sale of real estate and attracting buyers who have bitcoin but are unable to convert it cheaply into fiat currency.\n\nWider use will remain hampered by bitcoin\'s volatility.\n\nLONDON — Selling a house in London is getting harder.\n\nData from Rightmove showed that four in 10 sellers are reducing prices, with London\'s prime property market in the midst of a downturn.\n\nBut one £17 million mansion in Notting Hill has seen unprecedented interest since it went on sale in October.\n\n""Last week we had 15 viewings,"" said Lev Loginov, co-founder of property firm London Wall, which is selling the property.

Loginov says otherwise.\n\n""The biggest benefit for us is that we as a company, throughout this process, figure out how to process property transactions in bitcoin,"" he told Business Insider.\n\n""We now know exactly how it works, what we have to do, and the steps we have to take. We believe cryptocurrencies are going to be the future.""\n\nHe notes other benefits. He says a bitcoin transaction is easier and cheaper from a technical point of view. A firm in the United States checks the legitimacy of his prospective bitcoin buyers, a process which Loginov says is ""much cheaper"" than the equivalent process for tracking fiat money, such is the transparency of blockchain.\n\nLoginov said the reason they don\'t simply convert their cryptocurrency holdings into fiat money is that ""many of them do not have the mechanics to do it.""\n\nThe cost of processing bitcoin into fiat currency on that scale is also significant, which likely makes doing so less attractive.\n\nA marketing gimmick?\n\nIf, then, the sale of a single house might make sense from a business perspective, bitcoin analysts are less convinced the property market will adopt the cryptocurrency more widely.\n\nThe biggest problem, according to Saurabh Saxena, founder of residential proptech startup Houzen, is the fact bitcoin and property appeal to fundamentally different types of investors. Property is a stable asset class, and bitcoin is highly volatile.\n\n\n\nIt\'s purely a marketing gimmick\n\n""I sincerely believe that bitcoin as a currency or exchange medium is not sustainable. It\'s purely a marketing gimmick,"" he told Businesss Insider.\n\n""Developers typically raise money from pension funds or private equity. When a pension fund invests in real estate, they would typically expect a return of anywhere from 8% to 10%.\n\n""Real estate is a low- to medium-risk asset class, and offers low to medium returns. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, and hence very, very high risk as a transaction medium.\n\n""If the value is fixed, then a bit of global reach would make it acceptable for the industry but it\'s not — the value goes up and down every day.""\n\nA bitcoin bubble?\n\nMati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at trading platform eToro, agrees. ""Most bitcoin property transactions are done using the fiat value of the property,"" he told Business Insider.\n\nFixing the price in fiat value and converting it to bitcoin at the point of sale essentially means that the buyer absorbs none of the volatility associated with bitcoin, so long as they convert it back to fiat value once the transaction is complete (for what it’s worth, Loginov says he will keep most of the funds from the house sale in bitcoin).\n\n\n\nA bubble only ends once all the players have maxed their positions\n\nFor as long as bitcoin remains volatile, Greenspan says, it will not see full adoption in areas like the property market.\n\n""Once bitcoin adoption reaches full potential the volatility will even out as well but that could still be a while from now,"" he says.\n\n""More and more people are coming into the market on a daily basis and there are still many people who are intrigued but still on the sidelines.

11/15/2017,"['Even though India’s key financial regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has strongly voiced its opinion against using bitcoin for payments, technology enthusiasts believe the craze for cryptocurrency is only on the upswing in India. Indian bitcoin exchanges, bolstered by the growing number of bitcoin buyers and traders, are laboring on with their efforts to popularize cryptocurrency.\n\nAt a banking event, RBI executive director Ganesh Kumar said that the organization will not be using bitcoins for payments or settlements anytime soon. This isn\'t the first time the RBI has expressed its discomfort about cryptocurrency and its usage in India. On numerous occasions, the RBI has largely maintained a measured and vigilant approach about popularizing the use of bitcoin. But, this hasn\'t held back Indians from exploring the various uses of cryptocurrencies aside from payment.\n\nBitcoin For Investments & Remittance In India\n\nAccording to leading cryptocurrency exchanges in India, cryptocurrency is gaining popularity, primarily as a financial asset. While global trade volume is about $5 billion a day, India’s annual bitcoin trade volume stands at $20 billion. India’s first bitcoin exchange Zebpay says there are more than 1.5 million bitcoin users in India and 200,000 users are being added each month. Most of these users buy bitcoins as a financial asset. Cofounder Sandeep Goenka said, “Investing in bitcoin has emerged as a significant trend in the past few months. We have enabled Indians to buy an international asset in a large scale and help them contribute to increase in wealth.” The volume o users have been steadily growing on Zebpay. There was a distinct rally in November 2016 and numbers haven’t dropped since.\n\nBitcoin in India has another appeal – remittances and compensating freelancers. Despite an 8.9% drop in 2016, India has retained its position as a top receiver of remittances worldwide, according to a World Bank report. Many bitcoin startups in India believe remittances is a huge potential market for them, and bitcoin transactions are more economical than wire transfers.\n\nUnocoin, India\'s first entrant into the bitcoin industry, entered a partnership with U.S.-based Bitwage in 2016 to enable global payments for services. Bitwage can utilize Unocoin’s APIs, enabling employers to directly sell bitcoins as payment for a service, and beneficiaries will receive Indian rupees directly into their accounts. An Indian employee who is getting paid $ 1,000 can receive around 8% more if paid via Bitwage (returns are subject to bitcoin exchange rates). Unocoin has also collaborated with Canadian remittance app Paycase, which allows Canadians to send money to India and the Philippines effortlessly. Cofounder Sathvik Vishwanath says, “Bitcoin makes payments fast and inexpensive. Payment portals, like banks, levy transaction charges on beneficiaries. With bitcoin, there are no overhead costs or extra charges, making it a more appealing form of payment as workers get paid closer to real wages.”\n\nAsian Nations Race Ahead In The Cryptocurrency Game\n\nEven as cryptocurrency startups like Unocoin and Zebpay continue to do business as usual, the current RBI stance has raised some concerns about the perception of India as a fintech hub and its seriousness about financial inclusion.\n\nIndia’s reluctance to encourage mainstream bitcoin usage is more pronounced in the light of developments taking place in other parts of Asia. Singapore’s key regulator Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) along with Deloitte and leading banks has published a report on its work to develop Project Ubin, a tokenized version of the national currency on a distributed ledger. Moreover, fintech hub LATTICE80 is planning to do conduct an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2018, for which cities such as Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Tokyo, London and New York will be considered. Japan continues to be a trendsetter for bitcoin use. In March 2016, the Japanese cabinet approved bills that position bitcoin and cryptocurrency at the same level as authorized currency. Nearly 260,000 retailers, hotels, airlines and department stores in Japan are expected to accept bitcoin payments through PoS app AirRegi. South Korea is also showing a marked interest in blockchain, especially after electronics manufacturer Samsung announced in May that it was exploring corporate use for the software powering Ethereum.\n\nGoenka says, “India is already three years behind USA, Japan and Hong Kong when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption. We believe this technology will be a game-changer, probably even bigger than what the internet did for us in the 90s. The current concerns by the RBI only accelerates our need to engage with authorities and regulators to generate awareness about blockchain, which powers the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”\n\nFuture Of Cryptocurrency In India\n\nBolstered by positive reviews and growing customer acquisition levels, bitcoin companies are bullish about the market in India. ""Investing in bitcoin isn’t a get-rich-quick method. Investors must spend time educating themselves about bitcoin and the technology behind it, much like real estate or stock market,” says Goenka.\n\nThe bitcoin frenzy isn’t about to die down anytime soon. While the RBI’s reluctance about cryptocurrency stems from concerns over new technology, the growing number of users in India cannot be ignored and beckons regulatory intervention sooner than later.', 'Bitcoin was on a tear Wednesday after mobile payments company Square confirmed it was letting some people buy and sell bitcoin on its Cash app.\n\nBitcoin was trading at $7,284, up more than 10%, at 5:18 p.m. ET. Square, on the other hand, ended the trading day up 2.3%.\n\n\n\nSquare, the mobile payments firm, is running a trial that allows some users of its Cash platform to buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nThe news, which was reported by TechCrunch, sent Square\'s stock to an all-time high of $41.80 per share soon after the markets first opened. It gave up some of those gains during the rest of the trading day and closed at $40.66 per share, up 2.3%.\n\nBitcoin is also in the green today. The cryptocurrency, known for its wild price swings, was trading up more than 10% at $7,284 per coin at 5:18 p.m. ET, according to data from Markets Insider.\n\nSquare added the feature to Cash, a rival to Venmo, because users asked for it, the company said in a statement. The company is still trying to figure out how to make it ""faster and easier"" and is only offering it to a ""small number"" of Cash users, it said.\n\nThe new feature will allow Square to compete with cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini.\n\nA research note penned by Credit Suisse analysts Paul Condra and Mrinalini Bhutoria said the move could be a tailwind for the company, despite some hurdles. Here\'s the bank (emphasis ours):\n\n""Given SQ’s tendency to move judiciously into new technologies, we expect it will do the same with bitcoin purchases. We believe the largest risk is regulation, which could limit its ability to provide the service or outright ban it. SQ is also exposed to liquidity and counterparty risk as it must source bitcoin for users either by pre-buying or using an exchange. Despite these risks, the upside could be significant if crypto currencies become more mainstream.""\n\nAs for bitcoin, the Square news is the latest example of a mainstream financial services firm showing interest in the profit opportunities in the booming cryptocurrency space.\n\nSimon Yu, CEO of StormX, a blockchain technology company, said the news is a ""fantastic development"" for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nHe said it will ""undoubtedly be a call to action to invite other forward-thinking firms in embracing the new token economy.”', ""An alleged money launderer tied to the defunct BTC-e bitcoin exchange and wanted by both Russia and the U.S. will attend an extradition hearing next month.\n\nThe Dec. 6 hearing, The Associated Press reports, represents a delay intended to allow for two witnesses to attend the proceedings, a lawyer for Alexander Vinnik said. Vinnik was arrested in July and accused of laundering billions of dollars through BTC-e, which was also targeted by law enforcement officials.\n\nThe development represents the latest twist in a story that sparked global headlines in the wake of Vinnik's arrest. U.S. prosecutors had filed charges against both Vinnik and BTC-e, with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) handing down a $110 million fine against the cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nVinnik has since remained in Greece after local authorities acted on a U.S. arrest warrant. And while a Greek court initially backed the request to extradite him to face charges in the U.S., Vinnik is seeking to be sent to Russia instead.\n\nAs a result, both governments are pushing for their respective extradition requests to be granted, putting the decision in the hands of the Greek Supreme Court, as well as the Greek Justice Department.\n\nIn statements, Vinnik has declared his innocence in regards to the U.S. charges, though he acknowledged that he worked for BTC-e. BTC-e – which has since relaunched after having its domain seized by law enforcement – has denied any involvement with Vinnik.\n\nCourt image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It traded at $13,010 by 3:34 p.m. in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital.\n\nDemand for bitcoin in Zimbabwe has surged amid a shortage of hard currency. Golix processed more than $1 million of transactions in the past 30 days, compared with turnover of $100,000 for the whole of 2016, according to data on the exchange’s website. Zimbabwe doesn’t have its own currency, with the government adopting the U.S. dollar and South African rand, among others, as legal tender in 2009 after hyperinflation rendered the local dollar worthless.\n\nGolix, an unregulated platform that also trades other cryptocurrencies including bitcoin cash, has been in operation since 2014. Prices for bitcoin are set by supply and demand, according to Taurai Chinyamakobvu, co-owner of the exchange. Sellers are paid in U.S. dollars deposited electronically, which can only be converted into hard cash at a steep discount on the black market.\n\nClick here to read more on the situation in Zimbabwe\n\nZimbabwe’s army moved into the capital, Harare, on Tuesday after a week of confrontation with President Robert Mugabe’s government and said the action was needed to stave off violent conflict in the southern African nation that he has ruled since 1980.\n\nDeep Crisis\n\nThe events unfolded as Zimbabwe is in deep crisis. The economy has halved in size since 2000, an estimated 95 percent of the workforce is jobless and as many as 3 million Zimbabweans have gone into exile.\n\nWhile most major currencies are legal tender in Zimbabwe, cash-strapped importers and retailers buy dollars -- or any currency easily converted to dollars -- at premium prices by paying the seller electronically. An “electronic” dollar buys about 8 South African rand, compared with the market exchange rate of 14.32 on Wednesday. Zimbabwe’s unpopular “bond notes” -- promissory notes issued by the central bank and officially pegged to the dollar -- are worth as little as 50 U.S. cents on the black market.', 'CME Group’s announcement that they will begin trading Bitcoin futures catapulted the Bitcoin market to new highs two weeks ago. Many Bitcoin investors are waiting with bated breath for trading to commence and are expecting further price growth. Indeed, when the world’s largest futures market recognizes Bitcoin as a legitimate asset and decides to integrate it into their offerings, it would seem to be a very good thing.\n\nWhat does it actually accomplish?\n\nBut why? Other than CME Group’s imprimatur, which is undoubtedly valuable in itself, what specific good is going to come from this new marketplace? After all, creation of a large and regulated futures market will make it far easier for deep-pocketed traders to short Bitcoin, potentially causing the price to tumble.\n\nCointelegraph had the opportunity to speak with David Johnson, CEO of Latium and experienced foreign exchange (FX) trader, to get his take on what CME Group’s announcement means. Johnson believes the biggest boost to Bitcoin will come not from the trading of futures per se, but from what that trading enables: retail adoption.\n\nA lesson from the airlines\n\nThe airline industry is one of the biggest buyers of oil futures in the world. The reason is obvious; they need to “lock in” the price of jet fuel so they can charge passengers an appropriate fare. If airlines were subject to the daily whims of the oil market, they would find it nearly impossible to operate effectively.\n\nThe process of locking in prices on a commodity or asset is referred to as “hedging.” The airlines don’t want to buy massive amounts of jet fuel and have to store it for long periods of time; all they want is a stable price. Therefore, they go to the futures market and buy or sell specific types of options which effectively guarantee the price they will pay for fuel for a period of time.\n\nRetail adoption\n\nRight now, most companies that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment use third-party payment processors to receive the Bitcoin and immediately convert it to cash, and deposit the funds in the company’s bank account.\n\nThis works, up to a point. Unfortunately, these companies don’t have a long track record and are quite small. Huge retailers, like Walmart or Amazon, probably would be wary of doing business with them.\n\nCME Group’s futures market changes all of this. According to Johnson, major companies with careful risk management strategies have been slow to get involved in Bitcoin because of the risk. There is a risk to storing Bitcoin.\n\nThere is counterparty risk in dealing with a small payment processor without a long and trusted reputation. There is risk of inadequate liquidity to exchange Bitcoin for cash. There’s regulatory risk, as your counterparties might not be in full compliance.\n\nIf you want Amazon or some other mega-company to start accepting Bitcoin, the first step is to create a way to mitigate these risks. Johnson says this is the single most important thing the new futures marketplace will bring.\n\nLarge retailers will be able to accept Bitcoin, have it immediately converted to cash or hedged, and do so on a massive, trusted, regulated exchange.\n\nJohnson believes the full effects of the new marketplace won’t be seen for six to eight months, as liquidity builds and large retailers become aware of it. More places to spend Bitcoin, of course, will make it more useful to ordinary consumers and will presumably increase its price, in time. Many in the community have long believed that retail adoption is one of the keys to boosting Bitcoin’s price; without a place to spend cryptocurrency, it’s nothing more than a speculative instrument.\n\nInstitutional investors\n\nCME Group will also provide an on-ramp for traditional institutional investors. Some of them have hundreds of billions of dollars at their disposal, but they generally have strict rules about what they can invest in. At present, such institutions have shied away from Bitcoin due to the difficulty of storing the currency or dealing with small, unregulated Bitcoin exchanges without a long history of doing business.\n\nWhile an institutional investor might not be able to buy Bitcoins directly, there will likely be far fewer restrictions on buying futures contracts. Institutions can, therefore, bet on Bitcoin price without actually owning the asset.\n\nPaper Bitcoin\n\nThat brings us to a rather interesting point: this is a futures market. No actual Bitcoin will change hands on CME’s marketplace. In effect, market participants will be trading “paper” Bitcoins. Commodities experts like Ted Butler have long railed against the “paper silver” and “paper gold” that trade on regulated exchanges and have accused these markets of distorting the price for actual physical metals.\n\nIt remains to be seen what effect this market will have on Bitcoin.\n\nFuture ETF\n\nAlmost as important as retail adoption, CME’s exchange will almost certainly bring about the SEC’s approval of a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) at some point in the future. The regulator had already said earlier this year when rejecting the Winklevoss twins’ proposal, that approval would be likely if regulated futures markets were established:\n\n”When the spot market is unregulated--there must be significant, regulated derivatives markets related to the underlying asset with which the exchange can enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement.”\n\nAn ETF would be big news because it would provide another way for institutional - and retail - investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nIn the case of an ETF, the fund must actually hold the underlying asset, meaning that if the ETF has traded shares equivalent to 100,000 BTC, they must actually own 100,000 BTC. This much buying pressure could only spell good news for Bitcoin price.\n\nMany in the Bitcoin community have long wanted to invest part of their 401(k) or IRA in Bitcoin, but have found it difficult or impossible to do. Those that succeed invariably pay high fees (to create a self-directed IRA) or sizeable premiums (to buy shares of GBTC).\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would be a low-fee and simple way of adding Bitcoin to your traditional retirement portfolio. It would be as easy as calling up your broker and asking them to place the order...or doing it yourself online.\n\nSmart regulation\n\nJohnson noted that regulation is inevitable and instead of fighting it, Bitcoin owners should embrace smart regulations. In fact, he suggests that Bitcoin businesses and investors come up with their own body of rules that regulators could easily adopt.\n\nThat would be a much better option, Johnson notes, than having regulators unknowledgeable about Bitcoin try and create regulations which might well be impossible to follow.\n\nFor Bitcoin to continue its growth, integration into existing infrastructure is essential, Johnson said. Wall Street’s growing acceptance of the currency and regulators’ increased understanding will go a long way toward bringing Bitcoin out of the shadows and boosting its price.\n\nMainstream media attention, Wall Street acceptance, possible retail adoption and ETFs all spell a bright future for digital currency. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream and further integrated into financial markets and daily life, one wonders if Tim Draper might be correct:', 'The highest price paid on a cryptocurrency exchange in Zimbabwe overnight was $13,499 — almost double prices in the US.\n\nThe price action comes amid a military invention in the African country, which doesn’t have a currency of its own.\n\nDespite wild swings in prices on the local exchanges, peer-to-peer transactions appeared to be less volatile.\n\n\n\nBitcoin prices have jumped back above $7,000 on global benchmark exchanges, but the latest moves appear small compared to overnight action in Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwe’s military stormed the capital city of Harare yesterday and took control of the state broadcaster.\n\nZimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has been placed under house arrest and may step down later this week.\n\nThat led to reports that bitcoin prices on a cryptocurrency exchange in Zimbabwe called Golix had skyrocketed past $13,000 — almost double the current value on other major exchanges such as Bitfinex.\n\nZimbabwe doesn’t have its own currency, with the US dollar and South African rand both accepted as legal tender since 2009 after hyperinflation left the previous currency worthless.\n\nThe Golix website showed settled bitcoin transactions ranged from $8,000 to as high as $13,499 over the last 24 hours, although its unclear whether those figures referred to settlements of at least one bitcoin, or a percentage of bitcoin.\n\nIn other words, if someone purchased 0.25 of a bitcoin at $13,499, the actual money paid would be around $3,375.\n\nIn addition, there was a wide gap between the bid and ask spread for bitcoin trades on the Golix website overnight, with the most drastic discrepancy showing a sell offer (ask) at $16,000 against a buy offer (bid) of just $5,000.\n\nA short time ago, the website showed that bitcoin was trading at $10,250 — still around a $3,000 premium to current prices on larger exchanges.\n\nAccording to a report in Quartz, the higher prices were most likely due to a lack of liquidity on the Golix exchange, which appears to be the only cryptocurrency website in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Golix website says the exchange has processed transactions for 16.2878 bitcoin over the past 24 hours. As a comparison, larger exchanges in the US such as Bitfinex process tens of thousands over the same time-frame.\n\nThe Quartz report added that where countries don’t have large clearing exchanges, peer-to-peer transactions are more common.\n\nThe biggest global platform for peer-to-peer bitcoin trades is localbitcoins.com, and a search of brokers in Zimbabwe shows transactions more in line with the current global price of bitcoin.\n\nSo while at least one transaction may have been cleared at the impressively high price of $13,499, it doesn’t appear that a large number of Zimbaweans are paying top dollar in a mad scramble for cryptocurrency as military tanks roll through downtown Harare.\n\nHere’s the price for bitcoin in US dollars a short time ago on the Bitfinex exchange, via Investing.com:', ""Reuters reports that Man Group, a UK-based hedge fund, will be getting involved in Bitcoin trading if CME Group’s plans to open a regulated futures exchange are approved.

However, such funds have a much wider latitude to trade whatever types of assets or instruments it thinks would be profitable for its clients. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are open to regular retail investors but have greater restrictions as to how they can invest their funds.\n\nThe holy grail for retail investors would be an exchange traded fund, or ETF.

At press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is around $7,007 levels. Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that bitcoin has gained nearly 6.74 percent in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe move marks a recovery of around 25 percent from bitcoin\'s recent lows near $5,000, though is still at least 10 percent short of the record highs above $7,800 hit last week.\n\nPrice action analysis suggests the tide is slowly turning in favor of the bulls, although the last major domino – the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement – is yet to fall.\n\nBitcoin chart\n\nAs discussed in the previous update, bitcoin prices have moved higher after having consolidated above the key trendline level.\n\nThe chart above shows:\n\nThe 5-day moving average (MA) has bottomed out and is now curled up in favor of the bulls, courtesy of the price gains seen today.\n\nBitcoin is struggling to break above $6,986 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent sell-off).\n\nThe RSI has moved back above 50.00 (in the bullish territory) and is trending upwards.\n\nView\n\nRetracement levels are based on the prior move (sell-off from record highs) and alert traders or investors to a potential trend reversal.\n\nA close above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci (Fib) retracement level of $6,986 would indicate a revival of the bull run and open the doors for a move towards the record highs above $7,800.\n\nAs long as bitcoin trades below 61.8 percent Fib level, the 29 percent rally from the recent lows near $5,000 would qualify as a ""corrective rally"" in a strong downtrend (sell-off from record highs).\n\nBear case scenario: Failure to close above the 61.8 percent Fib level followed by a drop below the rising trendline support (seen today at $6,555) would indicate the corrective rally has ended. Prices could then proceed to test the upward sloping 50-day MA seen today at $5,723.\n\n4-hour chart\n\nThe price action detailed under the bear case scenario would only add credence to the bearish 50-MA and 100-MA crossover seen on the 4-hour chart above and strengthen the case for a drop to $5,750–$5,723.\n\nAlso, note that the 61.8 percent Fib level of $6,986 is closely aligned with the psychological barrier of $7,000. Thus, we can conclude that $7,000 is a ""make or break"" level to watch out for over the next day or two.\n\nShip\'s wheel image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Local sources have revealed that bitcoin mining is not banned as of yet.\n\nUnconfirmed Reports and Rumors\n\nInitially, Sichuan Electric Power Company, released an unconfirmed circular which claimed that the use of electricity to produce and mine bitcoin is illegal. Caijing, an independent news publication based in Beijing, first reported on the circular released by Sichuan Electric Power Company, and more media outlets followed.\n\nCnLedger, a trusted news source of the Chinese cryptocurrency market, quickly debunked the report, after Sichuan Electric Power Company admitted that it had made several mistakes and included unverified claims on its circular.\n\n“The head of that company has clarified that they made mistakes on the statement, as they are not a government administrative department, and have no rights to determine whether bitcoin mining is illegal,” wrote CnLedger.\n\nAccording to the county electric power company in Sichuan, the firm did release a notice which explicitly described bitcoin mining as an illicit operation. But, an executive of the company stated that the circular was released in a hurry and that the company is not in a position to ban or restrict bitcoin mining.\n\n“However, head of the company clarified to Caixin today that the notice was made in a hurry; it is not their role to determine whether bitcoin mining is against the law. Actually the company is not yet connected to national grid, and relies on local stations to get electricity,” added CnLedger.\n\nGovernment and State-Owned News Publication Clarify\n\nMore importantly, state-owned business and finance news publication Caixin, revealed that the government has no intent of banning bitcoin mining or any activity surrounding cryptocurrency mining in the region as of yet.\n\nCaixin’s report was particularly important and notable to the controversy surrounding a potential bitcoin mining ban in China as it has operated as the official press of the Chinese government. CnLedger explained that Caixin has communicated with the government, which announced that bitcoin is not illegal as of current. CnLedger revealed:\n\n“Caixin also mentioned that technically these 6 stations are not qualified grid power supplier. So they are not allowed to the grid anyway. The electricity they produced is considered “wasted” power. Previously Caixin has also contacted those who are close to the regulators, and was told that currently there is no plan to forbid bitcoin mining.”\n\nConclusively, a premature and unverified circular of a country grid operator led to a series of false reports around the legality of bitcoin mining. So far, the government and state-owned press have evidently demonstrated that the country has no intentions to ban bitcoin mining.\n\nIn the upcoming months, several analysts predict the Chinese government to provide necessary regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrency trading and bitcoin mining.

As of writing, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is at $7,459 – a 2.54 percent gain for the session, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index\n\nStepping back, prices had dropped 29 percent after the developers suspended a controversial software upgrade, known as Segwit2x, on Nov. 8.\n\nHowever, the sell-off was cut short near $5,500 by the 50-day moving average (MA) on Nov, 12. A rally in the subsequent days all but erased the likelihood of a drop to $5,000 levels. Then, yesterday, a move above $7,000 improved the odds of a continued rally to record highs above $7,800. Currently, BTC is just $312 short of its Nov. 8 record of over $7,800.\n\nPossibly exerting influence on prices in recent days, comments on social media show the investor community has started analyzing the effect of a potential rotation of money out of stocks and bonds and into bitcoin. CME Group's recently announced BTC futures contract is likely to begin trading as soon as December.\n\nThe new offering will allow institutional investors to diversify into a high yielding asset like bitcoin – especially if the equity markets respond negatively to increased odds of a Fed rate hike.\n\nThe price action analysis also indicates the tables may have turned in favor of the bulls.\n\nBitcoin chart\n\nThe 5-day MA and 10-day MA have bottomed out, courtesy of the sharp rally above the $7,000 mark. With 61.8 percent Fibonacci hurdle well and truly behind us, bitcoin looks set to possibly test $8,000 levels.\n\nThe relative strength index is overbought on the 1-hour and 4-hour time frame, hence minor pullbacks cannot be ruled out.\n\nDips could be short-lived, though, and a continued rally looks likely.\n\nOnly a sharp sell-off and a close today below the rising trendline support of $6,600 would turn the tide back in favor of the bears.\n\nScope image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'The price of bitcoin returned to record highs in trading Thursday thanks to several announcements that boosted investor confidence in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe first announcement came from venture capital-funded bitcoin exchange Coinbase Inc. It announced the launch of Coinbase Custody, a custodian service aimed at large institutional investors like hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds that are looking to park their money in bitcoin holdings. A custodian service holds customers’ securities for safekeeping to minimize the risk of their theft or loss, so in this case Coinbase will be securing bitcoin holdings.\n\nAccording to a post on Medium by Coinbase Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong, the new service will be limited to investors with at least the equivalent of $10 million in bitcoin, and it will charge a $100,000 setup fee. “By some estimates there is $10 billion of institutional money waiting on the sidelines to invest in digital currency today,” Armstrong said. “When we speak with these institutions, they tell us that the number one thing preventing them from getting started is the existence of a digital asset custodian that they can trust to store client funds securely.”\n\nThe second good news for bitcoin came from Man Group. The U.K.-based hedge fund, which has $10 billion in funds under management, said it will start trading in bitcoin once the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launches a bitcoin futures contract as planned. According to Reuters, Man Group CEO Luke Ellis said cryptocurrencies presented “a number of challenges,” but that while it’s not part of the company’s “investment universe today – it could be.” He added that “if there is a CME future on bitcoin, it would be.”\n\nCME Group announced in October that it was planning to start offering bitcoin futures trading before the end of the year subject to regulatory approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It’s not clear if that approval has yet been granted, however. As recently as Monday, the company was saying that the product would launch in the second week of December.\n\nThe compounding good news saw the price of bitcoin finally break clear of the doldrums sparked by disagreements over the future of the underlying code used by cryptocurrency. It surged to as high as $7.998.32 at one point, going oh-so-close to breaking through the $8,000 price for the first time. As of 10:45 p.m. EST, bitcoin was trading at $7,973.84 with the current bull run likely to see the $8,000 mark breached in coming hours.', 'Political turmoil and an apparent coup have pushed the price of Bitcoin as high as $13,000 on a digital currency exchange in Zimbabwe -- nearly twice the going rate in global markets.\n\nDemand surged on Golix, which appears to be the only local Bitcoin exchange, after military leaders put 93-year-old leader Robert Mugabe under house arrest.\n\nBitcoin has long commanded higher prices in Zimbabwe, which scrapped its own currency in 2009 after years of hyperinflation made it worthless.\n\nBut the appearance of tanks on the streets of the capital Harare have pushed the price gap even wider. Bitcoin was trading on international exchanges for roughly $7,500 on Thursday.\n\nThe digital currency was quoted more broadly in line with world prices in online market places that allow buyers and sellers in Zimbabwe to deal directly with each other.\n\nRelated: Mugabe\'s exit is \'a done deal\' but Zimbabwe is still in limbo\n\nElevated Bitcoin prices in Zimbabwe appear to be the result of the country\'s dysfunctional economy and mismatched supply and demand.\n\nSince 2009, business in the country has been conducted in a number of foreign currencies, but exchange rates on the thriving black market are highly distorted. Dollars are in short supply, and strict capital controls are in place.\n\nLast year, the country started printing bond notes -- backed by U.S dollars -- in a bid to ease a chronic shortage of cash. But many Zimbabweans worry they are a backdoor to the reintroduction of a local currency that would be doomed to massive devaluation.\n\n""In Zimbabwe, you are very limited with what you can do with the money in your bank account,"" Golix says on its website. ""Bitcoin is better than the money we\'re using now.""\n\nRelated: How Robert Mugabe killed one of Africa\'s richest economies\n\nThere is also the problem that local demand for Bitcoin far outstrips supply.\n\nOnly 16 Bitcoin have been traded on Golix over the past 24 hours, and 160 over the previous month.\n\nBitcoins are created through ""mining"" -- a process in which computers race to solve complex math problem, and winners are rewarded with chunks of the digital currency.\n\nMining requires huge amounts of electricity, and Golix says that energy prices in the region are simply too high to make the process cost effective.\n\nRelated: What is Bitcoin?\n\n""Bitcoin in circulation in Africa comes from people who bought it at an exchange elsewhere,"" the exchange says on its website.\n\nSupply is likely remain low, however. Golix doesn\'t allow Bitcoin sellers to take their money away in cash.', 'TOKYO – When Mt. Gox, the world’s largest bitcoin trading exchange, collapsed in early 2014, more than 24,000 customers around the world lost access to hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency and cash.\n\nMore than three years later, with the price of bitcoin skyrocketing to more than $7,000, not a single customer has recouped a single cent, crypto or otherwise. It’s not clear when they will. The failed exchange has become stuck in a morass of litigation – a Russian doll of bankruptcies in Japan and New Zealand, four in all, plus lawsuits in the United States and competing claims from creditors.\n\nAnd although the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee recovered digital currency now worth more than $1.6 billion, under Japanese law the exchange’s customers likely will recover only a fraction of that.\n\nKim Nilsson, a Swedish software developer who had more than a dozen bitcoins at Mt. Gox, isn’t optimistic of a payout soon. “It’s a legal twilight zone,” he says. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it took several years more.”\n\nThe court-appointed trustee in Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy, Nobuaki Kobayashi, did not respond to questions from Reuters about the payout process.\n\nThere are few better examples of the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies than Mt. Gox. As Reuters reported in September, cryptocurrency exchanges – where digital coins are bought, sold and stored – are largely unregulated and have become magnets for fraud and deception. At least 10 of them have closed, often after thefts, leaving customers without their funds.\n\nIn all, more than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges since 2011 – two-thirds of those from Mt. Gox. Today, all of the stolen coins would be worth more than $6 billion, Reuters has calculated.\n\nMt. Gox is one of the few collapsed exchanges that ended up in bankruptcy court; some just vanished. But the problem for Mt. Gox’s thousands of creditors is that under Japanese bankruptcy law, their claims were valued at the market price of bitcoin in April 2014 just before the Tokyo District Court ordered the exchange be liquidated. At that time, one bitcoin was worth $483. On the basis of the April 2014 value, the claims ultimately approved were fixed at 45.6 billion Japanese yen, currently about $400 million.\n\nBased on the current price of bitcoin, Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy trustee is sitting on enough cash to repay creditors whose claims have been approved more than three times that amount, according to Reuters’ calculation.\n\nBut that likely won’t happen, according to two Japanese bankruptcy attorneys. In Japan, by law any funds left over in a bankrupt company’s estate after creditors have been paid go to shareholders. Mt. Gox is 88 percent owned by a Japanese company called Tibanne. And Mark Karpeles, a 32-year-old French software engineer and Mt. Gox’s former chief executive, owns 100 percent of Tibanne.\n\nKarpeles is currently on trial in Tokyo, accused of embezzling money from Mt. Gox and manipulating its data, as well as breach of trust. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, some of which carry sentences of up to 10 years. He served nearly a year in jail following his arrest in August 2015.\n\nMany creditors are livid at the prospect of a payout for Karpeles, whom they blame for Mt. Gox’s failure. “If the government just took all of it, that would be less offensive than if they just gave it to Mark,” said Aaron Gutman, a software developer who had about 464 bitcoins at Mt. Gox, which are now worth about $3 million.\n\n“It’s a legal twilight zone. I wouldn’t be surprised if it took several years more.”\n\nAdded Henry Dienn, a 61-year-old entrepreneur in Japan who had 175 bitcoins at Mt. Gox: “Some of the people say, ‘I’d rather see the money burned.’”\n\nIn a three-hour interview, Karpeles told Reuters he doesn’t want the money. The main reason: He expects he would be inundated with lawsuits. He says he already is facing about a half dozen.\n\n“I don’t want to be the beneficiary of this,” he said. “I don’t really need money. I work, I get by.”\n\nKarpeles also told Reuters he has been exploring a way to resurrect Mt. Gox under new management and ownership - at an estimated cost of $245 million.\n\nAmong the factors complicating the liquidation process is a U.S. tech company called CoinLab. It agreed to partner with Mt. Gox in 2012, and is pursuing claims in a Japanese court totaling about $170 million against both Mt. Gox and Tibanne.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Peter Vessenes, CoinLab’s former CEO who had signed the agreement with Mt. Gox, declined to answer any questions, including whether CoinLab is still in business.\n\nCoinLab has been struck off the corporate registry in Washington state. In Delaware, state records and interviews show its registration status is “void” and it owes more than $400,000 in unpaid taxes.\n\nKarpeles, who is required to attend various bankruptcy hearings and is forbidden from leaving Japan, said Mt. Gox’s claimants will be lucky to be paid anything before 2020 - the year Tokyo is set to host the summer Olympics.\n\nOn paper, Karpeles, who himself is in personal bankruptcy, stands to gain most of the surplus. But he would not get it all. Some of the excess would be allocated to Tibanne, and another part would likely go to the owner of a 12 percent stake in Mt. Gox. Who that is remains in question.\n\nFELINE FIRM\n\nThe Mt. Gox exchange was first launched by Jed McCaleb, an American software engineer, in 2010. The domain previously had been used to trade cards in an online game.\n\nMcCaleb told Reuters in an interview that he decided he wanted to work on other projects, and transferred the exchange to Karpeles in February 2011 for free. The only conditions were that Karpeles had to share the exchange’s revenues with McCaleb for six months, not hold him legally responsible for any problems and give him a 12 percent stake. Mt. Gox became part of Tibanne, which Karpeles had formed in 2009 as a web hosting and development business. He named the company after his cat.\n\nKarpeles said when he took over Mt. Gox, it had about 3,000 customers. As bitcoin grew in popularity among tech aficionados and investors, the exchange prospered. By 2013, it had nearly 1.1 million active accounts from 239 countries and handled upwards of 90 percent of global bitcoin trading. It generated about $40 million in fees in its last year, Karpeles said.\n\nAbout 30 percent of its customers were from America, he said. Karpeles feared he was going to run into regulatory trouble there because Mt. Gox wasn’t licensed to transmit money. In November 2012, Karpeles signed an exclusive agreement with CoinLab, a Seattle-based bitcoin project incubator, to service the exchange’s U.S. and Canadian customers.\n\nThe partnership quickly soured. In a federal lawsuit filed in Washington state in May 2013, CoinLab argued that Mt. Gox and Tibanne had breached the contract by continuing to serve North American customers directly and failing to transfer their accounts to CoinLab. It demanded damages of at least $75 million.\n\nIn counterclaims filed later that year, Mt. Gox and Tibanne argued that Mt. Gox had not provided access to customer accounts because they alleged CoinLab was not properly registered or licensed to do business. They also alleged that CoinLab had not returned $5.3 million in Mt. Gox customer deposits. CoinLab said in a court filing it had complied with all relevant laws and had registered to provide bitcoin exchange services with the U.S. Treasury Department’s FinCEN bureau. The case is on hold as a result of a petition filed by the trustee in Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy, Kobayashi.\n\nRoger Ver, who is known as “Bitcoin Jesus” for his longtime evangelism for the digital currency, personifies the complexity of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. He was an early investor in CoinLab and was also a Mt. Gox customer with 577 bitcoins in his account when it shut down.\n\nVer told Reuters he urged CoinLab’s former CEO, Vessenes, to withdraw the lawsuit against Mt. Gox and Tibanne because he considered the suit “frivolous.” He did not elaborate.\n\nVer was also a customer of Bitcoinica, a New Zealand bitcoin exchange where he said he stored nearly 25,000 bitcoins. It collapsed in 2012 following thefts of tens of thousands of bitcoins that year. Bitcoinica had kept customer deposits at Mt. Gox, so the New Zealand exchange became yet another creditor in the Japanese bankruptcy. The Bitcoinica bankruptcy estate’s claims in the Mt. Gox case are valued at 3.29 billion Japanese yen, or about $29 million.\n\nMt. Gox was repeatedly robbed of bitcoins between 2011 and 2014 by unknown thieves who stole at least 650,000 bitcoins. They are now worth about $4 billion.\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2014, Mt. Gox said it had detected “unusual activity” on its bitcoin wallets and halted withdrawals. The price of bitcoins on Mt. Gox plunged.\n\nLater that month, Mt. Gox halted all trading and filed for bankruptcy protection at Tokyo District Court. At first, the exchange said that nearly all of the bitcoins in its possession – about 850,000 – were missing. But it later located 202,185 bitcoins in storage and on its system.\n\nMt. Gox founder McCaleb said that in April 2014, before the court-ordered liquidation, he signed an agreement to sell his 12 percent stake to Sunlot Holdings, a Cyprus-registered company, for one bitcoin. Sunlot at the time was trying to purchase most of Mt. Gox and resurrect it, but the plan fell through.\n\nMcCaleb said he never received the bitcoin. “It’s unclear to me whether the sale was actually completed,” McCaleb said. “It’s in this weird gray zone.”\n\nA spokesman for John Betts, who was part of the Sunlot investment group, declined to comment on the status of the sale.\n\nThis past summer, U.S. authorities announced they had found at least one person involved with the Mt. Gox hacks.\n\nIn July, a U.S. grand jury indicted Alexander Vinnik, a 37-year-old Russian, accusing him of operating an unlicensed money-service business, money laundering and other crimes. In its indictment, the government alleged Vinnik had received funds from the Mt. Gox hacks and laundered them through online exchanges including BTC-e, an exchange he operated, and Tradehill, a now-defunct San Francisco-based exchange. He remains in jail in Greece and is seeking to have his case heard in Russia, not the United States.\n\nAlexandros Lykourezos, an Athens attorney who represents Vinnik, said his client rejects all of the indictment’s allegations. “He says he has nothing to do with the Mt. Gox incident,” the attorney said.\n\nMULTIPLE BANKRUPTCIES\n\nMt. Gox initially filed for a form of bankruptcy that allowed the exchange to be sold, and briefly considered offers from potential buyers, including Sunlot. But a deal never happened.\n\nOn April 24, 2014, the Tokyo District Court ordered Mt. Gox to be liquidated. Kobayashi, a veteran Japanese bankruptcy lawyer, was appointed trustee.\n\nKobayashi filed a petition with a U.S. bankruptcy court that led to CoinLab’s 2013 lawsuit against Mt. Gox being put on hold. He began conducting meetings to brief creditors several times a year, and posting reports online about the progress of the bankruptcy in both Japanese and English.\n\nAs he sought to protect Mt. Gox’s estate, Kobayashi created bankruptcies within bankruptcies. He asked the Tokyo District Court to put Tibanne, Mt. Gox’s parent company, into bankruptcy on the grounds that he had been unable to get Tibanne to repay debts to Mt. Gox, according to a trustee report to creditors. The trustee also put Karpeles into personal bankruptcy.\n\nDifferent trustees were appointed to handle those cases. Kobayashi filed claims against both Tibanne and Karpeles.\n\nKobayashi set up an online system for filing claims; 24,750 former Mt. Gox customers ultimately sought compensation. He valued bitcoin claims at $483 per digital coin, the market price on the day before the liquidation order, and converted that value into Japanese yen.\n\n“Those of us who were burned by this are now permanently locked into that depressed price,” said Gutman, the software developer and Mt. Gox creditor.\n\nAccording to Kobayashi’s most recent status report on the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, dated Sept. 27, as trustee he has received 163.7 million yen, or about $1.4 million, in fees since his appointment.\n\nKobayashi also recently reached a settlement with the U.S. government. He recouped for the estate $2.6 million - half the funds U.S. authorities seized from Mt. Gox in 2013 for operating in the United States without a license. The United States got to keep the other $2.6 million. No creditors have benefited.\n\nAmong the claims the trustee needs to evaluate is the one from CoinLab, the U.S. bitcoin tech firm that sued Mt. Gox and Tibanne in 2013 in the United States. With its lawsuit put on hold, it filed a claim for about 8.7 billion yen, or about $75 million, in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, a court filing in Japan shows. It also filed a claim in Tibanne’s bankruptcy case for about 10.8 billion Japanese yen, or $95 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Tibanne case records are not public so Reuters was unable to determine the basis for this claim.\n\nIn interviews, Karpeles and several creditors, including Ver, blamed Vessenes, CoinLab’s former chief executive, for holding up compensation to Mt. Gox’s former customers. Records in the Mt. Gox case show the trustee rejected CoinLab’s claims but the company petitioned for a reassessment, which Karpeles and some creditors say has caused delays. According to Japanese bankruptcy lawyers, claimants are unlikely to be paid until disputes over large claims are settled.\n\nA spokesperson for Vessenes, ex-CEO of CoinLab, said he was unable to comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nCRACKS APPEAR AMONGST CREDITORS\n\nWith the price of bitcoin soaring in 2017 – it’s up more than seven-fold this year – some Mt. Gox customers are hoping the bankruptcy trustee will revalue their claims. But disputes have emerged over the best way to convince him to do that.\n\nSome want to form a creditors’ committee to increase leverage. That involves getting a majority of the creditors – more than 12,000 – to support the plan, according to Japanese bankruptcy law.\n\nJapanese bankruptcy lawyers told Reuters that creditor committees are rare in insolvency cases. The court also would need to recognize the committee, they said.\n\nOne creditor supporting a committee is Kolin Burges, a British software developer and cryptocurrency investor who had 311 bitcoins at Mt. Gox, about two-thirds of his savings. He said he recognized the difficulty of getting so many creditors to sign up and of convincing the court that the group fairly represents all creditors.\n\n“It’s going to be a tough task,” he said.\n\nDaniel Kelman, an American lawyer in Taiwan who had 44.5 bitcoin - today worth about $310,000 - stored with Mt. Gox, predicts further disputes. “People are going to fight over the value of claims,” he said. “For sure.”\n\nThere’s also the issue of paying shareholders in Mt. Gox and Tibanne, rather than creditors.\n\nLike Karpeles, McCaleb, Mt. Gox’s founder, told Reuters that he didn’t “want to make money” from the bankruptcy. McCaleb said he would give “as much as possible” from any money he received to creditors – minus any legal costs or taxes.\n\n“The people that are more hurt by the whole Mt. Gox fiasco are more deserving,” he said. “It seems kind of silly that Mark or I would get it.”\n\nMeanwhile, Mt. Gox’s bitcoin assets keep climbing in value. In August, bitcoin’s underlying software code split, creating a clone called “bitcoin cash.” In addition to the 202,185 bitcoins that it already had, the Mt. Gox estate now owns an equal number of bitcoin cash digital coins. Those are now worth about $200 million, while the bitcoins are worth about $1.4 billion.\n\nIn his latest status report on Mt. Gox, Kobayashi said he wished to proceed with distributing the assets “as soon as possible,” but that the timing and method “have not yet been determined.”\n\nAlexandra Harney reported from Tokyo and Shanghai. Steve Stecklow reported from Tokyo and London.\n\nFixing Mt. Gox To solve the Mt. Gox bankruptcy mess, its former chief executive says he is exploring a dramatic solution – reviving the exchange so it can start generating money again. Mark Karpeles told Reuters he believes Mt. Gox, which collapsed in 2014, could be resurrected under new management and ownership – at a cost of $245 million. He said he would have no role and would only receive “money for required expenses, mostly legal.” Karpeles is currently on trial in Japan, accused of embezzling money from Mt. Gox and manipulating its data, as well as breach of trust. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He said the $245 million would be needed to set up a fund to cover possible payments to “uncooperative creditors,” to fund a year’s operating expenses and future cash flow, for compliance in the United States, Europe and Japan, and to convince creditors to support the plan. To raise the money, he proposes either finding a buyer for Mt. Gox or conducting an online fundraiser. Karpeles explains his thinking in a blog. If Mt. Gox were to resume business, as unlikely as that may seem, Karpeles said he would have “no role nor benefit at all, except for the fact people may hate me a little less.”\n\nMountain of Trouble By Alexandra Harney and Steve Stecklow Photo editing: Simon Newman Graphics: Maryanne Murray Video: Michelle Hennessy Design: Catherine Tai Edited by Janet McBride and Richard Woods', 'Unlike his fellow Wall Street bigwigs, James Gorman has not been scathing of Bitcoin, but neither has he been gushing. Now, as Bitcoin’s boom has continued, Gorman looks to be trying to play down the huge growth.\n\nThe CEO from Wall Street has said the cryptocurrency ""doesn\'t quite deserve the attention it\'s getting.""\n\nGorman sees the growth as speculation and warns people of the effects a speculative market can bring, seemingly trying to play down the unprecedented asset growth.\n\nNot even close to a safe investment\n\nThe way in which Bitcoin has been viewed by the traditionalist and institutionalized money movers in Wall Street has seen them divided. Some, like Dimon, look to tear it apart with vitriol, while others, like Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein and Fidelity Investments Abigail Johnson, are much more welcoming.\n\nThen there are the middle-grounders, such as Gorman, who on one hand praise -however lightly- Bitcoin, but then try and belittle its growth.\n\n""Something that goes up 700 percent in a year — it\'s by definition speculative,"" he said. ""So anybody who thinks they\'re buying something that it\'s a stable investment is deluding themselves.""\n\n""It might go up another 700 percent but it could easily not,"" Gorman added.\n\nChances missed?\n\nIt sometimes seems that these captains of industry are suffering from a case of sour grapes. Bitcoin, as an opportunity, is unprecedented and now with teenagers and mothers able to cash in and profit more than Wall Street bankers in their traditional means- it hurts them.\n\nDespite the long-term future of Bitcoin, there are some that are not letting the current wave miss them out.\n\nMike Novogratz, a former manager at fortress investments, has said:\n\n“This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes.”\n\n“Prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be. You can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.”\n\nThis traditional investor is happy to make hay while the sun shines, leaving those who are speculating about a speculative market to speculate out in the cold.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nNo one knows where Bitcoin will be in 10 years or five, or one for that matter, however, what is apparent now is that there is money to be made.\n\nFor investors, staring at something that has currently made over 700 percent gains in less than a year and to do nothing about it, screams of missed opportunity.\n\nSome excuses are as stale as the banking bureaucracy that governs Wall Street. Regulations, central banks, anonymity and criminal activities are all spouted as reasons not to get involved.\n\nHowever, for people whose sole purpose is to profit, the rhetoric surrounding Bitcoin’s negative side should not be a reason to ignore it.\n\nIn a letter to its investors, clients and portfolio managers, JP Morgan Analyst Robert D. Boroujerdi wrote:\n\n""With the total value nearly $120 bln, it’s getting harder for institutional investors to ignore cryptocurrencies. There are currently over 800 cryptocurrencies out there, though just nine have a market cap in excess of $1 bln.”\n\nThis was only three months ago, and that $120 bln figure is nearly doubled...', 'TOKYO (Reuters) - Bitcoin BTC=BTSP is in a bubble and its fair value should be around $100, or about 99 percent below the current level, Katsunori Sago, chief investment officer of Japan Post Bank (7182.T) said on Thursday.\n\nThe bank could consider buying the digital currency if it falls to $100, but has no plans to short-sell bitcoin because it is too volatile, he added.\n\nThe current bitcoin craze is worse than the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s that eventually busted in 2000, Sago said.\n\n“During the information technology bubble, we saw a rally in dot-com company shares. But at least at that time, there were people using Yahoo or (Japanese internet firm) Rakuten -- people were using their services,” he said.\n\n“But this time, I see quite a lot of people doing crypto-currency businesses in my circle of friends. But I hardly know anyone in person who is trading crypto-currencies and I haven’t seen anyone using them in real life,” he said.\n\n“So in that sense, it’s worse than the IT bubble,” he added.\n\nSago also said he found it troubling when a friend who has no background in the financial industry recently asked his opinion of crypto-currencies.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n“When people who have nothing to do with finance ask me that sort of question, normally that market will get into trouble in a few months. According to knowledge from my experience, it is a very important signal for me,” noting that he had a similar experience twice, once before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and another in 2007, when stock prices peaked in many countries.\n\nSago said bitcoin’s rally could end after its price hits the $10,000 mark or right before the CME Group launches bitcoin futures some time by the end of this year.\n\nThe futures contract is expected to make it possible for institutional investors to short the digital currency.\n\nBut Sago said it is hard to predict when and where a bubble will burst, and therefore, the bank is not interested in shorting bitcoin.\n\nSago noted that blockchain is a great technology and one day bitcoin could become a major means of settlement.\n\n“But that will be years away, possibly more than a decade -- so there’s no need to buy bitcoin now. Since no one knows when the bubble will burst, the best thing to do here is to stay away from it,” he said.\n\n($1 = 113.00 yen)', 'Gregory Meyer and Nicole Bullock in New York and Joe Rennison and Alexandra Scaggs in Florida NOVEMBER 16, 2017 53 Traders eagerly awaiting the debut of bitcoin futures will face tougher risk standards says the chief executive of the CME Group as the exchange operator plans to launch contracts on the highly volatile cryptocurrency. Terry Duffy, CME chief executive, told the Financial Times he wants to lure a new generation of futures traders attracted by the cryptocurrency boom, although he acknowledges the challenges of creating a market infrastructure that can safely handle the hair-raising swings of bitcoin. That may entail traders of CME bitcoin futures having to deposit close to 30 per cent of their value as collateral, says Mr Duffy, who is competing with a rival offering from Chicago neighbour, Cboe Global Markets. The exchanges’ moves represent a first step by traditional institutions to take a serious look at a cryptocurrency, often associated with money-laundering and cyber theft. There are, however, worries that the launch exposes new risks to important financial bodies such as clearing houses that guarantee futures markets.  “Listen, it’s no mystery, this is a different product,” says Mr Duffy. “We want to get out something that’s safe.”  At CME, no bitcoin futures trading will be permitted at prices 20 per cent above or below the prior day’s settlement, according to exchange literature. That is similar to its circuit breakers for stock-index futures.  Share this graphic CME will also require bitcoin futures traders to post greater margin, or good-faith collateral, held against a losing position. “The margin is yet to be decided, but it’s not going to be standard futures margin. This margin is probably going to be closer to 30 per cent,” Mr Duffy says. Typical futures margins are in single-digit percentages.  Some are concerned about the dangers posed by such a market to massive clearing houses that help curtail systemic risk. Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers, this week took out a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal to argue that bitcoin futures endangered the CME clearing house where his company has money at stake as a member. He urged regulators to require separate, ringfenced clearing houses for cryptocurrencies.  “Margining such a product in a reasonable manner is impossible,” Mr Peterffy wrote, adding that “a large cryptocurrency price move that destabilises members that clear cryptocurrencies will destabilise the clearing organisation itself”.  Prices for the two rivals’ bitcoin futures will be based on spot bitcoin transactions at cryptocurrency exchanges whose record raises concern among financiers. Share this graphic CME intends to use the CME CF bitcoin Reference Rate, a daily dollar price of bitcoin derived from prices at four bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken. Six bitcoin exchanges underpinned the index as recently as April, when CME removed the Bitfinex and OKCoin exchanges after banks blocked their customers from wiring dollars in and out.  Last year, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex lost more than $60m worth of bitcoin to hackers and was fined by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission “for offering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodity transactions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” and failing to register. A message sent to Bitfinex chief executive J L van der Velde received no response.  San Francisco-based Kraken yesterday told customers its platform was seeing slow response times, connection timeouts and delays in withdrawals. A CME official says the problems did not interrupt the calculation of its bitcoin rate. Kraken did not respond to queries.  John Lothian, a former futures trader and broker who publishes a markets newsletter, says of CME’s venture: “They’re giving legitimacy to bitcoin and to these exchanges. They’re sharing their credibility with them. Whether they will be hurt by this or whether they profit by this is yet to be seen.”  The Cboe contract will be based on bitcoin auction prices at Gemini Trust, a New York-based cryptocurrency exchange. “The Gemini bitcoin auction is an incredible liquidity event for bitcoin,” says John Deters, Cboe chief strategy officer.  Yet Don Wilson, chief of DRW, a leading derivatives and cryptocurrencies trader, expressed concern about Gemini at a futures industry conference in Chicago last month. “Some of the auctions are pretty thinly traded,” he says, noting a recent one did not take place. A person close to Gemini blamed a glitch that has been fixed.

11/17/2017,"['In early September, one Bitcoin was worth almost $5,000. Then the Chinese government cracked down on cryptocurrency investments, and Bitcoin\'s value plunged 40 percent in a matter of days, reaching a low below $3,000.\n\nBut Bitcoin bounced back. By early November, one Bitcoin was worth almost $8,000. Then last week, a controversial effort to expand the Bitcoin network\'s capacity failed. Within days, Bitcoin\'s price had plunged 25 percent, while the value of a rival network called Bitcoin Cash doubled.\n\nToday, Bitcoin has recovered all of last week\'s losses—one Bitcoin is now worth more than $7,800.\n\nBitcoin\'s recoveries haven\'t been very surprising to long-time Bitcoin watchers. Over and over again, Bitcoin\'s value has seen spectacular plunges only to recover the lost ground and rise to new heights. Bitcoin has seen at least three major Bitcoin ""bubbles"" over its seven-year life.\n\nFurther Reading Explaining the new cryptocurrency bubble—and why it might not be all bad Each time, a huge price gain was followed by a spectacular crash, leading many people to declare that the currency had been nothing more than a bubble. Each time, the currency has defied critics, regaining the previous highs and then pushing still higher.\n\nToday\'s Bitcoin price might represent a bubble, in retrospect. But it\'s past time to acknowledge that Bitcoin isn\'t only a bubble.\n\nLots of prominent people think otherwise, of course. JPMorgan Chase\'s CEO labeled the currency a ""fraud"" in September. That sentiment has been prominently echoed abroad. ""I just don\'t believe in this bitcoin thing,"" Saudi Arabia\'s Prince Alwaleed said. ""I think it\'s just going to implode one day. I think this is Enron in the making.""\n\nBut here\'s the thing: people have been predicting Bitcoin\'s impending demise for years, and they\'ve consistently been wrong. Even if Bitcoin were to lose 90 percent of its value in the coming weeks, it would still be worth around $800—a value many people dismissed as an absurd bubble four years ago. If it lost 99 percent of its value, it would be worth $80—a value that would have been considered absurdly high less than five years ago.\n\nBlockchains are an important new technology, and cryptocurrencies are a fundamentally new asset class. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, might be overvalued right now, but it might not be. Either way, it certainly isn\'t going to suffer an Enron-style collapse.\n\nBitcoin is digital gold\n\nAdoption of the PC was driven by the invention of the spreadsheet and word processing. The Internet became a mainstream technology thanks largely to the World Wide Web. I\'ve been looking for Bitcoin\'s similar ""killer app"" since I started covering Bitcoin in 2011.\n\nBack then, I argued that international money transfers could be Bitcoin\'s killer app, allowing money to be sent around the globe faster and more cheaply than was possible before. Today, plenty of people are working on that idea, but so far it hasn\'t gained significant traction—hampered in part by the Bitcoin network\'s rising transactions fees.\n\nLast year, I argued that Bitcoin still hadn\'t discovered a killer app that would allow it to disrupt mainstream financial markets. One year later, I still think that\'s true.\n\nIt\'s possible Bitcoin will never pose a serious threat to conventional payment networks like Visa or MasterCard. And the recent failure of an effort to expand the Bitcoin network\'s throughput suggests that the Bitcoin community isn\'t serious about disrupting the mainstream payments business—though the Bitcoin Cash spinoff network might be.\n\nBut even if Bitcoin never finds its killer app, that won\'t necessarily cause Bitcoin\'s value to fall.\n\nThink about gold. Gold certainly has useful applications, from jewelry to electronics. But a lot of of the world\'s gold isn\'t being put into consumer products. Instead, it\'s being stored in big vaults—and under people\'s floorboards—as a disaster-proof store of value. Many people believe that if the global financial system were to collapse, gold is one of the few items that\'s guaranteed to maintain its value. Gold can also be stored and moved in a way that can\'t easily be tracked by the authorities.\n\nPeople believe this even though gold\'s value is volatile compared to the dollar or other conventional currencies. And they believe in gold\'s value despite the fact that no powerful institution has committed to uphold gold\'s value.\n\nObviously, Bitcoin is different from gold in many ways, but there are important similarities. Its value is a social convention, just as gold\'s value is. And as we\'ve learned in the last few years, the social convention of Bitcoin\'s value is surprisingly durable. Over and over again, Bitcoin\'s value has plunged, only to recover.\n\nThe decentralized, global nature of the Bitcoin network makes it unlikely the network will ever be entirely shut down. As long as the global Internet exists, there is likely to be at least one country that tolerates the operation of Bitcoin mining hardware.\n\nBitcoin is easy to store and transport without being traced by the authorities. You can obviously send bitcoins electronically without the know-your-customer checks that apply to conventional financial networks. You can also print out your private Bitcoin keys to create a supremely lightweight and portable way to store and transport value in the physical world.\n\nMost people don\'t need or want to own any bitcoins, but of course most people don\'t need to own gold either. But there have been enough people who want to own gold to push the value of all gold in circulation to around $6 trillion.\n\nThe world\'s bitcoins are worth a comparatively paltry $130 billion. Bitcoin competitors like ether and bitcoin cash are worth another $100 billion. That\'s absurdly high compared to the value of cryptocurrencies a couple of years ago. But it\'s really not that much money compared with gold—to say nothing of conventional asset classes like stocks and bonds.\n\nThe lesson here isn\'t that you should run out and buy bitcoins. Like gold, bitcoins don\'t pay any dividends, so in the long run you should expect bitcoin holdings to under-perform stocks and bonds. But the point is, it\'s not crazy to think that bitcoins could maintain their value over the long run. Bitcoin may not be useful for very much beyond being a way to store value, but the same is true of gold—and gold has stayed valuable for thousands of years now.\n\nCorrection: This article originally said most gold is held as an investment, but it\'s actually a bit less than half.', 'Bitcoin prices surpassed $8,000 today, as anticipation surrounding the hard fork helped drive the digital currency\'s price higher.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rose to as much as $8,004.59 on CoinMarketCap at 01:14 UTC.\n\nAt this price, Bitcoin prices have climbed more than 725% year-to-date (YTD), additional CoinMarketCap figures show.\n\nThe world\'s largest digital currency by trading volume has broken through several key milestones this year, including $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 and more recently $8,000.\n\nHard Fork Anticipation\n\nMarket analysts have pointed to several variables when explaining Bitcoin\'s sharp gains, but recently, the latest developments surrounding the SegWit2x hard fork hace drawn significant attention.\n\nCharles Hayter, c0-founder and CEO of digital currency platform CryptoCompare, cited anticipation surrounding this event as a major factor driving Bitcoin prices higher.\n\nThis fork, which was designed to double the size of Bitcoin\'s blocks from 1MB to 2MB, was originally called off earlier this month due to a lack of support, according to CoinDesk.\n\nHowever, a small group of developers announced that they would press on with the hard fork anyways. Coinbase wrote a blog post announcing that that starting at 2 a.m. Pacific Time today, it would prevent users from sending and receiving bitcoin in order to protect their funds.\n\nFurther, the exchange operator revealed that beginning one hour before the hard fork was scheduled to take place, which was estimated to be between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. Pacific Time, it would prevent users from buying and selling the digital currency.\n\nPotential Tailwinds For Bitcoin Investors\n\nTheoretically, anyone holding Bitcoin at the time of the hard fork would receive ""free currency"" should the fork cause the digital currency\'s blockchain to split in two.\n\nHowever, even if the blockchain splits in this manner, nobody knows for certain which of these two chains will draw the majority of hashing power, and whether the less popular chain will be able to survive for long.\n\nIf one of the chains lacks the hashing power to process transactions in a timely manner, market participants could quickly shun it.\n\nWhat\'s Next For Bitcoin?\n\nNow that Bitcoin has broken through $8,000, where will it go next?\n\nAccording to some analysts, Bitcoin\'s next price target is $10,000.\n\nIqbal Gandham, UK managing director of social trading platform eToro, emphasized that recent developments in the space have made this price a possibility.\n\n""I believe with CME futures launching and large hedge funds in the UK also starting to take interest, the price point of 10K is doable,"" he said.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, also identified this figure as a key price level, stating that:\n\n""The only two levels that matter are $10,000 and $5,000. The rest is just noise.""\n\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.', 'As the political turmoil in Zimbabwe has increased, so has the price of bitcoin.\n\nThis week, at the same time military leaders were placing longtime president Robert Mugabe under house arrest, rising demand pushed the cost of one bitcoin in the African nation to $13,000 U.S. That\'s double the international rate, CNN Money reports.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, bitcoin and other digital currencies are becoming more popular in countries like Zimbabwe as people lose faith in their local currency and financial institutions amid political and economic upheaval.\n\n""Bitcoin is a safe haven for people around the world who don\'t trust their governments,"" Andrew Milne, chief investment officer and co-founder of cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Altana Digital Currency Fund, tells Bloomberg.

This week, ironically, JPMorgan was cracked down for money laundering, after being fined $4 billion for mortgage fraud in September, merely two months ago.\n\nDimon and JPMorgan Criticized\n\nSince early 2016, JPMorgan and its CEO Jamie Dimon have focused on attempting to commercialize and market the term ‘blockchain” to compete with bitcoin. The company has seen hardly any success with its blockchain technology “Quorum,” which was developed by the JPMorgan development team within the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA).\n\nRealizing the lack of potential, applicability, and commercial success of permissioned blockchain technology, Dimon began to take a different approach; by directly condemning bitcoin, despite the harsh criticisms of highly respected venture capitalists and experts such as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, prominent venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, and billionaire hedge fund legend Mike Novogratz.\n\nIn response to Dimon’s comments, Wozniak emphasized that bitcoin is the most legitimate system that exists, because it is decentralized, transparent, and operates on a peer-to-peer network that is censorship resistant. Wozniak stated at the Money2020 conference:\n\n“Bitcoin is mathematical. I am a mathematician. There are only 21 million. It is more legitimate than other systems. There is a certain finite amount of bitcoin that can ever exist. Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but Bitcoin is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.”\n\nIn spite of criticisms from experts, Dimon continued to push through with his agenda and condemn bitcoin publicly, while JPMorgan traders and their clients have invested in bitcoin through the Swedish stock market Nordic Nasdaq.\n\nDimon Falsely Accuses Bitcoin of Being Money Laundering Tool\n\nDimon falsely accused bitcoin of being a money laundering tool earlier this year. Then, JPMorgan was fined $4 billion for committing mortgage fraud, and has been busted for money laundering.\n\nToday, ironically, leading Swiss daily news publication Handelszeitung reported that the Swiss subsidiary of JPMorgan was charged by the Swiss regulator, FINMA, for money laundering and “seriously violating supervision laws.”\n\nSubsequent to inaccurately portraying bitcoin as a fraudulent financial network, JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon have been exposed of two major scandals and fraudulent operations.\n\nVarious studies since 2016 have shown that the majority of millennials feel disconnected from the banking sector and do not trust major financial institutions with their wealth, capital, and investment. The hypocrisy and the conceitful nature of major banks and financial service provider will only result in the demise of the finance industry in the long-term, as decentralized networks continue to render intermediaries obsolete.\n\nFalse accusations and depictions of bitcoin by Dimon and other bank executives will only hasten the mainstream adoption of bitcoin and the migration of wealth from the traditional finance sector to decentralized cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shuttestock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Three Irish men arrested in the Netherlands during a major police operation against international drugs trafficking and money laundering have appeared in court in Amsterdam.\n\nThe men, one from Dublin and two from Limerick, were detained in raids on Thursday.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""According to Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and former executive at Coinbase, most innovative works done by Bitcoin developers and projects directly benefit Litecoin given the structural similarities between Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nLee explained:\n\n“Every Bitcoin developer also works on Litecoin. Absolutely nothing they can do about that. If you don't like that Litecoin piggybacks off of Bitcoin developers' hard work, it is because you care more about Bitcoin making you rich than crypto changing the world.”\n\nThe statement of Lee was released after significant progress has been made with the Confidential Transactions solution. On the Bitcoin Mailing List, Bitcoin Core Developer Greg Maxwell revealed a breakthrough with the solution, which has decreased the size of Confidential Transactions from 16x the normal size to 3x. Maxwell added that the reduction in the size of Confidential Transactions maximizes the applicability of the solution, improving privacy measures of the Bitcoin Blockchain network. Maxwell said:\n\n“This work also allows arbitrarily complex conditions to be proven in the values, not just simple ranges, with proofs logarithmic in the size of the arithmetic circuit representing the conditions being proved--and still with no trusted setup. As a result, it potentially opens up many other interesting applications as well.”\n\nConfidential transactions also applicable with Litecoin\n\nLike Lightning and SegWit, Confidential Transactions is a solution that is applicable to Litecoin, given its structure that is nearly identical with Bitcoin. Hence, after Bitcoin’s integration of Confidential Transations, Litecoin will be able to implement the same solution, increasing the privacy of the Litecoin network and its transactions.\n\nFor years, despite the emergence of several privacy-focused solutions such as MimbleWimble, privacy has been an issue for Bitcoin and Litecoin, as the transparent Blockchain networks of both cryptocurrencies enable anyone within the network to trace wallet addresses and transactions through public Blockchain explorers. More to that, strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies enforced by governments have made it challenging for businesses to implement necessary privacy measures for the benefit of users.\n\nUpon its integration, Confidential Transactions would provide drastic improvement in privacy by effectively hiding transaction amounts. Although Bitcoin addresses and transactions can still be traced through Blockchain explorers, because the amount of transactions is hidden, Confidential Transactions restrict the extent to which authorities or third party service providers can surveil on Bitcoin users.\n\nMaxwell explained:\n\n“This approach makes transaction amounts private--known only to the sender, the receiver, and whichever parties they choose to share the information with through sharing watching keys or through revealing single transactions. While that, combined with pseudonymous addresses, is a pretty nice privacy improvement in itself, it turns out that these blinded commitments also perfectly by avoiding the issue of joins being decoded due to different amounts being used.”\n\nBenefits for Litecoin\n\nBitcoin has a more vibrant, active, and larger open source development community than Litecoin, likely because the market valuation of Bitcoin is significantly larger than that of Litecoin. Since developers, open source projects and commercial companies tend to deploy software and develop code around the more prominent platform; Bitcoin is likely to see a higher amount of solutions and commitments proposed by its community of developers.\n\nLitecoin’s structure also directly benefits Bitcoin, as it can function as a testbed for Bitcoin’s solutions. For instance, SegWit was integrated into the Litecoin’s codebase prior to Bitcoin, and the stability of Litecoin’s codebase subsequent to its integration of SegWit led to increased support for SegWit within the Bitcoin community."", 'A Mt Gox initial coin offering (ICO)? It\'s not unthinkable, according to the defunct bitcoin exchange\'s controversial CEO.\n\nIn a blog post published yesterday, Mark Karpeles detailed possible avenues for reviving Mt Gox, the once-dominant Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement in early 2014. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin – at then-current prices – were feared lost, though ultimately 202,000 BTC were retained as assets, under the custody of a trustee.\n\nIn the aftermath, Mt Gox entered bankruptcy, and has since been at the center of an acrimonious, years-long claims process, including a $75 million claim from CoinLab. Prosecutors in Japan later charged Karpeles with embezzlement, with that trial beginning earlier this summer.\n\nThe blog post also addressed a recent bone of contention: while the value of the remaining Gox BTC has swelled as bitcoin\'s price has climbed to close to $8,000 per coin, those seeking to recoup their losses may ultimately collect much less, if anything.\n\nAnd while some are clamoring for that increase in value to be factored into the payouts, Karpeles pushed back on the idea in the blog post, stating that those gains haven\'t actually been realized yet, among other complications (the bitcoins remain in the custody of the Mt Gox trustee).\n\nOne possible avenue around the issue: reviving Mt Gox, with a price tag of $245 million. This could be accomplished either through a recapitalization by way of an equity sale or an ICO, according to Karpeles.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n""Launch an ICO to raise money to hypothetically revive MtGox. This sounds more challenging, both legally and because there is no guarantee of raising enough to revive MtGox. In case there is not enough raised it could still be locked to be distributed to creditors, which would be better than nothing.""\n\nAnd in a seeming acknowledgement that the idea is rather far-fetched at present, Karpeles suggested that anyone interested in recapitalizing the exchange should get in touch.\n\n""Should anyone have 245 million USD sitting around and want to purchase MtGox, just drop me an email,"" he wrote.\n\nImage via CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Still, events such as a bitcoin-funded terrorist attack are potential risks which are hard to evaluate, he said.\n\n“All it would take would be one terrorist incident in the U.S. funded by bitcoin for the U.S. regulator to much more seriously step in and take action, he said. “That’s a risk, an unquantifiable risk, bitcoin has that another currency doesn’t.""\n\nWhile skeptics have called bitcoin’s rapid advance a bubble, it has become too big an asset for many financial firms to ignore. Bitcoin has gained 17 percent this week, touching a high of $7,997.17 during Asia hours before moving lower in late trading. The rally through Friday came after bitcoin wiped out as much as $38 billion in market capitalization following the cancellation of a technology upgrade known as SegWit2x on Nov. 8.\n\nUBS Chairman Axel Weber this month said Bitcoin was a speculative investment and not a store of value, while Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Tidjane Thiam described the speculation around bitcoin as the “very definition of a bubble.” JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin “a fraud” that will eventually blow up.\n\nPutin’s View\n\nRussia’s President Vladimir Putin last month flagged the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering, tax evasion and funding for terrorism. Still, he stopped short of backing a broad ban in the country.\n\nBitcoin isn’t government-sponsored and some may use it to avoid oversight, a situation that’s “unlikely to persist forever,"" Haefele said. The CIO sees the bank’s own research into bitcoin as an opportunity to engage with clients on questions such as the role of currencies and speculative assets in a portfolio.\n\nStill, CME Group Inc., the world’s largest exchange owner, has said it plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the year, citing pent-up demand from clients. That pushes bitcoin closer to the mainstream by making it easier to trade without the hassles of owning the currency directly.\n\n“The thing that always strikes me about these, quote unquote, investments is not really when you would get into it but when you would get out of it,” Haefele said. “So how do you know when to get out of a bitcoin investment?""\n\n— With assistance by Jan-Henrik Foerster']"
11/18/2017,"['Bitcoin\'s price climbed to a new record high of more than $8,000 Friday before falling precipitously to around $5,600. At the same time, bitcoin cash, the three-month-old cryptocurrency cousin of bitcoin, also quadrupled in value overnight.\n\nNow, some analysts are wondering if the recent success of bitcoin cash indicates there are deeper rifts in the bitcoin community that may play out in different ways.\n\nThe past several weeks have been tumultuous for bitcoin. First, bitcoin developers, miners, and investors waited anxiously as an impending hard fork associated with the SegWit2x protocol approached.\n\nThen, just days before the hard fork was to be finalized, the proponents of the split called the entire thing off, pointing to a desire for unity across the different groups with an interest in the future of the cryptocurrency. (See more: What Happens Now That the Bitcoin Hard Fork Was Canceled?)\n\nScaling Question at Heart of Conflict\n\nThe fundamental reason for the disputes among bitcoin developers, miners, and investors is the question of how to scale bitcoin in order to accommodate additional transactions. Those looking to improve the cryptocurrency\'s ability to handle additional transactions say Bitcoin\'s software is in need of an upgrade.\n\nThese proponents of hard forking generally believe the currency must be properly scaled with software updates if it is ever going to catch on in the mainstream payment world. There has already been one hard fork.\n\nThree months ago, a hard fork resulted in the development of bitcoin cash. The fact that a second hard fork was planned, and that bitcoin cash has made gains while the original bitcoin faltered, points to an underlying conflict in the bitcoin community.\n\nBitcoin and Bitcoin Cash at Cross Purposes?\n\nA recent article in the MIT Technology Review suggests that ""under certain circumstances [bitcoin cash] can put a serious dent in bitcoin\'s value.""\n\nIt\'s difficult to say whether the recent downturn in bitcoin\'s price was correlated with the surge in bitcoin cash value. Nonetheless, it is a distinct possibility that investors moved toward the newer iteration of the leading cryptocurrency in response to the news of the hard fork\'s cancellation. If so, and if bitcoin cash and bitcoin are competing for the same pool of investor assets, it\'s possible the two digital currencies may impede each other\'s price gains.\n\nThere has already been substantial talk in the cryptocurrency space of a future when another digital currency (like ethereum, for example) may permanently take over the largest portion of market capitalization from bitcoin. This has not occurred yet, but it could be hastened if bitcoin cash and potential future hard fork-generated bitcoin spinoffs chip away at the original currency\'s investor interest. (See more: ""The Flippening"": Will Ethereum Take Bitcoin\'s Place?)', ""The price of Bitcoin surged by as much as 10% on the Zimbabwean exchange Golix in mid-November 2017 after the military successfully staged a coup d'état. The country is already known not to have a strong economy; Zimbabwe’s peak month of inflation was November 2008, when the rate of inflation hit an estimated at 79.6 billion percent.\n\nBased on data from the Golix website, Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed to up to $13,499 in the country, nearly double its rate in the international markets. As of November 15, Bitcoin was trading at $13,010 in the country’s capital Harare.\n\nCrisis in Zimbabwe and its effect(s) on Bitcoin\n\nThe Zimbabwean army assaulted Harare on November 14 following a week of confrontation with the administration of President Robert Mugabe. According to the army, the move was aimed at preventing an expected violent and deadly civil war in the country. Mugabe has been the country’s head since 1980.\n\nDue to the political crisis, the demand for Bitcoin in the country has skyrocketed to new highs because of a shortage of hard currency. The situation was exacerbated by the lack of national currency in Zimbabwe. In 2009, the country’s government adopted several fiat currencies like the US dollar and South African rand as a legal tender after hyperinflation turned the local dollar virtually worthless.\n\nAccording to Golix, it has processed over $1 million worth of transactions in the past 30 days, a sharp increase from its turnover of $100,000 for the entire year of 2016.\n\nAccording to Golix co-owner Taurai Chinyamakobvu, the prices for Bitcoin are determined by supply and demand. The sellers of the digital currency are paid in US dollars that are deposited electronically. The money, however, can only be converted into hard cash at a sizeable discount on the black market.\n\nOn November 15, an “electronic” dollar can purchase around eight South African rands, compared with the market exchange rate of 14.32 rands.\n\nSuch political unrest usually triggers many to turn to cryptocurrency as a form of ‘insurance’ and hedge against financial risks. For example, many Venezuelans have turned to Bitcoin mining to survive the political and financial crisis in the country."", 'Hong Kong’s bitcoin entrepreneurs say they have been forced to open bank accounts overseas to operate their businesses, after local banks froze or closed their accounts, threatening the city’s push to become a fintech hub.\n\nStaff at Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin – which allow customers to exchange their digital money for fiat currency – were left perplexed after they received a phone call from a Hang Seng Bank representative on September 15, where they held a company bank account, and were told their account was suspended without a detailed explanation.\n\n“It was a major disruption to our business,” Gatecoin marketing head Thomas Glucksmann said.\n\n“We had just tripled our customer base in a two to three month period, the price of bitcoin was rallying, the amount of money clients were depositing was increasing – the timing couldn’t have been worse.”\n\nWhile the company has had its accounts frozen with other banks before, this was first time it was suspended without prior notice, he added.\n\nSoon after, Gatecoin’s backup account with Fubon Bank was imposed with a daily transaction limit that was significantly below their needs, effectively shutting down the account.\n\nOne of bitcoin’s mission statements is to depart from the traditional banking system. But ironically, without a local bank account, new bitcoin buyers cannot purchase the digital currency.\n\nGlucksmann said the company strived to be “the most anti-money-laundering (AML) compliant, strict and transparent exchange”with its banking partners, only for their efforts to be fruitless.\n\n“We’ve been very much in favour of enforcing strict AML best practices; we do a lot of client due diligence and we don’t accept cash or cheques, because we have always wanted to make sure that we can associate every bank transfer coming in and out with the name of the client that has registered with us and we have all their [‘know your customer’ (KYC)] information,” Glucksmann said.\n\n“This way our banking partners feel satisfied that we’re able to provide [information] for their KYC and AML teams.”\n\nWithout a banking solution for its customers, Gatecoin sent an email telling them that transfers were suspended until they could find a way forward.\n\nThe announcement alarmed some customers, who subsequently contacted police, fearing that Gatecoin would meet the same fate as Mt.Gox, a Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014.\n\nA spokeswoman for Hang Seng Bank said: “We do not comment on individual cases.”\n\nA Fubon Bank spokeswoman said they could not comment on information relating to its clients, but it would “apply customer due diligence measures in a balanced manner” and “strengthen” communications with customers on account opening requirements and procedures.\n\nFailing to find a local solution, the bitcoin exchange looked overseas to fulfil their banking needs, settling for a European payments processor and a Swiss bank. But it will take two to six weeks before they can use these to transfer money to and from anxious customers.\n\nGeorge Harrap, founder of remittance payment company Bitspark, also had to resort to opening bank accounts overseas to meet his banking requirements.\n\n“Banking is a prized commodity in the bitcoin space,” he said.\n\nHarrap claimed that dozens of local banks denied his company a bank account without “any explanation”.\n\nWhile he was eventually able to open an account several months later, the uncertainty led him to change his business model by opening bank accounts in Europe and accepting cash deposits through money transfer shops that his company dealt with.\n\nBoth Harrap and Glucksmann felt that the difficulty of opening a bank account in Hong Kong tarnished the city’s reputation as a business and financial hub, and risked the government’s push to make the city a centre for fintech.\n\nGlucksmann said the government could look to Japan, which officially recognised bitcoin exchanges in September, as a blueprint on how to regulate cryptocurrency businesses, which could give banks a sense of safety to do business with them.\n\nThe Post contacted several banks about their willingness to take on cryptocurrency-related businesses. Near identical replies were received, stating that they followed regulatory requirements and due diligence on accounts avoiding any direct mention of bitcoin-related businesses.\n\nHSBC was more forthcoming. A spokesman for the banking giant said it had “very limited appetite for banking virtual currency exchanges”, but welcomed start-ups, which made up 70 per cent of new account openings each month.\n\nHong Kong’s de facto cental bank, the Monetary Authority, dismissed claims that a high number of businesses failed to open bank accounts.\n\nA spokesman said that the average account opening rejection rate was below 5 per cent per month.\n\nAccording to Hong Kong Bitcoin Association president Leo Weese, the top concern for members was getting a bank account, while losing their bank account was their “number one fear”.\n\n“The few that do have bank accounts are trying to be as cautious as possible. But ironically by being cautious they also raise red flags with banks,” he said.\n\n“There’s pretty much no way around that minefield without eventually having the account shut down.”\n\nWeese believed that the KYC cost for each banking transaction by bitcoin companies was unattractive to banks. He also suspected that banks did not want to help competitors to their business model.\n\nBut information technology lawmaker Charles Mok said the banking issues were not limited to cryptocurrency businesses. Start-ups and other fintech companies were also having difficulty opening bank accounts in Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, Mok said that the government could not claim that Hong Kong was a fintech hub without helping businesses clarify whether they may face bank account hurdles in the city.\n\nBitcoin has exploded in value, hovering at around US$7,500 per coin since the beginning of November – an almost 970 per cent increase compared to last year when the digital currency was trading at about US$700.\n\nSome bitcoin analysts have predicted that the cryptocurrency will surpass US$10,000 within the next few months.\n\nEconomists have warned that bitcoin is in a massive speculative bubble. But prophecies of its impending doom have not come to fruition and coin prices continue to set records.', 'Editor\'s note: The author, a freelance writer in the U.K., has an account at Trading 212 and was in the BCH market on Nov. 12.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash surged to a high of $2,500 last weekend, clients of Trading 212, a brokerage based in the U.K., Germany and Bulgaria, were sitting on fat profits, in some cases hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nThat is, until Sunday, when the cryptocurrency took a nosedive – and the firm suspended trading.\n\nUnable to close their positions, the affected customers could only watch as the price of bitcoin cash fell more than $800 in under an hour. Trading 212 says the suspension lasted only 10 minutes, but according to the traders, that was all it took to erase in some cases sizeable gains.\n\nNot taking it lying down, 54 customers went so far as to set up a WhatsApp group called ""People v 212,"" where they compared notes about how to reclaim their alleged missing gains.\n\nAll told, the Trading 212 clients – many of whom described their frustrations in interviews or emails – say they lost an estimated £10 million ($13.2 million), though some have settled their complaints with the company. For example, a group of traders from Cardiff, Wales, has accepted an offer to pay out a proportion, about 10 percent, of the profits they say they were owed.\n\nAside from temporarily preventing clients who had accumulated gains from cashing out, some said Trading 212 failed to execute their stop-loss or take-profit orders. The company, in turn, claims the customers whose orders were canceled had violated its contract terms.\n\n""Today we have settled with most of the affected clients,"" Borislav Nedialkov, a co-founder of Trading 212, said Friday.\n\nJustin Galvin, one of the Trading 212 customers battling to get what they see as their rightful profits, blamed the company for the situation, however. In statements, he argued the firm simply took too risky a strategy in offering the product in a nascent market.\n\nGalvin said:\n\n""In my opinion, they exercised too much risk by offering bitcoin cash to entice new customers only to have those traders beat the market by 100 times.”\n\nCFD emptor\n\nBut while bruising losses are nothing new in the crypto space, these traders hadn\'t actually purchased bitcoin cash. Rather, they had entered into contracts for difference (CFD) with Trading 212. In a CFD, traders don\'t buy assets directly but take positions on price movements. (CFDs are banned in the U.S.).\n\nThe gains and losses are amplified because the brokers allow trading at 30x to 150x margins.\n\nIn short, these entities don\'t hold any of the assets that customers are trading on. In this sense then, CFD brokers operate in a world that is more akin to betting. (Indeed, many of the companies in the sector also offer spread-betting services, although not in Trading 212\'s case.)\n\nThese companies sometimes freeze positions for short periods to manage volatility, as Trading 212 did with bitcoin cash on Sunday. In such situations, there is little clients can do if the broker prevents them from adjusting their positions in the market.\n\nThe goings on at Trading 212, then, perhaps represent a collision of worlds, where crypto traders meet old-school middlemen.\n\n""In crypto, I exit with my bitcoin profits immediately. Never leave your winning chips on the table for the dealer to see,” said Clem Chambers, chief executive of company stock analysis site ADVFN.com.\n\nTrading 212, however, is relatively new to the CFD broking game, launching its share-dealing and crypto service in June this year. Nevertheless, it has succeeded in attracting many young investors and traders. Its addition of eight cryptocurrency markets has helped it to expand.\n\nStill, many investors may have been prone to act emotionally, perhaps either not understanding, or being wilfully unaware, of the terms of the investments in which they had entered. It may be that the company concluded the Cardiff-based traders were ""trading in concert"" given that they knew each other, although the company has so far brought forward no evidence.\n\nNot used to the nature of the trading schemes that have sprouted up around the market, many were surprised, then, at the measures the company has taken.\n\nRickety markets\n\nBut Trading 212 isn\'t the only area of the crypto market to come under stress as a result of bitcoin cash\'s weekend ups and downs.\n\nBitcoin cash\'s price pullback happened at the same time as Korean exchange Bithumb began to have outages. In response, industry website CoinMarketCap stopped taking prices from the exchange, meaning 50 percent of trading volume worldwide wasn\'t shown in its charts.\n\nThree thousand Korean customers of Bithumb have launched a class action lawsuit against the exchange claiming they suffered losses as a result of the two-hour outage.\n\nPrice swings of the magnitude seen in the bitcoin market on Sunday would possibly have triggered a trading suspension on stock exchanges, but this is crypto, where no such mechanisms exist. Having said that, the market is showing signs of maturing.\n\nThe introduction of bitcoin futures by derivatives market giant CME Group will go some way to bearing down on bitcoin volatility – although some incumbents in the futures markets worry that a crypto ""virus"" could jump the species barrier and initiate a pandemic in the ""real economy."" The outbreak of influenza at Trading 212 may be an early warning sign.\n\nRegulators, it seems, are taking notice, though their main message is ""buyer beware.""\n\nFollowing the incident, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a statement on the risks of cryptocurrency CFDs. But Trading 212\'s customers are unlikely to find any consolation in its words.\n\nWhile the FCA regulates CFD brokers, it warned:\n\n""These protections will not compensate you for any losses from trading.""\n\nSince then, Trading 212 appears to be taking steps to ensure a similar situation doesn\'t repeat, announcing it was raising the deposit level required to trade on margin.\n\nMoney drain visualization image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'According to Turkish newspaper Habertürk, police recently managed to capture a gang of five extortionists in Merter, a suburb west of Istanbul, one of the country’s biggest cities, making it the first time police carried out an operation in a bitcoin-related crime in Turkey. The extortionists, according to reports, managed to steal 450 bitcoins, worth about $3.54 million, from a businessman earlier this week.\n\nThe gang followed the businessman to his car posing as police, before kidnapping him and extorting him out of his coins and online banking account passwords, while holding him at gunpoint and threatening him inside a van. The ordeal reportedly lasted eight hours before the victim was finally let go.\n\nFollowing the incident, the businessman contacted police and filed a criminal complaint. Police started investigating the case and, as the gang was presumably sloppy at covering its tracks, managed to quickly identify its members.\n\nAfter identifying those responsible for the crime, authorities launched a surveillance operation, in which they managed to know the quintet’s whereabouts and film its members as they went about their daily lives. Moreover, Turkish cybercrime officials followed the stolen funds’ trail on the blockchain, and it’s unclear whether or not these were recovered.\n\nPolice operations were successful, as the gang was then caught red-handed as it was getting ready to kidnap a second victim to extort. An investigation also found the suspects had stolen “bitcoin mining devices” from other people in the Esenler district.\n\nReports further suggest one of the gang’s leaders was convicted of extortion and sentenced 30 years in prison, while another suspect jailed for extortion seemingly managed to flee, according to the Daily Sabah.\n\nVictim Targeted for Showing off His Wealth\n\nApparently, the gang decided to target the wealthy businessman after seeing images in which he showed off an extravagant lifestyle, including meals in luxurious restaurants, on social media.\n\nAs every cryptocurrency enthusiast should by now know, showing off your wealth is never a good idea, as it’s clearly a security risk. Criminals are always looking for a way to make money, whether that means stealing someone’s cash, or someone’s bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Regulation\n\nThe Japanese Financial Services Agency has recently published a document clarifying its financial administrative policies, including its policy on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin-Based Ethereum Rival RSK Set to Launch Next Month\n\nFSA’s Policy Clarifications\n\nJapan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has recently clarified its financial administrative policies, outlining “what kind of policy the financial administration should conduct,” the agency wrote. Within the 41-page document, there is a section on cryptocurrency.\n\nThe FSA first discussed the protection of digital currency exchange users. Citing that cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain technology “which was not seen before,” the agency stated that to protect users, daily business management and system management are required.\n\n“Since the beginning of 2017, the virtual currency price fluctuations and various movements have been seen in the virtual currency market such as currency forking,” the agency continued, emphasizing the importance of establishing what influence they have on users.\n\nConsequently, the agency plans to “look at the trends in the [digital] currency market” and ensure appropriate business operations are conducted at exchanges. Moreover, the FSA affirmed that attention must be paid to “the balance between the promotion of innovation and the protection of users,” adding that:\n\nIt is necessary to monitor whether the system is in place…we will respond to changes in the environment surrounding the virtual currencies for protecting users, such as verifying [that] appropriate explanation / information provision for users is in place.\n\nIn addition, the FSA aims to ensure users’ security “through safe and stable system operation and fraud prevention.” This will be done by verifying whether an appropriate risk management system has been established at each cryptocurrency exchange. The agency will also ascertain whether effective countermeasures to prevent fraudulent acts such as money laundering have been implemented.\n\nFSA’s ICO Policy\n\nThe FSA also discussed ICOs in its document. Citing an increase in token sales which can lead to the receipt of digital currencies, the agency noted that “it is thought that the fund settlement law is applicable” to ICOs.\n\nHowever, this is not always the case as stated in the agency’s earlier announcement on the subject. The FSA explained:\n\nFor fraudulent ICOs, we will respond in cooperation with ministries and agencies, promote a voluntary response by the industry and users…We aim to protect users by alerting them to ICO risks.\n\nWhat do you think of the FSA’s policy on cryptocurrencies and ICOs?

BTC/USD might soon break $8000 for more gains above $8050.\n\nBitcoin Price Uptrend\n\nThere was a sharp bounce in bitcoin price from the $5800-6000 swing area against the US Dollar. The price moved above the $7000 and $7500 resistance levels. The upside move was strong and the price even traded close to the $8000 level. A new all-time high was formed at $7998 from where the price started a correction. It moved below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7105 low to $7998 high.\n\nHowever, the downside move was supported by the $7500 level. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7105 low to $7998 high also acted as a support. The price is now moving back higher and eyes a test of the $8000 level. On the upside, there is a connecting resistance trend line forming with current barrier near $8050 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. The pair might test this trend line again and form a new all-time high above $8000 in the near term.\n\nOn the downside, the price is well above the $7500 support and the 100 simple moving average (H4). There is also a bullish trend line with support at $7650 on the same chart.

Investors want exposure to Bitcoin but without most of the risks. Speculation on the Bitcoin price is their main objective first and foremost. New investment vehicles on Switzerland’s Six Exchange AG may provide the solution people have been asking for. It allows investors to profit if the Bitcoin price dips while limiting loss risk at the same time.\n\nBetting on the Bitcoin price is always a major gamble. Some people may call it “investing”, but it is gambling of the purest kind. Enough shorts against Bitcoin can easily trigger a price decrease. However, there is always a certain risk associated with this process, as cryptocurrency markets are unpredictable. Two Swiss companies have come together to create a new mainstream solution. Their product can be traded on Six Exchange AG. It provides investors with “bearish” opportunities. Rest assured there will be some great interest in this product moving forward.\n\nA New Mainstream Speculative Bitcoin Price Vehicle\n\nMore specifically, the demand for Bitcoin certificates is increasing. This is especially true in Switzerland, for some unknown reason. While speculation on price increases is common, the market can swing the other way as well. Giving investors an option to hedge their positions or go short in a mainstream fashion is pretty interesting. Vontobel AG claims this is the best decision given current market demand. An interesting approach, although the success remains to be determined.\n\nProviding this opportunity to regular investors is pretty significant. It will introduce more people to the world’s leading cryptocurrency as well. If all of these people go short, the momentum may turn against Bitcoin. It may not impact the price right away, though. Given the price gains during 2017, opening a short seems logical. Then again, the Bitcoin price set a new all-time high earlier this week. A very unpredictable market to take advantage of, that much is certain.\n\nThe most interesting aspect is the limited loss potential. This new vehicle has a multi-month maturity. At the same time, investors can exit early like any other instruments. It remains to be seen how much interest there will is in this new product, though. Initial feedback seems to be positive, which is to be expected. We see more crossovers between traditional finance and Bitcoin these days. That can only be considered to be a positive trend, all things considered.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

11/19/2017,"['For the past several months, I have been positive on Bitcoin. I have liked the fact that it rebounded from the China crackdown that coincided with the Jamie Dimon ""Bitcoin is a fraud"" comment.\n\nSince then, I have argued that the launch of Bitcoin futures and even more importantly, Bitcoin ETFs, would drive further gains in the price of Bitcoin (and all major cryptocurrencies).\n\nHere we are with Bitcoin closing the week at over $7,700 (according to Bloomberg), which is just below its all-time high.\n\nThe market has reacted well to all the news and it is clear that there are new adopters on a daily basis. Not only will futures and ETFs help attract new interest, but it is clear that many firms have done a good job of making Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) more accessible.\n\nWhat is starting to concern me is the proliferation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWithin Bitcoin you have the ""forks"" that are creating potentially new paths (link).\n\nThen you have not only the existing ""major"" cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (link), but it seems like there are new cryptocurrency launches on a daily basis, ranging from WhopperCoin (link) to stories about Banks attempting to create their own cryptocurrencies.\n\nGoogle Trends\n\nRight now, the launches and the ""buzz"" they are generating seems to have helped propel Bitcoin higher.\n\nCan that continue, or will buyers get nervous that the market is too fragmented, which might limit the commercial value of any particular cryptocurrency, or worse, will the market get concerned that it is too easy to create ICO\'s and that is a sign of a bubble building?\n\nFor now, I think the growing adoption rate will outweigh those concerns, but for those calling it a bubble - the list of bubble-like behavior is increasing.', 'Bitcoin broke through the $8,000 price mark this morning, reaching an all-time high of $8,100, thumbing its nose at the growing chorus of doomsayers reacting to the financial industry’s rising interest in the cryptocurrency. The price in the afternoon had dipped below the $8,000 mark, but the past week’s trend has been positive.\n\nShortly after noon, bitcoin’s price stood at $8,067.09 according to coinmarketcap.com, having posted a $133.956 million market capitalization and a 4.24% gain in a 24-hour period.\n\nVolatility Continues\n\nThe recent surge follows a near 29% plunge from the previous high of $7,562.47 on Nov. 5 to $5,650 on Nov. 12. This past week’s rally followed a $38 billion loss in market capitalization after the SegWit2x was canceled on Nov. 8. The recent volatility has been credited to the cancellation of SegWit2x, which caused some investors to move their holdings to altcoins, one sign being the near doubling in price of Bitcoin Cash.\n\nAfter starting the past week below the $6,000 mark on Nov. 13 at $5,937.82, the price rose and approached the $8,000 mark on Nov. 16, at which point it ebbed and flowed until today, Nov. 19 when it finally topped the $8,000 mark.\n\nBitcoin’s market share of the total cryptocurrency market today was 56.07%, followed by Ethereum at 14.51%. Bitcoin’s dominance was actually higher on Nov. 4 when its price was $7,291.92 and it held 61.58% to Ethereum’s 14.04%. Bitcoin’s highest market share was back on Aug. 10 when its price was $3,26.50 – it held 93.4% of the total market.\n\nInstitutional Interest Rises\n\nBitcoin’s entry into the mainstream financial markets is believed to be driving its ongoing gains. CME Group’s announcement to launch bitcoin future contracts has attracted interest from the financial community, signaling an institutional capital influx.\n\nAs a result of the institutional interest, Coinbase announced plans to offer a cryptocurrency custodial service targeted at institutional investors with more than $10 million in crypto assets.\n\nWall Street investors have also bestowed favor on publicly traded companies that expand into bitcoin. Square, a payment processor, got a price bump after inviting some users to test its Square Cash app to buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, the completion of the first off-chain “atomic swap” has also driven confidence in cryptocurrency. Lightning Labs traded testnet bitcoin for testnet Litecoin without leaving any trace on either currency’s blockchain.\n\nSegWit2x Impact\n\nWhile the cancellation of SegWit2x pulled bitcoin’s price downward, some see a silver lining.\n\nSpencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital, told Bloomberg Quint that despite the fact that the fork was called off, there are those that will follow through with the intended fork. As a result, some capital is rotating out of other crypto-assets and into bitcoin to ensure they receive coins on both sides of the fork.\n\nAlso read: 3 reasons why the bitcoin price hit $8,000 today\n\nNaysayers Reflect Rising Interest\n\nThe continuing bitcoin surge is noteworthy in light of the fact that it comes despite warnings from several financial experts that bitcoin is a bubble destined to implode. The fact that more financial observers are paying attention to bitcoin reflects the financial community’s rising interest.\n\nKatsunori Sago, the chief investment officer at Japan Post Bank, recently said bitcoin’s fair value should be around $100.\n\nJames Gorman, chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley, claimed that bitcoin doesn’t deserve the attention it is getting.\n\nEarlier this month, Societe Generale deputy CEO Severin Cabannes said bitcoin is clearly in a bubble, while Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam stated bitcoin is “the very definition of a bubble.”\n\nLegendary investor Warren Buffet said there’s a “real bubble in that sort of thing.” The most infamous quote of all is left to JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin is a fraud.\n\nMeanwhile, the price surge continues.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'People buy and sell bitcoins on a secure peer-to-peer network that doesn’t rely on any government or central bank. Photo: iStock\n\nNew York: About a third of the customers queuing at La Maison du Bitcoin’s teller windows in Paris aren’t speculating on the value of the cryptocurrency. They’re sending digital money home to Africa. “In many countries in Africa, there are far more cellphones than bank accounts,” said La Maison co-founder Manuel Valente. “For bitcoin, all you need is a phone.”\n\nZimbabwe, where the price of bitcoin spiked to double the international rate after this week’s military takeover, shows Jamie Dimon, Axel Weber and other cryptocurrency skeptics where the real-world use of bitcoin, and possibly its future, lies.\n\nIt’s becoming the preferred way for residents of failing economies to transfer money without dealing with banks, protecting their savings from political turmoil, and avoiding the local currency when its value declines due to inflation.\n\nThere’s no data on how much digital money leaves industrialized nations for the developing world. Part of the allure of electronic cash is the ability to transfer it anonymously. But as events in Zimbabwe have confirmed, bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, is most attractive when confidence in institutions falls.\n\n“Bitcoin is a safe haven for people around the world who don’t trust their governments,” said Andrew Milne, chief investment officer and co-founder of Altana Digital Currency Fund, a $22 million hedge fund that invests in cryptocurrency assets. “There are many countries where people are looking for an asset that isn’t vulnerable to banks blowing themselves up.’’\n\nZimbabwe gave up its own currency in 2009, the same year bitcoin was born, after hyperinflation led to the printing of a 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar note. The country uses the US dollar, South African rand and digital money.\n\nPeople buy and sell bitcoins on a secure peer-to-peer network that doesn’t rely on any government or central bank.\n\nTrying to control it is “like trying to catch water”, said Alex Tapscott, chief executive officer of NextBlock Global Ltd., a venture-capital firm that invests in start-ups involved in blockchain, the shared digital ledger that records transactions made with cryptocurrency.\n\nLeaders of three of the world’s biggest banks have expressed skepticism about the stability and endurance of bitcoin.\n\nIn September, JPMorgan Chase and Co. CEO Dimon threatened to fire any JPMorgan trader foolish enough to bet on it. Weber, who leads UBS Group AG, said last month that bitcoin has no intrinsic value because nothing backs it. Earlier this month, Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Tidjane Thiam said that “the only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble”.\n\nResidents, especially, of Zimbabwe and Venezuela, where the annual accumulated inflation rate is 825%, might disagree.\n\nIn Africa, converting bitcoin to the local currency is often handled by local entrepreneurs, either with licensed change points similar to Paris’s La Maison du Bitcoin or, on a smaller scale, an individual with a mobile phone and a pocket of cash, Valente said.\n\n“It’s like a walking exchange point,” Valente said. “It’s very decentralized.” Buying goods and services with cryptocurrency is still difficult to do, but Valente said he’s heard of shops accepting bitcoin opening in many African countries.\n\nEntrepreneurs have started companies intended to serve bigger markets. BitPesa Ltd., a Kenya-based start-up, provides international money transfers and other services in bitcoin in Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and its own country. Unocoin does the same in India, as does Coins.PH in the Philippines.\n\nBack in Paris, a few blocks from La Maison du Bitcoin is Passage du Grand Cerf, a covered street of shops. They all display a sticker on their windows declaring “We Accept Bitcoin”. The stores sell everything from antiques to designer clothing. Most proprietors said they’ve averaged a few transactions a month in bitcoin, frequently to Africans.\n\n“We’ve made about 20 or more sales in bitcoin in the past year,” said Yann Robert, who runs a designer clothing store. “The buyers are usually from Africa, a few from Asia—China, Japan. And they’re very happy, because not that many stores accept bitcoin.” Bloomberg', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Wendy McElroy is ready for most doomsday scenarios: a one-year supply of nonperishable food is stacked in a cellar at her farm in rural Ontario. Her blueprint for survival also depends upon working internet: part of her money, assuming she needs some after civilization collapses, is in bitcoin.\n\nAcross the North American countryside, preppers like McElroy are storing more and more of their wealth in invisible wallets in cyberspace instead of stockpiling gold bars and coins in their bunkers and basement safes.\n\nThey won’t be able to access their virtual cash the moment a catastrophe knocks out the power grid or the web, but that hasn’t dissuaded them. Even staunch survivalists are convinced bitcoin will endure economic collapse, global pandemic, climate change catastrophes and nuclear war.\n\n“I consider bitcoin to be a currency on the same level as gold,” McElroy, who lives on the farm with her husband, said by email. “It allows individuals to become self-bankers. When I fully understood the concepts and their significance, bitcoin became a fascination.”\n\nQuicktakeBitcoin and Blockchain\n\nAt first glance, it seems counter-intuitive that some of bitcoin’s most ardent proponents are people motivated by the belief that public infrastructure will collapse in times of social and political distress. Bitcoin isn’t yet widely accepted as a method of payment and steep transaction costs make it inconvenient to use at vendors that do take it.\n\nPreppers, as it happens, have a different perspective on what they see as the money of the future, which has surged 10-fold in the past 12 months as supporters lauded it as a digital alternative to rival the dollar, euro or yen.\n\nUsed to send and receive payments online, bitcoin is similar to payment networks like PayPal or Mastercard, the difference being that it runs on a decentralized network—blockchain—that’s beyond the control of central banks and regulators. It was born out of an anti-establishment vision of a government-free society, a key attraction for those seeking unhindered access to their capital in case a massive shock shuts down the banking system.\n\n“People see bitcoin prices going to the moon. No one thinks gold is going to the moon”\n\n“Not too long ago, people in the prepper community were actively warning against crypto, and now they’re all investing in it,” said Tom Martin, a truck driver from Washington who runs a social-media website for people interested in learning skills to survive disaster. “As long as the grid stays up, people will keep using bitcoin.”\n\nIn addition to gold, silver and stocks, Martin invests in bitcoin and peers litecoin and steem because they’re easier to travel with, harder to steal and offer better protection in the event of the kind of societal breakdown that would unfold if a fiat currency like the dollar collapsed.\n\nHe’s among those confident that bitcoin can withstand even a complete blackout through the strength of the underlying blockchain, the anonymous public bookkeeping technology that records every single bitcoin transaction.\n\nDiscussions on the pros and cons of investing in crypto have popped up on survivalist forums like mysurvivalforum.com and survivalistboards.com this year as bitcoin rallied above $7,000. “Buy bitcoin” is now a more popular search phrase than “buy gold” on Google.\n\nThe buzz is starting to impinge on gold’s role as a store of value especially since, like the precious metal, there’s a finite supply of bitcoin, which proponents say gives it anti-inflationary qualities. Sales of gold coins from the U.S. Mint slid to a decade low in the first three quarters months of 2017.\n\n“It’s definitely had some impact on the market,” Philip Newman, who does research on precious-metal coin sales and is one of the founders of research firm Metals Focus, said by phone from Washington. “People see bitcoin prices going to the moon. No one thinks gold is going to the moon.”\n\nBloomberg\n\nTo attract investors who traditionally buy gold, several digital assets, like Royal Mint Gold and Anthem Gold, have been developed that are backed by physical gold stored in vaults.\n\nStill, it’s hard to envision people walking around spending digital coins to buy Spam, canned beans or bottled water at a local supermarket when they don’t have electricity at home to charge their smart phones, let alone a working internet connection to access their digital wallets.\n\n“I doubt bitcoin is a safe haven from an extreme-risk environment. In that sense, bitcoin isn’t gold,” said Charlie Morris, the London-based chief investment officer at Newscape Capital Advisors Ltd., which invests in cryptocurrencies and is building a price-discovery platform for them.\n\nBitcoin has also not reached the critical mass to be considered a viable currency to invest in, UBS Group AG’s Mark Haefele said in an interview. The total sum of all cryptocurrencies is “not even the size of some of the smaller currencies’’ that UBS would allocate to, he said.\n\nPreppers, though, stock enough food and supplies to sustain them for months, if not years, and they expect whatever governing structure emerges post-calamity will prioritize getting the web back up and running.\n\n“It may be difficult, if not impossible to access for a while, but once things start returning to some level of normality, then the blockchain will return as it was before the disaster,” said Rob Harvey, a bitcoin investor who prepares for natural and nuclear catastrophes by learning and teaching survival skills, like making a fire. “The blockchain does not need a specific place or a specific person to survive—that’s a strong survival tactic.”\n\n“It is a people’s currency”\n\nInterest in cryptocurrencies has started permeating the mainstream. When Morris surveyed hundreds of executives attending the London Bullion Market Association’s annual conference last month, one in 10 said they’d rather own bitcoin than gold following a nuclear war.\n\nAlong the fringe, the 20,000 libertarians expected to converge on New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project are also switching from precious metals. They like bitcoin because it isn’t created by a government, unlike conventional currency.\n\n“You can use bitcoin for economic transactions in a way that gold was never designed to do because it’s a physical thing—it’s heavy,” Matt Philips, the project’s president, said by phone. “A lot of people don’t know what the heck to do with gold if you give it to them in exchange for a cup of coffee.”\n\nMatt Philips Source: Matt Philips\n\nWhatever doom-and-gloom scenario unfolds, McElroy, from Canada, has faith in bitcoin. She’s writing a book called Satoshi Revolution, inspired by the pseudonym of the person or people who created bitcoin in 2009 as an answer to the financial turmoil wrought by the global financial crisis.\n\nShe says the digital currency breaks society’s dependence on a state that uses its monopoly over the issuance of money to dominate the economy, making it a natural hedge against disaster.\n\n“It is a people’s currency,” she writes in the book’s introduction. “Bitcoins move seamlessly through a world without states or borders, obeying only the command of individuals who choose to deal with each other. Immune to currency manipulation and inflation, they do not serve the powerful elites at the expense of average people.”\n\n— With assistance by Dave Liedtka, and Samuel Dodge', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

The issue stemmed from the confusion surrounding the meaning of the term ‘pre-mine’, and what the new chain was attempting to do in mining new coins.\n\nClarification came today via the Bitcoin Gold website where a full explanation was given. The premine, according to the explanation, was actually a ‘post-mine’ - a mining of 100,000 coins after the fork had already occurred. The team did this via a rapid mining of approximately 8,000 blocks at 12.5 BTG per block.\n\nPremining a bonus?\n\nThe bulk of premined coins have been placed into an ‘endowment’, and according to the developers will be used to grow and maintain the BTG ecosystem. However, of the 100K coins, some five percent were set aside as a bonus for the team, or about 833 coins for each of the six members. Little was said regarding this payout, except an acknowledgement. According to the post:\n\n“There was, understandably, a lot of attention to the five percent of the premine which was earmarked as “initial reward for core team” in the Roadmap. That represents 5,000 coins, divided among six core team members, or about 833 coins each – so each core member receives about 0.005% of the existing coin supply (at the time) for their roles in getting this project off the ground during the months before launch.”\n\nThe remaining 95 percent are divided into time-locked wallets (60 percent - released in three years), while the remaining 35 percent will be put into immediate use for the sake of building the platform. Specifics on how the funds will be used are to be released over time.', 'Bitcoin surged to new highs on Sunday, as the world’s largest crypto by market cap continued to generate bids following the cancellation of Segwit2x.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nBTC/USD Price Levels\n\nThe value of a single bitcoin reached a daily high of $8,110.59, its best level on record.

BTC and BCH locked horns earlier this month after the Segwit2x hard fork was abandoned.\n\n$10,000 and Beyond?\n\nInstitutional clearing platform LedgerX has initiated its first long-term bitcoin futures option, which is set to expire Dec. 28, 2018. In setting up the option, LedgerX is assuming a price of $10,000 at the time of expiration. That’s a 25% premium on current levels.\n\nInvestors who buy the option are essentially saying they believe prices will exceed $10,000 by the time of expiration.\n\nBitcoin is being helped by growing institutional demand for the digital currency, as hedge funds, day traders and other mainstream investment outfits look to access this burgeoning asset class. CBOE and CME Group have each announced plans to integrate bitcoin into more conventional investment vehicles in the coming months.\n\nThe rush of institutional money into bitcoin is a sure sign that the digital asset class is becoming too big to ignore. The value of all cryptocurrencies in circulation has already exceeded $230 billion, with more than a dozen coins valued at $1 billion or more. Nine others have a market cap of $500 million or greater.\n\nCoinbase Responds\n\nThe rise of institutional capital has also compelled Coinbase to introduce a custodial service targeted at account holders with more than $10 million in assets. This service targets hedge funds and other institutions that have remained largely on the sidelines of the crypto revolution.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the new service will launch sometime next year.\n\n“When we speak with these institutions, they tell us that the number one thing preventing them from getting started is the existence of a digital asset custodian that they can trust to store client funds securely,” Armstrong wrote.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the minimum $10 million asset requirement, institutions must pay a $100,000 setup fee to gain access tot he Custodial program. In response, institutional investors will receive assurance that their assets are secure.\n\nThe Coinbase Custody website lists broad support for bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC), as well as ERC20 tokens. The ERC20 protocol has emerged as the favorite for startups launching initial coin offerings (ICOs), a controversial crowdfunding model that has already overtaken early stage venture capital.\n\nDisclaimer: The author owns bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.

Here are seven of the biggest challenges facing mainstream adoption of bitcoin, and what would need to happen for consumers to start using the digital currency on a large scale.\n\n1. Volatility\n\nBitcoin has been incredibly volatile since its inception. I wrote in September that $10 worth of bitcoin in 2010 would be worth millions of dollars today. And the volatility isn\'t slowing down -- in fact, since I wrote that article less than two months ago, the value of a bitcoin has more than doubled.\n\nThis environment has made bitcoin extremely popular among speculators who buy bitcoin hoping the price will continue to rise, but it isn\'t helping to fuel bitcoin\'s popularity as a currency. For example, if I plan to go on vacation in two weeks and want to set aside $1,000 in spending money, if I choose to store this money in bitcoin, its buying power could climb or fall significantly by the time I leave. Most people simply don\'t want to deal with that level of currency risk. Before bitcoin achieves mainstream adoption as a currency, I believe the price is going to need to become much more stable.\n\n2. Ease of use\n\nTo be fair, it has gotten much easier to buy, sell, and use bitcoin over the past several years, but it still isn\'t user-friendly enough to encourage mainstream adoption. Currently, if the average person wants to buy bitcoin, he or she needs to open an account at a bitcoin exchange such as Coinbase, link a checking account (or credit card, which generally comes with a higher fee), and in many cases wait several days for the transaction to clear. I consider myself knowledgeable about bitcoin, and I can buy virtually any product online with greater ease than I could buy, say, $200 in bitcoin.\n\nThe entry of Square (NYSE:SQ) and similar companies into the bitcoin game has the potential to fix this issue. In other words, if bitcoin could be purchased through an app that millions of people are using anyway, like Square Cash, with just the touch of a button, it could get many more less tech-savvy consumers interested in the world of digital currencies.\n\n3. Widespread acceptance\n\nThere are many retailers, particularly online, through which consumers can pay for transactions in bitcoin, but the digital currency still isn\'t anywhere close to being widely accepted. If Square, or another big payment processing company, decides to allow retailers that use their hardware to start accepting bitcoin payments easily, it could be a game-changer for the mainstream adoption of bitcoin.\n\n4. Potential for theft\n\nSecurity measures exist that make bitcoin virtually impossible to steal, but taking advantage of them involves a somewhat complex knowledge of how bitcoin works and can often require significantly more effort on the part of the user. While true bitcoin enthusiasts don\'t mind taking extra security measures, this is an example of the ease-of-use challenge I discussed earlier. And with online bitcoin wallets, there\'s always some chance that the currency could be stolen. It\'s happened before and could certainly happen again.\n\n5. Reputation for criminal activity\n\nBitcoin, especially in its early days, was well known for its use on the Dark Web, in money-laundering activities, or to purchase illegal items. And it makes sense. As the only true anonymous source of payment, bitcoin became the natural choice for people who wanted to buy drugs, illegal weapons, you name it. And to be fair, since it\'s an anonymous payment source, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to fully solve this problem.\n\nAnonymity is one of the positive aspects of bitcoin, but it does create the potential for illicit use.\n\n6. Tax issues\n\nUnder current law, the IRS considers bitcoin and other digital currencies to be ""intangible property,"" which means they\'re subject to capital gains taxes.\n\nIf you buy bitcoin and then sell it for more than you paid, you\'ll need to report the difference on your taxes. Even worse from a currency perspective, every time you use bitcoin to buy something, it is a potentially taxable event. For example, if I pay for a $5 cup of coffee with bitcoin that originally cost me $4, that dollar in profit is technically a capital gain. As you might imagine, this situation can create the need for an exhausting amount of record-keeping, and bitcoin users have three choices: Keep detailed records of every bitcoin purchase and transaction, risk getting into trouble with the IRS, or don\'t use bitcoin at all.\n\nTo be fair, gains resulting from other currencies also can result in taxable income, but this generally isn\'t an issue on a day-to-day basis. After all, few people in the U.S. regularly pay for goods and services with euros or yen.\n\n7. Scalability\n\nWithout getting too deep into the technical details, bitcoin has a serious scalability problem. The underlying technology behind bitcoin, the blockchain, limits the amount of information that can be contained in each block to 1 megabyte of data. This limitation allows for a maximum network capacity of about three transactions per second.\n\nIn other words, as more and more bitcoin trades and purchase transactions are executed, the network will have a more difficult time keeping up, which could result in serious processing delays. For comparison, Visa\'s network processes roughly 2,000 transactions per second. So if bitcoin ever wants to achieve a larger scale, something will need to be done. There are several proposals on the table, but the eventual long-term solution remains unclear.\n\nCan these problems be solved?\n\nThe bottom line is that bitcoin and the general concept of a digital currency is still very much in its infancy, and several problems need to be solved before bitcoin achieves mainstream adoption as a form of currency. It\'s also important to point out that this isn\'t an exhaustive list -- there are other challenges facing bitcoin. As one example, there\'s always the lingering threat of government regulation that could render bitcoin illegal in certain areas of the world.\n\nHowever, most of the problems facing bitcoin can be solved or worked out, and the recent news involving Square Cash is certainly a step in the right direction. Just be aware that it will take some time before you can walk through the mall or local craft market and see crowds of people all paying for their various purchases with bitcoin.', 'Games\n\nThe amusement arcade, like the shopping mall, is a 20th century relic. Once synonymous with teen idling and coming of age, these hangouts have since been eaten by the internet. But in one New Zealand town, the arcade is biting back, led by a Pac-Man that feeds on bitcoin.\n\nSee also: This Week in Bitcoin: Failed Forks, Atomic Swaps, and a Little Trouble in Big China\n\nTaking a Bite out of Bitcoin\n\nNamco’s beloved Pac-Man, released in 1980 before spawning a string of sequels and spin-offs, lives on in amusement arcades the world over.

Those kids who grew up chasing aliens around lurid mazes are now adults, and their progeny have no need for the mall now there’s an entire universe nestling in their pocket.\n\nIn Blenheim, a quiet wine-producing town of 31,000, the crumbling amusement arcade has been reborn. From the outside, Arcadia looks just like any other arcade: faded; deserted; living off former glories. Step inside, and there’s nothing that would suggest otherwise, the gloom extenuated by a twin row of arcade machines chirping and flashing gaudily.\n\nIn almost every single respect this is a run-of-the-mill arcade in an unassuming town, save for one crucial detail – you can pay and play with bitcoin.\n\nA Cash Killer\n\nThe future of fiat currency is a matter of some debate, with many bitcoiners predicting its demise. In the here and now, what’s indisputable is that physical cash is on the way out. In an era of contactless payments, administered by card, smartphone, and smartwatch, coins and notes are an inconvenience. Arcades seemed destined to be one of the few places where cash will remain king.\n\nArcadia’s owner clearly missed the memo however. As New Zealand’s Stuff reports, gamers can now pay with bitcoin using a mobile QR code. It’s an innovative solution which taps into the demographic that arcades should be targeting if they’re to survive – tech-savvy teens.\n\nIt was the owner’s son, Adam Scoon, who pressed for BTC to be introduced, enthusing:\n\n[Bitcoin] is getting more and more attention and more people are learning about it and getting into it which pushes its value up even more, we think that eventually everyone will be using it to pay for everything.\n\nAfter paying in bitcoin at the till, players are issued with tokens which they can use to put the racing games, pinball machines, and shoot-em-ups through their paces. As token use cases go, this one is certainly compelling – a true utility token if ever there was one. So has business boomed since Arcadia began accepting bitcoin? Actually, no. Then again, in a sleepy retirement community of 31,000, that’s not surprising.\n\nThe Arcadia story doesn’t constitute evidence that bitcoin adoption is soaring. What it does do is showcase another innovative way in which the cryptocurrency can be purposed. If bitcoin is to take over the world, it needs to capture the imagination of teens and tweens, digital demographics who were born into a world of tech. Anything that can get young people into bitcoin – while introducing them to the wonders of Pac-Man – has got to be welcomed.\n\nWhat do you think can be done to get more young people into bitcoin?

11/20/2017,"[""In Brief In its latest record-breaking price surge, bitcoin's value soared above $8,200 on November 20, just four days after the cryptocurrency surpassed the $8,000 mark. Many experts predict that bitcoin prices will continue to increase in the months to come.\n\nUp, Up, and Away\n\nEarlier in November, analysts from Goldman Sachs predicted that bitcoin’s price would soon reach $8,000, which it did on November 16. The value then rose higher than $8,100 barely three days later.\n\nAfter briefly dipping back below $8,000 by the end of November 19, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency shot back up again on November 20, climbing above $8,200. Bitcoin is now worth $8,274, as of writing.\n\nThe recent fluctuations in bitcoin’s price are the result of a combination of several developments. In late October, CME Group — the world’s largest exchange owner — opened up to bitcoin trading. Additionally, a controversial bitcoin blockchain hard fork was suspended in early November, and Bitcoin Classic ended up shutting down in favor of Bitcoin Cash.\n\nA Volatile Future\n\nIn the past four months, bitcoin’s price has reached record-breaking highs, with the value of the cryptocurrency almost doubling since August. The meteoric increases have been read by enthusiasts as signs of what’s to come, with bitcoin slowly creeping into the mainstream. Critics, on the other hand, see it as further proof of bitcoin’s volatility and that the crypto is a “bubble” that could burst soon.\n\nWhile predictions vary, most experts seem to agree that the price of bitcoin will continue to increase. A former Fortress Investment Group hedge fund manager suggests it could reach $10,000 by the first half of 2018. That’s a relatively moderate call, considering how one veteran trader thinks bitcoin prices could hit $15,000 before the end of 2017. In the long run, the popular cryptocoin could reach $20,000 to $25,000 in the next three to five years, but only time will tell how it actually performs.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets. Their personal investment perspectives have no impact on editorial content."", 'Bitcoin is continuing its good performance of the last few days. After its value briefly cleared the $8,000 mark on one exchange on Friday, it surpassed $8,110 on Sunday and is $8,048 at the time of writing.\n\nThis has been a highly volatile month for bitcoin—though the same can be said for most months. A couple of weeks ago, bitcoin hit a $7,888 high before falling as low as $6,800, then climbing back up again.\n\nAt the start of the year, one bitcoin was only worth around $1,000. Back in August, with the price at $3,500, analysts were being bullish by claiming bitcoin might clear $5,000 next year. Goldman Sachs analysts forecast the $8,000 barrier’s breakage earlier this month, suggesting there may be further surges in store.\n\nThe latest positivity comes as institutional investors start to push harder into the cryptocurrency world, with CME having recently announced plans to trade bitcoin futures and Coinbase offering a custodian service for hedge funds. Last week, Square also started testing bitcoin payments on its Cash app.\n\nThe “Segwit2x” fork, which would have split bitcoin into two factions, was also recently cancelled, at least formally. Some bitcoin-mining nodes still tried running the Segwit2x code, although reports emerged at the weekend suggesting that a bug in the code stopped it from working.', 'Forget about boring stocks. Bitcoin is where it\'s at these days for investors.\n\nThe virtual currency is now trading at a record high above $8,200 -- just a little more than a month after bitcoin first passed the $5,000 level. If this keeps up, bitcoin could be trading at $10,000 before the end of the year.\n\nThe price of one bitcoin (XBT) has surged more than 735% this year alone and has skyrocketed nearly 40,000% in the past five years.\n\nOf course, bitcoin\'s meteoric rise has led to some skepticism. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has bashed it on numerous occasions, calling it a ""fraud"" that\'s better off being used by drug dealers and North Korea.\n\nAnd Saudi Prince Alwaleed, a billionaire whose Kingdom Holding Company owns stakes in Apple (AAPL) and Citigroup (C), told CNBC before he was arrested in a sweeping anti-corruption probe that he thought bitcoin was an ""Enron in the making"" that will implode.\n\nBut while some see a bubble about to burst, others see opportunity. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase rival Goldman Sachs (GS), took issue with bitcoin critics.\n\nBlankfein tweeted last month that ""folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold."" Interestingly, technical analysts at Goldman also correctly predicted earlier this month that bitcoin prices would soon top $8,000.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin hits $13,000 on Zimbabwe exchange\n\nBlankfein raises an interesting point though. Sure, some investors are likely flocking to bitcoin as a speculative bet because they\'ve watched the price climb higher and higher.\n\nBut there\'s also a legitimate case to be made that bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies are the future of money and that more and more people will conduct actual transactions using these currencies.\n\nTo that end, Square -- the popular mobile payment service run by Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey -- recently announced a trial that will let some users of its Cash app purchase bitcoin.\n\n""We\'re always listening to our customers and we\'ve found that they are interested in using the Cash app to buy bitcoin,"" said a spokesperson for Square (SQ) in an email to CNNMoney.\n\n""We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system,"" the Square spokesperson added.\n\nAnd CME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said earlier this month it plans to soon list bitcoin futures contracts. CME (CME) CEO Terry Duffy noted that there has been ""increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets.""\n\nFutures let investors buy and sell an asset at a specified price at a later date, They\'re popular bets for currencies, metals and agricultural commodities. In other words, CME Group is now treating bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin prices have been incredibly volatile. What\'s going on?\n\nMany others agree. Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors, wrote in a recent note to clients that bitcoin prices should keep rising simply because more and more people are likely to use it.\n\n""Bitcoin adoption could multiply the more people become aware of how much of their wealth is controlled by governments and the big banks,"" he said.\n\nHolmes added that more startup companies are also looking to raise money through so-called initial coin offerings - the sale of digital currencies to investors instead of stock. That should lead to a further rise in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nDragonchain, a crytpocurrency startup originally backed by Disney (DIS), has held an ICO. Filecoin, a cloud storage company, raised more than $250 million earlier this year from an ICO -- the biggest ever.\n\nAnd online retailer Overstock (OSTK) is even planning an ICO for its tZero blockhain unit.\n\n""In an effort to bypass the rules and costs associated with getting listed on an exchange, many startups now are opting to raise funds by issuing their own digital currency based on blockchain technology,"" Holmes wrote.\n\nRelated: Cash is still king in the digital era\n\nTo be sure, bitcoin prices have moved wildly in the past couple of months. There have been several big crashes of at least 20%.\n\nStill, the price has always come roaring back -- and analytics firm Meltwater has noted an interesting trend. Bitcoin prices have moved higher simply based on the sheer volume of news coverage... regardless of whether the reports or positive or negative.\n\nIn other words, there is no such thing as bad publicity for bitcoin, no matter how much Jamie Dimon and others bash it.\n\nHave you been buying bitcoin?

Then, by Friday, prices were flirting with fresh record highs around the $8,000 mark.\n\nWith bid tone remaining intact over the weekend, bitcoin rose to an all-time high of $8,101.91 around 20:00 UTC yesterday, as per CoinDesk\'s Bitcoin Price Index.\n\nHowever, while the $2,500 rally is impressive, data from CoinMarketCap indicates the move higher from $7,853 (Nov. 17 open price) lacks substance, as trading volumes have steadily declined over the last three days.\n\nStruggling volumes\n\nThe above chart shows:\n\nA clear divergence between the rising prices and trading volumes. Volumes did pick up after Nov. 14, but topped out two days later. Meanwhile, prices continue to rise and clocked record highs yesterday.\n\nFurthermore, trading volumes have stayed well below the Nov. 12 high throughout the $2,500 rally from the recent lows near $5,500.\n\nA low volume rally is not necessarily an ominous sign, but could be an indication of overstretched valuations: i.e. investors are reluctant to invest fresh capital above $7,800 levels. Further, the Google search volumes have seen an anemic rise, perhaps validating that argument.\n\nSo, should we expect a corrective pullback?\n\nThe technical charts favor further upside in prices, but signal the potential for a pullback to $7,300 levels if prices break below $7,900 today.\n\nAs of writing, BTC is trading at $8,035 levels. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has added 3.4 percent in the last 24 hours.\n\n4-hour chart\n\nThe above chart shows:\n\nBull flag breakout\n\nBullish 50-MA and 100-MA crossover\n\nThe relative strength is beginning to curl up again, but stands very close to the overbought region.\n\nBull flags (named for their ""flag and pole""appearance) occur during strong uptrends. They are a bullish continuation pattern: i.e. an upside break signals resumption of the rally.\n\nOn the chart above, an upside break/bull flag breakout has been confirmed, meaning the doors are open for a rally to $10,393 (target as per the measured height method: i.e. pole height added to breakout point).\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, the breakout lacks substance due to dropping volumes. Additionally, bitcoin is already at record highs and overbought as per the weekly and monthly RSI.\n\nView\n\nThe signs of bull market exhaustion detailed above indicate heightened odds of a corrective pullback. A break below $7,900 would open doors for a drop to $7,200 (10-day MA).\n\nOn the other hand, a move above $8,100, if accompanied by a pick-up in volumes today, would validate the bull flag breakout and could yield a rally to $10,000 levels over the next week or two.\n\nWarning sign image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

We don’t actually use that template, but if you’ve been following bitcoin over the last 6 months it probably sounds very familiar.\n\nIn all seriousness, bitcoin has been on a wild run. Yesterday the price shot past $8,000 for the first time, and per usual when it breaks through a milestone is now trading solidly above it at $8,250.\n\nHere’s a quick recap of what’s been happening in bitcoin world the last few weeks.\n\nOn November 2nd the price of Bitcoin passed $7,000 for the first time, fueled by demand before the Segwit2x hard fork that was supposed to happen a few days ago. Anyone that held a bitcoin prior to the fork would receive an equal amount of the forked coin, which some saw as being akin to free money.\n\nWhen the hard fork was canceled on November 10th the price plummeted down to $5,800 as people moved their money back into alternative cryptocurrencies. This sudden plummet also coincided with some very strange movement in the price of bitcoin cash (BCH) which saw the price and hash rate spike for about 24 hours, temporarily making it the second most valuable coin and the coin with the most hash rate (even surpassing bitcoin).\n\nAnyways, now that the drama has passed the price is on a steady climb again and well past $8,000. So what’s causing this?\n\nWhile I made this argument when it passed $5,000 in early October, I still think that institutional interest is the main cause of this extended rally.\n\nOver 100 cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds have been created in the least year, which are acting as a conduit for large amounts of fiat being converted to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Even old-school hedge funds and investment institutions are getting in on the action, to the extend that there are services that allow them to safely do so.\n\nAnd these services are coming. Just last week Coinbase announced a service to securely store $10M or more of cryptocurrency for institutional investors. Additionally, CME group will launch the first ever regulated bitcoin futures product on December 10th. Both of these offerings will make it easier for large diversified investment vehicles to enter the market.\n\nSo what’s next? No one knows, but at this point it looks like $10k before the end of the year is possible. Of course it’s just as likely for the price to plummet, as many say we are due for a correction.', ""The widespread adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be stymied by the fact that they are not backed by a so-called 'lender of last resort', the French bank BNP Paribas has claimed.\n\nReplacing traditional currencies with Bitcoin would come with significant risks and undermine monetary policy, the French bank said.\n\nBitcoin and other cryprocurrencies do not have an equivalent body to the Bank of England, which could provide oversight of the financial services or products created using Bitcoin.\n\nThe UK's central bank determines interest rates and some financial regulation. It also acts as a lender of last resort, stepping into to bail out banks, as it did during the financial crisis of 2009, to protect savings and mortgages.\n\nIf consumers used a cryptocurrency for vital products such as mortgages, they would have no security and could lose their money if a financial crisis occurred. Such a scenario could trigger a run on conventional banks, according to BNP Paribas, as consumers would seek to suddenly get cash from other sources."", 'People are going crazy for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin just set another record above $8,000, shaking off a 25% drop earlier this month. But if the wild ride of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is too risky for you, a new payments startup thinks it has just the thing. Something stable, comforting, as old as money itself: gold.\n\nGlint, a new app that launches today in the UK, offers payment services using gold. In partnership with MasterCard and Lloyds Bank, Glint users can load credit onto their account and use it to buy a portion of a gold bar to store their money. Users can then send money and gold to others with the app and use a Glint debit card to make payments in a variety of currencies, and gold, at interbank exchange rates.\n\nPhysical gold holdings are allocated to the owner and held in an independent and insured vault in Switzerland. Glint, which is regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, plans to expand into Europe and Asia next year. The app currently supports the British pound and gold, with more currencies to come.\n\nThe effort to “reintroduce gold as money” is because the creators of Glint thought it was unfair that “money is prone to depreciate in ways we have no control over,” according to the company’s website. Jason Cozens, CEO of Glint, said: “Unlike ‘paper’ currencies, gold can’t be wiped out, devalued or corrupted.”\n\nIt’s been more than 40 years since the US cut the dollar’s ties to gold and centuries since physical gold was used a means of payment. Where some people have turned to bitcoin as an alternative to currencies controlled by governments and central banks, Glint is trying to make physical gold part of today’s electronic payments infrastructure.\n\nGold is still used in financial markets as a means to safeguard wealth. According to analysts at Citi, the “new normal” of heightened geopolitical tensions will boost demand for gold and push the price above $1,4000 per ounce for “sustained periods” by 2020. That said, the latest figures from the World Gold Council show that global demand for the precious metal has fallen to its lowest level since late 2009.\n\nGold has served as a haven for thousands of years, so if new technology can the illiquid, hard-to-move precious metal more user friendly, it might have some potential as an alternative currency for the risk averse.', ""Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high this week, crossing the $8,000 level for the first time.\n\nBut while some onlookers see bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a massive financial bubble, others say the bitcoin rally is just getting started.\n\nThe Analyst\n\nJust weeks after raising his price target for Bitcoin from $7,500 to $11,000, Standpoint Research analyst Ronnie Moas has raised his target once again to $14,000. Moas has also set a long-term target of $60,000 for 2022.\n\nEditor's note: Moas on Nov. 29 raised his target to $20,000.\n\nThe Thesis\n\nMore countries are embracing cryptocurrencies and removing barriers that kept investors away, Moas said in a note. But Moas is not trying to be a hero by keeping his target the highest on the Street. The target is based on the concept that, with $200 trillion dollars in the world in cash, stocks, bonds and gold, there are few reasonably valued investment options.\n\nIf one-half of 1 percent of the $200 trillion is put into bitcoin, it would result in a $1 trillion valuation — above Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Moas said.\n\nDespite his bold, bullish predictions, Moas said cryptocurrency investors shouldn’t put all their eggs in one backet and should instead invest in at least a dozen different currencies among the top 50 cryptos by market cap.\n\nInvestors should shrug off bubble concerns from the likes of Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett, since each of those prominent Wall Street CEOs is heavily invested in the traditional banking industry that's threatened by bitcoin, Moas said.\n\nPrice Action\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC) was trading down by 5.4 percent on Monday, but is up 686 percent year-to-date.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nA Guide To Who Loves And Hates Cryptocurrency\n\n10 Most Ridiculous Cryptocurrencies"", 'The BRAVO Event in Operation Castle was an experimental thermonuclear device, 15-megaton weapons related surface event detonated on Bikini Atoll; an enormous bell of a condensation cloud hangs over the mushroom cloud.

Bitcoin isn’t yet widely accepted as a method of payment and steep transaction costs make it inconvenient to use at vendors that do take it.\n\nPreppers, as it happens, have a different perspective on what they see as the money of the future, which has surged 10-fold in the past 12 months as supporters lauded it as a digital alternative to rival the dollar, euro or yen.\n\nMore from Bloomberg.com: The Latest on the Political Turmoil in Zimbabwe\n\nUsed to send and receive payments online, bitcoin is similar to payment networks like PayPal or Mastercard, the difference being that it runs on a decentralized network—blockchain—that’s beyond the control of central banks and regulators. It was born out of an anti-establishment vision of a government-free society, a key attraction for those seeking unhindered access to their capital in case a massive shock shuts down the banking system.\n\n“People see bitcoin prices going to the moon.

Sales of gold coins from the U.S. Mint slid to a decade low in the first three quarters months of 2017.\n\n“It’s definitely had some impact on the market,” Philip Newman, who does research on precious-metal coin sales and is one of the founders of research firm Metals Focus, said by phone from Washington. “People see bitcoin prices going to the moon.

But the most damaging incident happened in August 2016 when a thief got almost 120,000 Bitcoin, worth around $75 million at the time.\n\nThe company spread out the losses to all customers — even those who were not holding Bitcoin at the time of the hacking — by forcing customers to take a 36 percent haircut or loss on any money at the exchange.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe lack of detail that Bitfinex provided about the hacking drove away some large customers like Arthur Hayes, the founder of Bitmex, a Hong Kong-based virtual currency exchange.\n\n“There are so many questions about them,” Mr. Hayes said. “All of this could be easily rectified by just showing all the figures.”\n\nMr. van der Velde said the company had “been as public and transparent as possible about the security incident in August 2016 given the ongoing criminal investigations.”\n\nPhoto\n\nBanks have also been put off by Bitfinex’s operations. Wells Fargo said this year that it would no longer move money from Bitfinex accounts. Shortly after, Bitfinex said its main banks in Taiwan were shutting it off. Since then, it has moved between a series of banks in other countries, without telling customers where the exchange’s money is stored.\n\nBut nothing has drawn more criticism than the operation of Tether, a virtual currency that is supposed to be tied — or tethered — to the value of a dollar.\n\nCustomers can buy Tether coins on Bitfinex and then transfer them to other virtual currency exchanges, providing a way to move dollars between countries without going through banks. Tether has also become a very popular way to buy Bitcoin. In recent weeks, a few hundred millions dollars’ worth of Tether has changed hands on a daily basis across several exchanges, according to data on CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nTether and Bitfinex have insisted that the two operations are separate. But leaked documents known as the Paradise Papers, which were made public this month, show that Appleby, an offshore law firm, helped Mr. Potter and Mr. Devasini, the Bitfinex operators, set up Tether in the British Virgin Islands in late 2014.\n\nOne persistent online critic, going by the screen name Bitfinex’ed, has written several very detailed essays on Medium arguing that Bitfinex appears to be creating Tether coins out of thin air and then using them to buy Bitcoin and push the price up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTether and Bitfinex have countered this criticism in statements on the companies’ websites and promised that every Tether is backed up by a dollar sitting in a bank account. In September, the companies provided an accounting document intended to prove that Tether is financed with real money.\n\nLewis Cohen, a lawyer at the law firm Hogan Lovells who advises many virtual currency projects, said the document, because of the careful way it was phrased, did not prove that the Tether coins are backed by dollars.\n\nEven if they are, he said, Tether and Bitfinex appear to be violating laws in the United States and Europe that govern investments like Tether, which has qualities very similar to a money market mutual fund.\n\n“There are a long list of reasons that you don’t want to deal with them,” Mr. Cohen said of Tether.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tether announced that an “external attacker” had taken $30 million worth of Tether from the company’s online wallets. The company said it was working to recover the coins."", 'Wealth managers around the world are being bombarded by Bitcoin requests, according to a new report by Bloomberg. The spectacular rise in value of the cryptocurrency has caused a run on the investment, with a huge number of investors seeking positions in the new asset class.\n\nMainstream adoption for Bitcoin, which until this year was still widely considered a black market currency, has grown at remarkable rates. The explosive price increases have led to new vehicles for investment such as Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and others.\n\nGeneral consensus\n\nWhile most wealth managers are uncomfortable with the risk associated with a new technologically backed asset class, the bulk are willing to allow clients to enter the Bitcoin market. However, the vast majority of wealth managers suggest removing initial investment as quickly as possible and only leaving gains in the market.\n\nAccording to Kevin Grimes, president of Grimes and Co., it’s best to sell enough of your position to get your original investment out, but he’s still very strongly advising holding some position in the cryptocurrency. He says:\n\n""Laughing off Bitcoin could wind up being a big mistake. Bitcoin could go to zero and be a scam, and it could go up to numbers no one has conceived of yet.”\n\nRegardless, the reality that Bitcoin is moving into the mainstream in itself validates the potential for substantial price increases, according to others.', ""Bitstamp, one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced it will launch trading of Bitcoin Cash, a new currency that many Bitcoin supporters view as a rival.\n\n“We get requests from our users who want to trade it,” said Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodric. “We want to be as agnostic as possible so we look at the system, and if we believe there is sufficient demand and there will be trading and trading volume, we’re going to list it.”\n\nTrading of Bitcoin Cash on Bitstamp, which is the third-largest in the world for U.S. dollar and euro trading of Bitcoin, begins in the next couple weeks. The move could indicate possible growing acceptance of a cryptocurrency that many hardcore Bitcoiners view as an unwanted stepchild of Bitcoin and potential threat to the top cryptocurrency.\n\nIt's also significant because Bitstamp is one of the more conservative exchanges and currently only offers trading in the other four cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ethereum's Ether, Litecoin and Ripple's XRP — that round out the top five by market capitalization. It was the first nationally licensed Bitcoin exchange, a designation that applied across all 28 European Union countries.\n\nThe near-clone of Bitcoin was created in August by a group of Bitcoiners who disagree ideologically with the future development plans for the original cryptocurrency. They instead support a certain method for increasing the number of transactions that can be processed on the network at any given time that is generally known as “big blocks.” Bitcoin Cash currently has a market capitalization of $20 billion compared to Bitcoin’s $137 billion.\n\nEarlier in November, another so-called fork of Bitcoin was scheduled to occur that would have again created a new version of Bitcoin, this one containing elements of compromise for both camps across the ideological split. However, this plan, called SegWit2x, was called off, and so many of the ideologically driven big block supporters have instead begun pushing Bitcoin Cash.\n\n“There are still people out there who think Bitcoin should have larger blocks, and right now Bitcoin Cash provides them with exactly that,” said Kodric. “I think that’s why some of the demand emerged — SegWit2x didn’t happen, so some of the attention pivoted toward Bitcoin Cash.”\n\nBitcoin Cash has come under criticism from the Bitcoin community for its small developer community, calling into question just how decentralized the cryptocurrency actually is. Many also believe that market manipulation may have pushed up the price of Bitcoin Cash over a brief period earlier this month when the price skyrocketed from a low of $650 on a Friday to a high near $2,500 the next day. It has since dropped to about $1,200, while a Bitcoin is worth roughly $8,200.\n\n[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I own Bitcoin.]\n\nKodric acknowledged the suspicious activity but said it was impossible to prove. Instead, he noted that Bitcoin Cash’s trading volume has been roughly half that of Bitcoin, “so we would prefer to leave it to the market to decide.”\n\nKodric said that to list a cryptocurrency, the exchange evaluates its technology and the market supply and demand for that coin.\n\nRegarding the politically charged atmosphere around Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Kodric said that the exchange has not generally been supportive of the big block side, and did not sign the agreement to do the SegWit2x fork. “By listing Bitcoin Cash, we’re not endorsing anything,” he said. “We’re just a marketplace where people can go with their money. We’re not doing any harm to Bitcoin or anything beneficial to Bitcoin Cash.”\n\nHe compared the battle between the two sides to the cola wars. “Coca-Cola invented the sweet, dark, bubbly drink, then Pepsi copied everything 90-95% from Coca-Cola, and they marketed the recipe with bigger bottles — actually, similar to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash at the moment — and they did an aggressive marketing campaign to promote Pepsi, and a bunch of people went to the Pepsi camp and said it was a better drink. Maybe a similar thing is happening here. We’ll have two cryptocurrencies similar in the technology having vocal, strong and sometimes aggressive supporters. We’re in the business of allowing users to to trade whatever they want. We’re not taking any side.”"", 'Altcoins\n\nInvestor relations management is a crucial part of the operations of any business whose assets are traded by the public. In the growing crypto world, ventures are still learning this the hard way, as NEO’s recent investor relations disaster demonstrates.\n\nAlso Read: Exchanges Suspend USDT Transactions After $30 Million Tether Treasury Wallet Hack\n\nTraders, investors and self-proclaimed former supporters of the NEO project are attacking the team on social media and community forums over what they see as misleading behavior. This is while advocates of the company are already battling what they call “baseless FUD”.\n\nThe source of the frustrations are a few teasers by NEO promoters that insinuated that big announcements were coming soon. Some took this as a hint to buy and the price jumped as speculation about the possible announcement circulated. A few people even thought this could be related to a possible change in regulations in China regarding ICOs.\n\nWhen the expected date of the supposed big reveal passed and nothing materialized other than a new developers’ conference, traders reacted in anger and the price fell. When NEO later followed with an announcement of a white paper for a decentralized cryptographic trade and payment service creation platform, some of their followers were already too upset to give the news much credence.\n\nSome supporters have even expressed worries that this type of behavior will cause regulators to crack down harder on cryptocurrencies and ICOs. In the mainstream business world, for comparison, if someone is found to be even hinting at an upcoming major announcement that can push a stock’s price up or down to a selected group of investors at the expense of the general public, they can be prosecuted for insider trading.\n\nWhat is NEO?\n\nSometimes referred to by supporters as China’s answer to Ethereum NEO (formerly known as Antshares) is a smart contracts blockchain platform.\n\nNEO supports digital certificates, which the developers say solves the potential problem of untrustworthy nodes on a public blockchain.\n\nThey proclaim that “On the NEO blockchain, users are able to register, trade, and circulate multiple types of assets.

Die Digitalwährung Bitcoin ist von einem Diebstahl bei einem Anbieter einer konkurrierenden Kryptowährung belastet worden.\n\nIn der Nacht auf Dienstag fiel der Bitcoin-Kurs zeitweise um rund fünf Prozent auf knapp 7800 US-Dollar. Auslöser war eine Mitteilung des Anbieters der Digitalwährung ""Tether"", wonach infolge eines Hackerangriffs 31 Millionen US-Dollar aus dem System entwendet worden seien. Bis Vormittag erholte sich der Bitcoin etwas und notierte wieder über der Marke von 8000 Dollar.\n\nStarke Kursschwankungen von fünf Prozent oder mehr an einem Tag sind bei Digitalwährungen eher die Regel als die Ausnahme. Dies ist auch einer der Hauptkritikpunkte, die Gegner von Kryptowährungen anführen. Sie argumentieren, als Währung seien die Digitaldevisen wegen der starken Kursschwankungen nicht zu betrachten, vielmehr als Spekulationsobjekt. Ein weiterer Kritikpunkt lautet, dass Digitalwährungen unsicher seien. Diebstähle wie der bei Tether, die immer wieder vorkommen, bestärken diese Sichtweise.\n\nDie Digitaldevise Tether verwendet ein etwas anderes Konzept als die bekannteste Kryptowährung Bitcoin. Tether ist eins zu eins an den amerikanischen Dollar gebunden. Laut der Internetseite Coinmarketcap.com, die die Marktkapitalisierung und damit die Relevanz von Digitalwährungen berechnet, steht Tether derzeit an neunzehnter Position aller Kryptowährungen. Von diesen soll es mittlerweile mehr als 1000 geben.', 'Peter Smith in London NOVEMBER 22, 2017 12 A small Paris-based asset manager has launched Europe’s first bitcoin mutual fund in a move intended to draw institutional investor interest in the volatile cryptocurrency that has surged from $1,000 to more than $8,300 this year. The unregulated Tobam bitcoin fund is the latest evidence that cryptocurrencies are pushing deeper into the mainstream, and comes ahead of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s plans to start listing bitcoin futures with a centralised clearing mechanism. There are significant regulatory hurdles for asset managers to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are often associated with money-laundering and cyber theft. Unlike other currencies, bitcoins are strings of computer code, not securities. This means they are not regulated by many financial watchdogs, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, and cannot be held by traditional mutual funds or most exchange traded funds. Tobam’s fund is classified as an alternative investment fund, is not traded on an exchange and does not fall under the European mutual fund structure known as Ucits. However, it has daily liquidity based on market closing prices, as is the case in most Ucits mutual funds. Tobam said it required the approval of France’s financial regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, to launch the fund. Yves Choueifaty, the founder of Tobam, said the $10bn asset manager had to convince the AMF that the bitcoin fund’s “framework is protective of investors”. PwC is the fund’s auditor and Caceis, Crédit Agricole’s asset-servicing banking group, is its custodian. “How to run the money and invest in cryptocurrencies is quite elaborate,” he said. “We found some investors to launch the fund and we have had a lot of interest from an intellectual point of view.” Cryptocurrencies – investing or gambling? Play video  Mr Choueifaty said he would be disappointed if the bitcoin fund had not grown to a size of more than $400m in the next two to three years. Adrian Lowcock, investment director at Architas, the multi-manager investor, said the bitcoin fund as well as investment trusts invested in the cryptocurrency underlined interest from mainstream investors. “Obviously there is an appetite for this type of investment,” he said. Boudewijn Rooseboom, a co-founder of Cyber Capital, a specialist in cryptocurrency investment, said there was a lot of confusion about the nature of cryptocurrencies. “But from a portfolio diversification perspective, cryptocurrencies could be an interesting proposition for institutional investors,” he said. Trading in bitcoin remains hugely volatile. The currency crashed 27 per cent in the first three weeks of September, down from $4,950 to $3,612 for one bitcoin, only to go on to trade above $5,000 by mid-October, figures on Coindesk, the website providing news about digital currencies, show. “More and more cryptocurrencies have been created in recent years, with bitcoin gaining the largest market capitalisation and the longest record, while also being the most liquid,” Mr Choueifaty said. “Despite growing interest for the digital currency, the current solutions available to access bitcoin pose numerous difficulties for investors.” He added: “While bitcoin is prone to significant risks, including a very high level of volatility, it also provides diversification benefits.” Mainstream portfolio managers and financial advisers have said recently that most institutional investors are far from considering bitcoin investments Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT', ""Bitcoin's tremendous rally in 2017 has left analysts racing to revise their predictions. Mike Novogratz feels that Bitcoin's rally is not done yet and that it is poised to cross $10,000 by year end.\n\n$10K by April 2018? Nah...sooner\n\nMike Novogratz, who was ranked a billionaire by Forbes in 2007 and 2008, has been a long-term Bitcoin bull. In an interview to CNN a month back, he stated that he would not be surprised if Bitcoin reaches $10,000 by April 2018. Bitcoin's strong rally in the last month has made him revise his prediction. He now expects Bitcoin to cross $10k by the end of 2017.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg TV, Mike Novogratz said:\n\nI think literally we end the year at $10,000 in Bitcoin. I think that is a decent move from here. I think we end the year at close to $500 in Ethereum.\n\nWhile Bitcoin might have stolen the thunder in 2017, Mike believes that Ethereum could now be poised to make rapid gains:\n\nJust in the last few days, Ethereum has started to move. I actually think it's gonna put a new high soon. There are a lot of positive things happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDeeply invested\n\nMike Novogratz, who was a partner in Goldman Sachs and hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group, is deeply invested in Bitcoin. He was an early investor in Bitcoin, purchasing Bitcoins for $50 each in 2013. He also invested in Ether at the IPO, picking it up for about thirty cents. He has stated that he has invested 10% of his life savings in Bitcoin and Ether. Given the massive increase in prices of Bitcoin and Ether over the past year, that proportion is likely to have increased. Novogratz is currently looking to raise up to $500 mln to set up a hedge fund in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nFrom strength to strength\n\nBitcoin has moved from strength to strength, shrugging off the $30 mln hack of tether on Monday. According to Novogratz, while security and safe custody of cryptocurrencies is a concern, the market has not reacted badly since $30 mln is small compared to the overall crypto marketcap of $250 bln. In 2017, nothing seems to affect Bitcoin - whether it is Jamie Dimon's negativity or China's crackdown. With the huge momentum behind Bitcoin, it wouldn't be a surprise if Novogratz is forced to revise his projection once more before 2017 ends."", 'By Sana Elouazi\n\nRabat – A few days after the digital services company MTDS announced that it would accept Bitcoin as payment for the first time in the kingdom, Morocco’s Foreign Exchange Office and central bank have issued a public statement stating that transactions made via cryptocurrencies are banned and will be punishable by fines.\n\n“Penalties and fines will apply to anyone engaging in transactions with foreign countries that do not go through authorized intermediaries or in foreign currencies not listed by Bank Al-Maghrib,” warned the Foreign Exchange Office in a statement issued November 20.\n\nThe institution added in its press release that cryptocurrencies work within a “hidden payment system that is not backed by any financial institution.”\n\nIt also emphasized that “the use of cryptocurrencies entails significant risks for their users,” as cryptocurrencies could be linked to illegal activities on the Web, in particular the purchase and sale of drugs, weapons, and ransomware.\n\nFor MTDS, the adoption of Bitcoin is one of “the innovative payment methods with high growth potential that allows customers, especially international, pay services directly by Bitcoin alongside other traditional methods of payment such as transfer and local and international bank cards,” explained CEO Karl Stanzick in a statement.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin, of the English “bit” unit of binary information and “corner” coin, is a global cryptocurrency and digital payment system.\n\nIt is considered the first, and most famous, decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central repository or single administrator. Instead, transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.\n\nAlthough the blockchain registry is available for consultation at any time and provides an overview of all transactions that have been made via Bitcoin, the identity of users remains unknown for certain currencies like the Bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, the exchange rate of this cryptocurrency is worth more than USD 8000 against USD 0.1 when it was launched in 2009.\n\nIt is difficult to know the exact amount exchanged by Moroccans, the number of users, and their identity, due to the anonymity of transactions. However, it is estimated that transactions are at around USD 200,000 per day, which corresponds to 25 Bitcoins, according to the local bitcoin transaction website.\n\nInitially, Bitcoin was mostly used by websites, but today more merchants and companies are accepting this payment method, including Microsoft. The same for entrepreneurs who seek funding for their projects through the cryptocurrency as an alternative to the stock market.', 'Bitcoin continued to rise higher and make new all time highs as they broke through $8100 over the last 24 hours and continue to trade comfortably above it as of this writing. We have been saying that the break through the $8000 region was likely to spur another round of bullishness in the prices of bitcoin and that is what we have been seeing. Since bitcoin is the flag holder of the crypto currency, if the prices of bitcoin do well, we see that the prices of all other cryptos also rise and this just shows how important bitcoin are for this industry and bitcoin has also been repaying this faith by continuing to be resilient in the face of all kinds of methods being adopted to put it down and it has been rising again and again.\n\nGet Into Bitcoin Trading Today\n\nBitcoin Prices Move Higher\n\nNow there is growing talk of even the CBOE thinking of launching BTC options in the near future and this is just a further signal that this industry is only going to grow in the future and any talk of this industry going down or being in a bubble has to wait for a few more years. It is fundamentals like these that have been helping the prices to continue to move up and we should see some resistance in the $8200 and if there is any breakout through this region, then we should see the prices move towards the $8500 and $8800 region in due course of time. We wouldnt be surprised to see the prices being $10,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBitcoin 4H More\n\nThe ETH market has also been rejuvenated in the latest round of bullisness in the cryto market and now it is moving towards the highs of its price range. The prices trade comfortably above $360 as of this writing and it is only going to move even higher in the coming days and we should see the prices challenging the $400 region in the short term.\n\nForecast\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the day, we expect the crypto markets to continue to remain buoyant through the course of the day and this would only mean that the prices of BTC and ETH continue to move higher.\n\nThe Best and Safest Way to Buy and Sell Bitcoins\n\nFor those who are looking to take advantage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies price fluctuations, some brokers provide traders with instant access to trade Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.

11/22/2017,"['99% of Cryptocurrencies are total scams. And, yes, Cryptocurrencies are in a bubble.\n\nBUT…the opportunity is NEVER going away and generational wealth will be made. So you have to know the basics, why this opportunity even exists and what to watch out for.\n\nHere’s the problem. There’s around 900 different cryptocurrencies that exist, with new ones being created every week.\n\nI can tell you for sure: 95% of the cryptocurrencies are scams or Ponzi schemes. And I get questions every day: “Is XYZ currency a scam?” And nobody listens to the answer.\n\nEveryone is convinced they are right. That’s a bad sign. I always tell myself I’m the dumbest person in the room. Then I call the smarter people and ask them lots of questions. And then I read everything I can. And in this case, I read the code.\n\nBut the opportunity is immense. Think, “Internet 1994”. Right before the “right before”.\n\nBC will stand for “Before Crypto” and AC will stand for “After Crypto”. We are in AC right now and the world is about to change.\n\nI’ve never written about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies before. But there’s a reason I want to start now.\n\nWe’re in a hype bubble.\n\nIt doesn’t mean cryptos or bad. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy. It just means….there’s a lot of hype and scammers out there. We’ve seen this story at least twice before in past 20 years and many people have gotten hurt.\n\nI’ve been actively involved in investing in Cryptocurrencies since 2013 (I sold my book, “Choose Yourself” in a Bitcoin-only store I created a month before I released it on Amazon). And for the past 18 months I’ve participated in various ICOs (Internet Coin Offerings) that are all doing well.\n\nI say this just to establish some credentials. I will be writing more frequently about cryptocurrencies simply because I see so many people I know starting to be hurt when, in fact, there’s opportunities to make a lot of money in the space.\n\nBig picture:\n\nA simple cryptocurrency transaction looks like this:\n\nA) James wants to send Joe 10 bitcoin.\n\nB) James has 100 bitcoins that he has gotten from 500 people who, in turn, got from 10,000 people, and on and on back to the very first bitcoin transaction.\n\nC) James puts together a “transaction” (technically complicated but simply described as a “transaction”) and sends it out onto the block chain.\n\nD) A “block” is a list of transactions.\n\nE) enough “miners” confirm that the transactions in a block are legit (all of the inputs are legit and all of the outputs are legit. The merchant (in this case, “Joe” ) can decide how much validation he needs.\n\nF) the bitcoins get transferred\n\nEvery step above is much more complicated, but for a reason.\n\nPros and Cons:\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nA) a standardized and neutral confirmation policy backed by software that has no human agendas.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nImagine I want to send Joe dollars to buy his house. I need to trust all of the middlemen between Joe and me: local bank, central bank, lawyers, governments, Joe’s bank, etc to approve of this transaction if I do it in dollars.\n\nThis is ok but at each step someone can be untrustworthy. They are all humans, even the government (humans subtly influence the price of the dollar and also share details of the transaction with unfriendly parties (the IRS)).\n\nAlso, each step in the above has a transaction cost. So inflation is built into the system.\n\nIf this were a bitcoin transaction, enough miners need to approve that this transaction is valid. So even if a few miners are not trustworthy, the bulk of them will be and we can trust that the transaction between me and Joe is legit.\n\n[This process is complicated. Suffice to say, it works on Bitcoin and any other “legit” cryptocurrency.]\n\nThis is the ENTIRE reason for cryptocurrency: avoid governments, borders, middlemen, extra transaction costs. As well as have high security and avoid forgery.\n\n(there is another reason for cryptocurrency, which is to do more complicated transactions that we can call “contracts” without lawyers, etc. This reason is sometimes the basis for legit ICOs).\n\nImagine the history of money. Money is used as a store of value OR as a way to transact without having to use a barter system.\n\nStore of Value\n\nFirst it was the land you owned and the resources you developed on that land (wheat, grains, etc).\n\nThen it was metals. Gold, silver, etc. You traveled with it by fashioning it into jewelry. Too much gold = harder to travel.\n\nPaper currency. Backed first by gold but then…faith in God (“in God we trust”) or government. (Or a pyramid…with an eye in it????)\n\nElectronic currency. Easily transportable. But transaction fees all over the system. Zero privacy.\n\nAnd the next generation is Cryptocurrency. Easily transportable, little to zero transaction fees, no human intervention between payor and payee, high anonymity, and even functionality.\n\nMoney evolves, like anything else, and the natural evolution of money is always as a store of value that is easier to move, more secure, and more private.\n\nTransactions\n\nTransactions have the same history. And the same issues. How can you transact across a far geographic area with less fees, less costs, less chance for human error, higher security and privacy.\n\nA natural evolution leads go crypto-currency.\n\nThe biggest trend:\n\nTheism ==> Humanism ==> Data-ism\n\nThink about every industry in human history:\n\nWAR:\n\nTheism: A country planning on going to war would make sacrifices to their gods. Would pray. And would surrender to the fact that whosever god was stronger would win.\n\nHumanism: More people, more bullets, more human intelligence, equals the winner in a war.\n\nData-ism: This is the war being fought every day right now. We saw tiny snapshot of it with the election but it’s only a snapshot in a ten year long movie.\n\nThe war is on every single day. It’s fought in every country. It’s fought with data and hacking and piracy.\n\nMedicine:\n\nTheism: Shamans and priests would pray for health or do rituals to enhance health.\n\nHumanism: The doctor knocks your knee, puts hand on head, take two aspiring and call me in the morning\n\nData-ism: Bloodwork, DNA work, robotic surgeries, fMRIs, Catscans. Statistical matching with massive database of similar scans to do diagnosis. All medicine is starting to be outsourced to data.\n\nCurrency:\n\nTheism: “In God We Trust”\n\nHumanism: Let’s throw a President on there. Let’s get the signature of the Secretary of Treasury up there. “Don’t worry, we’re good for it.” While we print a few trillion without telling anyone.\n\nData-ism: The natural evolution: Cryptocurrency.\n\nDoes this mean Bitcoin is “The winner”. Buy bitcoin?\n\nNo. It just means the natural evolution of currency is arriving and nothing will stop it.\n\nThe basic philosophy is:\n\n– Decentralized. So no one government entity can quietly mint money for their own purposes and have access to your transactions, accounts, etc.\n\n– Security. So nobody can forge or steal your money.\n\n– Privacy. Your transactions can’t be seen and reported to other entitles.\n\n– Functionality. This is the more technical parts of the blockchain in Cryptocurrencies but suffice to say some of the “intrinsic value” of a coin is the functionality and computational power used to “mine” that functionality.\n\nThere’s not going to be ONE winner.\n\nJust like there is not one paper currency (or metal currency). There’s dollars, Euros, pesos.\n\nThe difference is: those currencies have geographic borders.\n\nCryptocurrencies have “use” borders. ZCash might be used by people requiring higher anonymity. Filecoin might be used by people requiring decentralized storage. Dash might be used be people requiring faster transactions.\n\nThe borders are created when more problems are solved. Which is a true innovation for currency.\n\nAs opposed to borders (and supply) being created by geographic boundaries, central banks with secret control, or a gold mine down the block.\n\nThe bad:\n\nWith Bitcoin, a list of transactions is sent out to the network in the form of a “block”. Miners, who are slowly paid in more bitcoin up to a maximum of 21,000,000 validate a transaction.\n\nIf a transaction doesn’t make it into a block (on Bitcoin) it waits a certain period of time to get into the next block.\n\nThis means it might take more time (a problem).\n\nAnother problem is that everyone can “see” the transaction on what is called the blockchain. They can’t see who it was but they can see the size and other details. (a problem).\n\nSometimes software can provide a solution (a coffee shop can say, I’ll verify the transaction anyway and trust that in ten minutes I’ll know for sure and there’s not a lot of risk in this).\n\nBut a software layer involves humans and human error and human “evil”. Hence there are scammers and Ponzi scheme and theft (just like with paper currencies).\n\nThe good news is these are problems that can be eliminated.\n\nJust like Internet software since 1991 solved (although always improving) the problems of speed, security, transactions, privacy, more functionality, etc think of cryptocurrencies as the “Internet of Money”.\n\nThese problems are being solved.\n\nEither with new currencies (examples: Ether, Dash, filecoin, etc) some of which may be scam currencies, others may be legit. Time and research will tell (just like with the Internet in 1995)…OR with “forks” in currencies, like what is happening today with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nSo what is Bitcoin cash and what should I do?\n\nBitcoin Cash tries to solve the problem of how can I buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin without using the software layer of Bitcoin.\n\nRemember, if a transaction doesn’t make it onto a block that is then sent out into the network to be validated, it has to wait.\n\nBitcoin Cash is simply the same as Bitcoin, except it increases the size of a block from 1MB to 8MB. Hence, faster transactions.\n\nThe reason that many exchanges are nervous about this “hard fork” is:\n\nA) it’s never happened before. So there could be the possibility that smart developers can find a flaw in the process and steal money.\n\nB) A “fork” is similar to a human election. We had a choice between Clinton and Trump and forked to Trump (not an exact analogy but rough).\n\nBitcoin is designed to limit human involvement as much as possible because all humans have different agendas.\n\nFor instance, perhaps China is greatly in favor of Bitcoin Cash because they currently have a huge edge on mining and they will be able to amass a large amount of Bitcoin Cash before others can.\n\nSo the fallout of Bitcoin Cash, while probably correct philosophically and from a software point of view, is still unclear from a human point of view.\n\nSame for the development of any new cryptocurrency (although all new currencies need scrutiny on the software side as well). But this fork is a bit more intense because Bitcoin is so big and it’s the first time this has happened.\n\nThis leads immediately to some logical conclusions:\n\nWhat to do right now about Bitcoin Cash and August 1:\n\nA) remove your bitcoin wallet from exchanges and store it in cold storage. If you google “cold storage” you can see step by step how to do that.\n\nB) If Bitcoin crashes 20% over the next few days because of this fork, I’d be a buyer. The philosophy of Bitcoin remains the same, it’s still the biggest, and volatility only creates opportunity.\n\nC) If Bitcoin Cash goes up too much, I’d sell or sell short, only because we don’t really know how people should value it.\n\nCryptocurrencies are going to be volatile for awhile. So in addition to the basic opportunity (Cryptocurrencies taking over all currencies) there is many additional trading opportunities due to the volatility.\n\nFirst, back to the basics:\n\nWhy does volatility create opportunity?\n\nBecause it’s rare that intrinsic value changes very quickly from day to day.\n\nExample: We know everything there is to know about McDonalds and 1000s of analysts research the company.\n\nThe intrinsic value of McDonald’s will almost certainly never go down 20% in a day. But if the stock went down 20% in a day (example: a 9/11 event occurs causing a mass fear selloff across all stocks), then MCD becomes a value buy because the volatility exceeded the normal change in value.\n\nIf you can identify the Cryptocurrencies that are legitimate and not scams, then you can make a lot of money playing in volatile situations in Cryptocurrencies.\n\nConclusion:\n\nA) Cryptocurrency philosophy is valid and not going anywhere and is a natural evolution in:\n\nB) the history of money from bartering to coins to paper money to data money\n\nC) the history of every industry from theism to humanism to data-ism.\n\nD) Volatility is huge as people determine what coins are real and what aren’t.\n\nThese are the basics.\n\nI wrote these basics around the circumstances of the event happening today: The bitcoin fork.\n\nBut I also want to begin helping the many people who are being scammed by all sorts of schemes and layers of schemes that are trying to dupe people into buying or trading cryptocurrencies that can be potentially worse than giant Madoff schemes.\n\nThe evolution of money, and the evolution of every industry, strongly imply that Cryptocurrencies, probably in many forms, will be in our future. And will dominate the money supply at some point.\n\nAnd how we get from “here” to “there” will be paved with many lucrative opportunities.\n\nBut I was burned plenty this type of opportunity in the 90s and in the 00s and I don’t plan on doing so again. The solution is research, diversification, building a network of intelligence people who understand all the relevant issues, and then making smart allocation decisions.\n\nIf you like this article and would like more on Cryptocurrencies you can let me know in the comments.\n\n(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)', 'The bitcoin bulls are charging.\n\nA day after hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz said the cryptocurrency will end the year at $10,000, Fundstrat’s Thomas Lee doubled his price target to $11,500 by the middle of 2018 -- a 40 percent gain from current levels.\n\nLee, who heads research at Fundstrat, said a 10 percent pullback earlier this month triggered by the controversial cancellation of an upgrade to bitcoin’s underlying software has set the stage for the coming surge.\n\nThe November slump “cleaned up weak hands,” Lee wrote Wednesday in a note to clients that almost doubled his last forecast. The strategist had warned earlier in the month that bitcoin’s rally to $7,000 from $3,500 raised the likelihood for a short-term pullback. “We no longer feel caution is warranted,” he said.\n\nBitcoin rose 1.2 percent to $8,230.12 as of 11:05 a.m. in New York, about $100 short of its all-time high set Tuesday after Novogratz’s comments. The most popular cryptocurrency has surged more than sevenfold since December, surpassing $8,000 for the first time this week.\n\nThe ride to records hasn’t been straight up for the virtual asset, with three separate slumps of more than 25 percent all giving way to subsequent rallies this year.\n\n“We recommend steady buying of Bitcoin at these levels,” Lee said in the Wednesday report. Fundstrat also boosted its price target for the Bitcoin Investment Trust, an over-the-counter security that offers investors exposure to bitcoin. Lee predicts it will trade at $1,300 by mid-2018, up from his prior target of $800.', 'JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon is considering a dramatic u-turn on bitcoin, according to reports.\n\nIn September the Wall Street executive said that if he found any of his employees trading the cryptocurrency, he would “fire them in a second, for two reasons: It is against our rules and they are stupid, and both are dangerous”.\n\nBut now the bank is weighing up whether to help its own clients bet on the price of bitcoin via proposed futures contracts to be offered by CME Group (owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange), according to Bloomberg.\n\nChicago-based CME has said it hopes to offer bitcoin futures before the end of the year, in a further sign that recognised financial institutions are beginning to open up to cryptocurrencies.\n\nBarclays revealed in July that it had opened up discussions with UK regulators about using digital currencies like bitcoin, and several other banks including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Societe Generale have set up a consortium to build a cryptocurrency platform of their own.\n\nBut it would represent a shock move if JPMorgan were to enter the market so soon after Mr Dimon’s disparaging remarks.\n\nMr Dimon has long been one of bitcoin’s most strident critics. “It is worse than tulips bulbs,” he said during his most recent comments on the topic, referring to the Dutch Tulip craze of the 1600s which is widely seen as the world’s first speculative bubble. He also labelled bitcoin a fraud and warned that it will “blow up” at an investor conference in September.\n\n“The currency isn’t going to work. You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,” Mr Dimon said.\n\nBitcoin’s value has surged eightfold so far this year to more than $8,000, forcing Wall Street banks to consider their clients’ demand to speculate on the cryptocurrency, despite bank executives’ skepticism.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The idea is to take profits from bitcoin as it advances to reinvest in gold and silver assets, he said in an interview on Nov. 16.\n\n“Bitcoin was explicitly designed to be digital gold,” said Naylor-Leyland. “So if you’re going to have a small proportion of a fund in bitcoin, it should be in a gold fund, because that’s exactly the point. It’s about bringing the ownership of disciplined money into the modern world. Bitcoin is paving the way for the reintroduction of gold as global money.”\n\nBitcoin’s up more than eight times this year to top $8,000 as entrepreneurs in the field say its value lies in proof of concept for a new kind of payment system not reliant on third parties like governments, big banks or credit-card companies. By contrast, gold’s held in a tight range since February, with a short break upward in September as U.S. and North Korea tensions spiraled.\n\nFor a QuickTake on bitcoin and blockchain, click here\n\nThe virtual currency has many backers and detractors. Mike Novogratz, who’s starting a $500 million hedge fund to invest in such assets, said bitcoin will likely end the year at $10,000. Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas on Monday raised his 2018 price target for the second time this month, to $14,000 from $11,000. But Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last month said gold wins out over cryptocurrencies when assessed on most of the key characteristics of money.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain resolve gold’s problems of divisibility, ownership and speed of transmission, said Naylor-Leyland, who’s investing through a Swedish-listed exchange-traded fund. “We’re going to revert to sound money,” he said. “If you imagine sound money and blockchain together, there’s quite an exciting potential outcome.” His fund has about 80 percent in gold and silver equities and most of the rest in physical metal.\n\nBitcoin traded at about $8,250 as of 1:26 p.m. in Singapore on Thursday, some $120 short of its record on Tuesday. Spot gold was at $1,289 an ounce.', 'Tobam, a Paris-based fund manager, has set up what it says is the first mutual fund in Europe to track the value of bitcoin investments, in the latest sign that the cryptocurrency is overcoming industry reservations.\n\nThe fund will be available to investors worldwide on a private-placement basis, the company said in a statement Wednesday. While bitcoin is “prone to significant risks,” it provides diversification benefits and, together with other cryptocurrencies, has the potential to become a durable standard in financial and saving markets, according to the statement. Tobam’s cyber-security systems will back up the fund.\n\nBitcoin’s surge in value this year is forcing conventional banks and money managers to balance clients’ interest in speculating on the cryptocurrency with executives’ skepticism about its future. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is weighing whether to help clients bet on the cryptocurrency via the CME Group Inc.’s proposed futures contracts, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.\n\n“Direct investment in bitcoin can be operationally challenging, from dealing with the choice of the platform, to maintaining the proper security measures,” Christophe Roehri, head of business development at Tobam, said in an emailed statement.\n\nAll About Bitcoin, Blockchain and Their Crypto World: QuickTake\n\nTobam, which oversees about $9 billion in assets, is controlled by its employees and counts the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and Amundi SA among its shareholders.', 'FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) has joined the ranks of those warning about the virtual currency bitcoin as an investment.\n\n“I would simply not recommend this to the everyday investor,” Ulrich Stephan, chief strategist at Germany’s largest lender, said on Wednesday.\n\nStephan said that fluctuations are too great and regulation too scant. He noted that German investors were reluctant to invest in stocks, but were generating hype about bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin smashed through the $8,000 level for the first time over the weekend and traded at $8,216 at 1523 GMT on Wednesday, with many experts saying $10,000 is possible.\n\nAn eightfold increase in the value of the volatile cryptocurrency this year has led to multiple warnings of a bubble, and institutional investors are broadly staying away.\n\nRetail investors, however, as well as some hedge funds and family offices, are piling in despite JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon earlier this year calling bitcoin a “fraud”.\n\nAlthough UBS (UBSG.S) Chairman Axel Weber urged caution on bitcoin last week, he also said there was potential for the technology underpinning it.\n\n“At this point, I‘m very cautious about bitcoin as an entity. I‘m much more optimistic about the underlying technology,” Weber added.\n\nSweden’s central bank is one organization which is investigating the potential for digital currencies.\n\n“An e-krona would have the potential to counteract some of the problems that could arise on the payment market in the future when the use of cash is rapidly declining,” the Riksbank said in a report in September.', 'Bitcoin backers have created one of the most volatile, active markets on earth—and Chicago\'s trading community wants in. CME Group and Cboe Global Markets—two of the biggest exchanges in the world—each proposed a new bitcoin futures contract in recent months. When the contracts launch, the Chicago companies will convert trading to fees.\n\nThey\'ve lent legitimacy to an exuberant bitcoin market that more than doubled in value to $137 billion in three months. Chicago traders and their high-speed electronic trading firms are egging the \u200b exchanges on so they can capitalize on a craze outside stagnant traditional markets. As the exchanges race to lay claim to the new turf, they\'re dismissing concerns of a potential ""catastrophe"" that could ripple through the financial system.\n\n""It\'s very, very volatile, but it also lacks some of the regulations and some of the air brakes that other systems have evolved over time,"" says Josh Metnick, a technologist who consults on bitcoin and has used it.\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin surged past $8,000 this month, up from below $15 five years ago. CME, with contracts on everything from gold to soybeans, aims to lure a new generation of traders with bitcoin and cater to major existing clients. ""Customers have continued to increase their demand for this product, and we\'re excited to bring it to the market for them,"" says Tim McCourt, CME\'s managing director of equity products.\n\nHEAVY TRADING\n\nCboe Chief Strategy Officer John Deters echoes the sentiment. Trading in bitcoin is more than six times heavier than trading in Apple shares, relative to their respective markets, he says. ""We wouldn\'t be doing this if we didn\'t think it was here to stay,"" Deters says. Still, he notes Cboe clients ""never have to touch bitcoin."" The contracts will link to bitcoin but settle in dollars.\n\nDespite JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon panning the secretive currency tied to criminal activities like Silk Road\'s illegal drug market, institutional players such as Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs are embracing bitcoin. It has become the most popular of some 1,000 digital currencies.\n\nCybernerds hidden in rooms full of computer servers solve mathematical problems to facilitate bitcoin transactions. For their work, these bitcoin ""miners"" earn a portion of the finite pool of 21 million bitcoins, and use blockchain technology to collectively track it. (Only about 17 million are minted in this process so far.)\n\nA bitcoin holder has a cryptocurrency key to redeem or transfer the value in minutes through bitcoin exchanges in New York and San Francisco or other trading platforms. Its proponents call it a disruptive, anonymous and ultrasecure means of transferring value without government interference or banking fees.\n\nBehind the scenes, Chicago\'s cottage industry of traders is bolstering bitcoin. DRW Holdings, one of the city\'s biggest trading firms, with 800 employees, secretly created bitcoin firm Cumberland Mining in 2014. Now it\'s a public powerhouse headed by Bobby Cho.\n\nThe firm, named for the Grateful Dead song ""Cumberland Blues,"" mainly buys and sells large bitcoin orders. In the past couple of years, the U.S. Marshals Service has auctioned off about 140,000 confiscated bitcoins, and Cumberland won half of them, Cho said on a FinTank cryptocurrency panel in October. That 70,000 bitcoin load was worth more than $560 million. ""It got to a point where it\'s hard to ignore,"" he said in a recent interview. Cho says rivals are also entering the bitcoin arena, but he declines to name them.\n\nChicago traders are gravitating to digital currencies as their industry consolidates. More competition and less volatility in the stock, options and futures markets is causing some electronic trading firms that emerged in the city over the past 20 years to shutter and sell.\n\nNear Milwaukee Avenue\'s ""Hipster Highway,"" bitcoin ATMs at two Foodsmart Urban Markets let users buy, redeem or withdraw bitcoins. Kevin Rojas, a 22-year-old clerk at one store, says ""tons"" of people, mainly 20-somethings, use the machine. ""I see people feeding $100 bills in there all the time,"" he says. He hasn\'t used it but is curious and plans to read up on bitcoin.\n\nMORE PLAYERS\n\nAthena Bitcoin, the Chicago company behind the ATMs, operates some 50 fee-charging machines across the country, with many in Florida, Georgia and Texas. Athena CEO Eric Gravengaard formerly worked at two Chicago options trading firms, Spot Trading and Chicago Trading. ""Bitcoin has that excitement because it\'s certainly a more volatile market at present,"" he says.\n\nHe also launched a Chicago hedge fund, Red Leaf Advisors, that invests in bitcoin, and a bitcoin exchange called BitQuick. As an adviser to Cboe\'s new product committee, he urged the exchange to enter the market, as did other firms, he says.\n\nAnother trader who left a top trading firm to venture into bitcoin is Luke Hoersten, who oversaw trading technology at Chicago-based Allston Trading until 2015. Now he\'s trying to start Bitnominal, a Chicago bitcoin derivatives exchange that will compete with CME and Cboe if it\'s approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He says he was impressed with how ""resilient"" the digital currency was in the face of troubles like the 2014 collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.\n\nLess sophisticated retail traders are taking to bitcoin, too. Scott Diamond, who formerly worked at a health care recruiting company, was also on the FinTank panel and became an ""aggressive"" bitcoin trader in 2015. ""The people who have been laughing at me for the last three years all want to talk with me,"" says Diamond, a Ronin Partners consultant.\n\nOthers are wary. ""It\'s an illiquid investment and you\'ve got to be very careful in investing in this stuff,"" says Alan Warms, a Chicago venture capitalist who has invested in bitcoin hedge funds. ""You can lose a lot of money.""\n\nThomas Peterffy, chairman of West Palm Beach, Fla.-based Interactive Brokers, wrote the CFTC, warning it about potential fallout for CME clearinghouse clients. ""Even clearing members who do not wish to clear cryptocurrencies because they judge the risk to be too great cannot isolate themselves and their customers from a potentially catastrophic loss,"" he said in his Nov. 14 letter, also printed as a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMeanwhile, Cboe and CME are engaging in one-upmanship like never before as they compete head-to-head on a futures contract for the first time. Given the demand, perhaps it will be the rare market with room for two players.', 'JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNiceHash, a bitcoin mining service, announced on Wednesday that it would be placing a 24-hour freeze on operations after its payment system was breached, resulting in the theft over around 4,700 bitcoins—the approximate equivalent of $70 million. The company is now working with authorities in Slovenia and elsewhere to investigate the hack, and is encouraging users to change their passwords.\n\nThis latest incident follows in a long line of cryptocurrency cons that stretch back to bitcoin’s earliest days. Cryptocurrency is a digital asset introduced in 2008 by an anonymous inventor. People can transfer tokens amongst themselves through a decentralized network, which helps maintain the anonymity of the users. Cryptocurrency has become a hot commodity, even as financial experts debate whether it could be an actual alternative to fiat currency. Billions of dollars have gone into bitcoin and its imitators, and values have been shooting up in what some fear is a cryptocurrency bubble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf course, when there’s money to be made, thieves will inevitably come to exploit the system. In 2011, an anonymous netizen with the screenname allinvain claimed that someone had stolen around 25,000 of his or her bitcoins, which would have constituted an approximately $500,000 loss at the time. On the assumption that the story was true, PC World suggested it may have been the “world’s first virtual heist.”\n\nThree years later, a high-profile robbery hit a bitcoin exchange platform based in Japan called Mt. Gox. A hacker with a Hong Kong IP address broke into a user account that held a significant amount of the currency and managed to abscond with $8.75 million in Bitcoin. The hacker then laundered the coins and eventually exchanged the spoils for U.S. dollars.\n\nMt. Gox managed to recover for a short time before going bankrupt due to another heist in 2014. The cyber burglars made off with around $460 million, and another $27.4 million disappeared from its accounts under mysterious circumstances.\n\nMore recently, users of a Hong Kong-based exchange called Bitfinex had a collective $72 million stolen from their wallets in 2016. And this July, an Israeli startup named CoinDash lost $7 million during its initial coin offering when a perpetrator redirected investors’ cryptocurrency funds to a fake address.\n\nTether, the company behind a cryptocurrency that’s pegged to the U.S. dollar, also disclosed in a now-deleted announcement that hackers transferred almost $31 million worth of tokens from its treasury to an unauthorized bitcoin wallet in November. Tether claims it has updated its software to prevent the tokens from leaving the wallet and is ultimately seeking to recover them. The stolen cryptocurrency will not be redeemable for U.S. dollars.\n\nHowever, not all bitcoin losses are intentional. In November, for instance, a user of the digital wallet service called Parity stumbled across a glitch in the system and accidentally hijacked other peoples’ wallets. The user’s attempt to return the funds ended up destroying over $300 million in cryptocurrency.\n\nYet despite of this turbulent history of missing bitcoins, cryptocurrency speculators seem undeterred. Bitcoin’s value rose by over 25% on Thursday, pushing the value per coin to more than $16,000.', 'Computer hackers target the Sacramento Regional Transit system and demand a whopping ransom of a single Bitcoin.\n\nThere have been quite a few major stories concerning technology in 2017, such as the meteoric rise in the value of Bitcoin. Another huge feature of the past year has been the sheer number of ransomware attacks by hackers. Now the Sacramento Regional Transit system is the latest victim, but it appears that the hackers responsible don’t need much cash as they are only asking for a single Bitcoin in ransom.\n\nIt’s a Trap!\n\nHackers targeted the Sacramento Regional Transit system over the weekend, announcing their presence by defacing the agency’s website with a note that read:\n\nI’m sorry to modify the home page, i’m good hacker, i I just want to help you fix these vulnerability. This is one of the loopholes, modify the home page …\n\nHowever, the message was a trap. When techs made the decision to see if any damage had been done by going into the system, they activated the hacking attack that deleted 30 million files. The files erased were for internal operations of the Sacramento Regional Transit system, such as those used for assigning routes and dispatching employees. The good news is that no data was actually stolen.\n\nOverall, 70 million files were saved from being deleted by the ransomware attack. A spokeswoman for the SacRT said:\n\nThe hacker put malware into the system – that deleted the files. Our IT team shut everything down –by rebooting the system that stopped the attack from worsening.\n\nShow Me the … Single Bitcoin?\n\nThe interesting facet of this incident is that the hacker’s demands were for a single Bitcoin. The hacker(s) left a message on the company’s Facebook page, saying:\n\nhello, I will always attack your website, we are hackers. we can do everything. Pay us now to stop attacking.\n\nThe current value of a single Bitcoin is fluctuating around $8,000. However, the company has refused to pay, and they say that there was no significant slow down for the agency’s customers.\n\nOverall, it’s likely that the hacker is some bored individual looking to show off, but it’s probable that quite a few riders of the SacRT were impacted during the weekend. The one bit of good news is that news reports are focusing on the ransomware nature of the attack and not laying blame on the inclusion of cryptocurrency.\n\nDo you think the hacker(s) were just goofing around by asking for a single Bitcoin?

According to CoinMarketCap data, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has depreciated by 1 percent in the last 24 hours.\n\nWhile BTC is holding above the $8,000 mark, the upside is being capped around $8,300.\n\nThe muted trading conditions could be in part due to the Thanksgiving holidays in the major markets of Japan and the U.S. Further, concerns about the financial health of Bitfinex, one of the largest exchanges, are possibly having an influence.\n\nHowever, the investor community does not appear too concerned about the Bitfinex issue and is instead assessing the impact of the rally in bitcoin cash (BCH) and ethereum (ETH) prices on bitcoin. Comments on social media indicate investors are expecting the number one cryptocurrency by market value to feel the heat of rallies in alternative currencies like BCH and ETH.\n\nMore immediately, the price action analysis indicates scope for a healthy pullback, although the broader outlook still remains bullish with fans of bitcoin predicting a $10,000 price by years' end.\n\n4-hour chart\n\nThe above chart shows:\n\nRising channel as represented by higher highs and lower highs on price, coupled with falling tops on the RSI (i.e. bearish divergence).\n\nThe 50-MA and 100-MA are curled up in favor of the bulls, suggesting a pullback could be short-lived.\n\nView\n\nA break below the rising channel support level of $8,020 could yield a pullback to $7,600 levels. Further losses are unlikely as the 10-day MA ($7,800) is curled up in favor of the bulls.\n\nBullish scenario: A rebound from the channel support, followed by a move above $8,300 would open the door for a rally to a new record high around $8,550 (rising channel resistance).\n\nPumpkins image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Will Dimon be called to testify? Will senators ask him why he sold bitcoins to clients after saying that people who buy bitcoins are ""stupid""?\n\nWill he say:\n\n""What clients are buying … is they are buying an exposure. The thing that we are selling to them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the institutional clients we have, wouldn’t care what our views are, they shouldn’t care.""\n\nThat did not go over especially well in the Senate in 2010, when Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein actually said it about the mortgage bonds that his bank sold in the lead-up to the financial crisis. Nonetheless it was true then, and it is true now, and it will be true in my imagined future.\n\nIf you are buying bitcoin futures from JPMorgan it is because you want exposure to bitcoin. The fact that Jamie Dimon doesn’t want exposure to bitcoin may or may not be an interesting data point for you, but it is surely not dispositive. He has no inside information about bitcoin. Since Jamie Dimon announced that bitcoin was a fraud and will collapse, its price has almost doubled. He might still be right, but even if he is, you could have had a nice profit on a tactical trade since his announcement.\n\nThere is a notion, popular in some circles, that the point of an investment bank is to sell people securities that will go up: that it has a duty to its customers to carefully curate its product offerings and sell them only the stuff that it personally believes in.\n\nThis is not the point of an investment bank. JPMorgan sits between people who want to buy a thing and people who want to sell the thing, and it intermediates their trades. Diversity of opinion — some people think the thing will go up, others think it will go down — is what makes a market. If JPMorgan could only trade with clients after satisfying itself that they are right, it would never do any trades.', 'As Bitcoin prices continues to reach new highs, major investors are thinking about getting some skin in the cryptocurrency game.\n\nFrom Gold to Bitcoin\n\nMany finance and tech experts have recently called Bitcoin a “bubble” and “tulip mania 2.0” but Bitcoin has managed to thrive despite these heavy accusations, and this week it hit a new all-time high price.\n\nMany investors and hedge funds are now planning to invest in Bitcoin, ICOs, and other cryptocurrencies. One of these funds is Old Mutual Gold & Silver, which oversees $220 million of precious metal equities. According to a recent Bloomberg article, the fund has started to invest in the digital currency since April 2017. The fund has been steadily investing at least 5% in Bitcoin and then uses the profits to invest in precious metals like gold and silver.\n\nNed Naylor-Leyland, Manager of Old Mutual Gold & Silver, stated following in the report:\n\nBitcoin was explicitly designed to be digital gold. So if you’re going to have a small proportion of a fund in bitcoin, it should be in a gold fund, because that’s exactly the point. It’s about bringing the ownership of disciplined money into the modern world. Bitcoin is paving the way for the reintroduction of gold as global money.\n\nTheir unique strategy seems to be paying off since the cryptocurrency managed to climb from April’s price of $1240 to today’s $8203, which equals an impressive increase of over 550%.\n\nBitcoin: A New Investment Opportunity for Hedge Funds?\n\nSince Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, many investors have now started to primarily focus on cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings. Cryptocurrencies have given many investors stock and gold investors ‘fresh air’, and many experts believe that the market will grow even bigger in the next couple of months.\n\nThe famous investor Mike Novogratz, recently forecasted that Bitcoin may rise up to $10,000 and Ethereum as high as $500 by this year’s end. Analysts believe that once Bitcoin futures hit the markets, more institutional investors will pour their money into it and other digital assets.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Old Mutual Gold & Silver’s decision to invest in cryptocurrencies? Do you think that in the future more funds will start investing into cryptocurrencies? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nImages courtesy of Pixabay, Bloomberg/Simon Dawson', 'The manager of Old Mutual Gold & Silver Fund, a precious metals fund with over $220 mln under control has said Bitcoin is “paving the way” for a global gold comeback.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg in an interview published today, Ned Naylor-Leyland said that the marriage of Bitcoin and gold was essentially a logical one given the characteristics and remit of both.\n\n“Bitcoin was explicitly designed to be digital gold,” he said.\n\n“So if you’re going to have a small proportion of a fund in Bitcoin, it should be in a gold fund because that’s exactly the point.”\n\nThe fund, which began in April this year, is aiming to allocate up to five percent to cryptocurrency, creaming off profits from price upticks to reinvest back into gold and silver.\n\nNaylor-Leyland is highly bullish on the concept going forward, echoing CME Group’s Chairman Emeritus Leo Melamed in his desire to bring discipline to the scene for investors.\n\n“It’s about bringing the ownership of disciplined money into the modern world,” he continued. “Bitcoin is paving the way for the reintroduction of gold as global money.”\n\nNot everyone in the wider gold industry is as happy with the status quo, however. Discussing a drop in profits, BullionVault Research Director Adrian Ash said earlier this month that Bitcoin “noise” was “distracting” some investors and leading to gold being sidelined.', 'Cryptocurrency mining has always been an intriguing and a peculiar business model. For most at-home users, it is simply not profitable or useful to do so. Chinese internet giant Baidu claims that will soon change, though. Their new service allows users to rent out spare computing power. In exchange, users will be paid for doing so. This applies to both spare hard drive space and excess bandwidth. It does require a massive computer to even join this offer, though.\n\nTo put this offer into perspective, Baidu has launched a new service. Most people refer to it as the Baidu Gold Mine, although that is not the actual name. This new offer allows people all over the world to share their hard drive space and bandwidth with the company. In exchange for providing these resources, users will be paid real money. It is evident this can be sued for Bitcoin mining purposes as well. How this will play out for the Chinese company, remains to be seen. It is evident there may be some genuine interest in this project.\n\nBaidu and Bitcoin Mining\n\nAccording to the company, their focus is on peer-to-peer content delivery. Gathering extra computing resources can be of great help to users all over the world. It allows users to share unused bandwidth, of which there is plenty all over the world. One of the options worth exploring is Bitcoin mining, but it will not be a priority for now. First and foremost, the focus is on live streaming and e-sport platforms. Bitcoin will be getting some attention at some point, though.\n\nAs far as payments go, the goal is to pay in cash. That is a remarkable choice by Baidu, to say the very least. One would expect them to pay with gift cards or even digital payments, but that is not the case. For now, it remains unclear what type of returns users can expect. It can be quite the lucrative business model, assuming your PC meets the requirements. That will not be the case for most people, though.\n\nShould this service be used for Bitcoin mining, things will get pretty interesting. it is unclear how Baidu would go about something like that, but the option is still on the table as we speak. Mining cryptocurrencies is still legal in China, for the time being. There is seemingly a growing demand for cloud computing services in China as we speak. Especially when it comes to content delivery networks, good money can be made in quick succession. Baidu is embarking on an interesting mission.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', ""As Bitcoin continues its stride towards mainstream adoption, it turns out that its surging price rates are not the only thing experiencing a sudden increase. New research indicates that the popular cryptocurrency now consumes more electricity than more than 20 countries in Europe.\n\nResearchers from British energy price comparison platform Power Compare have discovered that the total volume of electricity required for mining Bitcoin – the computational process that keeps transactions on the blockchain moving – now amounts to more consumption than 159 individual countries.\n\nAmong others, the list includes Ireland, Croatia, Serbia, Slovakia and Iceland.\n\nInterestingly, only three countries out of the entire continent of Africa currently consume more electricity than Bitcoin: South Africa, Egypt and Algeria.\n\nAs far as the rest of the world goes, Power Compare mentions Ecuador, Puerto Rico, North Korea and many more.\n\nCheck out this graphic for a more detailed breakdown:\n\nPower Compare further notes that Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption stands at 29.05 TWh – the equivalent of 0.13 percent of the world’s overall electricity needs.\n\nThis means that, if Bitcoin miners were to found their own autonomous state, it would rank 61st globally in terms of total electricity consumption. That ought to give you a better idea why Bitcoin’s mining community played such a crucial part in the dreadful Segwit2X discussions.\n\nAccording to Power Compare, Bitcoin mining has seen a nearly 30 percent increase in consumption over the last 30 days alone.\n\nCuriously, the research points out that, assuming Bitcoin’s electricity needs continue growing at this rate, the global mining consumption could be greater than the UK’s entire electricity supply by October next year.\n\nIn case you were wondering what all this electricity bills round up to, the researchers estimate the annual Bitcoin mining electricity costs currently stand at $1.5 billion. One thing to keep in mind is that the estimation assumes mining occurs in places with low electricity rates. So the number could be even higher in reality.\n\nRead next: Everything from VPNs to stunt drones, here's TNW Deals Black Friday preview sale"", 'The governor of a South Korean financial regulator has said it has ""no plans"" to supervise bitcoin trading, according to a report.\n\nIn remarks made to reporters today, Choe Heung-sik, chief of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), said that, since his agency does not view cryptocurrencies as ""legitimate currency,"" the FSS does not intend to supervise trading of the digital assets.\n\nAccording to a Korea Times report, Choe added the South Korean government believes that cryptocurrencies are used in speculation, not as payment tools.

After nine years of rapid development and various issues that the miners faced with Bitcoin, such as lack of privacy protection, high transaction fees and slow transaction speed, the teams finally collaborated and rolled out Bitcoin Diamond.\n\nBitcoin Diamond or BCD will solve the known downsides of Bitcoin, according to Bitcoin Diamond Foundation, the collaborative venture.\n\n“Bitcoin Diamond is a fork of Bitcoin that occurs at the predetermined height of block 495866”, said an EVEY team member while also launching the official website http://www.btcd.io/index.html.\n\n“Bitcoin Diamond miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and will consecutively develop and enhance the protection for account transfer and privacy based on original features of BTC. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, and a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. It shares the same transaction history with Bitcoin until it starts branching and coming into a unique block from which it diverges. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency was created which we call “Bitcoin Diamond””, he commented.\n\nAccording to the team member, Bitcoin Diamond has various benefits, such as better privacy protection, encryption of the amount and balance which protects customers’ privacy and faster transaction confirmations.\n\n“Bitcoin Diamond has raised the block size as part of a massive on-chain scaling approach. There is ample capacity for everyone’s transactions. The speed of generating blocks will be increased five times and the ultimate goal is to improve transaction confirmation speed for the entire BTC blockchain”, said another team member.\n\nHe also added that Bitcoin Diamond will lower the cost of participation thresholds. According to him, it will reduce the transaction fees and the cost of participation. “The total amount of Bitcoin Diamond is ten times as much of Bitcoin which will reduce the cost of the new participation and lower the thresholds”, he told the press.\n\nIt is reported that Bitcoin Diamond has been supported by a number of exchanges, and after EXX.COM issued an announcement of on-line BCD spot goods and futures trading in recent days yesterday, huobi.pro, okex.com, coinnest.com, gate.io, bitsun, bibox, btctrade, Aex.com, Cex.com, Coinbene.com, Rightbtc.com, and other exchanges also announced the on-line transactions in recent days today. It will fork in Nov.24th when the block hit the height of 495866.\n\nBecause Bitcoin Diamond has been highly concerned by many people in the block chain industry, the new forking coins will have a wave of hot pursuit.\n\nComparison chart & Support Exchanges :\n\nAbout the Company\n\nBitcoin Diamond (BCD) is a fork of Bitcoin based on Bitcoin protocol and a new cryptocurrency.\n\nTo know more, visit http://www.btcd.io/index.html\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of NewsBTC or any of its team members.

We may ban them; we may welcome them. It is trendy to urge people not to play with them. But they are a fact of our life.”\n\nWhile the man on the street openly buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins, most financial institutions and governments remain wary of virtual currencies.\n\nHowever, Gref believes that apathy is slowly changing.\n\n“Protectionism is just the first reaction of the state. However, both the institution of private money and the states, which will dare to change the way currency is issued, will eventually find a place for cryptocurrencies in the economy.”\n\nCryptoruble proves a point\n\nThe fact that the Russian government intends to issue its very own virtual currency proves that global institutions are more than aware of the applications of Blockchain technology.\n\nThe Russian government will also tax profits made on the sale of Cryptorubles. Herein lies the rub.\n\nCryptocurrencies cut out governments and banks and that is one of the biggest reasons why authorities are so opposed to virtual currencies.\n\nIt’s incredibly difficult to tax and make profit off cryptocurrencies, and that is the biggest hurdle standing in the way of legalizing virtual currencies in various countries.\n\nSecret symbol ? 3: L What is this?', 'Drama in the Bitcoin world is anything but hard to come by these days.That is rather unfortunate, but it is how things have evolved over time. Suprnova has finally started mining Bitcoin Cash, which is rather surprising. Their coinbase data, however, is less professional. They certainly make their statement on BCH very clear with this message, although a lot of people won’t appreciate it whatsoever.\n\nIt is evident there is still a schism between BTC and BCH supporters. Unlike what people would like to see, the communities remain at odds with one another. It is doubtful this situation will ever be resolved in a peaceful manner. That shouldn’t surprise anyone, as egos are not difficult to come by in the cryptocurrency world. The coinbase data for Suprnova’s Bitcoin Cash mining pool confirms as much. It is a sign of unprofessional behavior, to say the very least.\n\nSuprnova Lacks Professionalism at Times\n\nAdding the message of “Fuck Bitcoin Cash” to ever block mined by the pool is quite the statement. If the company had no intention to support BCH, they shouldn’t open their pool either. Surprisingly, the pool labels Bitcoin Cash as BCC instead of BCC. We all know BCC stands for BitConnect, which is a rather shady cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash is a very different creature in this regard. While not everyone may like it or its price action, the altcoin won’t go away either.\n\nSo far, the community isn’t too bothered by this statement. They are glad Suprnova listen to miners and allows them to mine Bitcoin Cash. There is a lot animosity toward this currency, yet it’s time to leave the childish comments behind us. Instead, we should focus on uniting both communities to create a better and stronger Bitcoin. Whether or not that is still possible at this point, remains to be seen, though. A lot of damage has been done, that much is certain. This coinbase text only adds more fuel to the fire as well.\n\nHaving more mining pools on board is good news for BCH users. More pools means the mining aspect of this altcoin becomes more decentralized as well. Even pools that hate this altcoin are still getting in on the action. It is a profitable coin to mine and the pool owners will get some decent fees from this new server as well. There is no reason not to support BCH mining right now, regardless of personal preferences. An interesting development, though, that much is certain.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
11/24/2017,"['Coins that are known for their privacy like Dash and Monero are on their best moments right now, as the price rally that is paired with their tokens is exciting new and older users about their very special functionalities – what Bitcoin is lacking – for now at least.\n\nOn Nov 23, DASH flew past and over Litecoin and took the fifth place easily with a strong $4.3 billion market cap [as per time of the writing]. Currently it is settling just below its new all time-high around $564.98. The same very welcoming luck struck Monero – the seventh virtual currency ranked by market capitalization, tearing down its previous all time record price of $152 as right now it is paired with USD at around $162.\n\nSource: coinmarketcap\n\nThese prices don’t surprise long-time proponents of these privacy coins, but they do bode well for continued adoption of the cryptocoins in question.\n\nSurely, in Monero and Dash, many users are attracted their cash-like fungibility, which is — as Litecoin creator Charlie Lee recently noted — the “only feature of good money that Bitcoin/Litecoin is missing.”\n\nThis level of privacy is attractive for many reasons, obviously.\n\nBut it’s also unquestionably become a rallying cause for some of the more anarchic elements of the crypto space who have been getting antsy about the public nature of the Bitcoin ledger.\n\nTo explain it, lets take for example with the United States’ IRS [Internal Revenue Service] just now taking in the services of blockchain detective firm Chainanalysis, it is obviously indicating that – they want their due and it is willing to go very far to get it.\n\nThat kind of dynamic is why a just released Europol report is pointing out that cybercriminals have started to move from the #1 of the crypto-pack [BTC] to Monero in a great flux.\n\nNot that these coins are designed to be criminal. Rather, they’re designed to be cash-like, and thus they provide benefits that more accountable cryptocurrencies can’t provide.\n\nAnd not that these privacy coins are only surging because of crime. Quite the opposite — they’re extremely attractive payment currencies. Consider Dash’s new 2MB block size upgrade and its instant transactions, for example.\n\nKeeping in mind that Bitcoin does have privacy solutions – on the horizon to be seen – [for example, Confidential Transactions], Dash and Monero are clearing out private transaction as per the moment and doing it quite well.\n\nOn the other hand, the second following Bitcoin – Ethereum, is on a surge rocketing its price upwards with a strong 9.63 percent gain in the last 24-hours reaching to $461.45. With all the news and long-term plans that are put on table by V. Buterin and the team developers, it is not surprising to see such an increase in a short period of time for ETH/USD. [Weekly chart below]', 'Bitcoin has been luring some investors with potentially huge rewards—and scaring others away with equally big risks. Should it be on your investment shopping list on Black Friday?\n\nThe cryptocurrency can certainly be volatile. Earlier this month, for example, it plummeted 25% over five days after concerns grew that a new currency called Bitcoin Cash, which promises to speed up transactions, would make Bitcoin itself a less attractive payment option.\n\nThat fear didn’t last long. Over a subsequent two-day span, investor sentiment reversed and the price jumped up 18% from its lows; by Thanksgiving, Bitcoin had soared to new highs.\n\nNot many investments engender the differences in opinion that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies create. It’s that volatility, and uncertainty about the technology’s long-term viability, that breeds whirlwind days. The currency has turned evangelists and hackers into paper millionaires overnight, while others see it as a fad, doomed to fade as countries add regulations onto what’s currently a stateless, bankless Wild West of payment tools.\n\nStill, it’s hard to argue with the short-term results. On New Year’s Day, a single Bitcoin was worth $964; by Black Friday morning its value had passed $8,200, a gain of nearly 800%. Taken together, the market capitalizations of all the world’s cryptocurrencies, including other prominent players like Ethereum and Ripple, have risen even faster this year.\n\nThis growth has pushed mainstream institutions to take notice and capitalize. CME Group, the world’s largest options and futures exchange owner, announced it would offer Bitcoin futures by the end of the year. That move would give Bitcoin a level of credibility that established currencies have, and also provide an infrastructure for developing exchange-traded funds (ETF). Money manager VanEck recently developed indices to track a group of cryptocurrencies’ movements, which could be used to develop index funds. And Mike Novogratz—a former manager at the hedge fund Fortress Investment Group who says he has 10% of his net worth in cryptocoins—recently estmiated it would be six to eight months before investment firms start to offer cryptocurrency products, like ETFs, to their clients. When they do, he added, it will make the buying process easier, allowing for the price “to go much higher.”\n\nAn employee at La Maison du Bitcoin bank in Paris. Bloomberg Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIt’s too early to say whether Novogratz is right. But the currencies’ popularity is generating more interest in the high net worth space. John Maher, an advisor and CIO at CCR Wealth Management, says that he now has numerous clients coming to him, asking about how to invest in the currency. Meanwhile, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti recently told Bloomberg that the wealthy have shown an increase in curiosity, even if they haven’t bitten on the investment.\n\nIt’s easy to understand the intrigue and hesitancy. Here are three important things to know about investing in the space.\n\nCryptocurrencies trade like volatile commodities\n\nTraditional currencies aren’t a vehicle that most mainstream “retail” investors own. You don’t take a large stake in Euros, for example. State-sponsored currencies tend to move with inflation while the primary goal of long-term investing is to beat inflation. Some mutual funds own positions in currencies as a way to hedge against the impact of exchange rates on their returns, but the currencies are seldom used to actually generate returns.\n\nBut cryptocurrencies don’t really trade like currencies at all. One of the primary reasons for that is that there’s a cap on the number of coins that any given currency will ever have in circulation. Central banks like the Federal Reserve can and do print more money to manage inflation and support their countries’ economic policies. Bitcoin, on the other hand, will eventually have a maximum of 21 million coins in circulation, based on the algorithm that controls distribution.\n\nThis makes many cryptocurrencies much more like commodities, since there’s a finite supply, like with gold or oil. “It’s difficult to look at Bitcoin as a currency,” because of this supply issue, says Maher. And the limited supply is one reason for Bitcoin’s volatility. (That could change some day if more institutions embrace the asset.)\n\nVolatility is also increased by the fact that the overall cyrptocurrency market is still tiny. All this trading and speculation is happening in a field where the total market cap is currently only about $260 billion. (Apple alone has a market cap of about $900 billion.)\n\nIs it winner-take-all?\n\nThe technology behind Bitcoin—the blockchain—has people convinced it will last long-term. But nobody is sure how many of the currencies that rely on blockchains will survive and thrive.\n\nBitcoin’s current value and price is partly based on the belief that it will continue to grow as the predominant cryptocurrency in the world. Yet it only accounts for just over half of the crypto market capitalization, as new currencies are developed, launched and spent. The competitor coin Ethereum, for example, launched in September 2015 and is now worth $440 per coin.\n\n“We simply don’t know the winners,” says Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategy at VanEck.\n\nThe Bitcoin cash scare only highlighted Bitcoin’s loose hold on the space. There’s many ways another player could up-end it (think of the way that Facebook’s rise led to MySpace’s demise). Some commentators believe traditional currencies could someday adopt blockchain-like characteristics, which would cut into cryptocurrencies’ mainstream acceptance—potentially crushing their value.\n\nCryptofunds will cost you\n\nInstitutional investors, and some of the wealthiest individual investors, already have some options for playing the cryptocurrency market. Through mid-October, 84 new crypto hedge funds that invest in the currencies have emerged, up from 11 in 2016, according to cryptocurrency research firm Autonomous Next. As the numbers suggest, however, these funds don’t have much of a track record. And many of these hedge funds charge hefty management and performance fees (often 2% of assets annually, plus 20% of any profits), eating into returns.\n\nMaher considers any of his clients investing in Bitcoin or the funds “the risk takers,” among his client portfolio, even though he owns Bitcoin and Ethereum himself. Maher often responds to those who want to take a stake by offering the thoughts of Mark Cuban. If you want to invest in cryptocurrency, Cuban said, then “pretend you’ve already lost your money.”\n\nIf you can stomach that kind of risk, you can handle trading in this market.', 'Die Kryptowährung Ethereum gewinnt an Wert und verzeichnet zeitgleich mehr Transaktionen als alle anderen Kryptowährungen zusammen.

Is the cryptocurrency the modern take on the commodity that has stood against financial storms for hundreds of years? There is considerable equivalency being drawn between the two - both directly and indirectly - but we should think critical about this connection if we intend to trade either.\n\nTalking Points:\n\nBitcoin has charged to a record high with a variety of explanations used to justify the move - and sustainability of its high\n\nA comparison is increasingly being drawn between cryptocurrencies and gold through their appeal as alternatives to financial markets\n\nWe examine the similarities and differences between gold and digital currencies to set expectations of trend and correlation\n\nRetail traders are more focused on short-term opportunities rather than long-term trends. See how retail traders are positioned in Gold on the DailyFX Sentiment Page (Bitcoin positioning will soon be recorded here as well).\n\nIs Bitcoin the new gold? The epic rise of cryptocurrencies and the massive rally that they have charged over the past few years necessitates explanation. Investors require justification - whether virtuous or not, convincing or not - to jump in and hold on through a rally of the magnitude registered by this benchmark cryptocurrency. There are many explanations being applied to this incredible outperformance, but some of this stretch the bounds of reason. And, while Bitcoin, Ethereum and the other liquid digital currencies can rise regardless of whether there is an agreement on its motivation; it is important to establish reasonable explanations so that we can better analyze market activity levels, participation and simply direction. One of the labels assigned to Bitcoin and its cadre that I feel is more misleading than most is its role as an alternative to traditional markets and all that entails.\n\nHistorically, there is a well-established alternative asset used to 'hedge' traditional markets and financial systems: gold. Through many eras and evolutions in civilization, this precious metal has shown its staying power through its stability. We only have to look back to the last Great Financial Crisis in 2008 to appreciate its representation of the role. While it did provide some degree of safe haven appeal, the far more remarkable reflection was found in its surge between 2008 and 2011 when it climbed 180 percent. The motivation for that incredible appreciation was the wide infusion of massive stimulus into the financial markets. The Fed, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and Bank of England cut rates massively and went on to introduce enormous quantitative easing measures. This resulted in a flood of Dollars, Euros, Yen and Pound in the system that uniformly devalued the world's most liquid reserve currencies. While some funds would seek out secondary fiat that would perhaps avoid some of the intense value loss, gold was once again quick to seize upon its historic role as an alternative. This commodity does deserve this title, but it doesn't always utilize it. With no yield and many currencies for which capital can circulate in a global market, there are more scenarios where the precious metal remains depressed than when it rises with that degree of enthusiasm.\n\nNow consider these same conditions for Bitcoin. If there were to be a universal slump in fiat currencies again, would there by a rush to cryptocurrency to safe guard funds? The market certainly lacks the scale to convince its utility for that. Further, its volatility is nothing short of dangerous for those looking for stability and eventually expecting a stable withdrawal of funds. What's more, the regulation of the cryptocurrency market leaves a very clear risk of hacking and even sudden change in official acceptance in countries that could suddenly create financial problems. Bitcoin is also heavily populated - I would argue dominated for volume - by speculative interests. That is more likely the source of its remarkable strength but is also a key risk for stability for periods that would require absolute trust. In the event of full scale risk aversion, these two assets would likely diverge wildly. Should there be a need for an alternative to traditional assets or fiat, the same. That doesn't mean either is due for a massive change in activity level or direction; but we should consider these assumptions as it can play an important role in our analysis and trading of each.

This is a complete about-face by the investment bank, which has previously criticized the digital currency.\n\nThe high demand for Bitcoin futures and derivatives products is resulting in very tough competitions among industry players. With the entry of CBOE, competition is expected to intensify further because the exchange is the biggest of its kind in the US. It remains to be seen, however, if the exchange can outperform its competitors in this area.\n\nTo effectively compete, there are issues that should be resolved by the exchange. Among these issues is how to relate its contracts to spot Bitcoin pricing. The exchange previously announced that it will extend its trading hours and all its Bitcoin-related transactions will be settled in cash. Whether these strategies are effective, however, remain to be seen.', 'The global average bitcoin price has surpassed $8,300 earlier today, on November 24, as the South Korean market demonstrated trades with a premium rate of around 5 percent.\n\nSince then, the price of bitcoin has fallen to $8,150, experiencing a slight correction. However, in the South Korean bitcoin market, the third largest market in the world behind Japan and the US, bitcoin is still being traded at a price of $8,450, with a $300 premium.\n\nPremium Emerges in South Korea When Bitcoin Price Rises\n\nHistorically, the South Korean bitcoin exchange market has demonstrated high premiums amidst strong bitcoin rallies. A surge in the price of bitcoin usually triggers general consumers and investors on major exchanges like Bithumb to invest in bitcoin, even with a substantial premium.\n\nLast week, when the price of bitcoin plummeted from $7,200 to $5,600 and the price of Bitcoin Cash surged from $1,200 to $2,900, Bithumb processed twice as much as daily trades as the South Korean stock market KOSDAQ.\n\nAlthough South Korea remains as a leading bitcoin market with high liquidity provided by Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit, a sudden surge in demand for bitcoin initiated by an increase in the price of bitcoin triggers investors to buy bitcoin in a short period of time, causing premiums to appear.\n\nEarlier today, when the bitcoin price reached $8,300, bitcoin was being traded at around $8,500 in South Korea. When the price of bitcoin recorded a slight correction and fell to $8,150, the $8,500 price remained in South Korea, as more traders rushed into invest in bitcoin.\n\nJPMorgan and South Korea\n\nThe South Korean finance industry tends to follow the trend established by other leading regions like the US and Japan. For instance, the Wall Street Journal’s report in regards to JPMorgan’s plan to trade bitcoin futures upon the launch of CME’s bitcoin futures exchange on December 11, was relayed by nearly every mainstream news publication within South Korea, further increasing the demand for bitcoin from the public.\n\nJPMorgan is the largest investment bank in the world, with a $341 billion market cap. Previously, when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon falsely claimed that bitcoin is a fraud and that any trader within the firm who initiates in bitcoin trading will be fired, the South Korean finance industry reacted negatively and the demand for bitcoin decreased, until enthusiastic announcements from CME, Man Group, and other major financial institutions were released.\n\nHence, when the WSJ report was released, the South Korean finance sector along with its cryptocurrency community demonstrated optimism towards the mid-term growth trend of bitcoin.\n\nMore to that, the report of Choe Heung-sik, chief of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), revealed that the South Korean government will not impose strict regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges in the foreseeable future.\n\n“Though we are monitoring the practice of cryptocurrency trading, we don’t have plans right now to directly supervise exchanges. Supervision will come only after the legal recognition of digital tokens as a legitimate currency,” said Choe.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'New research by British energy price comparison platform Power Compare shows that Bitcoin’s growth in usage is not just leading to a surge in price.\n\nThe energy-intensive process of mining the cryptocurrency requires a lot of energy. And, according to Power Compare, it really does require a lot of energy. Citing the latest Digiconomist Bitcoin energy Consumption Index, the company notes that, as of 20 November 2017, the digital currencies estimated annual electricity consumption is 29.05 terawatts per hour (TWh).\n\nIf that number doesn’t mean much to you, let us put it another way for you: that is around 0.13% of total global electricity consumption. Or, if bitcoin miners were classed as their own country, they would currently be ranked 61st in terms of energy consumption.\n\nThat places them above 159 other individual countries in terms of the amount of electricity they are using, including most of Africa and Ireland.\n\nEnergy intensive\n\nPower Compare decided to delve deeper into the power usage of bitcoin mining. The practice is growing in line with the popularity of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, and the company estimates that mining energy consumption has increased by 29.9% in the last month alone.\n\nAll of this activity has lead to an estimated global annual mining revenue of $7.2 billion, against a cost of $1.5 billion.\n\nThe energy use put in to bitcoin mining is more than the amount used by 20 individual European countries.\n\nIf the current growth trend of energy usage continues at the current rate, mining will use more electricity than the UK in a given year by October 2018, and the US by July 2019.\n\nThe reason why Bitcoin mining uses such an extraordinary amount of power comes down mainly to the way that the addition of new blocks is regulated and the requirements this places on computer hardware. In order to keep one new block being added every 10 minutes, and theoretically compensate for mining hardware becoming more powerful, the bitcoin algorithm adds more zeros to the required number at the beginning of a hash. This is effect makes the task of mining more difficult – and requires more energy.\n\nWhen the hashing is more difficult, it means more computations are needed to create a block and earn new bitcoins.\n\nIt should be noted that the electricity consumption data used by Power Compare comes from the CIA and Wikipedia and is mostly based on 2014 figures.', 'An unidentified 36-year-old man who owns a Bitcoin account has lost more than 100,000 euros ($117,000) worth of Bitcoins while he was logged in on a public wireless network in a restaurant in Vienna, Austria.\n\nThe Austrian police, however, claimed that they are still investigating whether the victim’s account was already hacked before he opened his account on the unsecured network, CBS reports.\n\nThis latest case reflects the growing concern over the security of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum amidst their growing popularity as a mode of payment.\n\nPerhaps the most infamous loss of Bitcoins due to security issues took place in 2014 when the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has collapsed following a breach on its platform and a significant amount of cryptocurrency was stolen. The exchange’s former CEO, Mark Karpelès, is currently being tried in Japan on charges of data manipulation and embezzlement.\n\nOther cases of security breaches\n\nIn mid-2017, the biggest Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange in South Korea, Bithumb, was also assaulted by hackers and stole cryptocurrencies worth an estimated 1.2 bln won or more than $1 mln. A man from Pennsylvania has also admitted that he stole $40 mln worth of Bitcoins just recently.\n\nCryptocrimes\n\nDespite these incidents, the digital currencies continue to increase in popularity among investors. Because of this, Ethereum price, for example, has already surged by 2,600 percent in just a matter of months from just $8.17 in early 2017. The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin, meanwhile, has increased to over $8,000 so far from $1,027 early in the year.\n\nDuring trading in New York on Nov. 21, 2017, Bitcoin price has reached a new record high of $8,339 despite earlier losses in the day due to the reported $31 mln theft of Tether.']"
11/25/2017,"['Zimbabwe’s central bank, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, has announced that the use of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is not allowed in the country. The bank has already issued a warning in the past stating that investors in the digital currencies could lose their money without recourse.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s Director and Registrar, Norman Mataruka, the use of “Bitcoin … is not actually legal” within the country’s jurisdiction. It is not clear, however, if Bitcoin is just not officially recognized as an authorized currency or it is totally prohibited as a legal tender within the country.\n\n""In Southern Africa, what we have done as regulators, we have said that we will not allow [Bitcoin] in our markets.""\n\nCentral bank assessing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ risks and potentials\n\nDespite his negative comment on Bitcoin, Mataruka, however, said that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has launched a research and development (R&D) initiative in order to determine the risks associated to the use of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that the use of Bitcoin in the country will not be authorized until the central bank has already created and implemented a regulatory framework covering the digital currencies.\n\nThis comment shows that the central bank is keeping an open mind on the possible legalization of cryptocurrencies in the country.\n\nOther South African countries’ positions on cryptocurrencies\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is not the only regulator opposing the mainstream adoption of digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nIn October 2017, the central bank of Namibia has announced that it will prohibit the use of Bitcoin as a payment option for goods and services. The central bank added that it will also disallow the establishment of virtual currency exchanges within its jurisdiction.\n\nIn their statement, Namibian central bank officials claimed that cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender and as foreign currency.\n\n""In addition to the bank not recognizing virtual currencies as legal tender in Namibia, it also does not recognize it to be a foreign currency that can be exchanged for local currency.”\n\nThe recent political unrest in the country sent Bitcoin price to shoot up to 12,500 in the country as it struggles with 95 percent unemployment rate.', 'After holding steady for the last two days, bitcoin’s price finally broke free and set a fresh all-time high this morning. At 13:46 UTC, the cryptocurrency’s price was trading at $8,469.20. At 15:05 UTC, the cryptocurrency was trading at $8,573.20, up by 4.53% in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum, which has been on an upswing in the last couple of days, continued its record-setting spree and climbed to a high of $485.19 at 01:30 UTC. As of this writing, the cryptocurrency was trading at $474.11, relatively unchanged in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum was created after a DAO hack last year. (See also: Ethereum Reaches Consensus To Hard Fork, Fixing DAO Hack.) The cryptocurrency’s original blockchain, which survived as Ethereum Classic, registered big gains yesterday, rising by 21.36% to $22.54. (See also: Bitcoin Holds Steady As Ethereum Registers Gains.)\n\nWith the exception of Bitcoin Cash, which declined by 3.74% to $1,604, the remaining top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies trended upward. The overall market capitalization for the cryptocurrency market rose to $273 billion from $260.2 billion 24 hours ago.\n\nWill Ethereum Reach $500?\n\nSeveral factors affect cryptocurrency prices, from media mentions to trading volume. While bitcoin has been the focus of attention for media and traders, the surge in ethereum’s price is not completely unexpected.\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, billionaire Michael Novogratz, who holds roughly 10% of his net worth in digital currencies, said that ether was “going to put a new high soon.” Back in June, he had made the opposite prediction after selling part of his stash of digital coins. He claimed then that cryptocurrencies had had a “spectacular run” but “trees don’t grow in the sky.”\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum crashed by as much as 25% in the 24 hours following his announcement. This time around, Novogratz has predicted a price target of $500 for ethereum and $10,000 for bitcoin by the end of 2017. (See also: New $500 Million Hedge Fund Will Focus On Cryptocurrencies.)\n\nBut that estimate seems conservative compared to the forecast of $14,000 by Standpoint Research\'s Ronnie Moas. In a note to clients last week, Moas wrote that there had been “positive developments” within the bitcoin ecosystem in the last 5 months and that “a few of the obstacles that were in bitcoin’s way have been knocked down.”\n\nIn the meanwhile, Nikolay Storonsky, CEO of U.K.-based bank alternative Revolut, told CNBC that bitcoin was not a fraud and compared it to gold in that both entities were ""less likely"" to be used in daily transactions. According to Storonsky, 99 percent of bitcoin transactions are ""speculation-driven.""', 'Bitcoin’s surge in popularity has sent the network’s electricity consumption soaring. And while using the electricity is not necessarily a problem when building the largest immutable ledger that has ever existed, it is important to know where that power comes from and how we can make it more sustainable.\n\nIt is estimated that bitcoin mining uses up to 22.5 TWh of energy annually, or 13,239,916 barrels of oil equivalent every year. Like other forms of mining, however profitable it may be, it has severe implications for the environment, and as the bitcoin boom continues, the burden on miners to embrace other sources of power will only increase.\n\nChina\n\nChina is the largest bitcoin mining nation by far, accounting for about 70 percent of the world’s bitcoin processing power. And in recent years, the country has begun to embrace the renewable revolution perhaps more than any other country, offering the cheapest mining power and possibly even some of the greenest.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the mining takes place in the sparsely populated and less developed Xinjiang province of China where much of the power in these operations is generated from coal-fired plants. Though electricity is cheap, the price on the environment is far more costly.\n\nThe vast Sichuan mountains, however, offer miners affordable electricity from cleaner hydroelectric dams. These hydro plants are presented with a separate challenge in the winter when the water begins to freeze, forcing the operations to halt or draw power from the alternative coal-powered plants. Additionally, Sichuan’s cheap power-used-for-mining has come under fire by the Chinese government.\n\nRelated: Thanksgiving Travelers Smash Records\n\nIn a report from Chinese media giant Tencent Finance, state-owned Sichuan Electric Power Company issued a statement ordering miners on grids connected to hydropower stations to halt operations. This order, however, appears to only target smaller mining operations as larger data centers have agreements with local governments. A move reminiscent of China’s independent teapot oil refineries.\n\nThough China’s bitcoin mining ambitions remain strong, others are looking to carve their own path, as well.\n\nRussia\n\nRussia offers some of the cheapest electricity in the world and focuses on less environmentally challenging power generation such as natural gas, nuclear, and hydroelectric, with coal only making up 18 percent of the country’s electricity generation.\n\nAdditionally, the Kremlin has suggested that miners are to receive subsidized -“leftover”- power.\n\nThe country’s largest energy provider, Gazprom, recently announced a partnership with EuroSibEnergo set to provide excess power to a number of miners within the Siberian, Urals, and European sections of Russia. The partnership has even created an interactive map showing the locations which could benefit from these subsidies.\n\nIceland\n\nAnother country planning to utilize cheap energy for mining is Iceland. The country is ideal for mining, as its cold climate and 100 percent renewable power generation offers a tremendous opportunity for miners looking to increase their profits and who are considerate of the environmental consequences of their power-hungry data centers.\n\nAlex Karis, CEO of DigitalBTC – the world’s first cryptocurrency company to be listed on a major stock exchange – noted: ""We can reduce our energy costs and maintain a low cost advantage as we grow our mining operations. We have just launched a new product platform and mining is an area we expect to see continued growth.""\n\nDigitalBTC has since exited the mining race, but others are quickly jumping on board the Iceland bandwagon.\n\nAnother listed company, HIVE Blockchain Technologies, backed by billionaire Frank Giustra, in a partnership with Genesis Mining, is taking advantage of the country’s cheap electricity and cold temperatures, as well. Additionally, HIVE is looking to expands its operations to Sweden, another cold country with vast renewable capacity.\n\nGreen Projects\n\nWhile certain countries offer special opportunities for ambitious crypto-mining companies, smaller scale projects seem to be popping up worldwide.\n\nRelated: Is This The Ultimate Fuel For Millennials?\n\nHydroMiner, which recently completed its ICO, is looking to harness hydroelectricity in Austria. Focusing on an environmentally sound and cost-effective means of producing electricity, HydroMiner has partnered with local small-scale hydro operations to pursue create sustainable and profitable data centers.\n\nEstablished in 2012, NastyMining, the brainchild of OgNasty, is a project based in Arizona with the goal to develop sustainable mining through solar and wind power generation. Focusing primarily on solar, OgNasty estimates that only 5 percent of the output will come from wind turbines.\n\n“A big part of that is due to our area being more advantageous for solar energy production. However, I do like the cool factor of taking advantage of multiple technologies to produce green energy in different scenarios,” OgNasty stated.\n\nAnother group, HARVEST, is taking a non-profit approach to cryptocurrency mining. With “critical engineering and computational climate” artwork, Julian Oliver is mining the cryptocurrency ZDash, with all proceeds going directly to funding climate change research.\n\nBeyond a simple piece of media-art, the idea is that these HARVEST nodes could be places all over the world to generate supplemental funding for climate research.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs cryptocurrencies accelerate, it is worth taking note of some of these endeavors. Though bitcoin mining uses less than a fraction of the energy used by the traditional banking system, going green is always going to be an important investment.\n\nBy Michael Kern via CryptoInsider\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Cowpuccinos owner Judson Rouse demonstrates how to buy some Bitcoin at the new machine in his coffee shop. (Matthew Allen / The Northern View)\n\nThe cryptocurrency craze has found its way to northern B.C.\n\nThe first Bitcoin ATM in the region was installed at Cowpuccino’s cafe in Prince Rupert this week, allowing people to purchase it and other cryptocurrencies like Lightcoin, Etherium and Bitcash as if they were depositing money into their personal bank accounts.\n\nREAD MORE: Cowpuccino’s up for two Small Business B.C. awards\n\nMike Whitford, a day trader who owns and installed the machine at the coffee shop, said he wanted to make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more accessible to average consumers in the north.\n\n“It’s pretty difficult for someone who isn’t computer or tech savvy to go online and try to find the right exchange,” Whitford said. “So with a machine, people can go to Cowpuccino’s and we can show you how to download a wallet. It’s bridging the gap so people can feel safe about using it.”\n\nA cryptocurrency is virtual money that can be used to buy and sell goods and services online over a secure network. Unlike mainstream currencies, a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is not tied to any physical resource, bank or central authority. Rather, each member of the network has access to every transaction that has ever taken place using the virtual currency, ensuring its validity and security.\n\nThe first Bitcoins were introduced in 2009, and the market for them has grown exponentially. Currently, one Bitcoin has a value of $11,099.39 CAD. There has been some skepticism in mainstream financial commentary about its security and long-term potential, but its advocates say it is here to stay.\n\n“It’s basically the US dollar to the cryptocurrency market,” Whitford said. “It’s so strong now that it would be very difficult for it to go away.”\n\nBuying virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, usually requires a relatively sophisticated understanding of the system and a digital wallet, which allows users to conduct transactions. The machine at Cowpuccino’s will function as a Bitcoin ATM.\n\nCowpuccino’s owner, Judson Rowse, said he agreed to have the machine set up because of how innovative it is.\n\nA few customers have already used the machine, he said, and he may consider accepting Bitcoin payments in the future as the transaction fees are considerably less than current credit card and debit payment options. The money he saves on those fees as a merchant could potentially be passed back to his customers.\n\n“If I were to accept Bitcoin regardless of the ATM, I think it would show people how it could work full circle,” he said. “It’s just another option.”\n\n\n\nmatthew.allen@thenorthernview.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter', 'Just as gold bars are lost at sea or $100 bills can burn, bitcoins can disappear from the Internet forever. When all 21 million bitcoins are mined by the year 2040, the actual amount available to trade or spend will be significantly lower.\n\nAccording to new research from Chainalysis, a digital forensics firm that studies the bitcoin blockchain, 3.79 million bitcoins are already gone for good based on a high estimate—and 2.78 million based on a low one. Those numbers imply 17% to 23% of existing bitcoins, which are today worth around $8,500 each, are lost.\n\nWhile others have speculated about the number of lost bitcoins, the Chainalysis findings are significant because they rely on a detailed empirical analysis of the blockchain, where all bitcoin transactions are recorded.\n\nAs the graphic above shows, Chainalysis’s conclusions rely on segmenting the existing bitcoin supply based on age and transaction activity. For some segments, the company used statistical sampling to determine the amount lost.\n\nThe segment “Mined Coins” reflects bitcoins mined in 2017 (which are presumed not to be lost), while “transactional” refers to those that have moved or spent in the last year—very few of which are lost. Likewise, the category of “Strategic Investors,” who have held their bitcoins for 1-2 years represent a very small share of the losses.\n\nHere’s the data in another format, which shows how “Out of circulation” bitcoins—those mined 2-7 years ago and belonging to long-time investors known as “hodlers”—and those from the early days of bitcoin in 2009 and 2010 account for the vast majority of the lost coins:\n\nThese figures reflect bitcoins that are truly lost, and not hacked or otherwise stolen—in these cases, of course, the bitcoin is not lost since the thief has control of them.\n\nNote the numbers above are based on the high estimate, and that the low estimate, which is based on only a 30% loss in “hodler” coins, puts the number of lost bitcoins at 2,767,468. Also, both estimates make a critical assumption that coins belonging to bitcoin’s inventor, Satoshi, are gone for good (more on that below).\n\nIn the future, more bitcoins will be lost. But the rate at which they disappear will be much lower than in the past since, now that they’re so valuable, people will be more vigilant about keeping track of them (unlike this poor fellow out who threw away a hard drive with the key to 7,500 bitcoins). Meanwhile, there is a question of whether the Chainalysis findings mean bitcoin is more scarce than people assume—or if the market has already priced the missing coins into the currency’s current value.\n\n“That is a very complex question. On the one hand, direct calculations about market cap do not take lost coins into consideration. Considering how highly speculative this field is, those market cap calculations may make it into economic models of the market that impact spending activity,” said Kim Grauer, Senior Economist at Chainalysis. “Yet the market has adapted to the actual demand and supply available – just look at exchange behavior. Furthermore, it is well known monetary policy procedure to lower or increase fiat reserves to impact exchange rates. So the answer is yes and no.”\n\nLost Bitcoins and the Secret of Satoshi\n\nChainalysis, whose clients include the IRS and Europol, has made a name for itself in the bitcoin world because of its abundant data and sophisticated study of blockchain wallets. Law enforcement agencies rely on the company to provide detailed insights into who owns the currency and how it moves around.\n\nChainalysis’s overall methodology is confidential, but a spokesperson shared certain details about how the company assesses which bitcoins are lost. An important clue comes when there is a “fork” in the blockchain, such as the one this summer which led to the creation of a bitcoin clone known as Bitcoin Cash. Such events can lead to the owners of wallets that have been inactive for years to conduct a transaction, providing an opportunity for statistical analysis.\n\nThese sort of clues help inform the Chainalysis figure for the “hodler” category—wallets belonging to people who got into bitcoin before it hit the big time, and which represent the biggest source of uncertainty as to whether bitcoins are lost or just being hoarded.\n\nAs for the 2% of “‘transactional” bitcoins that Chainalysis determined to be gone, the company says this is based on scraping the Internet for reports of lost coins. It added that the estimate of such losses, which can arise from a misdirected transaction or the loss of a private key through death or carelessness, is not based on statistical extrapolation and will be refined further in coming years.\n\nFinally, there’s the question of what became of the bitcoins belonging to Satoshi, the pseudonymous creator of the crypto-currency, who has not been not been heard from since 2011. Chainalysis says wallets associated with Satoshi represent about 1 million bitcoins (the company will provide a more specific figure later this year), and that its model assumes that those coins—which date from a time when it was easy to mine 50 bitcoin with a laptop—are gone forever. This assumption is a big one and, if it proves to be incorrect, the number of circulating bitcoins could suddenly increase significantly and deliver a shock to the market.\n\nFortune asked Chainalysis about what was most surprising about the lost bitcoin findings.\n\n“Firstly, we floated our findings to a few people and they all had different reactions about how surprising the figure was. But what I found most surprising/interesting was how when you unpack what it means to be “lost” things get even more confusing.” Grauer said.\n\nThe Ledger is Fortune’s focus on the intersection of tech and finance.

As a consequence, the bank refunded $1 million in funds and provided an extra $1 million to the 30,000 users as a compensation for the hacking attack they had experienced.\n\nIn an official statement provided to Naver, a Shinhan representative said:\n\n“Shinhan is testing a virtual bitcoin vault platform wherein the private keys of bitcoin addresses and wallets are managed and issued by the bank. The bank intends to provide the vault service for free and charge a fee for withdrawals.”\n\nGiven that Shinhan serves millions of active users and tens of thousands of corporations in South Korea, the integration of a bitcoin vault and wallet platform into the existing infrastructure of the Shinhan banking system would immediately introduce bitcoin to the general consumers within the region. Such exposure of bitcoin to the mainstream within South Korea, a leading bitcoin market, would significantly increase in the rate of adoption of bitcoin in the country.\n\nShinhan to Become First Commercial Bank to Introduce Bitcoin Vault and Wallet Service\n\nIf Shinhan launches its bitcoin vault and wallet platform by mid-2018 as planned, the company will become the first regulated and large-scale commercial bank to provide bitcoin vault and wallet service.\n\nAt this stage, whether Shinhan will offer bitcoin brokerage and trading services to enable their existing clients and customers to purchase or sell bitcoin remains unclear. It is likely that Shinhan will partner with cryptocurrency exchanges within South Korea such as Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit to provide liquidity to Shinhan’s client base.\n\nEarlier this month, Choe Heung-sik, chief of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), stated that the South Korean government will not impose strict regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges in the foreseeable future.\n\n“Though we are monitoring the practice of cryptocurrency trading, we don’t have plans right now to directly supervise exchanges. Supervision will come only after the legal recognition of digital tokens as a legitimate currency,” said Choe.\n\nThe integration and adoption of bitcoin by the country’s second largest bank would mean that bitcoin has already become a legitimate currency. As such, upon the integration of bitcoin by Shinhan, it is also likely that the South Korean government will regulate bitcoin, like Japan has done in March.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price is gaining momentum above $8400 against the US Dollar.

Let’s analyze further.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price is positioned well in the bullish zone above $8,200 against the US Dollar.\n\nThere is a rising channel forming with support at $7,200 on the daily chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nAs long as the pair is above the channel support and $7,200, it might test the $10K level.\n\nBitcoin Price Rally is here to Stay\n\nThere were further gains in bitcoin price as it was able to move above the $8,000 level against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair formed a new all-time high at $8,488 (data feed via Kraken) and is currently placed well for more gains.\n\nLooking at the daily chart of BTC/USD, there is a rising channel forming with support at $7,200. The channel recently acted as a major support above $7,000 and sparked a new rally.\n\nThe current upside move was solid as there was a break above the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the last decline from the $7,921 high to $5,398 low. It opened the doors for a test of the last swing high at $7,921.\n\nThe upside move was such that the price succeeded in breaking $7,921 and traded to a new all-time high at $8,488. At the moment, the price is trading near the channel resistance at $8,500.\n\nThe mentioned resistance is also near the 1.236 extension of the last decline from the $7,921 high to $5,398 low. Therefore, there is a chance of a minor dip in the short term before the price attempts a break above $8,600.\n\nOnce there is a close above the channel resistance or $8,600, the price could test the 1.618 extension of the last decline from the $7,921 high to $5,398 low, which is at $9468.\n\nCan BTC/USD Test $10,000?\n\nShould there be a test of the mentioned $9,468 level, there are high chances of a spike towards the $10K level.\n\nTherefore, keep a close eye on bitcoin price, the support levels at $8,100 and $7,200 in the medium term. And, finally look for a break above $8,600 for further gains.\n\nThere were major gains in Ethereum price as well this week. It moved above $450 level and eyes a test of the $500 level.

It’s about bringing the ownership of disciplined money into the modern world. Bitcoin is paving the way for the reintroduction of gold as global money.”\n\nThe fund started investing in Bitcoin in April this year, with the goal to dedicate 5% to cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, the aim is to obtain profits from Bitcoin, and then reinvest these in gold and silver assets.\n\nCompared to gold, Bitcoin is prone to volatility and its sudden and drastic price fluctuations have put many an investor on the backfoot. Currently trading at above $8,000, Bitcoin has risen almost eightfold in price since the start of 2017.\n\nGold, by comparison, is steadier in its price movements, and has remained in more or less the same range throughout the year, except for a brief upward spike in September when uncertainties caused by tensions between the United States and North Korea led to increased investment.\n\nEarlier this year, a report by Goldman Sachs concluded that gold was far superior to Bitcoin as it was more durable, had greater intrinsic value, and was a better store of value than Bitcoin, with a less volatile market. The only factor in which Bitcoin was deemed better than gold was its portability as compared to bullion.\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency may have its detractors, Bitcoin’s steadily increasing price suggests investor confidence remains high. Earlier this week, billionaire Mike Novogratz gave the digital currency his vote of confidence, predicting that Bitcoin would reach $10,000 before the end of 2017.\n\nHighlighting the positive aspects of Bitcoin and blockchain tech, Naylor-Leyland observed that Bitcoin is the answer to the problems of divisibility, ownership, and transmission speed which are associated with gold.\n\n“We’re going to revert to sound money,” Naylor-Leyland said. “If you imagine sound money and blockchain together, there’s quite an exciting potential outcome.”', '', 'Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n189 SHARES Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Linkedin Google Pinterest Reddit Pocket Hackernews\n\nAmid rising investments and Bitcoin futures products, the cryptocurrency market cap has crossed $250 Bn. Besides Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum are two other cryptocurrencies that have shown remarkable growth this week. And, with every gain in Bitcoin Cash, the bloodbath between Bitcoin enthusiasts and Bitcoin Cash supporters gets real. Trading at $400, Bitcoin Gold is also set to jump into the ongoing war. Meanwhile, encashing the Bitcoin popularity and increasing price, one of the leading Indian payment gateway platforms Billdesk has launched cryptocurrency exchange Coinome.\n\nInspired by the latest success as Bitcoin soars at $8,200, the US-based online retailer Overstock’s CEO Patrick Byrne argues that Bitcoin is more powerful than physical, old-fashioned money. Patrick opines, “It’s about time the world switches to real money; either gold or bitcoin.” While Patrick may have a point there as Bitcoin is traded in almost over 60 countries legally, it is important to note that cybercrimes surrounding cryptocurrency have grown exponentially too. From the Mt. Gox fiasco to Tether, this week, the list is quite long.\n\nLet’s take a look at the recent developments from the world of Cryptocurrency!\n\nBilldesk Launches Coinome, A Cryptocurrency Exchange In India\n\nOne of the leading Indian payment gateways Billdesk has recently launched a cryptocurrency exchange Coinome in India. The exchange currently offers the trading of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash and aims to add 20 cryptocurrencies by the end of 2018.\n\nMumbai-based Coinome allows users to be onboarded via an instant e-KYC process. Under the process, a user needs to register his/her Aadhaar number, post which an OTP is sent for the verification and activation of the account. With Billdesk being the promoter of the exchange, Coinome will have an easy window to build trust and deal with cybersecurity threats, which are currently the key concerns of cryptocurrency exchanges across the world.\n\nSpeaking to Inc42, Vivek Steve Francis, CEO of Coinome averred, “Coinome is the first Cryptocurrency exchange to introduce e-KYC process using Aadhaar numbers. Unlike other major cryptocurrency exchanges, we have planned to introduce the trading of leading 20 cryptocurrencies by 2018.”\n\nMalaysia To Regulate Cryptocurrency\n\nMalaysian Central Bank will announce a cryptocurrency regulation by early 2018, said its Governor, Tan Sri Muhammad Ibrahim. According to a Malaysian web daily Malay Mail Online, the Central Bank Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) will designate persons converting cryptocurrencies into fiat money as reporting institutions under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 beginning next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking at the Third Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) Summit 2017, Tan stated, “We need to prepare ourselves, as according to many pundits, digital currencies will become the new norm. The advent of digital currencies as some have forecast, will mark the beginning of a new era in the financial sector. As authorities, we cannot be oblivious to these developments.”.\n\nMarking the fact that cryptocurrency has allegedly opened new doors for terrorists, Muhammad said that big data analytics and AI can play a big role to stop these criminal acts and the entire banking system must lead the way to minimise such risks.\n\nSouth Korea Will NOT Regulate Bitcoins\n\nSouth Korean Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) Governor Choe Heung-sik has said that FSS has no plans to supervise transactions in Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to Korea Times, the Korean government believes that digital tokens do not function as a payment tool and remain as subjects of speculation. Hence, the FSS does not recognise cryptocurrency trading as financial products or services.\n\nWhile having lunch with Korean reporters, Choe stated, “It is the same with the fact that we don’t regulate or supervise casinos. Though we are monitoring the practice of cryptocurrency trading, we don’t have plans right now to directly supervise exchanges. Supervision will come only after the legal recognition of digital tokens as a legitimate currency.”\n\nSwissquote Bank Launches Bitcoin Certificate\n\nIn its attempt to minimise the risk and volatility of Bitcoin, Switzerland’s leading online bank Swissquote Bank has launched an exchange-traded product called Bitcoin certificate. It allows mainstream investors to participate in cryptocurrency boom through a traditional financial vehicle publicly traded at six Swiss exchanges. By buying Bitcoin certificates at regulated exchanges, investors are less exposed to the risks associated with trading and holding actual Bitcoin themselves, but can still benefit from potential profits, reads the company statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPeter Rosenstreich, Head of Market Strategy at Swissquote stated, “Even though we believe that Bitcoin represents the future, the volatility can be very high and considered too much of a risk by the average investor. This is why our strategy focuses on reducing volatility by increasing the amount of cash in periods of uncertainties and downturns.”\n\n“With the certificate, the average investor gets a regulated and transparent gateway to Bitcoin, without needing a special Bitcoin wallet, managing public and private keys or having to fear theft or hacks. We expect that investors will be willing to accept slightly lower returns in exchange for better protection against downside risks,” added Peter.\n\nAggregated Cryptocurrencies: AgreCoins And UpStart1K\n\nAfter Bitcoin, hard-forked coins, Bitcoin futures and Bitcoin certificates, aggregated crypto coins are set to launch in the market. Index fund-type coins Agre and UpStart1K (UP1K) will be launched through ICOs on December 1, this year.\n\nAgreCoin compiles the top six coins and makes them into their own ‘fund’, thus minimising the risk involved in buying single coins, while also benefitting from the gains of all six coins. The second coin UP1K will be aggregated based on the bottom 1000 coins. According to their whitepaper, the AgreCoin token contract will be based on the OpenZeppelin library. OpenZeppelin is an open-source framework to build secure smart contracts. It’s meant to provide secure, tested and audited code to enable the new generation of distributed applications, protocols and organisations.\n\nBack in India, Coinome and other recent exchange launches reflect the public mood despite the RBI’s discomfort. However, the frauds and hacks surrounding Bitcoins continue worldwide. Cryptocurrency startup Tether recently reported the theft of $31 Mn worth of cryptocurrencies. The wallet theft and Ponzi schemes can be tackled easily if people trading Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies know everything about the blockchain technology and its intricacies. Aimed to educate people about crypto know-how and blockchain, author Brandon Zemp has launched his new book called The Satoshi Sequence: A Manifesto on Blockchain Technology. Besides the history and technology of Bitcoin, the book also provides tips on how to invest in cryptocurrencies.']"
11/26/2017,"['Well, it’s over $9,000.\n\nEven as you recoup from attempting to explain Bitcoin to your family over the Thanksgiving dinner table, the value of the cryptocurrency is growing at an increasingly hefty pace. As of the time of this writing, the value of a single Bitcoin was above $9,143, climbing nearly 6 points in the past 24 hours.\n\nAt a certain point, news of clearing these incremental price hurdles are going to get old, but given the increasing speed in which Bitcoin prices are knocking through these barriers and hitting all-time-highs, it seems relevant to chronicle the march towards $10,000 at least.\n\nThe cryptocurrency currently has a market cap north of $152 billion.\n\nMy colleague Fitz Tepper said the case for Bitcoin at $10k was pretty strong by year’s end when it hit $8,000 just six days ago, but at this rate perhaps its more relevant to wonder how close to $15k the cryptocurrency will get in 2017 before the rate of investment at least cools.', 'Elon Musk is many things. A billionaire, a visionary, the owner of companies such as Tesla and SpaceX and overall one of the most inspiring and intriguing figures we have in business today. With this appeal comes a never-ending supply of rumors and fake news, from quitting Tesla to join a bitcoin startup, to being called national disgrace and thief.\n\nGiven the meteoric rise of mainstream cryptocurrency popularity, it should be no surprise that the elusive hunt for Satoshi, often referred to as the father of Bitcoin, has led to the theory that Elon Musk has been hiding a big secret from all of us. Sahil Gupta, a computer science student at Yale University and former intern at SpaceX, believes just this.\n\nWhy Elon Musk Could Be Satoshi\n\nGupta, who interned at SpaceX in 2015, provided a few “oddball” ideas on why Musk is the probable founder of Bitcoin:\n\n1. Technical capabilities: Bitcoin was written by someone with mastery of C++, a language Musk has utilized heavily at SpaceX. Musk’s 2013 Hyperloop paper also provided insight into his deep understanding of cryptography and economics.\n\n2. Passion for solving global problems: Bitcoin was founded in 2008, the year of the global financial crisis and widespread distaste of banking in general. If there was a time to create a currency for the people, without bank intervention, this was it.\n\n3. Relative silence on the issue: Musk has only been quoted speaking about Bitcoin a handful of times. He has publicly stated that he does not personally own any Bitcoin and even published this sneaky tweet when asked about cryptocurrencies:\n\n4. Musk doesn’t need the money: Satoshi’s stash of unused Bitcoin was estimated at $700 million back in June 2016 when the price of one Bitcoin was $719. Going by today’s price, Satoshi’s Bitcoins are worth over $8 billion – less than half of Musk’s current estimated net worth of $19.7 billion.\n\nAdditional Supporting Arguments\n\nOne week before Gupta’s Medium post on Musk, another Medium blog was published with a theory that Musk invented Bitcoin for future use on Mars. As radical as this may sounds, the point around Paypal in this article was relevant. Musk has already revolutionized digital currency his founding role in Paypal, which he sold to eBay in 2002. The author claims Musk is under a non-compete from this deal, leaving him to secrecy about his role in Bitcoin.\n\nArguments Against This Theory\n\n2008 was Musk’s “worst year”: 2008 was a notable year for Musk, who publicly claimed it was his worst year ever due to early challenges with SpaceX and Tesla and his personal finances and relationships in jeopardy. One could argue that working on Bitcoin was probably a challenge not even Musk could handle at this point. Musk lives in the spotlight: When the subject of Musk being Satoshi was brought up on Reddit in 2016, the Reddit community had a field day. Popular opinion is that Musk could never keep a secret this large and would have stepped in already to combat bank and regulatory attempts to destroy the cryptocurrency. Musk’s public statements can be negative: When asked about Bitcoin in this interview, Musk was notably careful about how he responded. Musk called Bitcoin “probably a good thing” but referenced its main use as a facilitator to illegal transactions.\n\nArguments for and against this theory create a compelling topic nonetheless. Whether or not Musk created Bitcoin is yet to be seen, but it is technically possible. As Gupta puts it, even if Musk is not Satoshi, “thanks for the Tesla Roadster”.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Futures for the S&P 500 index edged higher Monday morning after Bitcoin soared above $9,000 for the first time and set its sights on $10,000.

The digital currency, which only rose above $8,000 about a week ago, has surged an incredible 860% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite skepticism from some top finance executives about bitcoin\'s rise, experts say the latest gains appear to have been fueled by expectations that big professional investors -- such as hedge funds and asset managers -- could soon pour money into the currency.\n\nEven a small portion of the cash managed by major funds ""would make a dramatic impact on the bitcoin market,"" said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin.\n\nRelated: What is bitcoin?\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been gaining more legitimacy in some parts of the financial industry.\n\nFrom early next month, investors should be able to trade bitcoin futures via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is likely to help bolster the currency\'s reputation among mainstream investors. Futures allow traders to bet on the future price of assets like currencies, metals and agricultural commodities.\n\nThe backing of a major exchange is encouraging institutional investors ""to dip their toes into the bitcoin market,"" Glucksmann said. He expects more professional investors to put money into it if it breaches $10,000.\n\nRelated: Can anything stop bitcoin?\n\nThe virtual currency has famously attracted the derision of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who called it a ""fraud"" that would ""eventually blow up."" But other leading figures in finance, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein have defended it.\n\nShane Chanel, an adviser at investment firm ASR Wealth Advisers, predicts bitcoin will hit $12,000 within the next six months.\n\n""Greed will continue to drive the price over the short term,"" he said. But he warned that any setbacks in the introduction of bitcoin futures over the next few weeks could prompt a ""dramatic short-term tumble.""\n\nBitcoin\'s path toward $9,500 hasn\'t been smooth. It\'s suffered periods of major volatility along the way.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin splits in two, here\'s what that means\n\nIn September, it plunged as much as 20% after the Chinese government cracked down on offerings in the digital currency, prompting bitcoin exchanges to close their doors.\n\nEarlier this month, it plummeted by up to 30% within the space of a few days, before quickly bouncing back, after it appeared traders were switching to rival cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies are virtual ""coins"" that are ""mined"" by computers completing complex algorithms. Bitcoin is the most famous and widely used one.\n\nAlertMe', 'In a sign of growing mainstream acceptance, digital currency exchange Coinbase now boasts more accounts than brokerage firm Charles Schwab. According to its website, Coinbase has 13 mln users while the number of Schwab brokerage accounts stood at 10.6 mln as of the end of 2016.\n\nThese numbers don’t paint a complete picture, since the amount of assets controlled by Schwab certainly vastly exceeds those of Coinbase users. Nevertheless, the actual number of users indicates a massive volume of adoption, as the public begins to dabble in cryptocurrencies. Coinbase user numbers have grown by 167% this year.\n\nWidespread awareness\n\nCoinbase openly publishes the number of active accounts on their site, and traders have been keeping a close eye on those numbers throughout the digital currency boom this year. Such large numbers of individuals creating accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges should put an end to the thought that Bitcoin is just a fringe economic event.\n\nRegardless of bullish or bearish expectations, the reality is that Bitcoin is gaining traction amongst members of the general public. This is further demonstrated by the offering of futures by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the proliferation of hedge funds and the embrace of Bitcoin in cash-strapped countries.', ""Several recent reports have drawn attention to the massive amounts of energy used for bitcoin mining operations. The statistics are staggering. According to the Digiconomist website, a bitcoin country would rank 64th in the world for overall energy usage.\n\nBitcoin’s annual energy consumption is estimated to be 30 TWh. (Wikipedia defines one terawatt hour as being equal to a sustained power of 114 megawatts for a period of one year). On a more granular level, approximately 10 U.S. households can be powered for a single day using electricity required for a single bitcoin transaction. (See also: Is Bitcoin Mining Still Profitable?)\n\nEnergy accounts for between 90% to 95% of bitcoin mining costs and plays an extremely critical role in determining profitability for the cryptocurrency’s miners. In turn, profitability is important to attract more miners and grow the bitcoin mining ecosystem as demand for bitcoin spirals. (See also: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?) Does the increased cost of bitcoin translate to higher future prices?\n\nThe Relationship Between Mining Energy Costs And Bitcoin Price\n\nEnergy usage for miners is contingent upon several factors, from availability of cheap and plentiful power to energy-efficient hardware to the difficulty of problems being solved by machines to earn bitcoin rewards. For example, a difficult problem is computation-intensive (versus an easy problem) and, subsequently, will need additional energy resources for solving. A Forbes post last year suggested that bitcoin’s seigniorage (or the difference in its cost of production and overall value) will become unviable, unless the mining process becomes more energy-efficient.\n\nOver the years, bitcoin miners have cut back on energy costs by moving production to China, a country which reportedly accounts for 60% of bitcoin production operations. A majority of Chinese bitcoin mines are situated in its Sichuan province, where hydropower dominates. (See more: The Importance Of Chinese Hydropower To The Bitcoin Ecosystem.)\n\nIceland, which provides naturally cooling Arctic air for overheated systems and uses geothermal energy, is also a prominent venue for bitcoin mining operations. Chinese miners have not provided estimates for bitcoin production costs. But Genesis mining, which shifted its mines from China to Iceland, estimated that it cost $60 for the company to produce a single bitcoin.\n\nIn a 2015 paper, Investopedia writer Adam Hayes estimated a cost production model for bitcoin (of which energy was the main cost) and concluded that technological progress, in the form of faster and more energy-efficient hardware, would bring down the market price of bitcoin.\n\n“As real-world mining efficiency increases, which is a likely result of competition, the break-even price for bitcoin producers will tend to decrease. Low-cost producers will compete in the marketplace by offering their product at lower and lower prices,” Hayes wrote.\n\nBut that hasn’t happened. An increase in bitcoin numbers has paralleled a jump in bitcoin’s price. Why? The answer to that question is complicated.\n\nWhy An Increase In Bitcoin Production Hasn’t Declined Its Price\n\nTo be sure, there have been significant improvements in hardware processing power and costs.\n\nEven as energy costs have declined, however, the difficulty levels for bitcoin mining have increased on an overall basis. With the exception of two instances, the difficulty levels rose consistently over the last year. This increases the cryptocurrency's hash rate and is necessary to ensure bitcoin’s security. Even though it costs more energy, a significantly difficult problem set translates to a more secure bitcoin network.\n\nHalving of rewards for bitcoin mining from 25 to 12.5 has also ensured that mines have to work harder to earn the same number of bitcoins as earlier. Then there is speculation, which has played a prominent role in driving up prices for the cryptocurrency. Recent forks within the cryptocurrency have introduced new algorithms that require less processing power. For example, the recent Bitcoin Cash fork adjusts problem difficulty depending on hash rate, thereby enabling lower power consumption.\n\nThe net effect is that energy costs still comprise the majority component of bitcoin mining costs but exert minimal influence on its price. The energy costs associated with bitcoin mining operations ensure that it remains a significant barrier to enter the industry."", 'The growing interest in bitcoin is catching mainstream attention\n\nPublished 9:45 AM, November 27, 2017\n\nPARIS, France – Bitcoin, which this week soared to a new record high of more than $8,000, is the monetary equivalent of Uber, since it bypasses central bank regulation and could be attractive for financially fragile countries, economists say.\n\nNevertheless, it is precisely the lack of oversight that opens up the users of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to risks and dangers, analysts warn.\n\n""Bitcoin? It\'s about \'Uber-ising\' currency, about not having a central bank that decides the price,"" said Ludovic Subran, chief economist at credit insurer Euler Hermes, referring to Uber, the ride-hailing app that has set the cat among the pigeons in the taxi sector in recent years.\n\n""Yes, it\'s exactly that: it bypasses a central regulatory authority. That\'s the genius of this invention,"" agreed Yves Choueifaty, founder of the Paris-based asset management firm Tobam, which this week launched the first European fund investing in bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is not regulated, but is traded on specialist platforms. It has no legal exchange rate and no central bank backing it. Launched in 2009 as a bit of encrypted software written by someone using the Japanese-sounding name Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin is controlled and regulated by its community of users.\n\nInvestors are already referring to it as ""digital gold"", as the bitcoin soared to a new record high of more than $8,000 this week, a staggering rise in value from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year.\n\n""We have no need for central banks,"" said Yves Choueifaty, suggesting that institutional investors may be behind the recent sharp gains, even if insisted that there was ""no bitcoin bubble.""\n\nThe growing interest in bitcoin is catching mainstream attention: the CME Group of Chicago, one of the world\'s biggest exchanges, has decided to launch a bitcoin futures marketplace. And prestigious US universities are offering courses in blockchain technology, on which cryptocurrencies are based.\n\n\'Dollarization 2.0\'\n\nVirtual currencies could also prove attractive to economic players in countries such as Zimbabwe or Venezuela, whose fiat currencies have been ravaged hyper-inflation. Caracas, for example, has had to issued a new 100,000-bolivar bill, when just a year ago, the biggest-denomination banknote was 100 bolivars.\n\n""Think of countries with weak institutions and unstable national currencies. Instead of adopting the currency of another country – such as the US dollar – some of these economies might see a growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0,"" said the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, recently.\n\nEconomists also suggest the bitcoin could be of interest to developing countries where individuals often find it easier to access the internet than traditional bank accounts.\n\nNevertheless, central banks and the big financial institutions are concerned that virtual currencies can be used for illicit purposes and are highly speculative by nature.\n\n""It\'s the exact definition of a bubble,"" the head of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam, warned recently in comments that immediately sparked an uproar on social media among bitcoin\'s supporters.\n\nThe head of the French central bank or Banque de France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, warned in the summer: ""People are using the bitcoin today are clearly doing it at their own risk and at their own peril.""\n\n\'No intrinsic value\'\n\nNobel laureate, Jean Tirole, also insisted that the current bitcoin boom was a ""bubble"".\n\n""It\'s something that has no intrinsic value,"" he told Agence France-Presse on the sidelines of a conference in Paris this week.\n\n""It could collapse from one day to the next. I would be completely against French banks, for example, investing in bitcoin.""\n\nEuler Hermes economist Subran called on the financial authorities to make potential investors more aware of the risks.\n\n""There\'s a lot of money to be made. And a lot of money to be lost,"" he said.\n\n""We\'re seeing more and more people wanting to venture there, but they\'re not fully aware of the risk.""\n\nBitcoin has regularly suffered abrupt falls, for example, in cases of friction between the members of the community who oversee it and the members who produce it, when the regulatory authorities issue any warnings, or if there are data hacks.\n\nBut more often than not, bitcoin quickly makes up any losses and some investors are predicting it will soon top the $10,000 level. Back in 2011, it had struggled to pass $1. – Rappler.com', ""How high can bitcoin go?\n\nSince the digital currency cleared $7,000 earlier this month, an asset known for its wild swings has gone ballistic. On Monday morning, just over a week after it smashed through the $8,000 barrier, it surged past $9,000. As this column was published, Bitcoin was only $300 short of $10,000.\n\nSuch behavior seems deeply irrational -- but those inclined to dismiss it and bet on an inevitable decline must contend with the fact that human beings are deeply irrational.\n\nTake the $450 million paid for Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi earlier this month. The best explanation for that record-busting price -- enough to buy a gallery-full of Velasquez paintings -- is to look at it as a function of scarcity value. Only two or three paintings generally accepted to be by the Italian Renaissance master are in private hands. With about $45 billion a year being spent on art worldwide in 2016, it's not inconceivable such a unique piece might swallow up one percent of the market.\n\nIn asking how high digital currencies could go, it's worth thinking about them in similar terms. Even after its extraordinary growth, the market for bitcoin and its ilk is minute. As a result, relatively small net flows of funds away from conventional investments and into cryptocurrencies can have outsized impacts on prices.\n\nAt present, the value of all digital currencies is about $300 billion, according to coinmarketcap.com. That compares with $6 trillion of global gold holdings, $55 trillion in equities, $94 trillion in securitized debt and $162 trillion in residential real estate, according to a 2016 report by real estate agency Savills Plc.\n\nGold provides an instructive lesson here. The value of all the yellow metal ever mined comes to about $7.76 trillion at current prices, and just $1.66 trillion of that is held for private investment purposes. Falling interest rates and the widening ease of investment via ETFs in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis helped drive prices up from $641 a troy ounce at the start of 2007 to a peak of $1,900 an ounce in September 2011.\n\nIn absolute price terms that sounds dramatic. But when you set the stock of available investment gold against the size of equity and debt markets, the rebalancing involved was relatively slight -- equivalent to a shift of about 1 percent in the world's stock and bond portfolios.\n\nA similar dynamic can be perceived in relation to cryptocurrencies. Until 2009 they didn't exist, and to date they've been pretty difficult to buy and hold, let alone trade. Getting that exposure will become considerably easier within weeks, as CBOE Global Markets Inc. and CME Group Inc. look to establish futures and options linked to bitcoin. Even noted skeptics like JPMorgan Chase & Co. are reported to be exploring ways to facilitate client trades in the derivatives. Once the barriers to investment start to fall and any schmo can take a punt via their Charles Schwab account, don't be surprised to see digital-currency prices go higher, at least temporarily.\n\nJust how high? Trying to guess such a thing is pointless in relation to any idea of fundamentals, but the ballpark figures you could back out from funds flows are eye-wateringly large. If the current vogue for bitcoin is just a quarter as powerful as the 2007-2011 run-up in gold, you could easily add another $400 billion to the current $300 billion crypto market cap.\n\nAlternatively, you could place the $300 billion in digital currencies next to the $1.66 trillion of investment gold holdings to produce a portfolio of purportedly negative-beta assets. At present, crypto has about 15 percent of that notional global portfolio. Should it rise to 20 percent of the total, the value would climb almost a third, to $392 billion; at 25 percent, you reach $490 billion. Shifts between bitcoin and its rivals in the digital-currency space could further accentuate those movements.\n\nIt's equally possible that the crypto market cap falls to $200 billion, or $100 billion, or less -- but while individual digital currencies may well go to zero just as individual stocks do, at this point it's becoming hard to argue the asset class as a whole will go permanently out of fashion (barring extraordinarily coordinated global government action to prohibit it).\n\nThat's because people bid up the price of bitcoin for the same reason they flock to the best-performing mutual funds -- they make the rookie error of assuming past performance is a guarantee of future returns. That motivation may be irrational, but it's as old as investing. Trying to reason with it is as fruitless as asking the wind not to blow.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners."", 'What is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that does not exist in physical form and is created and held electronically.

It records each and every transaction in the order that transactions occur.\n\nThanks to Satoshi, there are now a plethora of cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin continues to be considered the master, despite the recent offshoots that have created Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin in 3 Steps\n\nThere are two main ways of buying Bitcoin, the first would be via Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies exchanges such as CEX.IO while the other method is much simpler and faster being via cryptocurrencies brokers such as Plus500, AVA Trade, and eToro.\n\nAs part of our cryptocurrencies brokers research, we have concluded Plus500 as an innovative and user-friendly broker which provides the opportunity to buy and sell Bitcoin without owning the digital coin but trade Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. To open an account with Plus500 and start trading is a simple process:\n\nStep 1 – Open an Account\n\nTo open an account with Plus 500 is a simple process, click here to start the registration. The process is fast and easy. All needs to be done is to fill your email address and password.\n\n\n\nStep 2 – Verify Your Account\n\nIn order to activate your account, you must provide the required documentation. Plus500 provides a simple and fast online platform which makes it an instant process. Customers are required to verify their accounts for identification and security purposes in accordance with Plus500 due diligence process.\n\nStep 3 – Buy and Sell Bitcoin\n\nOnce Plus500 approves your account, you can start trading Bitcoin as well as the most popular cryptos. Bear in mind that Plus500 provides a leverage position and the opportunity to short Bitcoin when Bitcoin prices decline. Currently, you cannot short Bitcoin in any exchange which leaves you with brokers such as Plus500 to make a profit should Bitcoin prices fall.\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin via an Exchange?\n\nThe second and the most common method to buy Bitcoin being via a Bitcoin exchange. Most exchanges have developed mobile phone apps to make it easier for those looking to buy and sell Bitcoin. The Exchanges will request credit/debit card or bank account details to cover the purchase price and bank details for the transfer of proceeds from the sale.\n\nNormally, for higher limits on Bitcoin exchanges, the buyer is required to provide bank account details, while debit cards can be used for lower limits on transactions.\n\nRecommended Bitcoin providers include CEX.IO – This exchange provides buying and selling of Bitcoins as well as other cryptocurrencies. In order to buy Bitcoin via CEX.IO:\n\nStep 1 – Open a Digital Wallet\n\nA digital wallet is where you hold your cryptocurrencies and interacts others via the blockchain technology. There are many providers of digital wallets, however, it is important to make a deep research before you decide which one is the best for you. Currently, the most popular digital wallets provider is Blockchain.info.\n\nStep 2 – Register & Open an Account\n\nOnce you enter CEX.IO website, register and open an account that can provide you with their service.\n\nStep 3 – Receive the 2FA Code\n\nThis is the authentication code as well as your password when you access CEX.IO. The code will be generated by an application and will be delivered to you by SMS.\n\nStep 4 – Purchase Bitcoin\n\nNow you can easily purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Note that you can always buy fractions of Bitcoin and CEX.IO allows you to choose fixed amounts with your own currency.\n\nChoose the payment option that is most convenient for you.\n\nIn order to complete the purchase, the broker will ask you to verify your identity with documents and various details.\n\nCan I Use Regular Money to Buy Bitcoin?\n\nCash can be used to buy Bitcoin and there are a number of ways to do this. LocalBitcoins is the most popular exchange that allows Bitcoin to be purchased by cash. The Bitcoin trade can be carried out in person or by way of a cash deposit.\n\nLocalBitcoin locates a Bitcoin seller willing to accept cash and requests the prospective buyer to place the order for the number of Bitcoins wanted who then receives the account number of the seller for cash to be deposited. Once the buyer provides proof of the cash deposit, the Bitcoins are then sent to the buyer’s LocalBitcoin wallet.\n\nThe alternative to depositing the cash into the seller’s account would be to meet the seller face to face and give the money in person, though as always, it’s important to make sure that buyers remain vigilant. Also, it’s important to be aware of fraud.\n\nBecause LocalBitcoin and similar agents ensure privacy, the price of Bitcoin is between 5-10% higher than the price on exchanges and there is a flat 1% fee for each transaction.\n\nOther companies that look to match cash buyers with Bitcoin sellers include:\n\nBitQuick, Wall of Coins, LibertyX, Bitit and then there are Bitcoin ATMs that also allow cash purchases of Bitcoins.\n\nDo note that buying and selling Bitcoins on LocalBitcoin and the other agents listed above are for smaller transactions. Buying a large number of Bitcoins is more difficult and Bitcoin ATMs will have limits that would require additional information for larger purchases.\n\nGetting a Bitcoin Wallet\n\nWhen looking to buy Bitcoin, it is strongly recommended that the Bitcoins purchased are not stored on the exchange once purchased and that the Bitcoins are kept in a wallet created by the buyer.\n\nA wallet is essentially the same as a bank account and in very much the same way, allows the owner of the wallet to send, receive and hold Bitcoins\n\nTwo common forms of wallet used are software wallets and web / hosted wallets. Software wallets are installed on a computer or mobile, with the owner of the wallet in complete control over the security of the Bitcoins held. Hosted wallets are created on 3rd party websites and are considered much easier to create and use, the only issue is that the host would need to be trusted to ensure that adequate privacy measures are always in place.\n\nFor those looking to create a wallet, recommended sites include Coinbase and Blockchain.info.\n\nFace-to-face, or ‘over-the-counter’ (OTC) trades\n\nAs we discussed earlier, the two most common ways to buy or sell Bitcoin are either face to face with cash or on an exchange/broker.\n\nFace-to-face transactions are the small investor looking to buy and sell a small number of Bitcoins anonymously. In stark contrast is the OTC market, where particularly large amounts of Bitcoins are bought and sold, the buyers and sellers being referred to as whales within the crypto world.\n\nThe benefit of an over-the-counter trade for those looking to buy a substantial number of Bitcoins is that the entire transaction would be carried out at a negotiated price that is likely to be more favorable than an average price for Bitcoins bought through an exchange.\n\nExchanges will have significantly less liquidity and Bitcoin buyers would need to break down the total number of Bitcoins to buy through smaller lots. The issue here is that each purchase could push the price up and more so if there is a lack of liquidity, by the time the buyer purchases the final batch of Bitcoins, the price may have moved considerably. This is not only likely to be less cost-efficient, but also less time efficient.\n\nThe commonality between face to face and over-the-counter transactions is that, in both instances, a counterparty is located for the trade. The difference will be that there is unlikely to be a negotiation on price in a face to face trade, while OTC transactions will involve a negotiation on price.\n\nOTC transactions will be carried out through exchanges and broker/dealers. Dealers will generally trade using their own funds, while brokers link buyers and sellers and negotiate on price for the buyer, whilst charging a fee. Bitcoin exchange OTC trading desks are used for the more sizeable transactions that go into the millions of dollars.\n\nSuggested Articles: How to Buy Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Exchanges\n\nIt’s quite important to select the right exchange. Unlike deciding which bank account or credit card to apply for, Bitcoin and the crypto world is unregulated, making it essential to ensure that the exchange chosen is not going to put your money or your Bitcoins at risk.\n\nThe location of the exchange is the first consideration. Where the buyer lives and the laws and regulations differ by geography, so it would be recommended to buy Bitcoins on an exchange that is in the same country as the buyer.\n\nOnce the list of exchanges has been identified by geography, the next step would be to identify the most competitive and also the most widely used exchanges. Transaction fees vary across the exchanges and some may have additional fees. While looking to find an exchange with competitive fees, it is worth paying a little more to use an exchange that has a sizeable order book.\n\nExchanges that have a large number of customers will tend to make public their order book, which then shows how liquid the exchange is.\n\nOther factors to consider when deciding on the best exchange include:\n\nHow well known is the exchange? There are a number of forums on the internet where reviews are available on the exchanges and it is worth doing some due diligence.\n\nHow long it takes for Bitcoins to be received following a purchase and how quickly funds will be received in event of a sale. On this note, it would also be important to make sure that prices are locked in at the time of purchase or sale and not on the day on which the Bitcoins are received or funds are remitted.\n\nExchange security is of significant importance. For greater security, exchanges selected should be on an HTTPS site and should request secure logins to limit the possibility of being hacked.\n\nFinally, obviously knowing how you can buy and sell Bitcoins is of importance and will vary from person to person. Some exchanges will accept payments by wire transfer, credit/debit cards, PayPal and even cash.\n\nWhen considering the method of payment, exchanges may not always carry the currency of the country that the exchange is located in and it is important to gauge how competitive exchange rates and fees are across the exchanges available.\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nWhile the majority are looking to buy and sell Bitcoin to try to make a tidy return on investment, there are those that are looking to enter the world of mining. Mining for Bitcoin is perhaps the most challenging of the mining environments within the cryptoworld, with miners needing significant computer power to be able to compete with existing miners.\n\nBitcoin mining is the validation of transactions that take place on each Bitcoin block. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin means that transactions are broadcasted to a peer-to-peer network and once broadcasted, needs to be verified, confirming that the transaction is valid and then having the transaction recorded on the public transaction database, which is known as the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMiners basically are the people involved in the processing and verifying of transactions before then recording the transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMiners will then receive transaction fees in the form of newly created Bitcoins.\n\nMiners compete with everyone on the peer-to-peer network to earn Bitcoins. The faster the processing power, the more attempts are made by the hardware to attempt to complete the verification, etc., earning the miner the Bitcoins that are highly sought after along with transaction fees.\n\nThe speed of processing power in Bitcoin mining is referred to as the hashrate and the processing power is referred to as the hashpower of the hardware.\n\nIn the early days, Bitcoin was mined using CPUs, but in the race to generate more income, miners shifted to Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Then came Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) followed by Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are used today.\n\nFor miners, the key metric is hashing power and the more hashpower, the more money miners can make. Today’s miners have warehouses of mining equipment, with Bitcoin’s mining community concentrated to a small number who account for the majority of the hashpower.\n\nBecause of the concentration of hashpower, not to mention the significant cost to set up a mining network, it’s recommended to join a mining pool, where miners combine computing power or to mine via cloud mining. For those looking to mine using a CPU or laptop, entering a mining pool will be of little value, since the mining income earned is proportional to the computer power contributed. A CPU or laptop just won’t be offering much compared with GPUs and ASICs hardware.\n\nFor cloud mining, you won’t feel the mining experience, just the income, though after fees etc., it’s not going to be earth-shattering.\n\nBitcoin cloud mining does provide a medium in which to receive newly mined Bitcoins, without the need to own costly mining hardware or even have any mining know-how, allowing the mining world to not only attract the technically minded but a far wider audience, who lack the technical knowledge needed to get into Bitcoin mining.\n\nOne of the major concerns over cloud mining is fraud, however. There have been plenty of reports of fraudulent activity, not to mention lower profits and even mining companies having the ability to halt operations should Bitcoin’s price fall below certain levels, so some due diligence on a mining company is recommended, with some basic steps to reduce the risk of being defrauded including:\n\nNo mining address and/or no user selectable pool.\n\nNo ASIC vendor endorsement. If there are no advertisements from the ASIC vendor, the mining company may not even own the hardware.\n\nNo photos of the hardware or data center of the mining company.\n\nNo limit imposed on sales or does not display how much hash rate sold against used in mining.\n\nReferral programs and social networking. A mining company willing to pay high referral fees should be avoided as these may well be Ponzi schemes.\n\nAnonymous operators should certainly be avoided…\n\nNo ability to sell your position or get the money out upon sale.\n\nSuggested Article: How Blockchain will change our Life, Economy and the World\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs are not like your traditional bank ATMs that dispense with cash from your bank account. The purpose of Bitcoin ATMs is to facilitate the purchase and sale of Bitcoins on an internet connected machine.\n\nThe ATMs allow you to insert cash to purchase Bitcoins or dispense cash in the case of a sale. Unlike the traditional bank ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs are not linked in any way to banking networks and it’s also worth noting that transaction fees can be particularly high.\n\nThe world’s first Bitcoin ATM was reported to have been introduced in Vancouver, Canada back in October 2013.\n\nToday, Bitcoin ATMs are located worldwide, with a reported 30 different types of Bitcoin ATMs and as Bitcoin becomes increasingly more popular. ATM providers will likely widen the net to attract the traffic that can generate transaction fees of 7%, before even considering exchange rates that are certainly considered less competitive than high street banks.\n\nBuy Bitcoin vs. Trade Bitcoin\n\nThere’s big difference between buying and holding on to Bitcoins and trading Bitcoins. For many, it is just a case of buying and holding on to Bitcoins in the hope that values will continue to rise. Talks of $100,000 have continued to draw in buyers in the hope of making a small fortune.\n\nWhile Bitcoin buyers will hold on for dear life and possibly sell once there’s some profit in the interest of not losing money, trading Bitcoin is an altogether different thing.\n\nBitcoin traders will be looking for daily volatility to trade and book profits with a shorter term outlook on Bitcoin prices and the use of technical fundamentals for direction.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s a whole new world for many even though Bitcoin has been in existence since 2008. The continued rise in value and talks of $100,000 have brought in a new wave of investors. With the scheduled launch of Bitcoin futures in December and the likely influx of institutional money, there will be more interest and the Bitcoin net will be widening. Whether this is a Bitcoin bubble or something more sustainable remains to be seen, after all, even the dot.com saw a mix of institutional and retail investors get burned. For now, the key to Bitcoin’s growth will be dependent on the Bitcoin world’s ability to educate and facilitate the buying and selling of Bitcoin.\n\nA multitude of new companies has been established that have begun fundraising through the Initial Coin Offering market, with the cryptocurrency world in a hurry to catch up with the more mature, traditional financial markets.\n\nCertain countries have already begun accepting Bitcoin as a means to buy, Japan has been one of the first movers and this is likely to continue to evolve in time.\n\nCash may be king, but knowledge is wealth. Going into Bitcoin at such levels requires both cash and knowledge, not to mention a resilience to noise and volatility. After all, this is the only asset class that has left investors ruing an early sale when faced with adversity.']"
11/27/2017,"['Looking at the total market cap of the cryptocurrency market, which recently crossed over the $300 bln mark, it is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time. This digital currency world that came into being less than 10 years ago has grown astronomically in such a short space of time.\n\nIndeed, 2017 alone has seen just Bitcoin go from $800 to nearly $10,000, and there is still a month to go. The records have crumbled for the Big digital currencies, as well as the new ones as the boom in ICO’s have also help set unprecedented growth.\n\nThus, as the most impressive performing asset class ever seen, surely Bitcoin is on the verge of taking over the world? Even that has two ways of being viewed - in relation, or in fear - but, no, Bitcoin is a small fish.\n\nBitcoin vs Gold\n\nLooking at the actual commodity markets out there, and weighing up Bitcoin’s $300 bln, it quickly becomes apparent that the digital currency is still splashing in the shallow end.\n\nGold, which Bitcoin is supposed to be challenging, has a market cap of $6 tln. On top of that, only about a fifth of all the mined gold is held for private investment purposes, the rest is either in jewelery - the large majority - or the official sector, or still underground.\n\nThus, seeing as the value of all gold mined comes in just over $7 tln, about $1.6 tln of it is being used for private investment purposes.\n\nLook deeper at the markets. Equities, another investible asset, has a market cap of $55 tln; then there is $94 tln in securitized debt and $162 tln in residential real estate, according to a 2016 report.\n\nNot even close to being overvalued\n\nSo, what does it mean if Bitcoin is a record breaker for speed, but not for size? It breaks down a lot of the bubble talk that is floating around there. For a market that only makes up 0.3 percent, when put next to residential estate value, securitized debt, equities, commercial real estate, farmland and gold, -- it can hardly be called a massive bubble.\n\nWhen it comes to bubbles, and overvaluing, stock picker and Bitcoin Bull Ronnie Moas breaks down the numbers a little more.\n\n“We currently have $200 tln in the world tied up in cash, stocks, bonds and gold alone and all four of those, in my opinion, are overvalued. If 1/2 of one percent of that 200 tln dollars ends up in Bitcoin, you are looking at a one tln dollar valuation that would be above where Apple Computers, the most valuable company in the World, is today.”\n\nSecret symbol ? 8: 5 What is this?', ""Bitcoin is on its way to being worth $10,000 per coin. Currently, the cryptocurrency is up 800% compared to the beginning of the year, when it was priced at $968 per coin. As of this evening, the price was a few hundred dollars shy of $10,000.\n\nThis new high comes just seven days after bitcoin broke $8,000 and not even a full month since it hit the $7,000 mark.\n\nWhy is bitcoin rising?\n\nAs buzz around cryptocurrencies continues to increase, more and more companies are talking about the technology. Some organizations are even adopting it.\n\nSquare is one such case. The payments processing company now allows customers to buy and sell bitcoin through Square Cash. Even as companies start to embrace the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer still downgraded shares, calling the company’s stock rally “overdone.”\n\nBut rather than a growing use throughout the financial sector, it seems growing public awareness of bitcoin is what’s driving the price surge.\n\nBitcoin is “officially an investor mania,” according to Josh Brown from Ritholtz Wealth Management.\n\nFactors like the anticipation of the CME listing cryptocurrency futures in the second week of December and investor FOMO (fear of missing out), are driving “another frenzy of buying,” said Chris Weston, chief marketing strategist at IG Group, in a note to clients Monday.\n\nIs it too late to buy bitcoin?\n\nApparently, this is what many were asking friends and family around Thanksgiving tables over the holiday weekend. And lots of people seem to have decided that no, it’s not too late.\n\nMore than 100,000 people opened new Coinbase accounts between November 22 and November 24, which means there are now more Coinbase users than Charles Schwab accounts. The total number of accounts on the platform is now around 13.1 million. But there’s an important detail to point out in the Coinbase and Charles Schwab comparison: The cryptocurrency trading accounts are worth much less than the $3.3 trillion total client assets in the more than 10 million open Schwab accounts.\n\nCoinbase users have more than doubled from the 4.9 million accounts open last November, according to data from CNBC.\n\nIt may seem that everybody is investing in bitcoin, but there are a few things to consider before you buy: the cryptocurrency is extremely volatile, crypto hedge funds charge serious fees to invest your money, and the value of bitcoin is only based on the assumption that it will continue to grow and become the predominant cryptocurrency.\n\nHow high will bitcoin go?\n\nAll these new investors and “mad momentum” are driving prices higher, according to Weston. It’s not clear where the ceiling is or, for many analysts, what the higher prices really signal besides a me-too trend among investors.\n\nBitcoin at 10,000 is just an arbitrary number.

Parets (@allstarcharts) November 27, 2017\n\nThe price of coins is still extremely volatile. Bitcoin has crashed, losing 80% of its value, on five different occasions over the last few years. But these severe dips often generate additional public interest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nPaul Gambles, managing director of MBMG, said cryptocurrencies are essentially a pump and dump scam, adding that the prices of favorite coins like bitcoin and Ethereum are propped up by users pumping and dumping."", 'Famed hedge funder turned crypto-investor, Michael Novogratz told CNBC bitcoin could reach $40,000 by the end of 2018.\n\nA wave of money from both institutional and retail investors is sitting on the sidelines, according to Novogratz.\n\n\n\nFamed hedge funder turned crypto-investor Michael Novogratz does not think bitcoin will top out any time soon.\n\nThe former Fortress manager told CNBC Monday that bitcoin, which has been flirting with $10,000, could potentially hit $40,000 by the end of 2018.\n\nNovogratz, who is planning to launch his own cryptocurrency hedge fund, said a spike in interest from both retail and institutional investors could push bitcoin to his bullish price target.\n\n""There\'s a big wave of money coming, not just here but all around the world,"" he said.\n\nAs Business Insider has previously reported, a number of Wall Street firms have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon, including market makers, DRW and DV Trading. Exchange giants CME and Cboe are set to launch bitcoin futures, which will allow investors to bet on the future price of bitcoin, in the near-term. That could open the door to more Wall Streeters entering the fray.\n\nTo be sure, Novogratz doesn\'t think the road to $40,000 will be without twists and turns. He said 50% corrections could happen on the way.\n\nA former prediction by Novogratz could pan out. In October, he told CNBC that bitcoin could break through $10,000 as soon as March 2018.\n\nBitcoin was trading at $9,698 per coin at 6:21 p.m. ET, a bit shy of its all-time high of $9,733, according to data from Markets Insider.

At current prices, the rally has covered a huge distance in 2017. On January 1 of this year, bitcoin opened trading at $973.37. From there, to today’s intraday highs of $9749, bitcoin has returned an astounding 901.57% for its investors. While the forecasters are quoting huge numbers for the future, we believe that at the current prices, the risk to reward ratio is skewed to the downside in the short-term.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nKey observations\n\nBitcoin’s rally is gaining momentum Experts are competing against each other in putting a huge target for bitcoin We believe the current leg is led by the newcomers who are in for a quick buck Markets are overextended in the short-term and a correction is likely We expect the next fall to be about 30% from the highs\n\nBut, just because an asset class has risen quickly is no sign that it will fall. True. There are a few sentimental factors and a few technical factors that have led us to arrive at our conclusion.\n\nWe are not calling an end to the long-term rally\n\nFirst, let us make it clear that we are not calling an end to the long-term rally yet. Calling a long-term top is a futile exercise, especially for a new technology like blockchain. Many forecasters have bitten the dust in calling a top in Amazon for about two decades. So, we shall not get into that exercise.\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace. Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nHowever, we are calling a short-term top in bitcoin.\n\nSentimental factors\n\nExuberance is usually the final stage of the rally. Pick up any news on any cryptocurrency website and you will find forecasters dishing out astronomical numbers for bitcoin.\n\nAgreed, there have been many recent developments across the globe that favor the blockchain technology and the existing cryptocurrencies. However, most experts in the field only talk about huge numbers without any caution about the volatility or a possible fall. Investors are being made to believe that the only way for bitcoin is up.\n\nIn a recent survey by LendEDU, a marketplace of private loans, bitcoin investors said that they will sell their positions if bitcoin neared $200,000 levels. While anything is possible in the markets, a price point that huge is unlikely to be reached within the next few years.\n\nSuch figures and astronomical targets are attracting new investors who are entering into cryptocurrency trading to make a quick buck.\n\nBitcoin futures trading by CBOE can be both good and bad\n\nWhile most of the mainstream Wall Street has stayed away from bitcoin, it is unlikely that the introduction of bitcoin futures trading by the CBOE is going to lead to a stampede for initiating long positions.\n\nContrarily, we believe that few short sellers are likely to enter the fray and test the resolve of the bulls on the upside. At least for the first few days, after bitcoin futures trading starts, we may see an increase in volatility.\n\nIf the big players of Wall Street with deep pockets are able to overpower the bulls, then a fall is likely.\n\nThe chart structure points to at least a 30% correction\n\nThe reasons mentioned above are regarding trader psychology and they are debatable. Most of the die-hard bitcoin supporters are likely to put those to trash.\n\nHence, we put forth our finding from the charts that suggests a likelihood of a fall.\n\nWe have picked up the short-term tops in bitcoin in 2017 for our analysis. We have disregarded the dips that were arrested at the 20-day EMA and we have not considered the dips that happened without a material rally.\n\nWe have considered the intraday highs on the day bitcoin topped. For that day, we also took the value of the 50-day simple moving average.\n\nWe find that, all the short-term tops in the markets have started when the percentage difference between the price of bitcoin and the 50-day SMA was in the range of 35% to 39%.\n\nThe ensuing correction in the first three instances saw a dip of about 40%. The fourth and the most recent correction, however, was shallower at 30%.\n\nSerial Number Date Intraday high 50-day SMA Price above 50-day SMA in % Ensuing correction in % 01 January 05, 2017 1175 821.75 35.38 37.47 02 June 12, 2017 2999.99 2014.18 39.32 41.39 03 September 02, 2017 4980 3461.14 35.98 40.26 04 November 08, 2017 7898 5330.04 38.82 30.22 05 November 27, 2017 9749 6694.14 37.15 ?\n\nAs of November 27, the difference between the intraday high of $9749 and the 50-day SMA value of 6694.14 has already reached 37.15%. This difference is closing in on the higher end of the percentage value, which has led to a correction in the past.\n\nEven if we take the minimum correction following the top, we shall see a 30% correction, which will sink bitcoin to around $7000 levels.\n\nRisks to our assumption\n\nWe have assumed that the market participants are in a euphoric state, however, this is difficult to gauge. If the markets are only in the optimism stage of the bull run, it still has a long way to go.\n\nWe have taken the performance of bitcoin only in 2017. This is a small sample size. The current rally may just continue higher without giving a meaningful pullback.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the debate on the valuation is never-ending, we believe that the current pace of ascent is looking euphoric in nature. As the proponents have benefitted by holding through every dip, there is a sense of security among the buyers that no matter what, price of bitcoin can and will only go up.\n\nWe believe that even if bitcoin has to rise, it will break this notion and test the long-term investors before embarking on a long-term uptrend. We, therefore, recommend trimming long positions in bitcoin in phases, instead of selling all at once. We expect a short-term top around the $10,000 mark. We believe the investors can buy bitcoin at lower prices in the next few weeks.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of Shutterstock.', 'Could the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX have created the biggest cryptocurrency as well?\n\nOne of the key mysteries of Bitcoin -- which recently reached a jaw-dropping value of more than $9,000 -- is who exactly created the cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto is listed as the author of the original paper describing Bitcoin, but no actual person, or group, has come out to say they are Nakamoto.\n\nWell, hold onto your hats, because Sahil Gupta, who says he was a software engineering intern at SpaceX, recently wrote a Medium post making a case that Satoshi Nakamoto is none other than Elon Musk.\n\nRelated: 11 Things You Need to Know About Bitcoin\n\nWhat\'s Gupta\'s evidence for this claim? Nothing concrete, but his logic is relatively sound. The original 2008 Bitcoin paper was written by someone ""with a deep understanding of economics and cryptography,"" which Gupta says Musk possesses. Musk is also a master of coding language C++, the language Bitcoin was written in, Gupta says.\n\n""Experience aside, Elon is a self-taught polymath. He\'s repeatedly innovated across fields by reading books on a subject and applying the knowledge,"" Gupta writes. ""It\'s how he built rockets, invented the Hyperloop (which he released to the world as a paper), and could have invented Bitcoin.\n\nGupta then points to this 2014 tweet from Musk as a possible coy confession that he created Bitcoin.\n\n@X4NWO Well, now that Satoshi Nakamoto has been discovered, I guess it is case closed ... :) — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2014\n\nRelated: 23 Weird Things We\'ve Learned About Elon Musk\n\nBut, my favorite piece of Gupta\'s argument is this: ""Would Elon choose a pseudonym that\'s an anagram for \'So a man took a shit?\' Of course.""\n\nIt\'s not much to go on, but it\'s certainly an interesting hypothesis. What do you think? Did Elon Musk create Bitcoin?

The digital currency, which only rose above $8,000 about a week ago, has surged an incredible 860% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite skepticism from some top finance executives about bitcoin\'s rise, experts say the latest gains appear to have been fueled by expectations that big professional investors -- such as hedge funds and asset managers -- could soon pour money into the currency.\n\nEven a small portion of the cash managed by major funds ""would make a dramatic impact on the bitcoin market,"" said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been gaining more legitimacy in some parts of the financial industry.\n\nFrom early next month, investors should be able to trade bitcoin futures via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is likely to help bolster the currency\'s reputation among mainstream investors.

He expects more professional investors to put money into it if it breaches $10,000.\n\nThe virtual currency has famously attracted the derision of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who called it a ""fraud"" that would ""eventually blow up."" But other leading figures in finance, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein have defended it.\n\nShane Chanel, an adviser at investment firm ASR Wealth Advisers, predicts bitcoin will hit $12,000 within the next six months.\n\n""Greed will continue to drive the price over the short term,"" he said. But he warned that any setbacks in the introduction of bitcoin futures over the next few weeks could prompt a ""dramatic short-term tumble.""\n\nBitcoin\'s path toward $9,500 hasn\'t been smooth. It\'s suffered periods of major volatility along the way.\n\nIn September, it plunged as much as 20% after the Chinese government cracked down on offerings in the digital currency, prompting bitcoin exchanges to close their doors.\n\nEarlier this month, it plummeted by up to 30% within the space of a few days, before quickly bouncing back, after it appeared traders were switching to rival cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies are virtual ""coins"" that are ""mined"" by computers completing complex algorithms. Bitcoin is the most famous and widely used one.', 'Yesterday, amid a rally that pushed Bitcoin to all-time highs globally, the price of a single Bitcoin broke 1,000,000 yen. While Westerners eye the sensational $10,000 level, Japan has seen their biggest psychological price barrier shattered. This is fitting, since there’s reason to believe that Japan started the massive Bitcoin rally to begin with.\n\nGranted, Bitcoin’s price has been steadily rising since the fall of 2016, but April’s news that Japan had formally recognized Bitcoin as a legal currency certainly helped propel the currency to new heights. By exempting the currency from an 8% consumption tax, Japan further increased citizens’ desire to own Bitcoin.\n\nIncreasing adoption, growing volumes\n\nBitcoin’s rising price has been attributed to increasing adoption and continuing integration into mainstream financial markets. In Japan, good news continues to come to the fore, with major conglomerates becoming involved with Bitcoin, and trading volume from shuttered Chinese exchanges coming to Japan’s markets due to favorable regulations.\n\nIn fact, China’s ban on Bitcoin exchanges pushed Japan to the forefront of the world’s Bitcoin markets. Beginning in September, and continuing to the present time, the majority of Bitcoin trading has been denominated in Japanese yen. At press time, the yen is responsible for an impressive 59.6% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide.\n\nWhile China dominated the Bitcoin trade for years, it’s clear that the crown has passed to the island nation of Japan. What happens on Japanese markets has powerful ripple effects throughout the global Bitcoin economy. Japan’s continued bullishness, indicated by Bitcoin’s current price of 1,084,000 yen, makes an assault on the West’s $10,000 level nearly inevitable.', 'In the latest sign that bitcoin is becoming a mainstream financial asset, the iOS app for bitcoin exchange Coinbase is now the top trending search in the App Store.\n\nLast week, friends and families across the U.S. gathered together to celebrate Thanksgiving. As in previous years, the subject of bitcoin was likely broached around many tables. However, unlike in previous years, the subject was not necessarily introduced by the resident bitcoin investor, and — perhaps for the first time — the other people at the table truly listened when he or she explained what has fueled the bitcoin price’s dramatic year-to-date increase.\n\nBitcoin was trading at a record level when the holiday arrived, but it has left that mark in the dust in the intervening days. Since Thanksgiving, the bitcoin price has risen approximately $1,600, perhaps in part due to new investors entering the market following those dinner table conversations. The effect of this grassroots bitcoin evangelism is impossible to measure, but this theory is supported by the fact that Coinbase has become the top trending search in the iOS App Store.\n\nThis phenomenon was discovered by a Reddit user, who posted a screenshot on the popular social media platform. As the picture below demonstrates, searches for Coinbase outpaced those for both reading app Hooked and home automation platform Wemo. Coinbase even beat out Hallmark Movies Now, the favorite streaming app of cinephiles who prefer their that their holiday movies be seasoned with a heavy dollop of kitsch.\n\nAs CCN has reported, Coinbase has experienced incredible growth throughout the year. Widely considered to be the easiest way to onboard new users into the cryptocurrency ecosystem — at least while Square Cash’s bitcoin pilot program remains in beta — the company has been registering more than one million new users per month during the latter half of the year.\n\nThat said, the expansion has not come without growing pains. Customer complaints have surged, and the exchange website has gone offline on multiple occasions during periods of intense volatility. However, the company has made efforts to improve the customer experience, as evidenced by the addition of phone support and instant cryptocurrency purchases — features that have undoubtedly contributed to its swelling user base over the past quarter.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A few years ago I wrote a piece called “Bitcoin Is Dead” and about once a week since then I’ve gotten an email from some aggrieved techno-utopian saying, “Oh yeah? How about issuing a correction—bitcoin rocks!”\n\nThe one I got this morning referenced a Wall Street Journal piece noting that the value of bitcoins now stands at an all-time, hilarious high: A single bitcoin is now worth more than $9,000—a value increase of 900 percent in the last year. So is bitcoin really dead?\n\nYou betcha.\n\nBitcoin wasn’t the first internet currency, but it was the first internet currency to gain a measure of acceptance in the marketplace. (There are others: You can think of ethereum and monero as the indie-rock bitcoins.) What set bitcoin apart was the blockchain: A programmatic advance that provided total transparency for the currency—everyone always knows exactly how they’re minted, what the current monetary supply is, and what the total supply can be—married to total anonymity for the user base. Bitcoin is, as I noted back in 2014, a perfectly frictionless currency. And it aspired to be a true, global currency—undercutting sovereign states, rivaling the dollar and the yen.\n\nThe first problem for bitcoin stemmed from its defining feature: Who needs total anonymity when paying for things on the internet? Criminals, that’s who. Bitcoin was the common currency of Silk Road and the dark web, meaning that its user base is people buying and selling drugs, gambling, prostitution, exploiting ransomware, and money laundering. Go have a look.\n\nThe second problem came when Mt. Gox went bankrupt. Mt. Gox was the world’s largest bitcoin exchange and one day it halted trading before eventually disclosing that someone had stolen 850,000 bitcoins—at the time, roughly 7 percent of the entire monetary supply of the currency. At which point any non-criminal consumers who thought that maybe they’d try out this new bitcoin-thingy realized that if someone can steal 7 percent of a currency’s entire supply (and get away with it) then the risks of using it far outweigh the benefits. The days of people using bitcoin to order a pizza were over.\n\nSo what’s behind the sudden rise in bitcoin’s valuation? Institutional investors and hedge funds have been drawn in by speculation.\n\nNow, maybe the $9,000 bitcoin is a bubble. Maybe it isn’t. (Spoiler alert: It is.) But that’s beside the point because the spike in valuation means that bitcoin isn’t even really a currency anymore. It’s a commodity.\n\nA currency is something you use to buy and sell goods. In order for it to have value qua currency, it has to be reasonably stable. If it loses value too quickly (as in Weimar Germany) people abandon it for barter. If it gains value too quickly (as in bitcoin) people stockpile it for investment instead of using it in exchange for goods and services.\n\nBut whatever the case, bitcoin is still DOA as a generally accepted currency. The best users can hope for is that it becomes something like digital gold—a widely accepted commodity in which investors can stockpile value as a hedge. But even that seems like a long shot: The economy already has actual gold. What’s the advantage—from a large-scale investing standpoint—in “digital gold.” If there is one, it isn’t obvious.\n\nWhich means that bitcoin will probably settle on a value at some point and go back to being the go-to method of bartering for hackers, drug dealers, and prostitutes. That is, unless the dark web simply moves on to something else.', 'Network’s estimated power use also exceeds that of 19 other European countries, consuming more than five times output of continent’s largest windfarm\n\nBitcoin’s “mining” network uses more electricity in a year than the whole of Ireland, according to statistics released as the currency broke $9,000 for the first time.\n\nAccording to Digiconomist the estimated power use of the bitcoin network, which is responsible for verifying transactions made with the cryptocurrency, is 30.14TWh a year, which exceeds that of 19 other European countries. At a continual power drain of 3.4GW, it means the network consumes five times more electricity than is produced by the largest wind farm in Europe, the London Array in the outer Thames Estuary, at 630MW.\n\nAt those levels of electricity consumption, each individual bitcoin transaction uses almost 300KWh of electricity – enough to boil around 36,000 kettles full of water. Although power consumption of other payment networks is harder to isolate, one of Visa’s two US data centres reportedly runs on about 2% of the power required by bitcoin. Between them, those two data centres conduct around 200m transactions a day; the bitcoin network handles fewer than 350,000.\n\nThe astronomical power draw is a facet of how the bitcoin network protects itself against fraud. With no centralised authority confirming transactions, bitcoin is instead backed by “miners”, who put specialised computers to work churning through extremely power-intensive computing problems. Solving those problems both rewards the miner, handing them almost a quarter of a million dollars in bitcoin, and verifies all transactions made in the last 10 minutes.\n\nAs the price of bitcoin goes up, so does the value of the reward, meaning that more miners put more computers to the task of running the network. But since the price of bitcoin doesn’t necessarily rise in step with the number of transactions, that disconnect can mean the currency uses a significant amount of power per transaction in periods of high prices.\n\nThe value of one bitcoin neared $10,000 on 27 November, as the currency continued to grow in its third significant boom in its history. Previous periods of sustained growth, in 2013 and 2014, each ended with substantial busts, leading commentators to label them, in hindsight, as speculative bubbles.']"
11/28/2017,"['Chloe Cornish in San Francisco NOVEMBER 28, 2017 87 It has been branded “a fraud” by its critics, and its sharp price rise during 2017 has been likened to the 17th century tulip craze. But love it or hate it, bitcoin has defied naysayers and delighted proponents by breaking through the $10,000 price barrier — a more than 10-fold increase in value over the course of this year. The semi-anonymous cryptocurrency, which was launched in 2009 by an anonymous developer, now has a market capitalisation of $171bn. While bitcoin has in the past ridden a cycle of boom and then bust, 2017 has seen its price skyrocket. Bitcoin was worth just under $1,000 at the start of the year, but public enthusiasm and moves to bring the cryptocurrency into the mainstream financial system have driven up its price. On Wednesday morning in Asia, bitcoin rose as high as $10,379 before easing a bit to $10,240 at midday in Hong Kong. Later it powered towards $11,500. CME Group, the US exchange operator, last month announced plans to roll out bitcoin futures, subject to regulatory approval. This would allow Wall Street — much of which has been unable to dabble in bitcoin due to a lack of infrastructure and financial products — to speculate on bitcoin as on other commodities such as gold. Share this graphic Meanwhile, on the retail front, spread betters have been allowing small investors to bet on the volatile cryptocurrency. But this has led to worries that some traditional marketplaces could end up becoming overly exposed. Bitcoin is still relatively illiquid, prone to price swings and defined differently by different regulators — factors that discourage bears from buying into the nascent asset. Furthermore, the infrastructure supporting bitcoin is still prone to hacks and other issues. Buying and storing bitcoin long has been seen as technically challenging. So a move by Square, the fintech company led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, to give a test group of customers the ability to buy bitcoin through its Cash app earlier in November was greeted with enthusiasm. Recommended Lex: How to treat bitcoin-itis Drivers and risks of the cryptocurrency boom Alphaville: Bitcoin futures and a shoddy market structure While bitcoin may have emerged as the preserve of rebels, originally popular with people buying drugs on the dark web, the technology that it pioneered — known as blockchain — has been embraced by many mainstream businesses from banks to shipping companies. These companies are betting that distributed ledger systems, which allow all participants on the network to see every single transaction, will help to improve efficiency and solve difficult problems such as tracking food through a supply chain. Bitcoin cannot be used widely to buy goods and services; many say they now see it as a way to store value. But companies such as Overstock, led by long-term bitcoin enthusiast Patrick Byrne, allow customers to use the cryptocurrency to make purchases. Nevertheless, this year has not all been good for bitcoin. In September China said it would clamp down on digital currencies, sparking concern that the world’s biggest market might be off limits. And disagreements between bitcoin developers have risked a new “fork” in the cryptocurrency, creating rancour in the close-knit community. Bitcoin’s existential crisis Play video Additional reporting by Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT', ""It seems unreal, but it's true: The price of digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin has just hit $10,000.\n\nThe all-time-high milestone comes after a period of ultra-fast growth, in which the price of Bitcoin rose from about $3,000 to $10,000 in less than three months. And on Jan. 1, 2017, the price was around $1,000, according to CoinMarketCap, meaning Bitcoin is up a neat 1,000% this year.\n\nBesides being a big psychological barrier, the price of $10,000 carries no specific meaning for Bitcoin, whose recent growth doesn't appear to be spurred by any sensible metric. Instead, the cancellation of a controversial hard fork in November, increased interest from the public, and institutional investors joining the fray appear to have fueled the stellar price rise.\n\nAnd it's not only Bitcoin that's growing. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined crossed the $300 billion threshold on Monday, with all 10 largest cryptocurrencies rising in value significantly. The second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, now has a market cap larger than $45 billion while the third in line, a fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, has a market cap over $26 billion.\n\nDespite the market's exuberance, not all is well with Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency isn't keeping up with the times; the network is slow and congested, causing transaction fees to fly through the roof and making Bitcoin mostly unusable for payments, which was the original intention of its elusive creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThroughout the year, experts pointed out that squabbles between Bitcoin's core developers with a large group of businesses, exchanges, and miners on the platform are bad for the cryptocurrency. All parties agree that Bitcoin should be upgraded, but they never agreed as to how and when; the highly contested Segwit2x fork was a possible solution but due to lack of consensus it was canceled days before launch.\n\nAs is, Bitcoin is currently primarily viewed as a store of value, akin to a digital gold, and this seems to be more than enough to drive the price up."", 'Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? The true identity of bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator remains the cryptocurrency’s biggest mystery (apart from “how high will it go before the bubble bursts?”). But one thing’s for certain: bitcoin’s very own Keyser Söze is not Elon Musk.\n\nThe idea that Musk is Satoshi has been doing the rounds recently, thanks to a blog post that detailed the Tesla supremo’s suitability in terms of technical skills, understanding of economics and style of self-expression. The post was written by Sahil Gupta, a former intern at Musk’s SpaceX.\n\nGupta’s post begged Musk to help bitcoin overcome its current network-congestion problems by offering guidance as the cryptocurrency’s “founding father.”\n\nHowever, when someone on Twitter sent Musk a story covering the post, he responded that the theory was “not true.”\n\nNot true. A friend sent me part of a BTC a few years, but I don’t know where it is. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 28, 2017\n\nWhat’s more, Musk noted that someone had sent him part of a bitcoin years ago, but he had no idea where it was anymore.\n\nObviously Musk is a man with a lot on his mind, but losing bitcoin is not uncommon. As Fortune exclusively revealed a few days ago, somewhere between 2.78 million and 3.79 million bitcoins have been mislaid over the years.\n\nWith the current value of bitcoin being $9,924, that means as much as $37.6 billion worth of the cryptocurrency is in the wind.', 'CME Group Inc. ’s Tim McCourt said the exchange has put safeguards such as higher margin levels and limits on positions and prices in place to curb risks on the bitcoin futures it plans to offer.\n\nThe exchange would also be able to adjust margin and capital levels during trading sessions, McCourt, head of equity products at the CME, said at a Coindesk-sponsored conference in New York. The controls he outlined are used by the CME on other futures contracts for equities and commodities.\n\nThe world’s largest exchange owner said in October it plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the year, a move that is seen as a key step in opening the asset to institutional investors. The price of the largest cryptocurrency, which has climbed about 10-fold this year, has surged since the announcement.\n\nThe CME has said contracts will settle in cash and use a daily price from the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, which is supported by digital exchanges Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken. Cboe Global Markets Inc. said earlier this year that it was going to begin a bitcoin futures contract by year-end or early 2018, and awaits approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n“I’m skeptical they’ll launch this year,"" said Mike Belshe, co-founder and chief executive officer of cryptocurrency security firm BitGo Inc. Big businesses may not be comfortable with bitcoin futures yet, said Belshe, who played a key role in Segwit2x, the controversial bitcoin software update that was ultimately called off last month.', 'Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin’s marketing chief has stated that bitcoin price, despite these boom times, is “undervalued.”\n\nIn a televised interview with Bloomberg today, Gatecoin’s marketing chief and head of business development for Asia Pacific Thomas Glucksmann was led onto the subject of bitcoin’s “fair value”, at a time when prices are nearing $10,000 – a remarkable 10x gain since the turn of the year. The bitcoin executive professed the market remains relatively “illogical” compared to traditional financial assets where price predictions are analyzed over usual valuation metrics.\n\nAsked if it was “impossible” to determine bitcoin’s fair value, Glucksmann acknowledged and replied:\n\nI would still argue that it is highly, highly undervalued. If you look at the long-term potential of the technology in the next 10, 20, 30 years, $10,000 is cheap in my opinion.\n\nWhile bitcoin is now seen in the mainstream as a store of value among retail investors, it remains a peer-to-peer decentralized electronic cryptocurrency, a fact Glucksmann is keen to point out even if or when the cryptocurrency is valued at a million dollars. “Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places,” the Gatecoin executive told the interviewer, referring to the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin, also known as Satoshis (0.00000001 BTC – a hundredth of a millionth BTC).\n\nHe stated:\n\nEven if one bitcoin is worth a $1,000,000, you could still have $1 USD worth of bitcoin which you could still transact peer-to-peer. It’s important to look at bitcoin in that way with that longer-term view.\n\nAt press time, data from CoinmarketCap reveals bitcoin price trading at $9,927 and topping $165 billion in the total market value of all 16.7 million mined bitcoins.\n\nGatecoin, which lays claim to being the world’s first exchange to list Ethereum’s ether tokens in mid-2015, suffered major operational disruption in recent months after Hong Kong banks abruptly froze its accounts, forcing the exchange to suspend HKD and USD deposits from customers at a time when the exchange had ‘tripled’ its customer base following bitcoin’s price gains. The exchange found respite with new banking partners in Europe and is scheduled to resume bank transfers in December.\n\nThe exchange also added support for Litecoin this month, enabling users to buy and sell the alternative cryptocurrency with bitcoin, ether and the Euro. In his remarks today, Glucksmann underlined Litecoin as an “underrated cryptocurrency” that shares many similarities with bitcoin without suffering the same “scaling issues” that has often plagued its development and community.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'GETTY Bitcoin could soon hit $10,000\n\nWith the top cryptocurrency sitting at $9871.10 (£7418.27) the coin gained another fifth in value over the past three days alone and is expected to hit $10k by the day\'s end. Despite fears of a forthcoming price crash circulating, former Fortress hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz told CNBC on Monday that he expects Bitcoin to multiply more than four times in roughly the next 13 months. Mr Novogratz said: ""Bitcoin could be at $40,000 (£30,068) at the end of 2018. It easily could.” The total market capitalisation of all digital coins on CoinMarketCap hit $304 billion Monday. Novogratz said he expects that could increase by about six times to $2trillion at the end of next year.\n\nThe rise and rise of Bitcoin - which began as merely an academic paper and some accompanying source code in 2009 - makes it more valuable than an increasing number of the world\'s best-known companies. Bitcoin is now worth more (total market capitalisation) than Walt Disney, McDonald\'s, IBM and Goldman Sachs. Despite the opportunity for big profit, so far major banks and investors have largely stayed away from Bitcoin with questions still unanswered over whether it remains too volatile, unregulated, hackable and complex to invest people\'s life-savings into. But many feel change is on the horizon.\n\nGETTY The total number of Coinbase users globally now stands at 13.3 million\n\nIf it\'s a bubble, then I suspect we will know for sure before too long. Nicholas Gregory, CEO of CommerceBlock\n\nLast week, Bitcoin users were given a further boost when French asset manager Tobam became the first European fund agrees to offer the controversial cryptocurrency. And some industry insiders say the launch of the CME futures could lure more mainstream investors. The world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator CME Group has said that it would start offering Bitcoin futures by the end of the year, though no precise date had been set. CME said: “The natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities.” Charles Hayter, founder of cryptocurrency data analysis website Cryptocompare, says: “Promises of bitcoin futures opening the door to institutional money are supercharging the price.”\n\nGETTY So far banks and investors have largely stayed away from Bitcoin\n\nWhile big funds being to dip their toe in the water, an increasingly number of users are having a look at Bitcoin from their home computers. Data compiled by Alistair Milne, the Monaco-based manager of the Altana Digital Currency Fund, showed US bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase added 300,000 users between Wednesday and Sunday, during the U.S Thanksgiving holiday. The total number of Coinbase users globally now stands at 13.3 million. Mr Milne said: “The Coinbase data is evidence that adoption is not slowing down. Breaking $10,000 seems inevitable following the recent price action.”\n\nGETTY French asset manager Tobam became the first fund to offer Bitcoin', 'Japanese cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer announced today it’s expanding to the U.S., with approval to operate in 42 states starting today. This includes regulatory approval in New York via the state’s Department of Financial Services’ “BitLicense”, which only five other cryptocurrency companies currently have.\n\nFor comparison, Coinbase has approval to operate in 48 states (including Washington, D.C.) and Gemini is operating in 46 states (including Washington, D.C.).\n\nThe exchange is by far the biggest in Japan, trading about $180 million worth of bitcoin per day. In terms of traditional exchange volume this ranks as the 14th largest exchange worldwide, but when you add margin volume to the calculation the exchange is actually the largest in the world in terms of total exchange volume.\n\nFounded in 2014, bitFlyer has raised a total of $36 million in venture funding.\n\nAt launch bitFlyer’s U.S. exchange will only support bitcoin/USD pairs, but “plans to expand its cryptocurrencies to include altcoins such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash and more.”\n\nRight now the exchange only supports deposit and withdraw via bitcoin and USD wire transfer, which means early users will likely be institutional or high net worth investors. Eventually the exchange wants to add additional forms of fund inflow and outflow like ACH transfer, making it easier for the average consumer to deposit or withdraw cash.\n\nLike most exchanges bitFlyer will have tiered verification levels. The first level asks for personal information like your name and address and email and cell phone verification, and in return you can deposit and withdraw up to $2,000 in bitcoin per day and trade up to $3,000 in bitcoin per day. The second tier asks for additional information like bank account verification and proof of identity via photo ID, and allows users to deposit and withdraw up to $50,000 in bitcoin per day and trade an unlimited amount of the cryptocurrency.\n\nWith Bitcoin spiking 1,200 percent over the past year, there’s a ton of demand to trade the cryptocurrency and not a lot of places to do it. While there are dozens of established exchanges around the world only a few operate legally in the United States, with the two main ones being Gemini and Coinbase. And even these exchanges get flack for slow customer service response times, an almost unavoidable byproduct of the insane spike in customers they are seeing.\n\nIf bitFlyer can provide a solid trading and customer service experience, there’s a lot of room for them to establish themselves in the U.S. market.', 'Fintech has lots to gain\n\nFintech is only beginning to scratch the surface of possibilities. Despite significant inroads in payments, lending and investing, amounts handled remain small in comparison. A popular line of argumentation with incumbents is that fintechs can’t match customers’ trust in financial institutions, especially regarding long term financial commitments, but that’s a flawed view.\n\nMajor Asian fintech players already serve hundreds of millions of customers digitally, matching incumbents’ scale across digital channels, which are likely to matter most going forward. Purchase behavior in fintech is expected to follow the evolution of e-commerce, starting with small amounts and eventually increasing to sizeable transactions. Fintech’s share in global financial activity is poised to climb steeply.\n\nMuch trust, and perhaps too much freedom\n\nOur increasing trust in financial technology is affecting the global financial system overall. Soaring market capitalizations of major cryptocurrencies, for instance, spark ample controversy. Also debated are Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which allow individuals to pledge cryptocurrencies towards ventures of varying sincerity and credibility. ICOs and initial public offerings (IPOs) bear striking resemblance, yet the former requires none of the checks and balances predating a listing on any major stock exchange.\n\nAlso on Forbes: Three Reasons Why The ICO Market Is Cooling Down, But Crypto And Blockchain Are Here To Stay\n\nThe ability of blockchain to ascertain trust between multiple parties in the absence of a central intermediary seems to inspire the idea of a trustless future requiring no intermediation, but that’s a dangerous route. Blind faith in technology, akin to blind faith in markets, catches up with us eventually. Like a petri dish, transformational technologies and their applications create an environment in which great, benign and less desirable grow side by side. We must remain disciplined about what we place our trust it, but the benefits outweigh the downsides. Digix, Kyber, Anquan and Aditus are some of many initiatives using blockchain to build better financial infrastructure, making them engines of progress.

11/29/2017,"['Bitcoin passed $10,000 for the first time on Tuesday evening.\n\nCryptocurrency passed $11,000 per coin on Wednesday lunchtime.\n\n\n\nLONDON — The price of bitcoin is leaping after passing the symbolically significant level of $10,000 on Tuesday evening.\n\nBitcoin passed $10,000 per coin at around 6.30 p.m. GMT (1.30 p.m ET) on Tuesday after flirting with the level all day. The level was seen as symbolically significant and, now it\'s passed $10,000, the price is motoring.\n\nBitcoin hit $11,000 per coin at 1.55 p.m. GMT (8.55 a.m. ET), up over 10% on the day.\n\nCharles Hayter, the CEO of CryptoCompare, called breaching the $10,000 level a ""seminal moment"" for the cryptocurrency.\n\nHe said in an email: ""$10k represents the closing of the second cycle in Bitcoin which has drawn the interest of institutional investors who have so far been constrained from trading by their remits. This is starting to change as more sophisticated and regulated instruments are made available. This will lead to Bitcoins third cycle.""\n\nMati Greenspan, an analyst with trading platform eToro who follows the crypto space closely, said in an email: ""Wall Street\'s resident bitcoin buff Mike Novogratz has moved his target to $40,000 by the end of 2018, stating that not only is this a bubble but that the bubble is going to get a lot bigger from here due to the global nature of this unique asset.\n\n""Whether it is indeed a bubble or something else entirely remains to be seen. What I can tell you from my conversations with clients is that more and more people are starting to see bitcoin as money and the potential to replace the current fiat central banking system that has gotten out of hand.""\n\nElsewhere in the cryptocurrency space, Litecoin, the sixth largest cryptocurrency by value, has reached a new all-time high of $103.46 overnight.\n\nThe entire cryptocurrency market is now worth over $330 billion, just two days after passing $300 billion for the first time. The market has rallied hugely this year despite some people warning that the market is in a bubble.', 'Bitcoin zoomed past $11,000 to hit a record high for the sixth day in a row today, after gaining more than $1,000 in just 12 hours, stoking concerns that a rapidly swelling bubble could be set to burst in spectacular fashion.\n\nAfter soaring more than 1,000% since the start of the year, bitcoin rose as much as 15% today.\n\nIt topped $10,000 for the first time in early Asia trading, before surging above $11,000 less than 12 hours later to reach $11,395 on Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, one of the largest and most liquid crypto-currency exchanges, and then dipping back below $11,000.\n\nBitcoin\'s rapid ascent has led to countless warnings that it has reached bubble territory in recent weeks.\n\nBut the warnings have had little effect, with dozens of new crypto-hedge funds entering the market and retail investors piling in.\n\nThe world\'s largest bitcoin wallet provider, San Francisco-based Coinbase, signed up 300,000 new users between last Wednesday and Sunday, during the US Thanksgiving holiday, according to data compiled by Altana crypto-currency fund manager Alistair Milne.\n\nIt now counts more than 13 million customers.\n\nThe evidence suggests that few of the users are buying bitcoin to use it as a means of exchange, but are speculating to increase their capital.\n\n""What\'s happening right now has nothing to do with bitcoin\'s functionality as a currency – this is pure mania that’s taken hold,"" said Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge\'s Judge Business School.\n\n""This is very much a bubble that will very much correct itself at some point and people need to be very careful.""\n\nMr Hileman, who last week gave a lecture to the Bank of England on the risks of bitcoin and other crypto currencies, also flagged the risk of the whole market collapsing entirely.\n\n""There’s always the possibility that some fundamental cryptographic flaw that we can’t solve craters the whole space, or that regulators unite and decide this represents systemic risk and actually could trigger the next financial crisis,"" he said.\n\n\'Exit ramps\'\n\nCreated in 2008, bitcoin uses encryption and a blockchain database that enables the fast and anonymous transfer of funds outside of a conventional centralised payment system.\n\nIt has far outstripped gains seen in any traditional asset classes or currencies this year.\n\nIts rise accelerated in recent months as exchanges such as the CME Group and the Chicago Board Options Exchange announced plans to offer futures contracts for the crypto currency.\n\nSceptics say it a classic speculative bubble with no relation to real financial market activity or the economy - most famously JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, who labelled it a ""fraud"".\n\nBut even Mr Dimon and others who say bitcoin represents a bubble - now the consensus view among mainstream investors - do not deny its price rise could still have further to go.\n\n""It’s got all the shapings of your tulip bubble chart (but) that tells you nothing about where that price line could go depending on the number of people who wish to own it,"" Standard Life\'s head of investment strategy, Andrew Milligan, said. ""Who is to say it doesn’t reach $100,000?""\n\nIn some emerging markets, bitcoin had hit well over $10,000 previously.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, bitcoin traded at $17,875 on Monday. Tuesday\'s price in Zimbabwe was not available.\n\nIn South Korean exchanges, too, bitcoin was already close to $11,000 or higher early this week.\n\nThe fact that bitcoin now provides ""exit ramps"" from national currencies that were becoming easier to use, Mr Hileman said, could exacerbate any future financial crisis.\n\nCoordinated regulatory action might therefore be necessary in order to stave off an ""economic calamity"", he said.\n\nDespite its mushrooming value, however, Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said today bitcoin was not big enough to pose a risk to the global economy.\n\nMike Novogratz, a former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group, said in a Reuters Investment Summit earlier this month that mainstream institutional investors were about six to eight months from adopting bitcoin.', 'Forget the Dow\'s big rally or booming tech stocks, there\'s a much wilder investment story happening.\n\nBitcoin started the year worth less than $1,000. It\'s now stormed past $11,000 -- a staggering jump of over 1,000%.\n\nSo how does the virtual digital currency work -- and what\'s behind its meteoric rise?\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin (XBT) was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Many of its backers saw it as a simple global payment system for anyone to use.\n\nUnlike the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen, digital currencies such as bitcoin aren\'t issued by central banks like the Federal Reserve. Instead, they are ""mined"" by computers using complex algorithms.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin hits $11,000 and then plummets\n\nPayments in bitcoin can be made without traditional middlemen such as banks and without the need to give your name.\n\nThat made bitcoin popular with criminals and others who wanted to move money anonymously. But its price has taken off this year as mainstream investors have become interested.\n\nWhy have prices gone crazy?\n\nSome experts say the biggest force pushing bitcoin prices higher this year has been ... higher prices.\n\nInvestors have been buying as they fear ""they\'re missing the party"" or ""losing out on a quick profit,"" said Stephen Innes, head of Asia trading at online broker Oanda. ""Intense media coverage"" in recent months has also convinced more investors to pile in, he added.\n\nArthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong\'s Bitmex, an exchange for trading financial instruments based on bitcoin, said the digital currency is in a ""positive feedback loop.""\n\nRelated: Can anything stop bitcoin?\n\nIn other words, investors see the price is increasing and want a piece of the action, moving prices higher still.\n\nThe sentiment has been backed up by indications that bitcoin is getting greater mainstream acceptance. Next month, investors should be able to start trading bitcoin futures via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThat would give the virtual currency more legitimacy among professional investors.\n\nWho\'s buying it?\n\nFor much of this year, it\'s mom-and-pop investors who have been buying in.\n\nMany are in Japan and South Korea, where recent regulation changes have made it easier to trade bitcoin, according to experts.\n\nBut the biggest gains from the virtual currency\'s massive rally are likely to be concentrated among a relatively small number of investors.\n\nRelated: Russia eyes cryptocurrency dominance\n\nWhen you invest in bitcoin, you don\'t have to buy a whole unit. According to research site BitInfoCharts, the vast majority of bitcoin accounts contain just 0.1 bitcoin (about $1,000) or less. Just 3% of more than 20 million bitcoin accounts hold one bitcoin or more.\n\nBig institutional investors such as hedge funds and assets managers have largely stayed on the sidelines. But some experts predict they\'ll move into the market in the coming months, despite skepticism from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nWhat\'s next?\n\nSome industry insiders are incredibly bullish. Hayes predicts prices could hit a mind-boggling $50,000 by the end of next year, driven by the flow of money when institutional investors ""pull the trigger"" on investing in the digital currency.\n\nWith a total value of around $175 billion, the bitcoin market is small compared with more established assets.\n\n""This is a drop in the ocean compared to the trillions transacted daily"" in currency and stock markets, said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Just a small amount of mainstream investors\' money would make a big difference to bitcoin prices, he said.\n\nBut some finance industry veterans are wary.\n\nOanda\'s Innes, who has worked in currency trading for decades, referenced a famous piece of investment advice from Buffett: ""Be fearful when others are greedy.""\n\n""Following the herd rarely produces large scale gains,"" Innes said.\n\nInvestors were given a reminder of bitcoin\'s unpredictability on Wednesday. After topping $11,000, it plunged more than $2,000 before recovering some of those losses.', 'Bitcoin is back in the news as its price continues a meteoric rise, with the cost of a single coin breaking $10,000 yesterday. Today, it was reported by several major publications that NASDAQ, the second largest stock exchange in the world, plans to launch futures contracts for Bitcoin next year. That would allow investors to bet on the rise and fall of the cryptocurrency, profiting if they are correct about the direction of its future price.\n\nNASDAQ is hardly the first player from the traditional finance world to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon. At the start of this month, Chicago’s CME Group said it would begin providing futures contracts on bitcoin as well. As The Verge reported this morning, while many well-known bankers and investors continue to deride Bitcoin as a bubble or a Ponzi scheme, almost every major financial institution has been exploring how they might interact with Bitcoin and its underlying structure, the blockchain.\n\nThe introduction of various financial products around Bitcoin will amplify the amount of risk investors can take. Cantor Fitzgerald, a large broker which owns an exchange, announced today that it plans to launch Bitcoin derivatives in the first half of 2018. Futures and derivatives allow investors to place bets on bitcoin without owning any of the actual currency, amplifying the amount of financial leverage on the underlying asset. It was an explosion of derivatives pegged to real estate assets like mortgages that underpinned the financial collapse of 2008.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to mint new millionaires, real-world applications for the currency and the underlying technology have so far remained niche. There are countless startups attempting to use bitcoin, blockchains, and other cryptocurrencies. Fueling a lot of this exuberance has been initial coin offerings, where investors can buy virtual tokens in lieu of more traditional equity. This year alone, ICOs have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, passing traditional venture capital as a source of funds.\n\nAs veteran investor and financial analyst Josh Brown wrote on his, none of this is likely to change soon:\n\n“These people aren’t going anywhere. Crypto is here to stay. It doesn’t matter if most of the ICOs see their token prices crash by 90% (which is what I think will happen). Walking the halls and having people come up to me to explain their projects, I came to the realization that price crashes alone will not drive these people out. They’ve got business cards, and signs and LLCs and money raised and there will undoubtedly be projects that become real companies, even if the majority disappear. This is how all capitalism works. The crash of the internet economy at the turn of the century didn’t kill the internet itself. Google came around four years later. Three years after that, the iPhone came out. Then Facebook and Twitter. These are all post-crash. So if you’re sick of hearing about crypto, the bad news is that it’s going to be a part of the world for the foreseeable future.”\n\nPredicting exactly when the Bitcoin bubble will burst, as it has many times before, is impossible. But pretty soon, the world’s most venerable exchanges will let you start placing bets.', 'Bitcoin plunged as much as 20 percent hours after a rally past $11,000 generated a surge in traffic at online exchanges that led to intermittent outages.\n\nThe plunge capped a wild day for the largest cryptocurrency that included a breakneck advance to a high of $11,434 before the reversal took it as low as $9,009. As of 3:36 p.m. in New York, it traded at $9,911.10, virtually unchanged from where it began the session.\n\nThe heaviest selling came amid reports of service outages and delays on some of the largest online exchanges. The extent of the problems on platforms such as Coinbase and Gemini remained unclear, with several saying massive spikes in traffic had caused unspecified problems. Coinbase remained unavailable to some users.\n\nBitcoin had rallied 20 percent in just four days, topping $10,000 for the first time earlier this week in a runup that drew increased warnings it was in a bubble. The cryptocurrency ended September at $4,171.25.\n\n“After doubling in such a short period of time, people are taking profits,” said David Mondrus, chief executive of Trive, a blockchain-based research platform. “Issues in the exchanges add to it without a doubt. When you have a lack of ability to exit, then people dump in order to exit faster.”\n\nWhile not uncommon, outages at online exchanges have earlier led to selloffs in cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, one of the biggest platforms, earlier tweeted traffic was at an all-time high after bitcoin surged to a record $11,434 at 9:11 a.m. in Bloomberg composite pricing.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is extremely volatile and susceptible to major dips -- it’s fallen by at least 25 percent on three separate occasions in 2017 already.', 'Nasdaq intends to release Bitcoin futures contracts in 2018\n\nStock Exchange operator Nasdaq intends to release Bitcoin futures contracts in 2018, becoming the third US-based stockbroker to plan such contracts on the volatile digital currency.\n\nThere are four stock giants in the US. Now Nasdaq joins CME Group and Cboe Global Markets in an attempt to enter this market. This makes the owner of the New York Stock Exchange – Intercontinental Exchange, the only stock exchange without any publicly announced derivative plans.\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoins are mostly traded on virtual, unregulated markets. Nasdaq, CME and Cboe, however, are subject to serious regulation, thereby giving legitimacy that can help professional investors feel more comfortable taking part in this trade.\n\nThe world’s largest futures trader CME Group recently announced that it plans to launch futures on the Bitcoin in the fourth quarter of the year. The regulatory approval is currently awaited. The leading global exchange in options and futures trading is another new player in the derivatives business of the battlefield – a highly volatile digital currency that is not listed on the stock exchanges.\n\nThe New York-based digital forex trading platform LedgerX was cleared in July for derivative clearing and began offering its institutional customers the opportunity to trade with battlefield options two weeks ago. The Chief Executive Officer Paul Chou said in an email that the company has cleared 1 million USD of derivatives for the first week and 2 million USD in the second week.\n\nThe growth of the derivatives on the Bitcoin is a new step towards the development of the digital currency to a more established asset class.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of a Bitcoin reached 11,000 USD, just a day after the 10,000-dollar mark was over, increasing 10-fold since the beginning of the year, but also raising concern for a bubble.\n\nAnd William Dudley, chairman of the Fed for New York, also said on Wednesday that the central bank is studying the idea of \u200b\u200bits own digital currency. But whatever product is to be introduced, it would be in the distant future. William Dudley, however, pointed out that he regarded the Bitcoin as a speculative activity rather than a stable way to store value.', 'The bitcoin roller coaster is picking up speed.\n\nThe virtual currency powered past $11,000 for the first time on Wednesday, capping a jaw-dropping rally of more than 1,000% since the start of the year. But it then plunged by more than $2,000, providing a stark reminder of its extreme volatility.\n\nLong shunned by regular investors as a murky domain for cranks and criminals, bitcoin has gained growing mainstream acceptance this year, helping propel its value higher and higher.\n\nIt’s been smashing through milestones at an increasing rate: it soared above $8,000 just over two weeks ago and only passed $9,000 for the first time over the weekend.\n\nOn Wednesday, bitcoin climbed as high as $11,350. But it then nosedived more than 18% to below $9,300 as two major exchanges where it’s traded said they were struggling to deal with a huge spike in traffic. By Thursday morning in Hong Kong, it had regained some ground to trade around $10,400.\n\nWhile bitcoin’s stratospheric rise this year has prompted warnings of a bubble, experts say that the gains in recent weeks have been driven in part by the expectation that more major investors — like hedge funds and asset managers — are gearing up to start investing in the digital currency.\n\nRelated: Russia eyes cryptocurrency dominance\n\nNext month, investors should be able to start trading bitcoin futures via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is expected to give the virtual currency more legitimacy among professional investors. Futures allow traders to bet on the future price of assets like currencies, metals and agricultural commodities.\n\nBitcoin is one of many cryptocurrencies that have proliferated in recent years. Unlike the dollar or the pound, these virtual “coins” aren’t tied to a central bank. Instead, they are “mined” by computers using complex algorithms.\n\nThe decentralized nature of bitcoin is what appeals to many of its enthusiasts and unnerves a lot of its skeptics.\n\nIt also makes it harder to settle arguments about whether the currency’s huge gains this year amount to a bubble. Unlike stocks, its value isn’t based on earnings or dividend payouts, and unlike bonds it doesn’t pay investors a steady stream of income.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin costs as much as $13,000 in Zimbabwe\n\nAnd the global market for bitcoin, at nearly $190 billion, is still relatively small. The S&P 500 stock index, for example, is worth more than $20 trillion.\n\n“What is the fundamental value of bitcoin? No one knows the answer to this question,” said Arthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong’s Bitmex, a bitcoin derivatives exchange.\n\nExperts said previously that the $10,000 mark would be a key milestone for the digital currency. Hayes and other industry insiders are predicting that the publicity surrounding bitcoin will continue to lure big investors and push prices even higher.\n\n“Institutional investors … will begin to pull the trigger in 2018,” he said.\n\nRelated: Can anything stop bitcoin?\n\nThe virtual currency has famously attracted the derision of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who called it a “fraud” that would “eventually blow up.” Warren Buffett has also expressed skepticism, warning of a “real bubble.”\n\nBut other leading figures in finance have defended it. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein pointed out last month that “folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold.”\n\nBitcoin’s stunning ascent this year hasn’t been particularly smooth.\n\nWednesday’s sudden losses after it topped $11,000 was the latest in a series of jarring drops.\n\nIn September, it plunged as much as 20% after the Chinese government cracked down on offerings in the digital currency, prompting bitcoin exchanges to close their doors.\n\nEarlier this month, it plummeted by up to 30% within the space of a few days, before quickly bouncing back, after it appeared traders were switching to rival cryptocurrencies.', 'The former chief economist of the World Bank wants bitcoin banned.\n\n""Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention, lack of oversight,"" Joseph Stigliz, currently a professor at Columbia University, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today, as the cryptocurrency reached new all-time highs this week.\n\nBecause of this, he added:\n\n""So it seems to me it ought to be outlawed. It doesn’t serve any socially useful function.""\n\nHowever, Stiglitz, who also chaired the U.S. President\'s Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton Administration, said he does support technological innovation in payments, but thinks digital money should still be fiat created and controlled by the government.\n\n""Let’s move away from paper into the 21st century of a digital economy,"" he said.\n\nLike many other members of the Davoisie, Stiglitz – who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001 – called the run-up in bitcoin\'s price unjustified and unsustainable.\n\n""It’s a bubble that’s going to give a lot of people a lot of exciting times as it rides up and then goes down,"" he said. ""The value of a bitcoin today is expectations of what the bitcoin is going to be tomorrow.""\n\nAnd even though bitcoin is a decentralized network, with participants scattered around the globe, Stiglitz seemed to think Washington could easily nip it in the bud.\n\n""If the government says \'the reason bitcoin is being used is circumvention,\' they could close it down at any moment,"" he said. ""And then it collapses.""\n\nYou can watch the clip here:\n\nJoseph Stiglitz photo via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Experts worry about a market drop. Bitcoin is nearing $11,000, despite increased warnings that the currency is trapped in a bubble, Bloomberg reported.\n\n“This is going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes,” hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz said on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.\n\nNovogratz, who invested in bitcoin when it cost $90, said he has started a $500 million fund because of the currency’s ability to transform the market.\n\nExperts worry that bitcoin will soon be regulated, which could drop its value, too.\n\n“It’s extremely difficult to determine a fair value for bitcoin,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst in London at Oanda, to Bloomberg. “And there’s no news of substance on the regulatory front.”\n\nAnd bitcoin has shown “roller coaster behavior,” according to Quartz. For example, stocks during the 2008 financial crisis dropped 40 percent. Bitcoin sees double-digit drops all the time. That’s one reason Wall Street has been cautious to embrace it.\n\nHowever, some experts believe the asset will continue to grow. CNBC\'s Jim Cramer said in June digital currency could help ward off cyberattacks.\n\n""I think it could because the European banks are frantically trying to buy them so they can pay off ransomware. It\'s a short-term way to be able to deal with cybersecurity. It is the way to pay off the bad guys,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street.""\n\nThough markets are cautious to fully embrace it, Wall Street strategist Tom Lee told CNBC this week that bitcoin could be a new form of “gold” for the younger generation.\n\nIn fact, a young couple from Provo said in 2013 that they planned to document their first 90 days as a married couple living on the virtual currency. They planned to use bitcoin to purchase ""furniture, rent, groceries, travel, gas, restaurants and even medical expenses,"" according to the Deseret News.\n\nBitcoin offers digital trust, which is sitting well with those who worry about institutional banking.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was introduced on the internet in 2009. Bitcoins are kept in an online wallet. There\'s no card or cash that represents bitcoin. All exchanges are done through the internet.\n\nAs ABC News reported, bitcoin was created as an alternative to modern currency. ""Transactions allow anonymity, which has made it popular with people who want to keep their financial activity, and their identities, private.""\n\nIn a way, bitcoin has become more of a replacement for gold, Lee told CNBC.\n\n""It\'s valued as if it is a small company today,"" Lee told CNBC. ""We think over the next 10 years, this new generation of millennials are going to view trust as a replacement for gold. So, bitcoin is essentially digital gold for another generation.""\n\nLee said earlier this year he expects bitcoin to be valued at $11,500 in 2018.', 'Jean Tirole NOVEMBER 29, 2017 193 The current craze for cryptocurrencies seems boundless. The dollar value of bitcoin has been multiplied by 10 since the beginning of the year, and by 30,000 since January 1 2011. “Initial coin offerings”, through which companies finance themselves by issuing “tokens” (cryptocurrencies newly minted for the occasion), have raised $3.5bn so far this year. We should be cautious of this trend: investors must be protected and regulated banks, insurance companies and pension funds should be prevented from building exposures to these instruments. My scepticism does not concern blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin. This distributed ledger technology is a welcome innovation with useful applications, including fast, automatic execution of smart contracts. What worries me are the cryptocurrencies themselves. Bitcoin raises two distinct questions. Is it sustainable? And assuming it is, does it contribute to the common good? My answers are: probably not (the jury is still out) and definitely not. On the sustainability question, bitcoin is a pure bubble, an asset without intrinsic value — its price will fall to zero if trust vanishes. There are undeniably certain successful, long-lasting, bubbles: gold (whose value vastly exceeds the price that it would fetch if it were treated as a raw material and used for industrial or decorative purposes); or even the dollar, the pound or the euro. The history of markets, though, is littered with bubbles ending in crashes, from Dutch tulip bulbs in the 1630s and the South Sea bubble in 1720, to countless stock market and real estate bubbles. No one can say with certainty that bitcoin will crash. It could become the new gold. But I would not bet my savings on it, nor would I want regulated banks to gamble on its value. Bitcoin’s social value is rather elusive to me. Consider seigniorage: an expansion in the money supply traditionally provides the government with extra resources. As it should, the proceeds of issuance should go to the community. In the case of bitcoin, the first minted coins went into private hands. Newly minted coins create the equivalent of a wasteful arm’s race. “Mining pools” compete to obtain bitcoins by investing in computing power and spending on electricity. There goes the seigniorage. Bitcoin may be a libertarian dream, but it is a real headache for anyone who views public policy as a necessary complement to market economies. It is still too often used for tax evasion or money laundering. And how would central banks run countercyclical policies in a world of private cryptocurrencies? The ICO craze is no more reassuring. Heralded as liberation from the power of financial intermediaries, from venture capital to banks, it neglects the fundamentals of finance: the use of trusted and well-capitalised intermediaries to monitor projects. Centuries of experience have taught us the value of screening out fraudulent or low-value projects and of exercising voice in corporate governance. Screening and monitoring are “public goods” from the point of view of investors; freeriding makes their supply unlikely under most forms of ICOs. To finance ICO projects, backers issue and hand over “tokens” to investors. These are often compared to shares, but unlike stocks, they most often confer no voting rights. Furthermore, if the distribution of dividends is in tokens rather than, say, dollars, tokens are again pure bubbles, and their value can fall to zero regardless of the company’s success. Technological advances can and will improve the efficiency of financial transactions. But they should not lead us to abstract from economic fundamentals. Governments that still give sympathetic consideration to bitcoin and ICOs would be well-advised to protect their citizens and their financial institutions against risky and socially harmful developments.

11/30/2017,"['A bar of gold. A disk of iron. A chain of beads. A card of plastic. A slip of cotton-linen paper. These things are worthless. One cannot eat them, or drink them, or use them as a blanket. But they are valuable, too. Their value comes from the simplest thing. People believe they are money, and so they are. If every currency is a consensual delusion, then bitcoin, a digital cryptocurrency that changes hands over the internet, feels more like a consensual hallucination on psychedelic drugs. The concept of bitcoin was born in a detailed white paper published in late 2008 by a pseudonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto.” By 2013, one bitcoin was worth $12. As of this writing, it’s worth more than $10,000. Its value has doubled in the last two months alone. For any currency’s value to increase by 100 percent in eight weeks is, to use a technical term, bonkers. If the Japanese yen or American dollar did the same, their economies would plunge into an infernal deflationary spiral.\n\nThroughout history, currency has taken one of two forms: physical assets, like gold or beads, and fiat currency, like government-backed paper and coins. Bitcoin and its brethren introduce a third category: digital currencies that run on a combination of game theory, economics, and cryptography—thus, cryptocurrencies. If all money is the sharing of an illusion, bitcoin wants to build a better way to share it. Like many people, I’ve long regarded bitcoin’s rise with both wonder and confusion. To help me make sense of it, I started calling cryptocurrency experts and academics to ask, is bitcoin just a dumb bubble, like 17th-century tulip bulbs? An investment hedge, like gold? A currency, like dollars? The answers I got weren’t satisfyingly unanimous. I heard “all of the above” and “none of the above” and “nobody knows for sure, yet.” Toward a More Perfect Money What’s wrong with dollars, anyway? If you ask me, very little. I like my credit card. I don’t even mind cash. But to others, the dollar’s dangers are glaringly obvious: a single omnipotent entity, the federal government, strictly controlling money supply and the rules that govern it. Some worry that the creation of too many dollars will lead to out-of-control inflation. “Cypherpunks have dreamed of fully decentralized electronic payment systems for decades” that would allay these concerns, writes Timothy Lee, a senior tech-policy reporter at Ars Technica who has long been on the bitcoin beat. Most digital-currency ideas, however, had the same tragic flaw—replicability. Just about everything that exists online (think text, photos, or files) can be copied. Fear of rampant counterfeiting would spell death for a digital currency.\n\nBitcoin solved this problem with the blockchain, an online ledger that records and validates all peer-to-peer payments to eliminate double-spending. For those inclined to less-than-legal behavior, it helps that the blockchain encrypts transactions to provide anonymity. The payment network is maintained by bitcoin “miners,” a decentralized group of individuals with powerful computers that approve transactions and are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. The total possible supply of bitcoin in the world is capped. Thus, bitcoin solves both of the cryptopunk money problems—the blockchain thwarts centralization, and the planned scarcity of bitcoins checks inflation. The blockchain is an ingenious and potentially transformative technology. People like Marc Andreessen, the well-known venture capitalist, have predicted that it could become the scaffolding of the entire economy, like the internet. Here’s a taste of the transformative vision from an interview Andreessen held with The Washington Post: Digital stocks. Digital equities. Digital fundraising for companies. Digital bonds. Digital contracts, digital keys, digital title, who owns what—digital title to your house, to your car … You’ve got digital voting, digital contracts, digital signatures … And then every aspect of financial services: insurance contracts, insurance derivatives, currency exchange, remittance—on and on and on. Nobody knows for sure whether the blockchain will transform the economy of the future, as Andreessen foresees. What’s clearer, however, is that it has not transformed the economy of today. While the number of bitcoin transactions is growing every year, it’s nothing close to a mass-market consumer technology, like Google, or Netflix, or even PayPal. Bitcoin remains cumbersome to use (the typical transaction can take up to 10 minutes) and the price is extremely volatile. It is, for now, a frankly terrible currency built on top of a potential transformative technology.\n\nWhich leads to perhaps the most obvious question: If bitcoin appears to have flopped as a mass-market currency, why has it so suddenly succeeded as an investment vehicle? Up, Up, and Away There are countless theories about why bitcoin’s valuation has gone berserk. But for the purpose of time and sanity, let’s reduce them to four mega-arguments. 1. Venture capital (and a green light from the feds) got the ball rolling. For the first five years of bitcoin’s existence, venture capital’s interest in bitcoin-related products and companies was minimal. After all, the very idea of cryptocurrency was infamous for its association with online black markets like Silk Road, where criminals used digital tokens to anonymously sell drugs and other illegal stuff. (In fact, one could argue that bitcoin’s rising valuation is just a bet that its most dubious uses—say, avoiding taxes or laundering money—will keep rising.) It seemed for a while that the U.S. government might try to crush the ostensible competitor of the almighty dollar. But in November 2013, shortly after the FBI shut down Silk Road, several senators praised bitcoin and other virtual currencies at an official hearing as “legitimate financial services.” Senatorial droning on C-SPAN doesn’t always move markets. But when it does, it really does. The value of bitcoin tripled within the month to $900, and venture capital got its green light. VC investments in bitcoin rose from nearly nothing in 2012 to $400 million in 2014 and $600 million in 2016. Bitcoin didn’t yet have an obvious mainstream purpose. But it had something even more valuable: legitimacy from Washington, with curiosity and cash from Silicon Valley.\n\n2. It’s digital gold. People have long described bitcoin as digital gold. In early November, Bloomberg reported that “buy bitcoin” had overtaken “buy gold” as an online search phrase, suggesting that bitcoin’s rising valuation could be partly due to investors seeing it as the precious metal’s trendy equivalent. Like gold or silver, bitcoin is scarce (by design) and a popular hedge for inflation hawks, worrywarts, conspiracy theorists, and other antiestablishment investors who believe the global economy is always a month away from implosion or hyperinflation. There is another important way that bitcoin is like gold: Its reputation is much bigger than its market. In any given week, $34 billion in bitcoin is traded, according to The Wall Street Journal, less than 1 percent of the global foreign-exchange market. As New York University professor and so-called “dean of valuation” Aswath Damodaran quipped, bitcoin could become the world’s reserve cryptocurrency or the biggest bust of the century. “Right now it’s not a very good currency, because it’s not a good medium of exchange and it’s not a good store of value, because it’s too volatile,” he told CNBC. He offered a more probable outcome for bitcoin: “gold for Millennials.” 3. It’s the reserve currency of the ICO market. What’s an ICO? An “initial coin offering” is essentially a way for a company to crowdsource funds without selling shares. Instead of accepting public money in exchange for equity, as in an initial public offering, or IPO, an ICO offers digital tokens denominated in a new cryptocurrency.\n\nThe conventional wisdom on ICOs is somewhat split. Some see it as an ingenious way for founders to quickly raise money without relying on the gatekeepers of venture capital. Others point out that it’s easy way to con poor dolts looking to buy into the crypto frenzy. And what a frenzy it is: In 2017, the ICO market exploded, raising more than $2 billion for new companies. There are several ways that the ICO craze feeds, and is fed by, the bitcoin boom. First, some analysts believe that the most lucrative ICOs are driven, not only by gullible rubes, but also by bitcoin millionaires who want to diversify their investments without paying tax by cashing out of cryptocurrencies, which would trigger a capital-gains tax. ICOs fulfill that need. Second, many ICO investors first convert their cash into bitcoin before buying tokens in a new cryptocurrency. As Tim Lee argues, this makes bitcoin the “reserve currency” of the crypto economy. Just as the U.S. dollar benefits from its status as the world’s reserve currency, accepted worldwide in lieu of or in exchange for the local currency, the same is often true of bitcoin in cryptocurrency markets. It’s possible that these factors work together in a feedback loop, where bitcoin millionaires seeking diversification raise the profile of ICOs, which increase the value of bitcoin. This much is clear: Bitcoin’s valuation has gone nuts in tandem with the (perhaps equally nuts) boomlet in ICOs.\n\n4. Maybe it’s just this simple: Bitcoin is an unprecedentedly dumb bubble built on ludicrous speculation. It seems strange to call a currency a bubble. But lacking more specific terminology, bubble seems like the only word that would apply. Even if one buys the argument that blockchain is brilliant, cryptocurrency is the new gold, and bitcoin is the reserve currency of the ICO market, it is still beyond strange to see any product’s value double in six weeks without any material change in its underlying success or application. Instead, there has been a great and widening divergence between bitcoin’s transaction volume (which has grown 32 times since 2012) and its market price (which had grown more than 1,000 times). Surveys show that the vast majority of bitcoin owners are buying and holding bitcoin to exchange them for dollars. Let’s be clear: If the predominant use case for any asset is to buy it, wait for it to appreciate, and then to exchange it for dollars, it is a terrible currency. That is how people treat baseball cards or stamps, not money. For most of its owners, bitcoin is not a currency. It is a collectible—a digital baseball card, without the faces or stats. * * * The explosion of bitcoin’s value has been pretty silly. But great things can be born of such silliness. As Dan Gross wrote in his book Pop!, the soapsuds of burst bubbles often fertilize the next generation’s breakthrough technologies. Before the national telegraph, train system, and tech giants, there was a telegraph bubble, a train bubble, and (who could forget?) a dot-com and online-retail bubble. The blockchain, like each of those technologies, has the potential to become a critical piece of infrastructure for the digital economy, even if the price of bitcoin is crashing as you read this paragraph.', 'This week bitcoin roared to new heights, took a steep dive and then leveled off — all the while grabbing major headlines and prompting a radio gabfest coast to coast. But it’s the evolving conversation among mainstream financial institutions — which may have accelerated just a bit in recent days— that bears close watching.\n\nBitcoin got a Wall Street endorsement of sorts on Wednesday when Nasdaq said it plans to introduce bitcoin futures in the first half of 2018. Previously, Cantor Fitzgerald had announced plans to launch bitcoin derivatives, and CME Group in Chicago also said it would provide futures on bitcoin contracts.\n\nNews that Nasdaq will begin supporting bitcoin futures is “a clear message that the traditional parts of the financial services industry are embracing digital currencies,” said Richard Levin, chair of the financial services technology and regulation practice at the law firm Polsinelli PC.\n\n“You look at the fact that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Nasdaq — two of the leading exchanges — are embracing financial products connected to a digital asset,"" Levin said. ""They aren’t charging into this cavalierly. They had discussions with their regulators. And many [institutional investors] are taking a look at this digital asset class and asking, is this a new asset we can trade? Just like the development of derivatives, some may feel this is a new area they can make money trading in.”\n\nStill, Levin said, regulators are likely to be concerned with the rise in popularity in bitcoin among individual retail investors who may not be as sophisticated and aware of bitcoin’s propensity for fluctuations. Indeed, top Federal Reserve officials are already warning about the speculative nature of bitcoin.\n\n“I think they’re worried that retail investors deemed not sophisticated enough might get burned,” he said.\n\nBut does the weight of having established names trading in bitcoin instruments mean the banking industry at large will begin to embrace it? Not exactly, but they may be less hostile and try to understand it better, experts said.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said it’s too early for his bank to need a bitcoin strategy and that it’s too volatile to be a good currency.\n\n“Something that moves up and down 20% in a day doesn’t feel like a currency, doesn’t feel like a store of value,” Blankfein said Thursday in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\n\nThat assessment, though cool, was less dismissive than when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin “a fraud.”\n\nSlideshow Start Slideshow Bitcoin mania mounts amid banker skepticism It’s been month after month of record-breaking, confounding growth for the cryptocurrency, accompanied by regular warnings from banks about bubble speculation.\n\nCredit Suisse CEO Tidjame Thiam has said many bankers are steering clear because banks “in the current state of regulation have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money-laundering challenges.”\n\nMany banks may avoid bitcoin until more regulatory clarity is provided and the price stabilizes.\n\n“It’s very difficult for banks themselves to benefit from bitcoin,” said Ben Jessel, managing principal at the consulting firm Capco. “There’s a lot of concern around its overall fundamentals. One would hope the advent of a futures market now will provide us with an idea of the future price of bitcoin and perhaps take out some of the speculative bubble element.”\n\nThe most well-known cryptocurrency experienced perhaps its most volatile trading day ever Wednesday. The price of bitcoin plunged 18% by Wednesday afternoon to below $9,500, after earlier in the day blowing through both $10,000 and $11,000 marks for the first time. It was trading at 9,519 late Thursday afternoon, according to Coinbase.\n\nIn general, the price of bitcoin has surged over 900% in 2017, largely due to much increased interest from retail and institutional investors in the cryptocurrency, which was once only thought of as the purview of drug dealers and other criminals.\n\nThat said, bitcoin is now attracting both individual and institutional investors in large numbers, said Maximilian von Wallenberg, co-founder of Cryptonaut, a cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\n“Every day at the moment only 1 million bitcoin are actively traded,” he said. “But by now there are millions of people who want to get into the market. … In addition, we have institutional money pouring in.”\n\nQuote \'The advent of a futures market now will provide us with an idea of the future price of bitcoin and perhaps take out some of the speculative bubble element.\'\n\nSome believe bitcoin — or at least the technology behind it — will have the greatest impact in banking by revolutionizing an inefficient cross-border payments system.\n\n“I think the biggest possibility will come in cross-border payments,” said Jessel. “The correspondent banking network we have now takes three days"" to complete a payment.\n\n“For cross-border payments, there is nothing better than cryptocurrency,” said William Quigley, managing director of Clearstone Venture Partners and CEO of the Worldwide Asset Exchange, a virtual marketplace. “More people are beginning to understand that fact, and it is getting reflected in the price for bitcoin.”\n\nBut regardless of its eventual function in the financial services industry, some say banks that dismiss bitcoin altogether do so at their own peril.\n\n“This is a runaway train — no one is closing it down now,” said David Tawil, a director at Maglan Capital and former investment banker at Credit Suisse. “If any financial services professional is not taking notice and educating themselves on bitcoin and cryptocurrency, they are doing themselves a big disservice.”\n\nOnce the “nefarious elements” associated with cryptocurrency can be minimized, the basic notion of a universal digital currency “is extremely compelling,” Tawil said, especially for those living in countries where there is geopolitical discord and a lack of trust in the government being able to maintain an economy.\n\n“Regulators need to get all over this as fast as possible and start figuring out a way to legitimize it,” he said.', 'HONG KONG (CNNMoney) -- Forget the Dow\'s big rally or booming tech stocks, there\'s a much wilder investment story happening.\n\nBitcoin started the year worth less than $1,000. It\'s now stormed past $11,000 -- a staggering jump of over 1,000%.\n\nSo how does the virtual digital currency work -- and what\'s behind its meteoric rise?\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Many of its backers saw it as a simple global payment system for anyone to use.\n\nUnlike the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen, digital currencies such as bitcoin aren\'t issued by central banks like the Federal Reserve. Instead, they are ""mined"" by computers using complex algorithms.\n\nPayments in bitcoin can be made without traditional middlemen such as banks and without the need to give your name.\n\nThat made bitcoin popular with criminals and others who wanted to move money anonymously. But its price has taken off this year as mainstream investors have become interested.\n\nWhy have prices gone crazy?\n\nSome experts say the biggest force pushing bitcoin prices higher this year has been ... higher prices.\n\nInvestors have been buying as they fear ""they\'re missing the party"" or ""losing out on a quick profit,"" said Stephen Innes, head of Asia trading at online broker Oanda. ""Intense media coverage"" in recent months has also convinced more investors to pile in, he added.\n\nArthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong\'s Bitmex, an exchange for trading financial instruments based on bitcoin, said the digital currency is in a ""positive feedback loop.""\n\nIn other words, investors see the price is increasing and want a piece of the action, moving prices higher still.\n\nThe sentiment has been backed up by indications that bitcoin is getting greater mainstream acceptance. Next month, investors should be able to start trading bitcoin futures via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThat would give the virtual currency more legitimacy among professional investors.\n\nWho\'s buying it?\n\nFor much of this year, it\'s mom-and-pop investors who have been buying in.\n\nMany are in Japan and South Korea, where recent regulation changes have made it easier to trade bitcoin, according to experts.\n\nBut the biggest gains from the virtual currency\'s massive rally are likely to be concentrated among a relatively small number of investors.\n\nWhen you invest in bitcoin, you don\'t have to buy a whole unit. According to research site BitInfoCharts, the vast majority of bitcoin accounts contain just 0.1 bitcoin (about $1,000) or less. Just 3% of more than 20 million bitcoin accounts hold one bitcoin or more.\n\nBig institutional investors such as hedge funds and assets managers have largely stayed on the sidelines. But some experts predict they\'ll move into the market in the coming months, despite skepticism from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nWhat\'s next?\n\nSome industry insiders are incredibly bullish. Hayes predicts prices could hit a mind-boggling $50,000 by the end of next year, driven by the flow of money when institutional investors ""pull the trigger"" on investing in the digital currency.\n\nWith a total value of around $175 billion, the bitcoin market is small compared with more established assets.\n\n""This is a drop in the ocean compared to the trillions transacted daily"" in currency and stock markets, said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Just a small amount of mainstream investors\' money would make a big difference to bitcoin prices, he said.\n\nBut some finance industry veterans are wary.\n\nOanda\'s Innes, who has worked in currency trading for decades, referenced a famous piece of investment advice from Buffett: ""Be fearful when others are greedy.""\n\n""Following the herd rarely produces large-scale gains,"" Innes said.\n\nInvestors were given a reminder of bitcoin\'s unpredictability on Wednesday. After topping $11,000, it plunged more than $2,000 before recovering some of those losses.\n\nBy Daniel Shane\n\nThe CNN Wire TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

On Wednesday, the coin shed more than $1,000 in a couple of hours as anxiety mounted over a number of outages at leading cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nUsers of Coinbase\'s professional trading platform, and Bitstamp, a bitcoin exchange based in Luxembourg, reported slow performance and outages. Such platforms have struggled to keep up with the explosive rise of bitcoin and increased trading volumes for cryptocurrencies.\n\n24-hour volumes, according to crypto data site CoinMarketCap, hit all-time highs in November. At the time of publication, they were just under $20 billion. To put that in context, the New York Stock Exchange sees approximately $50 billion of shares exchange on its floor during any given trading day.\n\nThe problem is platforms like Coinbase don\'t have the infrastructure to handle volumes that high, according to Garrett See, the CEO of DV Chain, the crypto trading division of Chicago-trading firm DV Trading.\n\nSee told Business Insider his firm is focusing on how it can improve the interface between his trading desks and cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n""We have been adapting the software we use on the traditional side and applying them to cryptocurrency markets,"" See said.\n\nCoinbase blamed high volumes for problems with their site in a tweet out early Thursday morning.\n\nMI\n\nExchanges appear to be stepping up their game, however.

TradeStation, which is among the few online brokerages embracing cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin, has already added support for real-time market data for CME\'s two bitcoin indices – the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and the CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index. Once they become available, the bitcoin contracts can be traded by current and newly funded TradeStation futures accounts. Over the summer, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, the largest U.S. options exchange, said that it will launch bitcoin derivatives trading products in the early part of 2018, which TradeStation will also offer.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been wildly volatile all year long, particularly for the leading digital currency bitcoin. In the beginning of 2017, bitcoin was trading around $1,000, and as of Thursday, it was valued at around $9,500. Bitcoin is known for wild swings based on regulatory actions and moves by the financial industry either to embrace or rail against the digital currency. Earlier in the year, bitcoin was under pressure after regulators from all sorts of countries, including the U.S., U.K. and China, warned about the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. China has banned bitcoin exchanges and initial coin offerings altogether.\n\nDespite these concerns, the price has surged on news that bitcoin is gaining legitimacy, which was the case when CME recently announced the impending bitcoin futures contracts. Japan has also embraced the currency, setting rules and boosting its legitimacy. As for where the price of bitcoin is heading, Putra said that it should continue moving higher just because of the new capital joining the marketplace.', 'India-based digital currency exchanges have claimed that the number of Indian investors who registered in their platforms to buy Bitcoin has increased considerably in the past few weeks as the value of the leading cryptocurrency surpassed the $11,000 level on November 29.\n\nThe unprecedented rise in the number of investors who want to invest their money in the most popular cryptocurrency was observed despite rumors that the country’s central bank may declare Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as illegal.\n\nAccording to Unocoin co-founder and CEO Sathvik Vishwanath, the number of customers who registered on their platform in just one month has reached around 200,000 due to the sharp rise in the price of Bitcoin.\n\n“It took us about three years to gather [100,000] registered customers and in last one month itself we have seen about [200,000] customers registering with us.”\n\nPhenomenal performance of Bitcoin in India\n\nDespite the negative views of the Indian government and banking regulator, the market for digital currencies in the country is booming. This is particularly true for Bitcoin, whose price has skyrocketed from Rs 459,047 on November 1 to Rs 860,049 on November 29.\n\nAccording to Zebpay co-founder Sandeep Goenka, the extent of interest shown by investors in Bitcoin is phenomenal. He added that the number of users is increasing by 300,000-400,000 in the past few months compared to around 150,000 in June and July.', 'Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize-winning economist, has made the claim that bitcoin ‘ought to be outlawed,’ at a time when the digital currency is experiencing record highs.\n\nIn a Bloomberg Television interview, the 74-year-old American economist and professor at Colombia University, said:\n\nIt seems to me it ought to be outlawed. It doesn’t serve any socially useful function.\n\nHis comments come at a time when bitcoin is continuing to surpass expectations from all sides. Just yesterday, it was reported that the digital currency has passed the historic $10,000 milestone and today it went even higher to reach over $11,000 for the first time, pushing its market total to $185 billion.\n\nYet, despite these record achievements, Stiglitz is of the opinion that the only reason the digital currency is doing so well is down to the fact that it has the ‘potential for circumvention, lack of oversight.’\n\nHe added that:\n\nIt’s a bubble that’s going to give a lot of people a lot of exciting times as it rides up and then goes down.\n\nStiglitz has, in the past, expressed his views about the digital currency, stating in 2016 that the U.S. government had ‘shut down‘ bitcoin. At the time, he said:\n\nThe main use of bitcoin has been to circumvent tax authorities and regulation. I think the U.S. government did the right of thing of shutting or trying to shut it down and I think effectively…it has done that.\n\nInterestingly, since then his outlook toward the crypto market has somewhat shifted, if only slightly. In January, while speaking at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, he said that the U.S. should phase out fiat currency and move toward the use of digital currencies.\n\nThe topic of discussion at the time focused on the issue of corruption, tax evasion and tax avoidance. According to Stiglitz, the phasing out of money and introducing digital currency has ‘benefits that outweigh the cost,’ in the long term.\n\nHarvard professor and economist Kenneth Rogoff has also said that cash provided the ideal avenue for tax evasion, and that the time was now to reduce fiat money.\n\nNo doubt Stiglitz’s most recent comments will raise a few eyebrows, and is unlikely to go down well bitcoin enthusiasts; however, given the upward trajectory that the digital currency is currently on, it’s not likely that it will have much impact on where the market is heading.\n\nFeatured image from Flickr/International Monetary Fund.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'CEO Lloyd Blankfein attacks cryptocurrency after value dives 20% in a day, saying bank will not get involved until it becomes less volatile\n\nThe boss of Goldman Sachs became the latest high-profile critic of bitcoin, claiming it was a vehicle to commit fraud as the value of the cryptocurrency plunged 20% in less than 24 hours.\n\nLloyd Blankfein, chief executive of the US investment bank, said: “Something that moves 20% [overnight] does not feel like a currency.

Whether it\'s a bad investment is the big question . Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it\'s hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.\n\nHis comments came during another wildly volatile trading session for the digital currency, which plunged by over $2,000 in a 24-hour period. Having topped $11,000 to reach a new record high of $11,395 on Wednesday, it fell to a low of $9,000 on Thursday, before picking up slightly later in the day.\n\nBlankfein said Goldman did not need to have a bitcoin strategy, adding the digital currency would need to be a lot less volatile and a lot more liquid to justify closer attention.\n\n“When do I have to have a bitcoin strategy? Not today. Life must be really rosy if that is what we are talking about,” he said. “Bitcoin is not for me. A lot of things that have not been for me in the past 20 years have worked out, but I am not guessing that this will work out.”\n\nDon’t let the bankers fool you: bitcoin is here to stay | Dominic Frisby Read more\n\nBlankfein is the latest boss of a major bank to voice scepticism about bitcoin, after JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, described it as fraud that would ultimately blow up and said it was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, said the digital currency was too small to pose a systemic threat to the global economy. He also cautioned that bitcoin investors needed “to do their homework”.\n\nDespite the fall in bitcoin’s value on Thursday, it remained far higher than it was at the start of 2017, when it was trading at $998. It is the biggest gainer of all asset classes this year, prompting sceptics to declare it a classic speculative bubble that could burst.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions remain concerned about bitcoin’s early associations with money laundering and online crime. Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin is not issued or regulated by a central bank or government.\n\nLee Wild, head of equity strategy at online trading company Interactive Investor, said the volatility in bitcoin trading was “wild west stuff”.\n\n“Cryptocurrency land’s extreme volatility is like catnip to high-risk traders, and even traditional investors are dipping their toe. Given there’s no logical way to value them with any accuracy, this remains wild west stuff.”\n\nAnalysts at the spread betting firm, City Index, said: “While traditional assets are experiencing historically low levels of volatility, the whipsaw action of the bitcoin is drawing the attention of traditional traders. Meanwhile existing traders and newcomers are increasingly interested in fear of missing out.”\n\n', 'After surging to $11,441, establishing a new all-time high for the third time this week, the bitcoin price has declined to $9,200.\n\nOn November 29, CCN reported that the price of bitcoin surged from around $10,000 to $10,884, recording an $800 daily increase in value. Since then, in a matter of hours, the price of bitcoin quickly surged from $10,884 to $11,441, as the demand from the global bitcoin market skyrocketed.\n\nBut, the entire cryptocurrency market has experienced a major correction, as the market valuation and price of leading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash dropped.\n\nFactors For the Next Rally\n\nOver the past few weeks, CCN has provided extensive coverage on the factors that have led to the recent bitcoin price surge. The major factor has been the market’s optimism on the entrance of institutional investors and retail traders. Experts including billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and Bitfury vice chairman George Kikvadze have revealed that at least $10 billion of institutional money is expected to flow into the bitcoin market in the upcoming weeks.\n\nSome analysts have claimed that Thanksgiving and the holiday weekend after it led to an increase interest and demand for bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, as families gathered and discussed the most important developments and technologies, including bitcoin. Essentially, bitcoin was a “hot Thanksgiving discussion point,” and as such, more individual investors and casual traders were exposed to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhile the bitcoin price has dropped below the $10,000 mark, analysts such as BTCC CEO Bobby Lee and Novogratz stated that bitcoin will likely surpass $40,000 in 2018 with ease. The recent correction of bitcoin price will allow the market to stabilize and prepare for another rally.\n\nMajor factors for bitcoin’s expected rallies in the mid-term and throughout 2018 are the sudden flow of large capital into the bitcoin market. As tens of billions of dollars flow into bitcoin, the cryptocurrency will become even more liquid, as the average daily trading volume of bitcoin enter the $10 billion region.\n\nBitcoin’s daily trading volume had surpassed $10 billion in the past, but is currently stable at around $8.6 billion. It is likely that with large-scale hedge funds and investment firms, the daily trading volume of bitcoin will surge, allowing the cryptocurrency to become more liquid and adopted by the mainstream.\n\n“My new price target for bitcoin is USD $48,000. Will it take approximately 7 months to reach that? ” said Lee.\n\nFinancial Institutions Enter Bitcoin Market\n\nSquare, the most widely utilized financial app in the US finance market, has officially integrated bitcoin, enabling its millions of users to purchase, sell, and store bitcoin on the Square application.\n\nAlmost immediately after its integration of bitcoin, the market valuation of Square increased by more than $1 billion, from $15 billion to $16.1 billion.\n\nIt has become significantly more difficult for financial service providers in the traditional finance sector to dismiss bitcoin, as integrating the cryptocurrency allows companies to penetrate the $336 billion cryptocurrency market. As existing financial service providers move to implement bitcoin, the market valuation of the cryptocurrency will rise, contributing to its next rally.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bank of England Deputy Governor, Sir Jon Cunliffe, has claimed that the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin poses no real threat to the global economy and financial institutions despite its current phenomenal performance in the market.

He added that investors should do a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind the virtual currencies phenomenal rise to avoid risks.\n\nThis is not at a size where it’s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.
