07/01/2015,"['CoinTelegraph spoke with Thanos Marinos, the founder of Greece’s only Bitcoin exchange, about the current debt crisis and Bitcoin’s surge in popularity in Greece and across the EU.\n\nThanos Marinos is the founder of BTCGreece, the country’s only Bitcoin exchange dedicated to Greek clients. Due to the current capital controls imposed in the country, BTCGreece is the only place, besides the single Bitcoin ATM in Athens, where Greeks can buy bitcoins at the moment.\n\n“The demand [for Bitcoin] in the last 4 weeks has risen by 400%.” - Thanos Marinos, BTCGreece Founder\n\nCoinTelegraph: Can you tell me about BTCGreece?\n\nThanos Marinos: We are the only exchange operating in Greece at the moment as the Greek banks are under capital controls. They cannot send money outside Greece and we hold a Greek bank account.\n\nCT: Have you seen a huge spike in interest towards Bitcoin in the last few weeks?\n\nTM: Yes, the demand in the last 4 weeks has risen by 400% and the number of newly registered customers by 600%.\n\nCT: Can you describe what the situation is like on the ground in Greece?\n\nTM: People are in shock as they never expected to have closed banks and at the same time risking being out of Eurozone and euro currency soon.\n\nPublic order is still in place but things are expected to become worse as soon as we move towards the referendum scheduled for Sunday. There are increasing voices that the government should withdraw the referendum.\n\n“Don’t be surprised if the Greek government pulls out from the referendum and cancels it as a goodwill gesture towards the creditors.”\n\nCT: The ‘No’ vote in the referendum is still leading in the polls but is losing steam due to the capital controls. What’s your prediction of what will happen on July 5?\n\nTM: Prior to the referendum day, fear will help the ‘Yes’ movement.\n\nHaving said that, don’t be surprised if the Greek government pulls out from the referendum and cancels it as a goodwill gesture towards the creditors or even change their position from NO to YES (for a food deal that Greece will get).\n\nCT: What does missing the IMF payment mean for the everyday situation in Greece?\n\nTM: Honestly nothing yet. Nothing has changed apart from the psychological factor that bankruptcy is coming closer.\n\nCT: Coinbase has said it has seen a 300% increase in people buying Bitcoin in Europe in the last few weeks. Can you comment on this?\n\nTM: There has definitely been a rise. I wouldn’t like to comment on the numbers. It’s important to note though that at the moment Coinbase and any other exchange except BTCGreece cannot operate in Greece as banks are not making any outward payments due to capital controls.\n\n“[…] the Greek government is already working on blockchain solutions […]”\n\nCT: In retrospect, would Bitcoin have been a good hedge against capital controls and as a store of value for Greeks?\n\nTM: That is exactly what we have seen the last 6 weeks from our Greek clients.\n\nCT: That they have been buying in preparation?\n\nTM: Yes correct. The deadline of June 30 has worked and many Greeks bought prior the capital controls being imposed. Now we are the only exchange that can sell to Greeks\n\nCT: Have you seen people using the one Bitcoin ATM in Athens?\n\nTM: They are not using it because if they have cash, they keep it since they need it for day-to-day use as capital controls allow only 60 Euros withdrawal per day. It’s a one way BTM.\n\nCT: Is there anything else you might want to say about Bitcoin and the situation in Greece? Do you see it as a viable option? If so, in what use cases and why?\n\nTM: I believe in bitcoin as a currency and as the biggest technological innovation of our days. It’s important to note that the Greek government is already working on blockchain solutions and there are people on the ground trying to introduce blockchain solution projects to the Greek economy. One good example is Drachmaeconnect.com targeting the tourism sector, one of the main industries in Greece.', 'Carl M Force, part of federal taskforce that penetrated illicit online marketplace, ended up siphoning off more than $700,000 in digital currency for himself\n\nA former undercover agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration has pleaded guilty on charges of stealing more than $700,000 in digital currency – most of it from an online drug bazaar known as Silk Road that he infiltrated as part of a federal investigation.\n\nCarl M Force, dressed in the orange garb of the San Francisco jail and shackled at the ankles, pleaded guilty to extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice in federal court.\n\nThe former DEA agent could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison when sentenced in October.\n\n“He had a stellar 15-year career with the DEA except for this one blip,” Force’s attorney, Ivan Bates, said outside court.\n\nInside court Bates told US District Judge Richard Seeborg that Force suffered from anxiety and depression.\n\nWhile with the DEA Force, 46, was tasked with masquerading as a big-time drug dealer who had connections to hit men, infiltrating Silk Road and communicating with the online drug bazaar’s founder, Ross Ulbricht.\n\nUlbricht was recently sentenced to life in prison for his role in managing the Silk Road website, which rang up more than $200m in sales.\n\nServing in his undercover role as “Nob”, Force told Ulbricht he had inside information about the federal investigation of Silk Road and began selling him tidbits about the probe, authorities said.\n\nForce also created another persona, “French Maid”, who purported to have inside information on the probe that he sold to Ulbricht.\n\nForce also invested in a company that brokered the digital currency bitcoin and served as the firm’s chief compliance officer while still with the DEA.\n\nDuring his time with the company Force used his position to seize $300,000 from a customer and transfer it to his private account, authorities said.\n\nAuthorities said a former Secret Service agent, Shaun Bridges, had previously agreed to plead guilty to theft charges involving the separate siphoning of funds from Silk Road. Bridges is scheduled to enter his plea in August.', ""Many people are extremely wary of a one-world currency. I didn't know until recently that this fear among Christians is due to a passage in the Bible itself. The Book of Revelation, chapter 13:16-17 says:\n\n“And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”\n\nThe topic came up during a drive through the country. Some friends and I utilized Craigslist to pay for a 1000-mile rideshare, and during the drive I had ample time to proselytize to our new driver friend about digital currency. After hearing my synopsis, he said, “So ... is Bitcoin kind of like the mark of the beast?”\n\n“What's that?” I asked. He explained his take on the Book of Revelation passage — that his prophets of old were warned that the highest tyranny would come to the earth in a form of biometrically-enforced and perfectly traceable money.\n\nWhat with Elliptic's recent privacy-smashing “blockchain map” and the fact that a man has already had a Bitcoin wallet implanted in his hand, one can see that my driver friend made an excellent point: if the Bitcoin maximalists get their way, and the whole world uses Bitcoin in its current form, the “compliant” masses could seriously usher in the “mark of the beast.” Here’s how:\n\n1. Bitcoin would be the perfect currency to be declared the only “legal tender.” States have failed miserably at producing and maintaining stable currencies. They just can't resist dipping their hands into the piggy bank. Look no further than Greece for a perfect example.\n\nBut digital currency provides a way for states to save themselves from themselves. A currency with a non-manipulatable inflation rate is a brilliant way for monopolists to present a viable, long-term monopoly currency.\n\n“Legal tender” laws have been used for 100 years to successfully corral people into using a monopoly currency. If the masses who've been obedient continue to be obedient, who's to say “legal tender” wouldn't be enforced with one digital currency as well? Just look at what's happening in Ecuador -- the state says all banks must accept a new state-run cryptocurreny. . . or else.\n\n2. Each person's Bitcoin addresses would be tied to identity. If Bitcoin were to be declared the new “legal tender” — which may become a more popular idea as more fiat currencies begin to fail around the world — the politically obedient would be all too easy to convince that identities must be tied to payments. The usual “terrorism-financial-stability-national-security-the-children” would be used as selling points. Coinbase would probably be the biggest cheerleader.\n\nIn an ironic twist of fate, Bitcoin would become the new fiat.\n\nThen every person's expenditures could be checked for “compliance” right from the blockchain. Addresses of “criminals” could be blacklisted and mandatory offerings (taxes) could be verified for all transactions. Your entire economic life could be tracked, verified, measured and controlled, all via the blockchain.\n\n3. Because the blockchain is transparent, it would be extremely easy to condemn those who don't comply. Failing to include your tax payment on every transaction, or doing any business with “economically sanctioned” individuals, would land you directly on the “Trade Sanction” list.\n\nAnyone found by the Bitcoin blockchain to trade with you henceforth would be imprisoned or worse. You may eventually starve, not for lack of food, but for lack of people willing to sell some to you. Or as Revelations would say, “No man might buy or sell.”\n\nThe relative IP address of where transactions are made is broadcast by the blockchain, so this makes for an excellent geo-tracking scheme when everyone's identites are tied to their Bitcoin address. Or as Revelations would say, “The number of his name.”\n\nWhen Bitcoin becomes the new fiat, you can run, but you can't hide.\n\nBitcoin-related projects like DarkWallet have known these risks for a while. Mixing services like BitMixer have served to mitigate the problem, too. Even the Sidechains Elements project proposes a half-measure solution that would mask exact amounts transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain, but not the sending and receiving addresses. Such solutions are a step in the right direction, but don't really solve the inherent problem.\n\nIf “mark of the beast” fears are to be avoided in the future, it will be thanks to a market in currency — you know, the thing that Bitcoin maximalists hate. In the new film Ulterior States, Andreas Antonopoulos states that he predicts there will be tens of thousands — potentially even millions — of digital currencies created and used in the future. Bitcoin offshoots like Dash have already taken the privacy issue into their own hands, building anonymity — not just pseudonymity — right into their protocol and masternode network.\n\nThe proposals in this article may sound far-fetched, but 200 years ago, today's monopoly currencies sounded pretty far-fetched, too. Many new things sound far-fetched before they materialize.\n\nOnly by envisioning potential futures can one actively work to prevent them."", 'At each node of this network, calculations are performed before the user pulls all the constituent parts back together. The nodes, en masse, can collective do the thinking, even without seeing the rest of the orginal data. The system uses the same anti-fraud record that\'s found in the bitcoin blockchain. As mentioned in Wired, this could lead to some very interesting conclusions: a search engine request that returns results, but never sees the user\'s original search, the ability to share sensitive medical data with medical companies and advertisers without privacy risks. Oz Nathan, Enigma\'s co-creator said:""No one wants to give their data to some company when you don\'t know what they\'ll do with it.""\n\n""But if you have guaranteed privacy, data analysis can be a lot more powerful. People will actually be willing to share more."" Another notable part of this system is that computational power needed is less than 100 times that of the unencrypted calculation. They hope to reduce this to around just ten times the processing power.', 'As I walked around TechCrunch Disrupt NYC recently, I was bombarded with messaging, product demos and pitches.\n\nUntil I met a young lady who didn\'t know I was a tech journo. She had one goal, after I announced that ""Bitcoin isn\'t my thing."" To change my mind.\n\nIt didn\'t matter who I was nor what I did. She saw me as a challenge. To change one mind at a time.\n\nAnd she did it discretely with diplomacy and gentility; almost lovingly. The things she was saying made so much sense and were made in the context of appreciation for innovation while trying to infect me with her passion about Bitcoin.\n\nHer name was Melanie Shapiro and she\'s the founder & CEO of Bitcoin\' company, Case Wallet Inc. which is based in Rochester, New York. Case offers what TechCrunch called ""an insanely secure Bitcoin hardware wallet.""\n\nDr. Shapiro is no slouch. In full possession of an MBA and Ph.D. in Management and Marketing, Shapiro talks excitedly and very genuinely about Bitcoin.\n\nShe and the company just landed $1.5 million in investor money, also from no slouches, RRE Ventures, Highline Venture Partners and one of her alma maters, the Rochester Institute of Technology Fund. The heightened significance of RRE\'s investment is that a co-founder of RRE is James D. Robinson III, a longtime Chairman & CEO of American Express. The legitimacy this adds to a Bitcoin-related business is immense.\n\nMelanie Shapiro worked me over with a series of soft/hard-edged quotes that shifted my opinion about Bitcoin dramatically.\n\nI don\'t know about you, but I find quotations to be one of the finest learning tools around. My two favorite quotesters are Winston Churchill and Mark Twain. So I decided to use Melanie\'s quotes here to try and convert you if you\'re not a Bitcoin supporter and even if you are, Melanie\'s quotes will provide you with more ammunition.\n\n""There\'s a lot of misconception about what bitcoin actually is due to media narratives. The most popular reference I hear mentioned is Silk Road, but Silk Road wasn\'t enabled by bitcoin. People forget or don\'t realize that Silk Road was enabled by Tor, an \'anonymizing\' proxy network. Bitcoin isn\'t actually an anonymous currency it\'s pseudo-anonymous. Want to know what\'s anonymous? Cash.""\n\n""The math and technology behind the blockchain is difficult for most to understand, but the beauty is - you don\'t have to get it to use it. Do you really get how the internet works? TLS/SSL? DNS? HTTPS?""\n\n""If you ask the average person on the street what https is or dns, they likely wouldn\'t be able to tell you. But these things are underneath most of the applications they use on a daily basis. I think the real success of bitcoin will be when it\'s the foundational layer on top of which applications and processes are built without people having to understand what that means.""\n\n\n\n""While we can attribute a lot of our early attention to stories of bitcoin scandal, Mt Gox, and high-profile arrests, the stories being told now are of how the technology could have the potential to bring efficiency to the financial industry.""\n\n\n\n""The reason you should care about bitcoin\'s success is not just because it can help reorganize how the financial industry is run, but because it can bring freedom and empowerment to the people who really need it ... the billions of \'un-banked\' people on this planet.""\n\n\n\n""Every CEO, founder, engineer or leader in the Bitcoin ecosystem is an educator - we all spend a tremendous amount of time just explaining what it is that we\'re doing and what kind of impact it can have. I think we\'re finally starting to see our hard work paying off. Sometimes it\'s as if we\'re all working for the same organization, fighting behind the same line, and on the same team.""\n\n""To truly understand the impact (of Bitcoin), consider what the cellphone did for telecom. There are places in the world that completely skipped over traditional landline phones, mostly because it\'s a resource-intensive advancement, and went straight to cellphones. Bitcoin will be the technology that leaps over traditional banking in these same parts of the world. The people in places that never saw truly established banking services will be able to use those cellphones they have to do their \'banking\' in bitcoin.""\n\n\n\n""To me, bitcoin is just the denomination used to pay the toll to put stuff on the world\'s first completely transparent and immutable decentralized ledger - the blockchain.""\n\n\n\n""If you think about it, everything in society lives on some sort of ledger. You have a driver\'s license, which lives on an identity ledger at the DMV, your credit card purchases are tied to a currency ledger at your bank, you buy a house and that lives on a property ledger. The blockchain is simply a ledger, like all of these other ledgers that our very lives exist on, but instead of there being thousands of different ledgers held by thousands of different central authorities, the blockchain is one global ledger that all of these things can live on.""\n\n""You\'ll hear the word \'decentralized\' thrown around a lot when talking about bitcoin. The reason for this is that bitcoin is a decentralized asset that no one entity has control over. This might not seem important, but think about the people who live in places where that central entity that controls your currency is corrupt or unstable.""\n\n\n\n""If it was as simple as just giving people another way to buy a cup of coffee, I can promise you that no one in our ecosystem would be working this hard. ""\n\n\n\n""We have to be careful with the word \'disrupt\' when talking about the potential of Bitcoin for both banks and government. It may be exactly what we\'re trying to do, but it certainly doesn\'t help the conversation - it\'s just too aggressive of a word I think when trying to start a dialogue.""\n\n\n\n""It\'s not that we\'re trying to replace the current banking system or government; we\'re trying to work along side them to rethink current processes that are both inefficient and costly. Neither side is going to get anywhere without working together. Ultimately, I think we\'re at a place now where goals are aligned on both sides. Ultimately, the Utopian goal is a world where all assets, identity, and contracts live on a distributed, public ledger owned by no one central entity, a ledger that even lives underneath people\'s credit card transactions.""\n\n\n\n""The amount of people coming from traditional banking and from government that are talking about bitcoin now (in a positive way), are exposing a wider audience to what bitcoin actually is, and is useful for. It\'s certainly great PR for our entire ecosystem.""\n\n""Regulation is a great thing for bitcoin. It gives me, and the rest of us principles by which we have to run our businesses. However, it\'s important that we are being regulated by people who understand the technology and can give us guidance without hindering innovation.""\n\n""It does worry me that bitcoin won\'t succeed, that something will stand in our way and we\'ll never see it live up to it\'s promise and this is sad because there are a lot of people who really need this to work.""\n\n""One of the coolest things about a global ledger as a public utility is that it can completely reorganize the way we run our societies, which is why I think the blockchain is one of the greatest human innovations of our time. To all the billions of people who don\'t truly own anything, or have records of their lives and assets - welcome to the global economy!""', 'The blockchain is the future; it has the potential to transform everything from how we send money to how communities grow. Here is WIRED\'s simple guide to the blockchain, bitcoin and how it could impact you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\'ve never heard of the blockchain before. What exactly is it?\n\nIf you\'re not familiar with the blockchain, and it\'s still a relatively new concept in the world of electronic finance, you no doubt will have heard of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, also known as ""cryptocurrency"", which basically allows people to make instant, anonymous transactions online.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin records every single transaction made on its network in a public record. This is known as the ""blockchain"".\n\nRead next Five startups in Rome that you need to be watching Five startups in Rome that you need to be watching\n\nHow does Bitcoin work?\n\nBitcoins have to be ""mined"" using specialist mining software, which then carries out a series of intensive calculations to find a certain data sequence, or ""block"". The block produces a specific data pattern when the Bitcoin ""hash"" algorithm is applied to the data. Whoever manages to do this will basically win bitcoins, which they can then spend in a range of places online and off.\n\nSo how often is the blockchain added to?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA new blockchain is generated around every ten minutes and then shared throughout the network. This means it\'s constantly growing as completed ""blocks"" are made and added to the public ledger.\n\nHow many ""blocks"" exist on the blockchain?\n\nRead next The man behind Manchester\'s sexist tech awards can\'t find a taker for his £50k apology The man behind Manchester\'s sexist tech awards can\'t find a taker for his £50k apology\n\nThere is a countless number of blocks on the blockchain at any one time – as soon as one block gets completed, another is automatically generated.\n\nSo it\'s a bit like the way conventional banks have a full history of its customers\' transactions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExactly. All Bitcoin transactions are entered chronologically in a blockchain, similarly to how typical bank transactions are recorded. You can think of the different blocks, then, like individual bank statements.\n\nCan Bitcoin transactions be traced easily on the blockchain?\n\nYes. All the blocks are added to the blockchain in a linear, sequential order. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, creating a linked series from the ""genesis"" block right the way through to the current one. As every Bitcoin user must have a Bitcoin address -- a unique identifier that allows them to receive Bitcoins -- the blockchain contains a complete set of information about every address using Bitcoin and their balances at any point in history.\n\nRead next Reykjavik\'s startup scene is powered by equality Reykjavik\'s startup scene is powered by equality\n\nSo how do you keep track of all your bitcoins?\n\nYou\'ll basically need something called a Bitcoin wallet: a free online wallet which you can use to make worldwide Bitcoin payments on your mobile or desktop.\n\nHow can I get a Bitcoin wallet?\n\nYou\'ll need to visit Blockchain.info to create your wallet. You\'ll need to enter your email address and create a password, but it only takes a few seconds -- and you can then send and receive Bitcoin payments immediately.\n\nDoes this mean the Bitcoin blockchain works like a bank then?\n\nNo. You\'re essentially your ""own"" bank; you have complete ownership over your currency and only you can check your Bitcoin balance, view your transactions and make payments.\n\nAre bitcoins secure?\n\nBitcoin maintains that all transactions are secure because they can be tracked. However, this doesn\'t tell the full story: there have been several cases where hackers have raided electronic wallets used to store secret keys that enable you to spend your bitcoins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo although none of these stolen bitcoins can be spent, due to blockchain tracking, you can still be deprived of your ability to spend them in the first place.\n\nThis feature was originally written ahead of WIRED Money 2015.

The bank wants to make sure it is ""at the leading edge of [distributed ledger technology]"" so it can ""exploit the opportunities within it.""\n\nAccording to Ken Moore, head of Citi Innovation Labs, Citi has been looking at blockchain technology for ""the last few years"" and has developed ""an equivalent to bitcoin"" within its labs while mining what it calls ""Citicoin.""\n\n""We have up and running three separate systems within Citi now that actually deploy blockchain distributed ledger technologies,"" Moore told the International Business Times. ""They are all within the labs just now so there is no real money passing through these systems yet, they are at a pre-production level to be clear.""\n\nThe bank is exploring how it could use blockchain technology for cross border payments; ""trade probably being a second runner,"" Moore said. He explained:\n\n""Because we are a global network, a global bank, we can look for opportunities to use this technology to move money from country to country - country A to country B, across our network.""\n\nMoore said that the bank has been in talks with governments and regulators about the potential of either a worldwide blockchain distributed ledger network, or even ""the opportunity to create a state-backed digital currency in a number of different countries,"" he said.\n\nCiti\'s interest into digitalizing payments and transactions has led the bank to focus on five main domains of which the blockchain is just one.\n\nAs major financial institutions and banks, including the Nasdaq, Santander and UBS, are investigating how they can benefit from distributed ledger technology, one of Australia\'s biggest banks announced yesterday it had invested in Coinbase through Reinventure Group, a fintech focused venture fund that counts Westpac as its largest investor.\n\nThree of Australia\'s big four banks are currently trialing Ripple payments for faster and lower-cost cross-border payments and intra-bank transfers.', 'The independent intergovernmental organization FATF or The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering), headquartered in Paris, has published a report as a guide for using digital currencies titled “Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Currencies.” It includes benefits of digital currencies as well as potential risks of money laundering and terror financing.\n\nThe report is essentially the conclusion to the recent meeting held at Brisbane that was participated by 34 member nations and two regional organizations – the European Union and the Gulf Co-operation Council — to discuss policies, regulations and compliance for digital currencies.\n\nThe 48-page extended report issued by the FATF described bitcoin payment services and products as potential tools for money laundering, and announced that digital currency service providers and companies must identify and notice potential risks of using the currency.\n\nFATF heavily emphasized the importance of its member nations to understand the technicalities and the technology behind digital currencies such as bitcoin, and encouraged its nations to introduce regulations and restrictions for digital currency exchanges that are similar to that of traditional financial establishments, thus requesting all digital exchanges to register and subject to the same regulations of other financial institutions and money transfer businesses.\n\nThe FATF’s “guidelines” of bitcoin are predicted to have the same effect as BitLicense had on New York-based bitcoin startups – this time on a global scale.\n\nDespite the report’s persistent connection of bitcoin to money laundering and terrorist financing cases, the report does point out positive usages and applications of the technology behind digital currencies. The FATF respects the attention of venture capital firms and billionaire angel investors who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in digital currency startups.\n\n“Virtual currency has the potential to improve payment efficiency and reduce transaction costs for payments and fund transfers,” the report said. “For example, Bitcoin functions as a global currency that can avoid exchange fees, is currently processed with lower fees/charges than traditional credit and debit cards, and may potentially provide benefit to existing online payment systems, like PayPal.”\n\nFATF also explained that digital currencies are one of the only financial instruments that enables the transfer of microtransactions, which optimizes financial processes of small online businesses and individuals with low-cost goods and services.\n\nMoreover, the advantages of digital currencies for both the unbanked and banked contributed to a significant part of the report, as digital currencies offer extremely low transaction fees, which is very benefitable for those without bank accounts or those using expensive remittance services and bank transfers.\n\nHowever, FATF finalized the report with a concern that decentralized systems like digital currencies are vulnerable to anonymity risks.\n\n“For example, by design, Bitcoin addresses, which function as accounts, have no names or other customer identification attached, and the system has no central server or service provider,” the report said. “The Bitcoin protocol does not require or provide identification and verification of participants or generate historical records of transactions that are necessarily associated with real world identity. There is no central oversight body, and no AML software currently available to monitor and identify suspicious transaction patterns. Law enforcement cannot target one central location or entity (administrator) for investigative or asset seizure purposes (although authorities can target individual exchangers for client information that the exchanger may collect). It thus offers a level of potential anonymity impossible with traditional credit and debit cards or older online payment systems, such as PayPal.”\n\nPhoto / Photopin', ""CoinBit.me is a new Bitcoin platform that was launched in Malaysia in April. Since its inception, 17,800 registered users from all around the world have signed up.\n\nCo-founders Thinhes Selvaraja, CEO, and Calvin Kong, a software engineer from Hong Kong, started their business with a specific goal in mind — to be the first Bitcoin company incorporated in the country.\n\n“I would like to see CoinBit become the first Bitcoin company that's publicly listed in Malaysia. We already plan our vision and mission for that direction. We plan to expand not only in Malaysia but throughout South East Asia as well.\n\nThe growing startup now has six members controlling legal, accounting, design and business development. CoinBit also provides other cryptocurrency solutions like bill payment and phone top ups. Malaysia offers a “fresh landscape” for the currency, says Selvaraja. As the company progresses, they plan on providing services like a market and charities for its members.\n\nSelvaraja also believes they are the first Bitcoin company following Islamic finance and Sharia compliance laws. Cointelegraph got a chance to talk with him about his efforts to spread Bitcoin adoption in Malaysia. He explains how CoinBit complies with the religion's rules and how users benefit from its model.\n\nCoinTelegraph: CoinBit is based in Malaysia. How is Bitcoin adoption going in that region?\n\nThinhes Selvaraja: Malaysia is a very fresh landscape for Bitcoin knowledge. Some Malaysians have heard about it, but they just cannot elaborate much, since they don't know the whole story about it. In Malaysia, we have so many fake cryptocurrency businesses, where these companies are promoting their digital currency by using Bitcoin as benchmark. So many of them believe bitcoin already surpassed its all time high, and it's not good for investment compared to those fake cryptocurrencies. So I can say we have very much a lack of solid knowledge, or a misunderstanding, about what is Bitcoin all about, and behind the technology of the blockchain.\n\nNow social media helps Malaysians get the right knowledge about bitcoin and it's just matter of time where we will have huge involvement of Malaysians. The potential of Bitcoin growth in Malaysia is so huge. Pioneers will make great opportunities here. We already have some groups that start bitcoin activities. We started some two years back. Mainly they bring exchanges from Singapore and other countries, but none of them are registered businesses here. I can proudly say CoinBit will be the first Bitcoin company startup incorporated in Malaysia.\n\n“At the moment we don't offer any spot price exchange trading platform, since those kinds of trading needs to be regulated by a Federal Reserve Bank. So, we do trading like how goldsmiths sell their gold.”\n\nCT: You have a charity platform in the works. Can you explain this project?\n\nTS: Our charity system will operate instantly, where our members can choose to donate some Bitcoin to one of our selected charity foundations every time the members do a transaction with us. We also will highlight our most generous members who always donate with us. We believe bitcoin is the best platform to donate money for places that are not so easy to reach out to. Our members from any part of world can participate in our Bitcoin Donation System.\n\nCT: Can you tell us about CoinBit’s trading platform?\n\nTS: We sell Bitcoin and we buy it back as well. Members from all of the world can store their bitcoin with us. We don't charge any fee for Bitcoin that's purchased from us. At the moment we don't offer any spot price exchange trading platform, since those kinds of trading needs to be regulated by a Federal Reserve Bank.

We share our profit and loss among crypto members.

We share our profit and loss among crypto members. Every time members buy or sell or even pay bills with Coinbit.me, we give cash back to them.\n\nWe also reward crypto members who become a premier member with Coinbit.me, as low as US$99 for lifetime, with some profit share. Every company employs a marketing team to market their product or services, but in Coinbit.me, we have crypto members who will market our products and services around the world with some profit share. Of course Coinbit.me is not MLM company. We believe in referral system.\n\n“We will offer an escrow service as well. This is very much a benefit for the country where they don't have this kind of facility before us.”\n\nCT: A market is lined up for development. Can you tell us about this?\n\nTS: We have members from more than 100 countries. These days, it is difficult to do online merchant services, mainly because of payment problems. Now we plan on developing an online mall for our members who can sell their products by accepting bitcoin as payment channel. We will offer an escrow service as well. This is very much a benefit for the country where they don't have this kind of facility before us.\n\n“Bitcoin will certainly become a big hit here in Malaysia, especially now where our Ringgit is losing its value against other major currencies in the world. Inflation is getting higher and people are looking for alternative solutions for transferring money, and also as payment solutions.”\n\nCT: You provide mining opportunities on your platform as well. How does this work?\n\nTS: Well, at the moment we collaborate with Bitclub Network, where anyone who is interested in purchasing mining contracts can invest in them. So far, they have offered best service for our investors. We have been approached by quite a few miners also for partnerships because of the huge membership we have around the globe. We might consider owning our own mining platform where members will be given profit share, but it all depends on how difficult the mining process, setup and cost may factor in. I can say we are more focused in a partnership with a successful mining company at the moment. Investors in Malaysia love to invest in mining pools.\n\nCT: Do you offer educational resources to teach Malaysians about bitcoin?\n\nTS: I am corporate trainer in a finance module and have my own corporate training company before I started CoinBit. So this makes it easy to start sharing new topics among my training participants. We plan to have weekly meetups in every major city in the region to share about bitcoin knowledge and opportunity for them with CoinBit. We even plan to open a branch in Cambodia soon.\n\nCT: Would you agree Bitcoin is the future of remittance in your region?\n\nTS: Bitcoin will certainly become a big hit here in Malaysia, especially now where our Ringgit is losing its value against other major currencies in the world. Inflation is getting higher and people are looking for alternative solutions for transferring money, and also as payment solutions."", 'Bitcoin wallet hardware maker Ledger and bitcoin exchange Paymium are among the 36 fintech startups backing France FinTech, a new trade group that has garnered support from the French government.\n\nThe group, which formally launched on 11th June, seeks to facilitate connections between the country\'s fintech startups and act as a collective voice when communicating with regulators, investors and parties both domestic and abroad.\n\nEric Larchevêque, CEO of Ledger, framed his startup\'s involvement by saying that the overall goal is to be a part of conversation as French regulators look to establish oversight of the country\'s financial technology sector, including its bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n""We\'ll be very active on all bitcoin related subjects for the association, and will make sure the crypto voice will be heard,"" he said.\n\nPaymium co-founder Gonzague Grandval told CoinDesk that the group\'s creation ""is a sign that FinTech startups are very active in France"".\n\nOther companies in the organization offer products and services focused on digital payments, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding and financial management.\n\nConcept of teamwork image via Shutterstock']"

That deal called for him to be paid up to $240,000.\n\nThe firm has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nForce also invested in a company that brokered Bitcoin and served as its chief compliance officer while still with the DEA.\n\nDuring his time with the company, Force used his position to seize $300,000 from a customer and transfer it to his private account, authorities said.\n\n\'Stellar career\'\n\nUS district judge Richard Seeborg accepted Force\'s guilty plea on Wednesday and scheduled his sentencing for October.\n\nSpeaking outside court, Force\'s lawyer Ivan Bates said: ""He had a stellar, 15-year career with the DEA except for this one blip."" Inside the court, Bates said his client suffered from anxiety and depression.\n\nSilk Road operated for more than two years until it was shut down in October 2013, generating more than $214m in sales of drugs and other illicit goods using Bitcoin, prosecutors said.\n\nUlbricht was himself sentenced in May after a federal jury in Manhattan found him guilty of several charges, including distributing drugs using the internet.\n\nPlea agreement\n\nProsecutors have also reached a plea agreement with Shaun Bridges, a former Secret Service agent who was charged along with Force in March with stealing Bitcoin during the investigation. He is scheduled to enter his plea in August.\n\nA lawyer for Ulbricht has said those charges removed ""any question about the corruption that pervaded the investigation of Silk Road"".\n\nForce and Bridges belonged to the same Baltimore-based federal task force that investigated Silk Road.', 'Photo\n\nIf you wanted to create an entirely new world, like that in “Star Wars,” or in Neal Stephenson’s “Cryptonomicon,” you would certainly need an entirely new form of money. As Nathaniel Popper points out in his new book, “Digital Gold,” which tracks the roller-coaster ride of the digital currency called Bitcoin, it’s not surprising that part of its appeal to its devotees is that it could enable the creation of that new world, a libertarian utopia. Bitcoins — which are created, or mined, via complex computer algorithms, and are stored in digital wallets — offer privacy: Although every transaction is recorded, the users are identified only by wallet IDs, which are difficult, if not impossible, to track back to their owners. Theoretically, Bitcoins also allow users to avoid any fees or meddling by a middleman like a bank, because buyers and sellers can deal directly with one another. At its grandest, Bitcoin promises freedom from the clunkiness of cash, from the dominance of central banks and from technology that allows us to be tracked, even by our own governments. On a more prosaic level, why shouldn’t money be as vulnerable to technological disruption as, say, music?\n\nPopper tells his story through a global cast of characters — technologists, altruists, evangelists, crooks and money men — who are every bit as memorable as Han Solo. There is the enigmatic, mysterious figure calling himself Satoshi, who in 2008 wrote what came to be known as the “Bitcoin White Paper,” which provided the basis of the code that created Bitcoins. “I’ve moved on to other things and probably won’t be around in the future,” Satoshi writes just as his invention is becoming more widely adopted, and while Popper never figures out who Satoshi actually is, he does, toward the end of his book, come to what seems to be a decent guess. (In a subsequent article, Popper has elaborated on what he calls “one of the great mysteries of the digital age.” He writes that there’s a “quiet but widely held belief” that Satoshi is one Nick Szabo, a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent who has played a critical role in Bitcoin’s development, but who denies that he is actually Satoshi.)\n\nOne of the early adopters of Satoshi’s invention was a man named Hal Finney, who was, Popper writes, “particularly drawn to Satoshi’s claims that users could own and trade Bitcoins without providing identifying information to any central authorities.” The late Finney, who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, and used his early stash of Bitcoins to pay for home care as his illness intensified, was a true and pure believer, as is the entrepreneur Roger Ver, who described Bitcoins as “the most important invention since the Internet itself. The world is changing because of Bitcoin right in front of our eyes.”\n\nBut Popper uses his characters to show the diverse set of intentions and motivations among Bitcoin’s promoters. He \xadintroduces us to the Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares, who sees in Bitcoin a way to fix the woes his own country has experienced with a currency its citizens can’t trust. It’s Casares who helps get money men into Bitcoin — including Pete Briger, who runs the Fortress Investment Group — and they have their own reasons for buying in. “Pete’s job as an investor in distressed companies made him good at spotting broken systems, and the more he thought about it, the more broken the current methods of moving money around the world seemed to him,” Popper writes.', 'London-based bitcoin exchange Coinfloor has launched Coinfloor Market, a broker-based peer-to-peer marketplace, which will enable consumers to buy bitcoin from professional brokers.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Coinfloor CEO Mark Lamb said the new marketplace is designed to provide a more consumer-friendly and personal bitcoin buying experience.\n\nBitcoin brokers, he noted, have to undergo a due diligence verification process, which will be refined over time.\n\nLamb added:\n\n""We meet all brokers in person, we get to know them and understand their business and make sure that they are operating to the same standards that Coinfloor has been operating to since launch.""\n\n""The important thing is that they are vetted professionals, they are not amateurs,"" he said, adding that some of the brokers have been trading with Coinfloor for a long time.\n\nHow it works\n\nNew users register with an email address and password, then are given the option to choose their preferred bitcoin broker.\n\nOnce the email address provided has been confirmed, consumers are asked to set up two-factor authentication. Following this, Coinfloor requests users to upload valid photo ID and proof of residence.\n\nTo buy bitcoin, registered users must transfer the desired amount in GBP to their chosen broker\'s bank account, with a minimum deposit of £20.\n\nOnce the money has been transferred, bitcoins are sourced directly from Coinfloor\'s exchange and held in escrow until the broker confirms the receipt of funds.\n\nBitcoin broker Peter Wood, known as y3peto in Coinfloor Market, said in a statement: ""My customers want a fair price, a secure transaction and a safe place to store their bitcoins. Coinfloor Market provides that ... It gives me the well deserved recognition for my work as a bitcoin broker in the UK.""\n\nThe launch follows Coinfloor\'s partnership with Estonian Bank LHV in March, which enabled the bitcoin exchange to handle user deposits.\n\nBroker image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Hoffman co-founded professional social network LinkedIn (LKND) and was an early investor in Facebook (FB) when it was only worth $5 million.\n\nIt’s not surprising that he’s looking for ways to add social networking to the venture capital world. Greylock Partners, the firm where Hoffman is an investment partner, recently launched a series of networking events called Communities to scale professional networking in Silicon Valley.\n\nWe sat down with Hoffman to talk about Silicon Valley’s growth explosion, unicorns, the state of valuations and a sector he’s particularly focused on, bitcoin.\n\n(This interview was edited for length and clarity)\n\nQ: Is the scale that Silicon Valley has achieved, with the massive amount of companies being built, good for the ecosystem overall?\n\nHoffman: Unequivocally yes. It’s not to say that there isn’t a bunch of noise, like an app launching for counting Tiddlywinks or something. That always happens when the breadth of things gets larger. But the number of legitimate globally transforming companies that we are creating at this tempo is basically unmatched in history. If you look globally, the only place that where that is also happening is China.\n\nIt would still be good if Silicon Valley were twice as big or three times as big. One could have a thesis to say, ‘Well, actually there’s only a limited amount of game changing ideas, so the noise is growing massively more than interesting ideas.’\n\nBut that actually gets back to kind of my view of unicorns [private companies valued at more than $1 billion], which is if there is a herd of unicorns then it’s not a unicorn. The whole idea of unicorns is having one.\n\nQ: Do we need to a new name for these $1 billion plus tech companies other than unicorns?\n\nA: I think that part of it is that we’ve built up expertise about how to build massively transforming companies and it’s actually not accidental. It’s a strong and healthy byproduct of the network in Silicon Valley, and that’s actually a really good thing. It does creates tension and wealth inequality and those are legitimate things that need to be paid attention to and worked on. But it creates a vast amount of prosperity overall in Silicon Valley.\n\nIt also creates transformative systems in the world. Airbnb is the way the world should be. The world should exist that way, and that’s a great thing. And creating more of those is actually in fact not just good for us, but good for everybody.\n\nQ: Are we in unicorn overload?\n\nA: The question also is are there frothy valuations. The thing that people under attribute in the networked age we have many more customers, and the ability to grow, the ability to make a startling business is happening very quickly. The combination of those things make the fast growing companies really interesting right now. And that sets a bar for how valuations are constructed, and what ends up happening is that you get a lot of investments at high valuations, so it looks frothy. But only some of those companies will be massively disrupting, and will be industry creating and transforming.\n\nWhat you have to be careful of is treating non-industry transforming companies like they are disruptive and valuing them like they are. When investors are exuberant and happy, undoubtedly some of those rounds start happening.\n\nQ: How do you maintain investing discipline in the current venture capital environment?\n\nA: We have a promise to ourselves, to our LPs [those who give Greylock to invest], to our entrepreneurs, that we select the projects, the entrepreneurs that have the chance of being an industry-defining company — a company that lasts for decades, hopefully centuries. We all have to collectively work towards that. And sometimes it doesn’t work. It’s a venture bet.\n\nBut to do that, because the system has grown, you have to be discriminatory. To have to be selective. You have to say, “Look, it has to be a really interesting project, a great entrepreneur, the right kind of timing this will work.” Even though you add things to a company like network effects, communities, and talent to help companies, you also need to have a venture partner who really partners with an entrepreneur and a CEO and says, look, “I am personally working with you on that.” And you can only do a couple of those deals a year. So you have to be very selective to which are the ones that will have the possibility of doing a massive transformation in the world. And while you want the social transformation, we’re also in the business of creating great businesses, too.\n\nQ: Is there one top of mind that comes to you that you’ve done recently that fits that description?\n\nA: Well, the last deal that I’ve done I think fits is still under stealth.\n\nQ: Okay, what about one that is public?\n\nA: Xapo [Xapo is a Greylock-backed company that has created a digital wallet for bitcoin]. My theory of why bitcoin is interesting is that there will almost certainly be in 10 years there will be one or more global crypto currencies that will either be bitcoin or bitcoin-derived.\n\nBased on that theory, I did two investments. One from Greylock because that Xapo is a standard business built on bitcoin.\n\nAnd then the other one is a technology layer, called Blockstream [Blockstream is creating technology to extend bitcoin’s functionality into things like stock trades or contracts]. I did this one personally through my foundation to essentially to say, “let’s make bitcoin be possible.”\n\nNow, is bitcoin going to be great or not? I don’t know. I think the least interesting question about bitcoin is the current price. The most interesting thing about bitcoin is that it’s an open platform the way the Internets are an open platform, but for financial systems.', 'Breach Response , Data Breach , Fraud\n\nBitcoin Exchange Hacked With Word Macro\n\n$5 Million Bitstamp Breach Detailed in Unconfirmed Report\n\nMemo to organizations: Do not allow PCs that run software such as Skype and Microsoft Office to connect to a server that hosts your bitcoin wallet.\n\nSee Also: Ransomware: The Look at Future Trends\n\nThat\'s one takeaway from a breach report apparently prepared for Bitstamp, a European bitcoin exchange - the company is officially registered in the United Kingdom - that suffered a Jan. 4 breach. The breach resulted in the theft of 18,977 bitcoins, which at the time were worth 4.4 million euros, or $5.3 million (see Bitstamp Back Online After Breach).\n\nBitstamp did not immediately respond to a request to verify the authenticity of the apparently leaked breach report, dated Feb. 20, which is now circulating online. The report, which is attributed to Bitstamp general counsel George Frost, says that it includes information gathered by digital forensics investigations firm Stroz Friedberg, plus information shared by the U.S. Secret Service and FBI, as well as the ""U.K.\'s cybercrime unit,"" which likely means either the National Crime Agency or the City of London Police, which runs the country\'s largest police fraud squad.\n\n""This is an active investigation,"" the February report says. ""We believe we have identified at least one of the hackers and are baiting a \'honey trap\' to lure him into the U.K. in order to make an arrest. Moreover, we need to be very careful not to educate other criminal hackers about how we safeguard our assets and information."" To date, however, U.K. police agencies have not announced any related arrests.\n\nA copy of the purported Bitstamp report was first posted July 1 to Reddit by a single-purpose account. It was later added to a dedicated Bitstamp Incident Report site hosted by WordPress.\n\nThe report says that Bitstamp was compromised by a phishing attack that targeted six different employees. ""All of the phishing messages were highly tailored to the victim, and showed a significant degree of background knowledge on the part of the attacker,"" the report says. And the attacks continued until the attacker successfully compromised a systems administrator\'s PC with malware. Crucially, that sysadm had access credentials for Bitstamp\'s Internet-connected bitcoin repository, or what\'s known as a ""hot wallet.""\n\nTargeted Phishing Attack\n\nThe attack began with a phishing message, dated Nov. 4, which purported to offer Bitstamp CTO Damian Merlak free tickets to a punk-rock festival, the report says. ""Merlak was contacted by Skype account punk.rock.holiday. ... The gambit for this phishing attack was to offer Mr. Merlak free tickets to Punk Rock Holiday 2015. (Merlak is keen on punk rock and has played in a band.)""\n\nThe attacker then sent Merlak a ""participant form"" named ""Punk Rock Holiday 2015 TICKET Form1.doc"" which included a malicious script written in the Visual Basic for Applications - or VBA - programming language, the report says. When the document was opened in Microsoft Word, the script was designed to execute, and pull a malicious file down to the PC from an external IP address. But the report says that there was no indication that this script ever executed.\n\nThe attacker, however, continued to demonstrate ""persistent effort,"" the report says. ""Over a period of approximately five weeks, four more Bitstamp employees received similar highly targeted phishing attacks, each tailored to individual interests."" For one of those attacks, the hacker posed as a journalist, and in another, a headhunter.\n\nNone of those attacks appeared to result in stolen bitcoins, the report notes, in part because none of the targets had access to crucial credentials. But on Dec. 9, systems administrator Luka Kodric - who had access to Bitstamp\'s hot wallet - received a phishing email to his Gmail account that was spoofed to appear as if it had come from an employee at the Association for Computing Machinery, even though it arrived via the Tor anonymizing network, the report says. Via follow-up discussions over Skype, the supposed ACM employee told Kodric that the association wanted to add him to its international honor society, and sent him an application form, which the report says he opened on Dec. 11, thus compromising his PC. By late December, the attacker appeared to have installed a remote-access Trojan on Kodric\'s system, accessed Bitstamp\'s hot wallet, and copied the bitcoin wallet file and passphrase, both of which would have given the attacker direct access to the stored bitcoins.\n\n""On 4 January, the attacker drained the Bitstamp wallet, as evidenced on the blockchain,"" the report says, referring to the public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. ""Although the maximum content of this wallet was 5,000 bitcoins at any one time, the attacker was able to steal over 18,000 bitcoins throughout the day as further deposits were made by customers.""\n\nWhy Hackers Like Social Engineering\n\nIf the report is true, Bitstamp is hardly the first organization that was socially engineered - tricked - in part by attackers who used email or Skype (see Syrian Rebels Hacked Via Skype).\n\nBut security experts say this hack attack demonstrates the importance of locking down any system that stores sensitive or valuable information, in the event that employees do get tricked. ""The hardest problem in computer security is not putting server credentials on the machine you use to check email,"" cryptographer Matthew Green, a professor at John Hopkins University, says via Twitter.\n\nThe attack also shows how hackers need not bother with advanced attacks, when simple ones will suffice. Indeed, as highlighted on Twitter by the operational security expert known as the Grugq, this concerted phishing campaign, backed by relatively simple malicious macro code, netted one or more attackers millions of dollars. But the Grugq notes that the attack might have been blocked, had Bitstamp protected its servers using two-factor authentication, and ensured that no system that ran email or VoIP software such as Skype could connect to one of the exchange\'s hot wallets.\n\nComputer security is such an unsolved problem that Bitstamp lost $5m because someone had macros enabled in Microsoft Word. ï¿½ the grugq (@thegrugq) July 2, 2015\n\nLessons Learned\n\nAfter the bitcoin theft, the incident report notes that unlike other hacked exchanges such as Mt. Gox, Bitstamp was saved from going under in part because it stored so many of its bitcoins offline, in cold wallets (see Second Bitcoin Exchange Halts Operations).\n\nIn the wake of the breach, the incident report notes that Bitstamp quickly hired a forensics investigation team, commissioned a security review, and opted to rebuild the exchange from the ground up. ""We have paid out approximately $250,000 to programmers hired to rebuild and improve our platform; paid approximately $250,000 (and counting) to the Stroz Friedberg team; and at least $150,000 more for various security reviews, and legal and financial advice,"" the report says. ""These out of pocket costs are continuing to accrue.""\n\nJust six weeks after the bitcoins were stolen, the company had already made a number of security-related changes, the report says. Those included numerous ""obvious"" fixes such as implementing email and Internet screening software from FireEye, requiring multi-factor authentication to access Bitstamp\'s hot wallet, ensuring that ""any manager\'s laptop with access to bitcoin deposits or sensitive customer information is highly restricted, and \'single purpose,\' i.e. it does not also have capabilities to receive email, engage in Skype calls, or cruise the Internet."" The report adds that the firm also planned to acquire insurance for all bitcoin payments, and was working with a technology company called Xapo to better secure its cold wallets by splitting the wallets\' addresses into multiple pieces and storing them at a number of secret locations around the world.', ""It has the potential to disrupt the financial services industry — changing how we trade financial securities, eliminating the delays and wire fees that accompany international payments, opening bank records to the easy scrutiny of regulators and the public, advocates say.\n\nIt could ensure transparent and fair elections in the developing world.\n\nIt could even help certain Central American countries, where reliable records are rare, track things like land ownership.\n\nWhat is this technology?\n\nIt’s called the blockchain, and it’s the digital ledger that forms the backbone of bitcoin.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled about the blockchain’s potential for disruption. But the technology — which first emerged in 2009 — is still in its infancy, and there are some key obstacles that engineers must overcome before it can be used on a larger scale.\n\nWhat is the blockchain?\n\nGetty Images This isn't a bitcoin!\n\nYou can’t reach out and touch a bitcoin. It doesn’t exist in the physical world.\n\nA bitcoin is just a piece of data stored on the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain differs from conventional databases in a few important ways. Instead of storing data in one central location, it distributes it among a network of users running the bitcoin software. A complete history of every bitcoin transaction is stored on the blockchain, and all of these recorded transactions are open to public scrutiny.\n\nBefore a bitcoin transaction is approved and processed by the network, it is verified using a cryptographic algorithm that checks the transaction against the histories stored on every computer in the network. This process is complex, but it has one big advantage: it makes the blockchain very difficult to hack, advocates say.\n\nEstablished companies are interested in the blockchain because it can clear transactions almost instantly and eliminate intermediaries from financial transactions, while offering both parties a high degree of transparency and security.\n\nSome enthusiasts envision a world in which versions of the blockchain — or some other blockchain-inspired protocol, but built on a unique foundation — will become the universal protocol that underpins our entire financial system.\n\nCryptobonds\n\nOverstock.com OVER, +30.76% a large U.S. e-commerce company based in Salt Lake City, is already testing the technology’s limits. The retailer has built its own trading system on top of the blockchain, and early in June announced that it intends to offer $25 million in so-called cryptobonds that will trade on the platform.\n\nThe experiment is part of the company’s larger exploration into the innovative potential of cryptocurrency, which its CEO, Patrick Byrne, calls “Medici.” So far, Byrne is the only investor in the bonds. But the company says it anticipates announcing more buyers in the near future.\n\nThe trading platform, a company representative says, offers same-day settlement for trades — a process that typically takes three days, using conventional market infrastructure.\n\n“Those functions can be accomplished more easily, far more extensively, and with far less risk of corruption through the world of crypto technologies that are emerging,” Byrne said.\n\nInternational Payments\n\nRipple Labs, the creator of the Ripple payments protocol, has built a platform that is similar to — and, its creators say, inspired by — the blockchain.\n\nRipple’s platform essentially provides a link between corporations that need to make international payments with investment banks and trading firms who are willing to put up the foreign currencies required to make those payments.\n\nThe system will save companies money on expenses like wire fees, interest payments and the opportunity cost of tying up capital in foreign bank accounts, says Patrick Griffin, an executive vice president at Ripple Labs. The institutions providing the capital will profit by charging a spread.\n\n”Big corporates are floating cash and opening credit lines all over the world to meet their payment requirements,” Griffin said. “[Ripple] gives them an opportunity to repatriate all of that cash flow, and outsource it to a trading firm or an investment bank that has a lower cost of capital and could put up that cash.”\n\nThe company recently raised a $28 million venture round from a group of large investors, including the CME Group, which operates the Chicago Board of Trade — one of the world’s largest exchanges for financial derivatives.\n\nSensitive data\n\nEris Industries, another startup, is building its own unique platform that is distinct from bitcoin but, like Ripple, has similar characteristics.\n\nOne key difference is that databases built using Eris’s platform can limit how many people view the data stored within its database.\n\nPreston Byrne, one of the company’s co-founders and its chief of operations (no relation to Patrick Byrne), calls the Eris database a “permissioned” blockchain.\n\nThe company’s database would be ideal for applications that involve the storage of sensitive, personal information — like health-care records, for example.\n\nThe higher degree of control allowed by Eris’s protocol makes it better-suited to corporations’ purposes, Preston Byrne said.\n\nAt least one startup, Everledger, is using Eris’s system to build an application that tracks the provenance of luxury goods. The company just graduated from a three-month accelerator program at Barclays PLC BARC, -1.41% in London.\n\nEverledger can build on Eris’s platform because it is open source. But how will companies like Eris and Ripple earn a profit?\n\nByrne said the company sees an opportunity to profit by acting like a consultant, providing guidance to clients who are trying to build their own systems on top of its platform.\n\n“We’re giving away the handle for free, but we’re selling the razor,” Byrne said.\n\nMoving beyond\n\nSince the technology first emerged, an international community of programmers has been constantly revising and improving the blockchain’s code. The 10th iteration of the blockchain was released in February. Since 2009, nearly all the original code has been rewritten.\n\nAnd Overstock isn’t the only established company exploring how the blockchain will fit into its business. Nasdaq OMX Group NDAQ, -0.46% said in May that it is exploring how it could incorporate the blockchain into its market for private shares.\n\n“People understand that the technology needed to mature,” said David Johnston, chairman of the Factom Foundation, another startup building its own blockchain-inspired protocol. “Blockchain 1.0 was all the payments stuff — now we’re moving beyond that.”\n\nObstacles\n\nLarge databases can require a massive amount of computing power to function efficiently. Typically, that power comes from a collection of servers stored in a warehouse somewhere.\n\nIn contrast, the blockchain is powered jointly by every computer running the software — and, most critically, by so-called bitcoin miners, who use powerful computers to solve complex cryptographic puzzles and unlock new caches of bitcoins. These caches are known as “blocks.” Hence, the term blockchain.\n\nThis decentralization of data — one of the aspects that enthusiasts find most exciting about the technology — is also a major vulnerability.\n\n“The biggest obstacle is scalability,” said Ripple’s Griffin.\n\nWhile the blockchain can theoretically handle up to seven transactions a second, in reality, that number is closer to three or four, said Jonathan Mohan, who works with BitcoinNYC, a networking group for bitcoin professionals.\n\nVisa’s payment processing system, known as VisaNet, can handle more than 56,000 transactions per second, according to a company spokesman.\n\nA representative from Overstock.com says the company is working on ways to improve its platform’s capacity for processing transactions. But as of now, the technology is better suited for small, private offerings, a company representative said.\n\nSo supplanting the New York Stock Exchange is still a long way off."", 'CoinTelegraph tapped into the experience of several startup founders to get an idea of things aspiring entrepreneurs should avoid when starting their own business in the cryptocurrency industry, which for many is still uncharted territory.\n\nBefore big banks began taking a serious look at Bitcoin, some visionaries realized the potential of this new technology early in the game. Many have since started their own companies, such as CoinBase or BitPay, while others’ ventures fizzled out or fell victim to “wild west” conditions of this volatile space.\n\nSo what are the most common mistakes that Bitcoin entrepreneurs make? In a follow-up to the 5 must do’s for any Bitcoin business, below are five things crypto startups should avoid to boost their chances of success in the new industry.\n\n1. Don’t Push Your Product If It Isn’t Ready\n\nThis may seem like common sense, but far too many startups have made the mistake of promoting a product that’s not ready for market, or worse — one that’s not even operational.\n\nDoes your product work? If so, it will not only demonstrate to customers and potential investors that you are for real, but will also facilitate trust, and provide you with feedback that can be used for further improvement.\n\nSimon Dixon, the CEO of BnkToTheFuture, an online investment platform that recently passed the $10 million invested mark for blockchain startups, explained to CoinTelegraph:\n\n""We love to invest in Blockchain businesses where we can play with the technology already. We like to see how customers are using it and what they are saying about it.”\n\nWithout a tangible product, your idea might still attract believers and even lead to a successful crowdfunding campaign. However, not every company is Ethereum, which has been criticized as “vaporware” by some. And while it’s true that software needs time to be developed, tested and honed, a ready-made solution will undoubtedly be much more attractive for users and investors alike.\n\n“I think currently the climate is very untrusting and so I would advise not to say much before you have something real and tangible in hand,” adds Dor Konforty, CEO of Synereo, a fully decentralized social platform. “It\'s less about ‘ready for market’ than it is ‘working technology.’""\n\n2. Don’t Pitch Ideas to Investors\n\nThe invention of Bitcoin opened the door to a whole array of new possibilities around blockchain technology. Hundreds, if not thousands, of novel ideas have sprung up in the minds of ambitious entrepreneurs, from new payment methods to literally going to the moon and beyond by using the blockchain for space exploration.\n\nDixon says:\n\n“Blockchain ideas are normally funded by the founders. Launched products with customers and a team behind them are funded by investors.”\n\nIn other words, ideas are a dime a dozen. Thus, investors are attracted not to just promising ideas, but preferably a launched product that has already established a customer base, along with a team to support further development.\n\nThis is because investors are averse to risk. A brand with a ready-made product, an experienced team behind it, along with a clear vision already has a greater chance to succeed than an idea that hasn’t yet materialized, no matter how good it may sound or how glossy that PowerPoint presentation may be.\n\n“Clearly articulate the real-world problem your startup is solving and quantify the value,” adds Ribbit.me CEO, Gregory Simon.\n\nDoes your product address a real-life problem? How big is the profit potential of the solution? These are all crucial things to address before making that pitch to potential investors.\n\n3. Don’t Use ‘the Blockchain’ (If You Don’t Have To)\n\n“Is using the blockchain for the problem you\'re trying to solve really the way to go?” asks Konforty. He continues:\n\n“Too many crypto projects see the blockchain as the ultimate solution to all problems, not bothering to explore the issue they\'re trying to solve deeply to see whether what the blockchain provides is relevant at all.”\n\nIndeed, many firms, particularly in traditional finance, have jumped aboard the bandwagon using the “blockchain” as a buzzword, while divorcing it from Bitcoin, to create an image of a tech-savvy and forward thinking company.\n\n“It becomes a sort of ‘me too!’ situation where people want to have a blockchain-related product, rather than to overcome a pain using novel means,” adds Konforty.\n\nSo ask yourself, is your product reliant on a blockchain to function? Can you use it for transactions, record keeping, as a data layer or for some other application? If not, then it might be best to go the old-fashioned route in order to avoid disappointing your customers and investors.\n\n4. Don’t Be Anonymous\n\nAnonymity is great if you are a user who values privacy. However, executives whose company’s success depends on reputation must not only be visible, but they must be real people who interact with their customers and business partners.\n\nOne telltale sign of a scam, still all too prevalent in the cryptocurrency industry, is a company without an ‘Our Team’ page, with no photos of its members on its website. Even though some fraudsters are brazen enough to flaunt their online gravitas, most criminals would prefer to keep their identities secret and run off with the cash before the dust settles.\n\n“Transparency is vital for the future success of a company and an important part of this is trust,” said Ronny Boesing, CEO of CCEDK. “It’s the human factor that is vital for success, which is impossible with anonymity.”\n\nHaving a transparent team that customers know is real people will instill greater confidence in your product and company as a whole.\n\n5. Don’t Keep All Your Eggs in One Basket\n\nIf you are finally seeing an influx of funds — from crowdfunding, investors, sales, etc. — your next move will be to ensure that these funds are secure. Incidents such as the Mt. Gox heist have taught us that digital currency stored in a single place is not only a welcoming sign for hackers, but also for the authorities to confiscate your funds, if they deem your actions illegal.\n\n“It’s getting better than it was a few years ago, but unfortunately, if your startup is remotely related to Bitcoin or blockchain technology, be prepared to have bank accounts shut down with little to no notice,” explains Gregory Simon. “It’s not that banks hate Bitcoin — it’s just the regulatory uncertainty and the bitcoin counterparty risk uncertainty leading these decisions.” He concludes:\n\n“It’s a good idea to have multiple bank accounts set up just in case.”\n\nMultiple wallets, cold storage, multisig, escrow accounts, and other security measures would all help to ensure that your money is stored safely. Because what could be worse than successfully raising funds, only to lose them all because of something that could have been prevented?\n\nAre you an entrepreneur, or are you thinking about starting a company in the crypto space? Please share your own experiences, suggestions and comments in the section below, which may be used for similar articles in the future.\n\nNote: This is the first part of a multiple part series on ‘Do’s and Don’ts for Bitcoin Businesses.’ Be sure to look out for part two with more tips coming soon.', 'Can Bitcoin-based Enigma encryption succeed where HE has failed?\n\nSolving the question of \'can you get sorted sales reports from SalesForce.com without SalesForce.com being able to see your data because it\'s encrypted?\' or \'can I search through my Outlook.com mailbox if Microsoft cannot see the actual contents because it\'s encrypted?\' is something that has been bugging people for ages.\n\nThe answer is not an easy one, but most people agree that it comes in the shape of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) or at least something that looks very much like it. HE means that an untrusted party (SalesForce.com or Microsoft in the above examples) would be able to perform the computational acts upon the encrypted data, and provide an encrypted result, without ever having your keys and with only you being able to decrypt that resulting data. That\'s why HE is seen as something of a Holy Grail in this age where Big Data and the Cloud are the buzzwords of the day.\n\nThe trouble with HE, or at least one of the troubles with HE, is that to get it to work at all takes a lot of computational power and even then it\'s slower than a pig swimming through treacle wearing flippers. How slow is that? Well the first HE breakthrough by IBM back in 2009 took about a trillion times longer to do a Google search than doing a Google search did without HE encryption being involved; in the years since that has improved so it now only takes a million times longer...\n\nBut what if you could get that speed loss down to just 100 times slower, and eventually down to a factor of just 10? That\'s what the inventors of a new prototype encryption method, similar to HE but not actually HE, called \'Enigma\' for now and actually a form of secure multi-party computation which aims to achieve the same thing as HE, have created. It\'s new because it thinks around the edges of the box, if not actually outside it; and the box has a great big label on which says Bitcoin.\n\nYou see Enigma is the brainchild of a couple of Bitcoin entrepreneurs who, together with a MIT Media Lab researcher, have used features from the decentralized Bitcoin network architecture including an external blockchain to create what they reckon will be the ultimate peer-to-peer network for storing and running computations on data whilst keeping it completely private at the same time. The white paper announcing the technology, Enigma: Decentralized Computation Platform with Guaranteed Privacy, http://enigma.media.mit.edu/enigma_full.pdf has an abstract which reads:\n\n""Enigma\'s computational model is based on a highly optimised version of secure multi-party computation, guaranteed by a verifiable secret-sharing scheme. For storage, we use a modified distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared data. An external blockchain is utilised as the controller of the network manages access control, identities and serves as a tamper-proof log of events. Security deposits and fees incentivise operation, correctness and fairness of the system. Similar to Bitcoin, Enigma removes the need for a trusted third party, enabling autonomous control of personal data. For the first time, users are able to share their data with cryptographic guarantees regarding their privacy.""\n\nFor readers of a technical bent, I recommend you go and read that paper as it\'s only 12 pages long and it really is a thought-provoking thing of nerdlike beauty. For everyone else, here\'s the ‘dumbed down as much as I can\' bit: Enigma will break your data up into tiny chunks and then randomly distributes meaningless bits of those to nodes in the network where the calculations are performed on each discrete lump before being returned to the user where they are put back together to form an unencrypted whole again. Obviously there is some maths involved to enable each node to do whatever computational task is required on just that miniature piece of data. Equally obviously, the more nodes there are the quicker the computing is and, importantly, the more secure this thing is as the pieces will be smaller. The Bitcoin blockchain keeps track of who has what and where by way of a metadata store, unforgeable courtesy of being copied to thousands of computers.\n\nAmichai Shulman, CTO of Imperva told SCMagazineUK.com that the breakthrough here compared to existing research is ""that presumably by distributing computation to various parties we can use improved methods that reduce the overall cost of the computations involved in this scheme. So far the cost of HE has been prohibitive and it never went beyond simple mathematical functions.""\n\nWhile not wishing to make prediction about success, Shulman does agree that it\'s an interesting new way of achieving HE, even if it\'s not actually HE itself. ""We do need to remember though that we are still speaking about simple computations rather than full blown applications"" Shulman added, continuing ""and, much like Bitcoin, most processing power will be controlled by a few large entities which can either bias results or actually get a peek into the data.""\n\nI\'m not so convinced about that latter point, especially given that the creators of Enigma do seem to have given a lot of thought about the whole 51 percent attack problem. This is where, in Bitcoin, there is the potential for a majority of nodes to work together and get to the tipping point of 51 percent where they can then take over the blockchain and start ripping off the users. The fact that this has never happened would suggest it\'s not as easy as it sounds, and Enigma has been designed to make it even harder by way of requiring a security deposit. In effect every node that joins has to pay a bitcoin deposit to join the network, and any that is found to be dishonest would forfeit that deposit which would then be distributed between the other nodes by way of a disincentive.\n\nGavin Reid, VP of threat intelligence at Lancope speaking to SCMagazineUK.com is still to be convinced though, warning that there are several concerns to consider, not least that typically the cryptography itself is not usually the weakness but rather the practical implementation of that crypto. ""Think of the huge amount of theft centred around Bitcoin implementation issues or vulnerabilities, like the transaction malleability issue"" Reid continued, and remember that Enigma is loosely based around Bitcoin architectures and technologies.\n\n""All of the other typical attacks will also come into play and have to be dealt with."" Reid also reminds us ""DDoS of nodes seems to be a potential weakness with the smaller numbers."" If anything will stop this from being the big breakthrough in encryption technology moving forward though, Reid reckons, it\'s likely to be a matter of trust. ""If the early implementations are broken"" he says ""then people will quickly lose trust in its abilities to protect them."" With securing potentially high-risk data being the focus, any security issues will be magnified and quickly erode consumer confidence and thus adoption. ""Just like the money incentive with Bitcoin"" Reid concludes ""hackers will have a data incentive to attack Enigma.""\n\nSally Annereau, senior data protection advisor at law firm Taylor Wessing is equally unsure whether Enigma will meet the Holy Grail expectations that Homomorphic Encryption and its ilk has promised with regards to securing the integrity and confidentiality of managed data processing. ""There are signs of exciting progress towards that goal although scalability appears to remain a big challenge given the sheer complexity of computations required on the encrypted data"" she told SCMagazineUK.com\n\n""It remains to be seen if they can evolve into enterprise-ready solutions that can be transposed, for example to commercial cloud hosting services or secured big data analysis across health services"". She does, however, think that the signs are very positive and that effective homomorphic encryption or similar tools would be essential in facilitating compliance with data protection requirements, particularly around data security and ensuring an adequate level of protection for global personal data transfers. That said, organisations will need to be careful of leaping to embrace any technology that potentially promises so much before there is a full and proper understanding of the strengths and potential vulnerabilities of the solutions. ""We will all need to do more than simply kicking the tyres of the technology before taking it for a spin"" she warns.', 'People who live in Spain will now have a new option to buy bitcoins locally, with ease.\n\nA service called Coinay has been launched in 3,000 Spanish stores allowing people to go and spend cash for bitcoins, without all the fuss.\n\nIn essence, the buyer purchases a voucher and then redeems the voucher for bitcoins. As with any product, consumers will still need a reason to buy it. Consumers buy other vouchers because they have a need of them, such as a Facebook credit voucher or a prepaid debit card.\n\n“With Coinay, we can enable customers to buy easily bitcoins in retail locations all over Spain. Using vouchers makes buying bitcoin fast, easy and convenient for customers,” said Paolo Premoli, Head of Sales South Europe, in a press release.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin ATM Company SatoshiPoint Gains Angel Investors and Plans for Expansion\n\nThe vouchers can be bought in amounts of 10 Euros to 100 Euros. Unfortunately for those that want to make bigger purchases, the most a single customer can currently buy at this time is 100 Euros. It is unclear whether the same customer would be allowed to go to other stores and buy bitcoins or not, but it would seem that the company would want to sell more, not less, bitcoins.\n\nIn any case, such services take much of the complication out of buying bitcoins. The user simply has to buy the voucher and enter a wallet address, and they receive their money. This could be considered an improvement over the previous learning curve a user would have to go through to understand Bitcoin acquisition. Trading and even buying bitcoins online can be very complicated processes.\n\nCoinay isn’t stuck on Spain, though. They want to take their mission to other parts of Europe, and even to Africa and Latin America later on so that they can sell bitcoins worldwide, instead of just in Spain. Spain will make a rather good test case, as some say it will follow in the footsteps of Greece, depending on how things go in Greece.\n\nImages from Pixabay and Coinay.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin entrepreneurs are predictably quick to puff up the virtual currency’s benefits – zero-to-low transaction costs, no chargebacks and the freedom to send and receive money anywhere in the world without a third party, to name a few. They typically aren’t as eager, however, to draw attention to the risks of doing business in Bitcoin, and, just like starting up around any other embryonic technology, there are many.\n\nThe first and worst of which is going belly-up. Three out of four startups launched today fail, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. And, as evidenced by the unraveling of Mt. Gox, Aquifer, Cointerra, the World Bitcoin Association and a long and growing list of others, Bitcoin upstarts are no exception.\n\nAnother major risk is the continuing lack of a mass market. Even with the total amount of venture capital pouring into the fledgling industry on pace to crack the $1 billion mark, your average everyday consumer simply doesn’t give a rip about Bitcoin. Three out of four Americans haven’t heard of the six-year-old cryptocurrency, a study conducted by the research firm GfK and The Street recently revealed. Equally concerning, almost 80 percent of those polled aren’t interested in even attempting to use the world’s first digital money.\n\nAnother considerable gamble is price volatility. “The worry is ‘What if the value of Bitcoin drops to zero?’” says Jonathan Chester, founder and COO of Bitcoin payroll startup Bitwage. “If Bitcoin goes to zero, even the 2.0 applications don’t work any more.”\n\nConnie Gallippi, founder and executive director of the BitGive Foundation, which claims to be the first-ever Bitcoin charity, doesn’t sweat the virtual currency’s day-to-day price fluctuations. She told Entrepreneur she’s more concerned about the nagging uncertainty surrounding what it will take to push the cryptocurrency into the mainstream. What\'s the ""secret sauce,"" she wonders?

""There aren\'t any other options unless you buy diamonds, and that\'s very difficult to move.""\n\nBut Marinos said the bitcoin buyers\' main aim was to shield their money against the prospect that Greece might leave the euro zone and convert all the deposits in Greek banks into a greatly devalued national currency. If voters reject the demands of international creditors in a referendum on Sunday, this becomes much more likely.\n\n""A lot of people are keeping all the bitcoins they buy on our platform, until they understand what to do with them,"" Marinos said. ""In their eyes, now they have bitcoins, they\'re safe.""\n\nVolatile currency\n\nThat said, the value of a bitcoin, a web-based digital currency invented six years ago that floats freely and is not backed by a government or central bank, has been highly volatile.\n\nIt peaked at over $1,200 in late 2013 before crashing almost 70 percent in less than a month after a hacking attack on the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox in early 2014.\n\nThis week, as Greece defaulted on a debt to the IMF, the price jumped to a 3-1/2-month high of $268 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp exchange -- up more than 20 percent since the start of June -- while the number of daily transactions reached a record 150,917.\n\nMost bitcoin-watchers reckon the digital currency\'s rise is mostly due to speculators betting that capital controls would trigger heavy demand.

However, given the challenge of keeping private keys safe, investors will likely ""entrust an authority to safe keep [them].""\n\nScenario 2: Integration\n\nThe second scenario consists in an integration of blockchain technology within the post trade ecosystem. This would imply that custodians and settlement infrastructures would use the blockchain to record the ownership and trades between themselves.\n\nIn this scenario, end investors would still need to use a custodian to access the market and ""the ledger will only be accessible to authorized market participants.""\n\n""Existing actors will remain in charge in this scenario, however, their level of service could change and they may deploy new services that they could not in the past because the investments required were a huge barrier to entry.""\n\nFinally, Palychata believes that Bitcoin, which ""allows a removal of the central third party in financial transactions,"" has ""solved a technical challenge and the currency it hosts has been successful so far.""\n\nAccording to him, the technology ""offers a new range of possibilities well beyond finance,"" and ""should be considered as an invention like the stream or combustion engine.""', ""The Philippines is the twelfth most populous nation in the world, and according to the world bank, has the 39th largest Gross Domestic Product (GDP). With many modern cities, and a world class telecommunications infrastructure, the island country south of Taiwan ranks 1st in average time spent online and 3rd for incoming migrant remittances. This unique combination makes Bitcoin a very useful currency for a large percentage of the country.\n\nRecently the Philippines has been a major target market for entrepreneurs pushing Bitcoin adoption, and this week it looks like it may be starting to pay off.\n\nSoon after the Manila Bulletin, a top-five newspaper in the Philippines, ran a very positive bitcoin article on the cover of their business section, trade on LocalBitcoins in Manila hit unprecedented highs. The subject of the featured article was a local Bitcoin company called Paylance.\n\nSpikes like these can sometimes happen from a one-time sale. In this case the top bitcoin seller at LocalBitcoins happens to be the CEO of the company in the news, and has stepped forward to explain that this is indeed a bonafide increase in popularity.\n\nPaylance CEO Jay Villarante, known as jbvillarante on localbitcoins, is the sites largest seller of bitcoins in Manila. In a post he made, on the website Reddit, he confirmed that this spike is not isolated, nor is it a single new buyer.\n\n- Jay Villarante, Paylance CEO\n\nVillarante's Paylance is a mixed-use site consisting of a remittance solution, local shopping with bitcoin, and even a way to earn bitcoins through playing video games. It also allows anyone to send Pesos to Filipinos extremely easily, powered by bitcoin.\n\nBrave New Coin reached out to Villarante and asked if the spike was related to his recent press in the Bulletin. “I can't tell for sure if they're related because I don't ask my trade partners why they're buying/selling. But what I can tell you is I got a lot of new big traders locally in the Philippines,” he said.\n\n- Villarante\n\nVillarante confirmed that the biggest trades in Filipino pesos were for those buying BTC. As a Localbitcoins trader, he usually gets to speak with his customers personally, and in doing so, he explained that “The biggest trading partners I traded with keep their bitcoins as a form of investment.”\n\nExchanges there are also seeing increased traffic. According to Anthony Chua, President of the filipino exchange Coinage, the influx doesn't appear to be isolated to one business or venue. He told Brave New Coin that he’s recently seen “huge volume in general for the Philippines,” and also said that his exchange is seeing an increase in users signing up for the service.\n\nChua's exchange, Coinage, began as a graduate of the Boost VC accelerator program in Silicon Valley, with a handy $20,000 US seed funding to start their business with. In October of last year Coinage launched in Cebu, the fifth largest city in the Philippines. Chua says he doesn't really attribute the recent spike in volume it to anything other than “new users learning about bitcoin.”\n\nGoogle is also seeing the increase. Searches from the Philippines have recently climbed to a level not seen since late in 2013, when bitcoin's price was nearing it’s all-time high.\n\nIt is no secret that this island country has a conducive environment for Bitcoin to thrive in, and a range of other companies have been targeting the country, some of them with substantial Venture Capital backing.\n\nCoins.ph, which launched in 2014, offers several services including ways to transfer cash, pay bills, and load users cell phones, all using bitcoin. They have the largest number of retail locations for Filipinos, largely because of partnerships with some of the country’s largest banks and e-commerce platforms.\n\nCoins.ph partnerships have been confirmed with companies including Metrodeal, Lhuiller, Banco de Oro, Bank of the Philippines Islands, China Bank and MayBank. In December, the company announced a new partnership with Security Bank. This will enable the banks clients to purchase Bitcoin by depositing cash at 450 ATMs.\n\nAlthough native to Hong Kong, Bitspark expanded its services to the Philippines and Indonesia in January 2015. The company charges a flat rate of HK$14 (US$1.81) for payments made to the Philippines, making it an attractive alternative to traditional remittance providers. Bitspark also allows users to send payments from end to end without touching bitcoins at any point, taking the fear of volatility risk out of the entire process.\n\nTaking the same approach to remittance, powered by Bitcoin, is Satoshi Citadel Industries (SCI). The company's flagship product is Rebit.ph, which is one of the most popular remittance services in the country.\n\n- Luis Buenaventura, Rebit.ph Co-founder told Tech Crunch\n\nThe company also runs a clever global bitcoin remittance website, called Rebittance. The service has signed up more than a dozen other remittance partners, in various countries around the world, and added them into a matrix alongside the Rebit service. Users who come to the website can send bitcoins to anyone, across the network of service providers, anywhere in the world, and recipients receive the funds in their local currency.\n\nLocal angel investor Joe Maristela recently invested $100,000 in the SCI, which was founded in 2014. The company now controls several Filipino Bitcoin start ups. Among their offerings are; BitMarket.ph, a merchant business solution similar to BitPay; PrePaidBitcoin.ph, a way to sell bitcoins using plastic scratch-off cards over the counter in retail stores; BuyBitcoin.ph, a way to sell bitcoins online; and an up-and-coming wallet called BitBit.\n\nWith so many services and locations for Filipinos to use locally, they may already be the most heavily served nation for bitcoin commerce on Earth.

Amusingly enough, even /r/buttcoin (a subreddit that parodies Bitcoin and pokes fun at Cryptocurrency enthusiasts) has gone offline.\n\nThis news later seeped into the rest of the Reddit community, causing many users to relocate to Voat.co, a media aggregation website with less rules to govern it.

The media aggregating website claims that it “doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator in return for traffic.”\n\nAdditionally, many redditors who left to Voat see this as a direct response to Reddit’s recent Anti-Harassment policy.\n\nA sweet spot for bitcoin\n\nWhile Paypal may not want to fund alternative websites like Voat, Bitcoin, of course, does not care. The website, which is still in its alpha phase, does not currently contain any ads for revenue, relying instead on anonymous bitcoin donations to keep their servers up.\n\nVoat also intends to launch a partnership program which issues bitcoin rewards for users that write constructive posts. Those eligible for the partner program are the “users who share their original content, the people who write comments and the moderators who keep everything spam free.”\n\nWhile this system is still being worked on, the Voat team has already shared three possible options for partner program payments:\n\nTo reward users with a portion of Voat ad-revenue earnings based on the quality of the content they submit to Voat;\n\nTo let users donate their earnings to humanitarian causes;\n\nTo let users donate their earnings to other Voat users.\n\nAccording to their Partner Program page, the Voat team claims that the reason behind a reward-based system is to “promote creation of original content by rewarding people who take their time to write comments and vote, we want to encourage quality of said comments.”\n\nWhile there is a possibility of using traditional payment methods, the Voat team has confirmed that they plan to use digital currency as the main payment method for its users.

According to ZDNet, Bitstamp reported it held offline reserves of 183,497 Bitcoins (£34 million) in May meaning they lost around 10 percent of their assets in the raid.\n\nAccording to the report, written by Bitstamp\'s general counsel George Frost, the loss was discovered on 4 January by the chief technology officer Damian Merlak. He noticed a suspicious data transfer of 3.5GB to an unfamiliar IP address. This raised alarm bells because that\'s the size of the wallet.dat file containing Bitstamp\'s Bitcoin wallet.\n\nIt was a sophisticated attack which required that the attacker connect to the company\'s data server through one of three IP addresses. This was accomplished by accessing the laptop of Bitstamp employee Luka Kodric, which was connected via VPN to the server.\n\nHaving obtained the wallet, the attacker needed to access another server to get the passphrase to access the Bitcoins.\n\nSeparately, on 4 January someone attempted to access the Bitstamp office network again, using Kodric\'s account. Because VPN connections from an external IP address require two-factor authentication, Kodric received nine notifications on his mobile phone in the space of 20 minutes to provide additional authentication. The login attempts were from a Romanian IP address.\n\nThe attack vector was a targeted phishing campaign, with six employees known to be targeted between 4 November and 12 December. The attacker was persistent, contacting each of the targets via Skype with offers tailored to their specific interests. Having gained their trust, the attacker then sent them Word documents containing obfuscated malicious VBA script designed to connect to an external IP address and download a file.\n\nOn the sixth attempt, the hacker managed to get Kodric to download a malicious file. As systems administrator, he had access to Bitstamp\'s hot wallet. The phishing email purportedly came from the Association for Computing Machinery and offered Kodric the chance to join an international honour society. As part of this, he was sent a Word document containing the malicious VBA script which downloaded the malicious script and compromised the machine.\n\nFollowing this, the attacker switched to Skype conversations with Kodric, following which further malicious executable files were created on his laptop. On 23 December, his computer logged onto the server containing the wallet.dat file and this was followed by the successful attack on 29 December in which they logged into the data file server and the server containing the passphrase.\n\nThe attacker then waited until 4 January when they drained the Bitstamp wallet. Normally containing just 5,000 Bitcoins, on that day it held over 18,000.\n\nKevin Epstein, VP of advanced security and governance at Proofpoint, said, ""This is yet further confirmation that the human factor remains the weakest link in many security profiles – and that use of attachments and macros continues to exploit that weakness. Clearly conventional email gateways aren\'t succeeding in blocking this type of attack, so organizations who don\'t proactively invest in modern targeted attack protection and threat response systems will continue to make headlines as victims.”', 'Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media coverage and its impact.\n\nThis week was by no means the first time the mainstream media has connected Greece\'s looming debt crisis to bitcoin.\n\nAs the country gets to grips with the controversial bailout referendum that will decide the country\'s future in the eurozone this Sunday, the media has taken its coverage of the digital currency to a whole new level. At the time of publication, a quick Google news search resulted in over 100 articles.\n\nGiven the country\'s cashflow restrictions and bank closures, journalists have taken to explore bitcoin\'s potential in Greece.\n\nCoinDesk has taken a look at the top bitcoin related headlines from across the globe.\n\nWooing the Greeks\n\nA regular on the bitcoin weekly scene, Fortune\'s Daniel Roberts wrote a piece which highlighted the ways in which bitcoin companies were trying to attract the attention of Greeks.\n\n""As their country\'s financial system collapses, Greek citizens are desperate to access their money. And vocal businesspeople elsewhere in the world are eager to inform them that they have another option: bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nRoberts noted Coinbase had waived transactions fees for euro purchases made until 5th July – coinciding with the date of the referendum – in an attempt to encourage bitcoin purchases.\n\nAccurately, however, Roberts pointed out ""leading Greeks to the digital currency isn\'t so simple"".\n\nHe continued:\n\n""Right now, in fact, there are very few ways for anyone in Greece to even obtain bitcoins. Their banks are closed for a week; their ATMs are limiting them to withdrawing €60 per day; and as of Tuesday, they cannot use Greek credit or debit cards for online transactions. That means they can\'t even take Coinbase up on its offer.""\n\nIt seemed that bitcoin was doomed to remain untouched, despite the efforts of companies operating within the space.\n\nHowever, Fred Ehrsam, cofounder and president at Coinbase, cited in the article, said the company\'s motive was to appeal to Europeans who are not in Greece.\n\n""There\'s little that [bitcoin companies] can do for people on the ground in Greece. The bigger deal here is if you\'re sitting in Italy, Spain, or Portugal, and you\'re getting a little nervous, maybe it makes more sense to put value into bitcoin where you\'re less susceptible to these things. The doomsday way of saying it would be, \'Do it before it\'s too late\'.""\n\nAfter all, Spain, Portugal and Italy are also familiar with the consequences of external debt.\n\nBitcoin vs gold\n\nThere is no doubt that Greece is struggling, but why are its citizens not turning to one of the oldest forms of money – gold?\n\nThat\'s exactly what CNBC\'s Brian Kelly questioned in a piece titled ""Greece is in crisis – why no love for gold?""\n\nThe precious metal will remain unloved because this is a political crisis, not a currency crisis, he said. ""The primary reason you buy the ""barbarous relic"" that is gold is fear of a global currency crisis.""\n\nKelly is right. The onset of the Global Financial Crisis and the rapidly declining stock markets triggered a stampede of gold purchases between 2007 and 2008.\n\nHe added:\n\n""In Greece, citizens and investors are not concerned about having a currency to use; the only unknown is which currency they will adopt or create. Currently, the Greek citizens have a currency, the euro, but using it is next to impossible with the banks closed.""\n\nAccording to Kelly, gold is only useful in the aftermath of a complete currency collapse. For this reason, he believes the precious metal will remain untouched as long as there is a viable alternative. ""Gold is both useful and valuable — just not in a political crisis.""\n\nPolitical crisis\n\nAlthough there is no denying that Greece is feeling the widespread effects of an economic crisis, outlets across the world joined Kelly, noting the crisis was as much political as it was economic.\n\nThe BBC headlined a piece ""Politics trumps economics in Greek debt crisis\' and Channel 4\'s Paul Mason exposed a similar viewpoint in a piece titled ""Greece crisis: a failure of economics in the face of politics"".\n\nAdditionally to high youth unemployment rates, Greece\'s public debt currently stands at a staggering 177% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP); the highest in the European Union.\n\nDespite explaining his sources had not verified a surge of bitcoin buying attributable to Greece, Kelly said that this did not mean that the Greek crisis was unrelated to the recent price spike.\n\n""That is not to say that Greece is not the reason for the recent rise in bitcoin – it is. Speculators have been buying up bitcoin as a safe-haven alternative asset – more specifically an asset that trades 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is out of reach of government decrees on bank closures or bail-ins.""\n\nAccording to CoinDesk\'s Bitcoin Price Index, the digital currency experienced a relatively small increase in value, spiking to $266.15 on 30th June.\n\nSince then, bitcoin\'s price has declined, hovering around the $250 mark at the time of press. This tiny price movement would have gone unnoticed any other day in the digital currency\'s volatile history, however it seems to have captivated the imagination of the press today.\n\nMore talk than walk\n\nMarketwatch\'s Francine McKenna added to the debate with a piece titled ""For Greece, bitcoin is more talk than a reality"".\n\nThe journalist cited Antonis Polemitis, managing director of New York-based Ledra Capital and an instructor in the first master of science degree in digital currency at the University of Nicosia in Cyprus.\n\nHe told McKenna:\n\n""However, Greece has a low adoption rate for bitcoin and it is too late now for anyone other than the previously converted to take advantage of its functionality for this crisis.""\n\nThe journalist continued to note that the country\'s low bitcoin adoption rate is a function both of interest and aptitude. ""Its access to the euro is an advantage for a citizenry that craves a stable, easily convertible currency. Even if the country were to revert to its patrimonial currency, drachmas, Greek citizens will probably still rely on euros since, as citizens of Europe, their lives and economy are tied up with their neighbours.""\n\nAccording to Mckenna\'s piece, the digital currency\'s adoption is still limited to tech savvy citizens who may want a practical, rather than a political, alternative to what is perceived to be a unstable global banking system.\n\nCiting George Papageorgiou, a faculty member on the University of Nicosia’s digital currency MSc program, the article noted:\n\n""The financially unsophisticated, the elderly, and those too stressed to take the time and spend the money to get established will continue to find bitcoin a logistically difficult alternative.""\n\nHowever, Kelly still sees potential for the digital currency to thrive in Greece:\n\n""An asset unencumbered by political crisis that can be used as a medium of exchange at over 100,000 merchants is just ONE of the many use cases for bitcoin and block-chain technology,"" he concluded.\n\nWhether bitcoin will help Greece in its time of need remains to be seen. One thing is for certain, the Greeks are quickly running out of options. Banks remain closed and just yesterday, Shelly Banjo, a Quartz journalist, reported PayPal was no longer in the country, shutting its population off from online payments.\n\nGreek protest image via Yiorgos GR/Shutterstock.com; gold bullion, Greek flag and pocket images via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Making international remittances simpler, safer and more affordable is something PayPal is excited to do for our customers.”\n\nExcited to announce that @PayPal has agreed to acquire @Xoom to make international remittances better for people t.co/UfxWLloQ2L — PayPal (@PayPal) July 1, 2015\n\nPayPal’s Vision\n\nWith Xoom’s pre-existing payment/remittance infrastructure, the platform’s large user base of 1.3 million U.S customers and annual transactions of about US$7 billion in 37 countries, Paypal hopes to expand to emerging markets like India and China, and its user base of 68 million active users to focus on global growth.\n\nPayPal president Dan Schulman stated in a press release:\n\n“Acquiring Xoom allows PayPal to offer a broader range of services to our global customer base, increase customer engagement and enter an important and growing adjacent marketplace. Xoom’s presence in 37 countries – in particular, Mexico, India, the Philippines, China and Brazil – will help us accelerate our expansion in these important markets.”\n\nThe US$890 million valuation of the 14 year-old payment service provider Xoom derives from the company’s IPO in 2013, when it was valued at well over US$1 billion until its shares dropped substantially by the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nDue to the plunge of Xoom’s share prices, Xoom ended trading this week at US$21.36 on Monday. However, PayPal’s acquisition offered a value of US$25.05 per share, increasing the company’s value from US$807 million to $890 million dollars overnight.\n\nBefore its IPO, Xoom raised US$78 million from a series of funding rounds, which included prominent venture capital firms including Sequoia Capital, New Enterprise Associates, Fidelity Ventures, and Glynn Capital Management.\n\nThis deal has been the second acquisition of PayPal since the purchase of Paydiant, a mobile payment startup that was valued at US$280 million in March 2015.\n\nBitcoin?\n\nPayPal has recently confirmed its partnership with two of the largest cryptocurrency processors – CoinBase and GoCoin – to allow its merchants to accept bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin for digital goods and products. With PayPal’s growing interests in bitcoin, Xoom and PayPal may potentially work together to implement bitcoin in Xoom’s payment service platform. Xoom CEO John Kunze was open to experimenting with the digital currency stating in a 2014 interview with PYMNTS:', ""Customers in Canada will be now able to deposit Canadian dollars into their Bitstamp accounts following the bitcoin exchange's partnership with payment processor Vogogo.\n\nAccording to a company post, funds deposited via eCheck will take up to 5 days to clear into customers' Bitstamp accounts.

In the latest version of the BitLicense framework in New York, these reward points based on the cyrptocurrency’s blockchain were exempted from regulation.\n\nThese comprise frequently flyer miles, hotel loyalty points, return-customer retailer programs and so forth that were developed using bitcoin blockchain. Ribbit.me, a company whose RibbitRewards are tradeable, blockchain-based loyalty tokens, gives reward points that are generated by an algorithm and issued in the form of a digital token on the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Technology Applications\n\nFor merchants, this is a positive development, as the bitcoin technology can remove loyalty program liabilities that merchants have traditionally had to carry to recognize their future obligation to deliver goods and services against those points.\n\n“There’s no liability on merchants’ balance sheets anymore, and that’s what’s huge,” said Ribbit.me co-founder Sean Dennis. “We can take millions of dollars in liabilities off their balance sheets.”\n\nUsing digital tokens issued under the blockchain, Ribbit.me is able to create assets on the individual’s portfolio without adding to the liabilities on the merchant’s side. This technique upends the centuries-old viewpoint of double-entry bookkeeping in which an asset has a corresponding liability.\n\n“We tell them the liability disappears, because the blockchain belongs to no one,” said Ribbit.me co-founder Greg Simon.\n\nThis idea of blockchain-based rewards points has been catching on for a lot of retailers, which makes Ribbit.me founders worried that regulation could someday impose boundaries. For them, blockchain solutions could create better methods for managing merchant obligations, especially for the hotel industry in which franchises or branches can be operated by different owners.\n\nAnother advantage is the real-time aspect of bitcoin technology, which allows reward points to be instantly updated and available for use. For Eric Piscini, a banking technology consultant at Deloitte in Atlanta, this is good for both the customer and the owner of the business.']"
07/04/2015,"['The BIP66 update was meant to align miners on stricter cryptographic signatures through a form of block chain Democracy. As part of the BIP rules, once 950 of the past 1,000 blocks upgraded to the newer version all miners would older version blocks. This morning the network met that goal and a small, non-upgraded miner mined an older version block. Instead of rejecting the block roughly half the network accepted it and the Bitcoin block chain forked between software versions.\n\nThe bogus chain began when the BTCNuggets mining pool mined an out of date block. Though the main chain orphaned the block lightweight and older version of Bitcoin Core wallets are still at risk. According to Bitcoin.org’s network alert nearly 50% of the network hash rate mines on these lightweight or old versions. Any user running the older versions should stop accepting transactions immediately and upgrade their software.\n\n“Early morning UTC on 4 July 2015, the 950/1000 (95%) threshold was reached. Shortly thereafter, a small miner (part of the non-upgraded 5%) mined an invalid block–as was an expected occurrence. Unfortunately, it turned out that roughly half the network hash rate was mining without fully validating blocks (called SPV mining), and built new blocks on top of that invalid block.” Writes Bitcoin.org. “Note that the roughly 50% of the network that was SPV mining had explicitly indicated that they would enforce the BIP66 rules. By not doing so, several large miners have lost over $50,000 dollars worth of mining income so far.”\n\nThe immediate fix is well underway. Getting all miners off SPV and back to full validation is the patch. Once doing so miners working on the Bitcoin block chain fork that is accepting the older version blocks will correct their block chains and realign with the rest of the network.\n\nThis morning Ant Pool, F2Pool, and Blockchain.info were also using the down version software. Ant Pool alone controls nearly 36% of the network hash rate. Peter Todd was among the first responders acting on Reddit. As of the time of this writing the majority of the network hash rate is now mining valid blocks. He reports that only 4% of the network is still mining on the invalid software. Though SPV wallets will remain vulnerable as they do no validation\n\nAlso read “Bitcoin is Really Fragile” – Bitcoin Core Developer Mike Hearn\n\nYour bitcoin are safe if you received them prior to the 4th of July 2015 8:00 UTC. For users running Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 or later your bitcoin are safe. However, earlier versions, web wallets and Simple Payment Verification wallets should wait an additional 30 blocks before accepting a transaction. Miners should check their pool is mining using the updated version of Bitcoin Core or switch to a pool that does. Pools mining on the older software will lose money since they are not correctly validating and all blocks they mine will be rejected by the main network.\n\nCurrently the Eligius, kano/ckpool, P2Pool and F2Pool mining pools are reported as ‘Good’ on Bitcoin.org\n\nImages from Brian Smithson, Blockchain.info\n\n.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The India-based Trestor Foundation — maintainer of the Trestor digital currency — has offered all “credit-worthy” greekss a loan for 2,000 euros’ worth of trests. Greeks can sign a promissory note at one of three partner locations in Greece, and the Trestor loan becomes repayable “when capital controls are lifted.”\n\nHolders of trests can exchange the tokens for euros at the partner locations, but some merchants have begun to accept trests directly, removing the need for users to convert to euros.\n\n“One of our investors convinced his pharmacist to accept trests because the pharmacy declined to accept his credit card. Another person was able to get his gas filled with trests in a cash-only gas station. This third one is pretty unusual: a guy was able to negotiate \'12 eggs and a loaf of bread\' for 440 trests.” — Kunal Dixit, founder of Trestor\n\nWe asked Trestor founder Kunal Dixit for more information:\n\nCoinTelegraph: Trests are not listed on CoinMarketCap.com. Is Trestor a decentralized cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, or is it something else?\n\nKunal Dixit: We are not on Coinmarketcap because we haven\'t yet made an effort to get listed on an exchange. Our APIs, whitepaper, Tech-Draft and most of our source code is open, however.\n\nWe believe that decentralization is a process, not a final state. Trestor is on track to make Trestor network (T-Net) fully decentralized. As of right now, the entry barrier to run a full Trestor node is high. We are accepting applications from academic institutions interested in running a Trestor full node, and upon successful due diligence process, we will let them run Trestor full nodes.\n\nTrestor\'s control over T-Net will go down month to month. By October 1, 2015, T-Net will be fully decentralized and anyone with minimal resources would be able to run a full node. At that point, we will be far more decentralized than Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.\n\nCT: With some cryptos boasting nearly 3,000 full nodes across the globe, why are you confident that Trestor will become ‘far more decentralized’ than they within the next four months?\n\nKD: We may or may not beat the statistic of 3,000 full nodes. That\'s not really our benchmark. The US$3.5 billion market cap Bitcoin project — and millions of dollars of venture capital and angel investment — reside on just a two-word premise, and that is “competitive mining.”\n\n""Competitive mining"" is the soul of every mining-powered blockchain. Unfortunately, mining has become far more collaborative, and the incentives are aligned for it to remain that way.\n\nBy October 1, Trestor Network will primarily be powered by academic institutions, running full Trestor nodes across the globe. Our consensus is not PoW [proof of work] or PoS [proof of stake], or Ripple/Stellar. Our process takes the best of proof of stake and the Ripple/Stellar-type voting-based mathematical guarantees, and merges the two ideas to create a new network consensus system. We call this “asymmetric proof of stake” (aPoS). There is a huge economic disincentive for the attacker to plan any viable attack.\n\nCT: What has the response been among greeks so far to the Trestor loan offer?\n\nKD: The response has been amazing. Within the first 24 hours, we closed deals with seven investors, all of them working professionals. They cleared mandatory identity and credit checks and signed the “promissory note.” Trests worth 2,000 euros were sent out to each of them within two hours of successful paperwork.\n\nFor tomorrow, we expect a lot more calls, as more and more Greeks realize that Trestor Network is the only non-cash network which works in Greece. Even Bitcoin purchases cannot escape capital controls.\n\nCT: What do you mean ‘even Bitcoin purchases cannot escape capital controls?’\n\nKD: Greeks cannot purchase bitcoins because:\n\nThey cannot purchase it with cash (€60 daily withdrawal limit). They cannot purchase it with bank transfers (outbound SEPA transactions frozen).\n\nThey can only purchase if there are enough sellers within Greece who are willing to sell their bitcoins via bank transfers. So, net movement of bitcoins into Greece is negligible, therefore, for all practical purposes. Bitcoin as a system is no better than fiat post-capital control for people who didn\'t invest in bitcoins pre-capital control.\n\nOn the other hand, trests are flowing into Greece from outside in return for signed ""promissory notes"" from credit worthy Greeks.\n\n“The situation is very fluid right now. Over 400 new Trestor Android wallets were created in Greece last night. We see a lot of transactions happening there, but we have no idea about the nature and location of such transactions.”\n\nCT: Where in Greece, or where online, can greeks spend their new trests?\n\nKD: People can certainly spend their trests at any of our retail partner locations. There are many other locations within Greece accepting trests, but it\'s difficult for us to get that data as the situation is very fluid right now. Over 400 new Trestor Android wallets were created in Greece last night. We see a lot of transactions happening there, but we have no idea about the nature and location of such transactions.\n\nSome of what we know are as follows: one of our investors convinced his pharmacist to accept trests because the pharmacy declined to accept his credit card. Another person was able to get his gas filled with trests in a cash-only gas station. This third one is pretty unusual: a guy was able to negotiate \'12 eggs and a loaf of bread\' for 440 trests.\n\nCT: How many merchants accept trests directly for goods or services in Greece today?\n\nKD: We are following the money to understand and capture who all are accepting trests. We will have a very good idea within the next day or two and will update these new locations on our website as soon as we get them. It is definitely more than the three that are listed on our website.\n\n“Our job is to make payments work where all fiat and even commodity-based monies fail.”\n\nCT: If this campaign is successful, will Trestor consider making the same proposition to people in other regions in cases of fiat failure?\n\nKD: Yes, we certainly will. At Trestor, our job is to make payments work where all fiat and even commodity-based monies fail. We start by deciding our level of risk exposure, and then we try to reach out to the population that may need our help.\n\nCT: The value of one trest is reportedly ‘set to’ US$0.01. How can you fix the value of a trest over a fluctuating market price?\n\nKD: As of right now, market price for trests does not fluctuate much because, as the Trestor Foundation, we are actively engaged in market-making activities around that price. Over time, as more and more trests are out of Trestor accounts, our ability to make the market would go down.\n\nCT: Does the Trestor Foundation pay out fiat to merchants who accept trests?\n\nKD: Our retail partners are different from what one would think of a typical bitcoin merchant. In addition to selling their goods and services for trests they are also broker-dealers for Trestor. You can think of our 600+ retail partners as 600+ micro-exchanges. Most of them buy back trests from sellers at a 2 to 3% discount so that they can sell them to a buyer at 1 cent, thereby making a healthy spread.\n\nGreeks can fill out the application to receive 2000 euros\' worth of trests at Trestor Foundation\'s homepage.', ""Travis Patron is a digital money researcher and author of The Bitcoin Revolution: An Internet of Money. Here he explains why bitcoin may be an intrinsically valuable form of money because it is regulated through time-bound algorithms.\n\nOne of the most common criticisms of bitcoin is it is not backed by anything, nor is it intrinsically valuable. However, pundits have long been arguing that the US dollar has no intrinsic value and neither does gold.\n\nThe utter misconception of this economic principle as it relates to bitcoin is too large, and too important to ignore. Everything from Dutch tulips in the 17th century to stacks of paper USD notes have had some degree of intrinsic value. What we need to debate is the quality of intrinsic value attributed to each.\n\nWhat cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts must understand is that bitcoin is not only a financial asset with considerable intrinsic value, but it is regulated by a universal constant unlike any man-made money system that has come before it – time itself.\n\nThis universal construct allows us to plot the supply schedule of bitcoin, meaning it is highly predictable while also being uncheatable through the manipulation found in traditional monetary policies.\n\nAlgorithmic regulation\n\nThe argument goes that dollars are backed by the US government and the largest force of military might on the planet, but what is backing bitcoin? Even if programmable, digital money brings intrinsically valuable capabilities, how can we have faith in it if there is no core party overseeing its acceptance and adoption?\n\nAt the very root of what makes the bitcoin network tick is a regulatory algorithm determining that new blocks of bitcoin will be mined on average every 10 minutes. This 'uncheatable' maths which is intelligently constructed by system design, ensures that nothing can alter the predetermined issuance rate, nor the block size halving rate, of bitcoin.\n\nEvery 10 minutes, more bitcoin becomes available at a disinflationary rate. This mathematical guarantee formulated by a crude form of artificial intelligence is exactly what backs a system that boasts remarkable intrinsic value.\n\nFriedman's k-percent rule\n\nAmerican economist, statistician and writer Milton Friedman once posed the idea of replacing central banking institutions with a computer capable of mechanically managing the supply of money.\n\nHe proposed a fixed monetary rule, called Friedman's k-percent rule, where money supply would be calculated by known macroeconomic and financial factors, targeting a specific level or range of inflation.\n\nUnder this rule, a central reserve bank would have no leeway as money supply increases could be determined by a computer and the market (and its citizens) could then anticipate all monetary policy decisions.\n\nWill we ever see Friedman's computerized banking institution put into action? Considering the mining network is the closest thing to an authority within bitcoin, and mining will only get more specialized and thus centralized in the future, we may well already be on the path towards it.\n\nAn intelligent force\n\nBitcoin boasts the economic backing of a force magnitudes more intelligent and pervasive than the promise of men and military might: an uncheatable, highly predictable, chronological supply schedule enabled by Friedman’s k-percent rule.\n\nFriedman predicted the rise of a computer capable of automatically adjusting the inflation rate of money, and this is precisely what we see in the case of bitcoin, as a regulatory algorithm intelligently adjusts the mining difficulty to make the issuance of blocks more or less easy depending on the demand for network hashing power.\n\nThe computerized function of the bitcoin system boasts intrinsic value which will continue to grow as more users join the fold and the network becomes more valuable for every participant.\n\nNo money system we have seen to date can claim it is chronologically regulated. The universal construct of time is the backing of the bitcoin digital economy.\n\nTime image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Obviously there is no footage from the event, but historical accounts contend that it was Caesar himself who inadvertently started the fire by burning his own ships.\n\nMankind will never know how much we really lost from the Library of Alexandria, but with much of the world’s communications and information going digital, and with national defense efforts by most countries pushing toward cyber warfare, Blocktech believes that it could happen again. Is it possible to completely eradicate anything from the Internet? While it technically is possible, it would take a massive effort and a lot of intelligence. The goal of a cyberwarfare effort in the direction of eradicating information and knowledge wouldn’t be as much to succeed in full erasure, it would be more focused on disruption.\n\nDisrupting Central Points of Failure\n\nWhat Blocktech’s Alexandria is offering is a way for companies and communities to prevent catastrophic data loss caused by ill-intentioned hackers. If everyone has a copy of something, then you have to take everyone down. Futuristic civilizations come to mind, with everyone carrying a small device that contains all of the knowledge the civilization has ever acquired. But it’s much simpler than this, in terms of the technological solution Alexandria is selling.\n\nAlexandria is a system for publishing despite censorship or cyber attacks. An Alexandria implementation has three main components, but Bitcoin comes in to serve optional audience-to-publisher payments. For actual transmission of files, which can be various types of content, the peer-to-peer file-sharing software BitTorrent has been utilized. Florincoin made some advancements in block chain technology such that its block chain serves the purpose of tying all this together, creating a publishing ledger with a payment layer. It also makes use of IPFS, the revolutionary file sharing protocol that could replace the Internet as we know it.\n\nWhat Bitcoin did for money, Alexandria will do for digital content publishing and distribution by removing central points of failure and financially incentivizing users around the world.\n\nThe way Alexandria works is similar to any other decentralized computing platform: numerous machines working together to serve files and ensure their legitimacy. A situation where all nodes can agree on the contents of the network is always preferable to one requiring constant verification.\n\nAlexandria is another in a long line of projects that are solving a problem rarely discussed on the Internet: censorship is real, and growing. In this reality, anti-censorship technology and secure methods of communication and education are going to be necessary. The Library of Alexandria will not be the last project to tackle this problem, but its approach has some of the important markers of success: clear vision and a strong team.\n\nImages from Shutterstock (the new Library of Alexandria) and Blocktech.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Greece has halted all Internet payment transactions that uses the Greek debit or credit cards. This is the latest move the country’s banks have taken in response to the continuing financial crisis. Earlier, Greece had imposed a 60 euro daily withdrawal limit and closed all banks nationwide.\n\nAs the Greek crisis rages, the concern is that Greece will stop using the Euro for its currency. Due to the tight restrictions amidst the crisis, many Greeks have turned their attention to Bitcoin to protect their savings.\n\nBitcoin’s value has increased more than 16 percent since the beginning of June. Exchanges operators said the trading volume has significantly increased since the Greek crisis took shape.\n\nThe news comes as no surprise, as limitations have been placed on Greek credit and debit cards when used on Amazon and other online stores.\n\nPolish bitcoin exchange Bitcurex revealed that it has received a score of emails from Greeks regarding Bitcoin, its validity in Europe, and how it can be used. For the most part, Bitcoin can’t be used to purchase groceries or for medical care. However, its decentralized digital nature makes it a worthwhile option for people to store or transfer money. To respond to the influx of new Greek users, Bitcurex has waived transaction fees for Greek citizens.\n\nSince the Greek crisis took shape, bitcoin prices have risen to $250 per coin. Although still much lower than the $1,000 per coin mark in 2014, it’s anyone’s guess what will happen to the price after the Sunday vote in Greece.', '""Una valuta complementare, la moneta delle tasse future"" Grecia, il piano B di Varoufakis: il Bitcoin di Stato Si tratta di un sistema di pagamento garantito dalle tasse future e nominativamente legato all\'euro. Il sistema, spiega il ministro delle Finanze greco, permetterebbe a un cittadino di acquistare un Ft-coin (moneta delle tasse future) con 1.000 euro. Poi ogni Paese avrebbe un proprio mercato di questa valuta complementare che sarebbe utilizzabile per le transazioni comuni ma anche convertibile in euro in qualsiasi momento\n\nYanis Varoufakis\n\nCondividi\n\nAtene\n\nEra il 13 marzo del 2014. il ministro delle Finanze greco Yanis Varoufakis già parlava dal suo blog di bitcoin, definendolo un meraviglioso algoritmo, il meraviglioso algoritmo del 21esimo secolo. E proprio in questo periodo di scarsa liquidità in Grecia con la chiusura delle banche, i limiti ai prelievi ai bancomat e l\'estrema difficoltà ad operare acquisti online per i controlli sui conti collegati agli account, a lievitare esponenzialmente sono state proprio le operazioni in bitcoin. I greci stanno facendo incetta di questa valuta virtuale (si tratta di una moneta elettronica che utilizza un database distribuito tra i nodi della rete che tengono traccia delle transazioni) per procurarsi liquidità e per proteggersi in caso di un\'eventuale Grexit, che svaluterebbe drammaticamente il loro potere d\'acquisto. Giusto per dare un\'idea, tra maggio e giugno - periodo serratissimo di negoziati tra Atene e creditori per la crisi del debito - il valore dei bitcoin in Grecia è aumentato di 400 volte e i depositi si sono quadruplicati arrivando a un valore medio di 700 euro. L\'utilizzo di bitcoin consente ai greci di aggirare i controlli sui capitali e far uscire i soldi dai depositi, al limite per trasferirli all\'estero. Molti greci comunque comprano bitcoin e li lasciano in parcheggio nelle piattaforme online in attesa di capire l\'esito del referendum.Su questo assunto si baserebbe il piano B del ministro delle finanze di Atene Yanis Varoufakis. Se vince il no, con ogni probabilità la Bce interromperà l\'Ela (Assistenza di emergenza per la liquidita), il programma che consente alle banche di avere contanti da cedere ai correntisti. E con ciò il Governo avrà due sole possibilità: lasciare crollare l\'economia del Paese nel vortice di una crisi legata alla mancanza materiale di denaro nel sistema, oppure stampare moneta. E in questo secondo caso sarà costretta a stampare dracme, con ciò uscendo dall\'euro. I sostenitori del sì vogliono evitare questo scenario da incubo, mentre il premier Alexis Tsipras vuole, sfidando Berlino, vedere le carte di Francoforte e Bruxelles, sperando che non andranno fino in fondo.Per Varoufakis si potrebbe pensare a una terza via, ossia l\'impiego di valute complementari, una sorta di bitcoin rivisti e corretti. Nel suo blog scriveva che ""che i Paesi periferici (dell\'Eurozona, ndr) possono fare qualcosa per darsi una possibilità di respirare meglio e che possa essere una merce di scambio di cui Berlino, Francoforte e Bruxelles posso prendere nota: e cioè possono creare il proprio sistema di pagamento garantito dalle tasse future e nominativamente legato all\'euro. Di più, possono usare un algoritmo simmile a quello del Bitcoin per creare un sistema trasparente, efficiente e libero dai costi di transazione. Chiamiamolo Ft-coin, cioè moneta delle tasse future"". Il sistema, spiega il titolare delle Finanze di Atene, funzionerebbe così: il cittadino potrebbe acquistare un Ft-coin con 1.000 euro. Ciascun Paese (Varoufakis fa l\'esempio di Spagna, Italia e Irlanda) avrebbe un proprio mercato di questa valuta complementare. Il Ft-coin sarebbe utilizzabile per le transazioni comuni ma anche convertibile verso gli euro in qualsiasi momento. E dopo un certo arco di tempo, in linea di massima due anni, acquisirebbe maggior valore nei confronti dello Stato: varrebbe 1.500 euro per pagare le tasse (su ciascun Ft-coin ci sarebbe stampata naturalmente la data di emissione). ""Ogni anno - chiude il cerchio - il ministero del Tesoro emetterebbe nuovi Ft-coin, mantenendone il valore nominale complessivo in circolazione al di sotto di una certa percentuale del Pil, diciamo intorno al 10%"". Un sistema del genere, spiega, rappresenterebbe ""una fonte di liquidità per i governi al di fuori del mercato dei titoli di Stato, che non coinvolgerebbe le banche e che sarebbe al di fuori delle restrizioni imposte da Bruxelles e dalle varie trojke"". Non solo, ma costituirebbe, aggiunge, una ""creazione nazionale di euro perfettamente legale nel contesto dei trattati europei che potrebbe essere impiegata per assistere i membri pi· deboli della societa o per pagare alcuni lavori sociali disperatamente necessari"".Una ipotesi tutt\'altro che campata in aria, spiega Stefano Lucarelli, professore di economia monetaria presso l\'università di Bergamo ed esperto di valute complementari. Da alcuni anni, infatti, collabora a D-cent, un progetto finanziato con fondi Ue dedicato proprio allo sviluppo di una piattaforma software in grado di offrire questo genere di strumenti. Le sperimentazioni sono già partite: Islanda, Finlandia, Catalogna, Francia. E anche in Sardegna è nata una esperienza simile con una matrice autonomista. L\'idea, di impostazione fortemente sociale, è concentrarsi sulla moneta come mezzo di scambio e non di speculazione, che permetta di dare liquidità e credito a chi non ce l\'ha, tipicamente alle parti più deboli della società. ""Esistono molte sperimentazioni legate al mondo delle monete complementari - racconta Lucarelli -. In Grecia si è posta l\'attenzione su una moneta fiscale, una moneta complementare che, restando nell\'euro, sia accettata nel pagamento delle imposte a livello regionale e locale, che garantisca credito alle imprese che offrono beni e servizi. Il ragionamento di Varoufakis fin da inizio mandato è andato prefigurando una situazione in cui non si torna alla dracma ma si risolvono i problemi di indebitamento delle imprese attraverso uno strumento creditizio di facilitazione"".""Questo potrebbe dare ossigeno all\'economia sul piano interno - sottolinea - ma c\'è da dire che non risolverebbe il problema centrale, i debiti pregressi con l\'estero. Da questa situazione non c\'è modo di uscire se non con un taglio del debito o con un suo ripudio totale"" (altrimenti, dice, proseguira un circolo infinito di prestiti per ripagare i debiti seguiti da nuovi prestiti per ripagare i nuovi debiti). ""In entrambi i casi - conclude - è impensabile che manchi finanziamento esterno alla Grecia per far ripartire gli investimenti"".', 'July 4 marks the third anniversary of Bytecoin, the world’s first CryptoNote-based cryptocurrency. The Bytecoin team has unveiled an expanded roadmap detailing their future plans for the coin.\n\nBytecoin\n\nBytecoin is the first CryptoNote-based cryptocurrency that enables absolutely anonymous transactions via ring signatures and one-time keys. Unlike Bitcoin, it offers certain unique properties such as smooth block reward, difficulty adjustment and ASIC resistance. (GPU mining provides efficiency of the same magnitude as CPU mining.)\n\nThe Bytecoin platform allows for implementing colored coins and smart contracts by means of the network itself, without any add-ons. “The work on these functions is already in process,” Bytecoin developer Joseph Lin told CoinTelegraph. “The upcoming releases will include wallet improvements, block explorer high-level API, aliases and more.”\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe generation of Bytecoin’s first block coincided with America’s Independence Day on July 4, 2012. Now the development team has prepared an updated roadmap revealing their plans for Bytecoin in the near future. Additionally, the team has started working on colored coins, which will later serve as the basis for implementing smart contracts.\n\nThe features that would be implemented with the next releases include:\n\nBytecoin platform expansion\n\nAs an addition to the existing API (“IWallet” and “ITransaction” APIs for handling transactions; “INode” API for daemon functionality), they will release the block explorer API. This will allow developers to get native access to the blockchain data.\n\nCode refactoring\n\nThe next releases will include a new network library with network code operating significantly faster than the existing solution. Moreover, block synchronization speed and block relay speed will be enhanced.\n\nEnhancing wallet usability\n\nThe Bytecoin Wallet will include an integrated block explorer and provide ability to mine BCN directly from the wallet. Also, e-shops will be able to issue invoices that will be shown in the user’s wallet. It will only take one click to pay merchants.\n\nMulti-addressing feature will be integrated into Bytecoin RPC Wallet\n\nExchanges, payment processors, online shops and others will have the ability to create a unique address for incoming payments from individual users.\n\nIncreasing the transaction processing speed\n\nReal-time transaction synchronization is a feature allowing all network nodes to have identical lists of unconfirmed transactions. This update will further increase the speed of transactions processing.\n\nAliases integrated into blockchain\n\nAliases will allow for mapping the Bytecoin address to any convenient string. For example, you can donate some funds to the “Tor.Project.” This address will be automatically resolved to:\n\n22k6qhj6X8FZkwPDbpswnUescZm63tGArYj5fAkjLvG5f8wZcdXvMxmK5gKrufqTM1As722mmKTftd1sz8Ng2rBy8jgfgYD\n\n“Bytecoin already allows users to make secure and private financial transactions and create businesses in the fields, where financial privacy plays an important role,” explained Senior Developer Lin to CoinTelegraph. “We are planning to develop Bytecoin even further. Our long-term goal is to help Bytecoin become a very comprehensive financial system.” Lin continued:', '“The Future of Financial Services,” a 178-page report released on June 30 by the World Economic Forum, explains one of the greatest advantages of FinTech firms. They have the ability to reduce friction by using the most innovative software and technology. Jesse McWaters, project manager of the Center for Global Industries, World Economic Forum, said:\n\n“Today’s innovators are aggressively targeting the intersection between areas of high frustration for customers and high profitability for incumbents, allowing them to ‘skim the cream’ by chipping away at incumbents’ most valuable products. It is hard to think of a better example of this than remittance — banks have traditionally charged very high fees for cross-border money transfers and offered a poor customer experience, with transfers often taking up to three days to arrive at their destination.”\n\nTo illustrate how fast global FinTech is growing, total financing in 2008 was less than US$930 million. By October 2014, it had grown to over US$1.04 billion in that month alone. Some raise the question whether this growing ecosystem should form partnerships within the existing banking system. The real question, however, is whether the traditional financial sector can even adapt. Andreas Antonopoulos said in March at the MIT Bitcoin Expo 2015:\n\n""Where do we go when the era of Central Banking dies? Because it\'s about to die — by decentralized organisms that are dynamically scalable and software that can be modified. I am very confident that software systems can and do adapt dynamically.""\n\nReshaping Banking\n\nIn a banking report, the “Future of Finance,” Goldman Sachs analyst Ryan Nash noted that “new technologies are among the top factors [that are] reshaping the traditional banking sector.” Most FinTech environments are exploding globally. A recent survey by customer experience company Accenture finds that global investment in financial-technology ventures tripled to US$12.2 billion in 2014. The survey suggests the old financial industry is not yet ready for the radical changes brought by these new ventures, although as a matter of survival, they are trying to understand. Accenture says:\n\n“Core banking must be adaptive, ready to adopt new business models and leverage new technologies.”\n\nBanks from all around the globe are doubling efforts to enter this arena. Mastercard announced in May its own peer-to-peer remittance service called MasterCard Send, an attempt to duplicate its counterparts in the financial tech world. In the same month, during a US$50 million investment round, Goldman Sachs pumped up Circle Internet Financial, Inc.\'s funding, putting the company\'s name into the minds of watching investors.\n\nIn June, the Singapore monetary authority started a blockchain record-keeping project. Last year, Barclays launched a FinTech incubator as well. A graduate from the Barclay team, Aneesh Varma — co-founder of Aire, a credit score startup — said:\n\n“Most of the financial ecosystem depends on common protocols. Having one bank as a ‘buddy’ gives you a head start over your competition and helps reassure clients and consumers that you’re okay to do business with.”\n\nProblems Adapting\n\nMany think it’s helpful for FinTech companies to work with traditional financial institutions, although the most vocal opinion is that the financial sector is not yet ready to adapt or regulate these technologies in a way that’s helpful to both tradition and innovation.\n\nA survey by Accenture found that more than a quarter of U.S. customers have thought about changing their financial service providers after experiencing growing dissatisfied with their own banks. Decentralization techniques are now often the default in new platforms. Many of the creators of the technological revolution are not asking for permission. They are going ahead with building the applications and providing their services.\n\nThe emergence of FinTech startups is heavily related to often harsh regulation surrounding the finance industry. FinTech companies often have different sets of policies regarding operations. Slow-moving financial regulators can’t adapt quickly enough to new technical innovations, so new businesses are often able to operate under the radar from governments for a period of time, using it to their advantage, to collect capital and to network without regulatory hassle.\n\nThe banking industry must stand on previous foundations made by policy makers, but also learn to adapt to this new environment quickly. McWaters says:\n\n“Innovators are also using their technical skills to automate manual processes that are currently very resource intensive for established players. This allows them to offer services to whole new groups of customers that were once reserved for the elite.”\n\n-This graphic describes the six key “innovation clusters” in the World Economic Forum report', 'Chris Flood JULY 4, 2015 0 Pension fund managers and life insurance companies are increasing their chances of going bust if they undertake aggressive shifts into alternative assets to meet their promises to savers, warns the OECD. The rising share of pension and life insurance assets invested in hedge funds, private equity, high-yield corporate bonds and commodities “warrants vigilance” by regulators and policy makers, says the Paris-based body in its latest report. It believes the move into riskier investments could result in the solvency position of pension funds being “seriously compromised” in the event of a market shock where there is a freeze on liquidity. “The concern is whether pension funds and life insurance companies have, or might become involved, in an excessive search for yield to match the level of returns previously promised when financial markets were delivering higher returns,” says Pablo Antolin, head of the OECD’s private pensions unit. Indeed, according to a report by PwC, the professional services firm, global alternative assets could almost double to more than $15tn in the next five years. David Blake, director of the pensions institute at Cass Business School in London, is not convinced this is a bad thing. He disputes whether the OECD is right to be concerned about the shift. “Is it not more sensible for pension funds to develop a mix of investment strategies, given the choice of new asset classes that are now available?” he says. The OECD says a lack of data has hindered an exact assessment of the extent of the portfolio changes by pension funds and life insurers, but Mr Antolin says a move into riskier assets is definitely taking place. Forecasts from PwC support that. It expects pension fund assets will increase from $37tn in 2013 to $57bn by the end of 2020, with alternatives making up a far bigger share of total assets. Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, the worlds largest, recently added a 5 per cent allocation to alternatives for the first time, and a number of other large Japanese public pension funds are expected to follow suit. In the US, the 96 largest public pension plans that manage $2.9tn in total assets, have increased their exposure to alternatives (excluding property) from around 3 per cent in 2001 to 15.1 per cent in 2013, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Keith Brainard, director of research for Nasra, says he does not believe the solvency of public pension funds could be threatened by this shift towards alternative assets. “I do not accept that alternatives are by definition more risky than other assets, and, in fact, in some cases they can be less risky,” he says. Amlan Roy, head of global demographics and pensions research at Credit Suisse, agrees. He says that the current financial models used by many pension funds to guide asset allocation choices are inadequate. He believes it is unrealistic to expect a repeat of the returns on equities and bonds seen in the 1980s and 1990s, the two best decades for performance for 200 years. “Pension funds need to look carefully at alternative asset classes, which are no more risky than equities at current valuations,” says Mr Roy. Within fixed income, pension funds’ and insurers’ need for long-dated bonds to match their liabilities has led to huge growth in demand relative to supply, meaning the outlook for returns has deteriorated. This has left investors with little choice but to consider alternatives. Euan MacLaren, head of Natixis Global Asset Management’s UK and Ireland institutional business, says the increased volatility of fixed income markets is another factor encouraging pension funds to reconsider their strategic choices. “Our pension fund clients have a good understanding of their liabilities but more are re-examining how their assets are structured,” he says. He adds that there has not been a big change in the risk appetite of pension funds but instead a willingness to consider a wider range of investment options that could boost returns. The OECD is unconvinced. “Regulators and policy makers need to remain vigilant to prevent an excessive search for yield,” says Mr Antolin.', 'In der Krise ist Gold eine stabile Geld-Alternative. Doch in Griechenland bleibt der Run aus. Zugleich steigt der Kurs einer anderen Währung. Diese hat in der aktuellen Krise klare Vorteile.\n\nAnzeige\n\nDas Interesse an der Digitalwährung Bitcoin ist in Griechenland sprunghaft angestiegen – drohender Euro-Austritt und Kapitalverkehrskontrollen sei Dank. Online-Marktplätze für die digitale Währung berichten von einem deutlichen Anstieg der Anfragen und Kontoeröffnungen aus Griechenland. Bei Google Trends lässt sich das stark gewachsene Interesse am steilen Anstieg des Suchworts Bitcoin in Griechenland erkennen.\n\nIn Griechenland sind die Anfragen nach dem Wort „Bitcoin“ bei Google zuletzt nach oben geschossen Quelle: Inforafik Die Welt\n\nNoch am 1. April hatte Griechenlands Finanzminister Janis Varoufakis die Finanzwelt mit einem Scherz aufgeschreckt. Wenn die Troika nicht spure, werde sein Land den Bitcoin als Währung einführen. Die Schrecksekunde währte nur kurz, denn der rebellisch-radikale Politiker hatte einen Aprilscherz versucht.\n\nIn Wahrheit hält Varoufakis, der nie einen Hehl über den Einfluss des Marxismus auf sein Denken gemacht hat, nicht viel von der digitalen Währung. In einem Blogeintrag erklärte er den Bitcoin wegen seiner deflatorischen Effekte sogar für geradezu gefährlich. Staatliche Institutionen rund um die Welt warnen regelmäßig vor den Gefahren der dezentralen Währung, die sich dem Einfluss der Zentralbanken entzieht und deren Geldmenge nur durch den Einsatz von Rechenkraft steigt. Privatanlegern drohe im schlimmsten Fall der Totalverlust.\n\nAnzeige\n\nEinige Landsleute von Varoufakis scheinen das anders zu sehen – und vertrauen dem Wert der Digitalwährung mehr als einer möglichen künftigen griechischen Währung, die gegenüber dem Euro wohl stark abwerten würde. Manche Börsen berichten von einer Versechsfachung der Nutzerzahlen.\n\nBitcoin-Preis steigt, Gold nicht\n\nAuch der Bitcoin-Preis hat angezogen, was auf eine gestiegene Nachfrage schließen lässt. Vor dem vergangenen Wochenende, als der Schuldenstreit zwischen der Troika und der griechischen Regierung eskalierte, wurde die Internetwährung an den Börsen für 215 Euro gehandelt. In den Tagen darauf ist der Bitcoin-Preis bis auf 240 Euro nach oben geschossen. Am Freitagnachmittag wurden 230 Euro für eine Einheit des digitalen Geldes bezahlt.\n\nSeit der Verkündung des Referendums in Griechenland hat der Bitcoin-Kurs wieder angezogen Quelle: Infografik Die Welt\n\nDieser Kursanstieg um rund zehn Prozent kontrastiert mit der Entwicklung des „Krisenmetalls“ Gold. In Euro gerechnet, hat sich der Unzenpreis seit der „Grescalation“ nicht verändert. Das gelbe Metall kostet genauso viel wie zuvor. Als Fluchtwährung hat es sich nur insofern bewährt, als sein Wert stabil geblieben ist, während Aktien verloren haben, der Dax auf Wochensicht zum Beispiel vier Prozent.\n\nAnzeige\n\nZwar berichten auch Edelmetallhändler von einer anziehenden Nachfrage nach Münzen und Barren durch griechische Kunden. Doch haben Bitcoins gegenüber dem gelben Metall einen Vorteil: Sie lassen sich in Sekundenschnelle über die Staatsgrenzen hinweg transferieren. Und besonders vorteilhaft für griechische Staatsbürger: Die Transfers finden außerhalb des Finanzsystems statt.\n\nBitcoin-Befürworter fordern zur Kapitalflucht auf\n\nManche Bitcoin-Propheten fordern die Hellenen unumwunden dazu auf, mit den digitalen Talern Kapitalflucht zu begehen: „Für die Griechen ist es jetzt interessant, einen Teil ihres Geldes in Bitcoins umzutauschen, um die Kapitalverkehrskontrollen zu umgehen“, sagt Aaron Koenig, Chef der Firma Bitfilm Networks in Berlin.\n\nDie Zahl unserer Neukunden ist binnen einer Woche um rund 500 Prozent gestiegen\n\nSchon jetzt kursieren Berichte über eine Bargeld-Knappheit im Land. „Bitcoins haben den großen Vorteil, dass sie nicht gesperrt oder konfisziert werden können“, sagt Koenig. Solange die Bankkonten nicht komplett eingefroren sind, könnten die Griechen bei den Online-Börsen digitale Münzen per Überweisung erwerben.\n\nDas passiert derzeit offenbar massenhaft. Die meisten Bitcoin-Börsen wollen keine exakten Zahlen nennen, bestätigen jedoch, dass die Anfragen aus Griechenland deutlich zugenommen haben. „Die Zahl unserer Neukunden ist binnen einer Woche um rund 500 Prozent gestiegen“, sagt Thanos Marinos, Gründer des Online-Handelsplatzes BTCGreece.\n\n„Zeitweise haben sich bei uns zehnmal so viele Leute aus Griechenland registriert wie vorher, und der Bitcoin-Umsatz griechischer Kunden hat sich ungefähr verdreifacht“, sagt Oliver Flaskämper, Geschäftsführer der deutschen Firma Bitcoin.de, die hierzulande Marktführer ist.\n\nAuch bei Wettbewerbern habe die Aktivität signifikant zugenommen. Der weltweit größte Handelsplatz Bitstamp vermeldete auf Twitter eine 350-prozentige Steigerung der Neuregistrierungen für User in Griechenland. Allerdings war Griechenland laut Geschäftsführer Nejc Kodric nie ein großer Markt für die digitale Währung.\n\nAus Sicht von Flaskämper hängt das unmittelbar mit den Kapitalverkehrskontrollen zusammen. „So wie es jetzt aussieht, ist das Bitcoin-Netzwerk die einzige Möglichkeit für Griechen, noch Auslandüberweisungen durchzuführen“, sagt er.\n\nDie Nachteile des „digitalen Golds“\n\nDie Möglichkeiten, in Griechenland jetzt noch Euro in Bitcoin umzutauschen, sind jedoch eingeschränkt. Die meisten Bankfilialen bleiben geschlossen, und auch Online-Überweisungen könnten bald gekappt werden. „Viele Griechen wollen in diesen Tagen ihre Ersparnisse sichern. Das ist absolut nachvollziehbar, schließlich haben die Leute Angst, dass große Verluste anfallen, falls ihr Euro-Konto auf die Drachme oder eine andere Alternativwährung umgestellt wird“, sagt Jan Randolph, Direktor für Risikoratings bei IHS in London. Die Gefahr eines Währungsschnitts sei real.\n\n„Für die Griechen, die an ihr Geld kommen, sind Bitcoins natürlich eine Möglichkeit – aber nur eine von vielen“, sagt Randolph. Es läge für viele näher, Gold oder Dollars zu kaufen. „Gold ist meiner Einschätzung nach ein besserer Aufbewahrungsort für das Vermögen der Griechen. Nicht jeder kennt sich mit Bitcoins aus, sie zirkulieren nur in einem relativ kleinen Bereich“, sagt der Banker.\n\nGanz Griechenland verzeichnet nur einen einzigen Bitcoin-Automaten – und zwar in einem Buch- und Schreibwarenladen im Norden der Hauptstadt Athen Quelle: REUTERS/AK/KV/\n\nDas Problem von Bitcoins sei, dass die Akzeptanz der Griechen vorher nicht sonderlich gewesen sei und dass viele Leute nicht wüssten, wie und wo sie Bitcoins kaufen könnten. „Für den griechischen Durchschnittsbürger ist dies nicht die erste Wahl.“\n\nBitcoin-Umtausch mit Hindernissen\n\n„Bei der großen Mehrheit der Nutzer haben die Bitcoin-Transaktionen ein Volumen von 50 bis 100 Euro“, sagt Marinos von BTCGreece. Viele würden die digitalen Münzen schlicht als Wertaufbewahrungsmittel nutzen und abwarten, wie es in Griechenland nach dem Referendum weitergeht.\n\nBisher ist es alles andere als einfach, vorhandenes Bargeld in Bitcoin zu wechseln. Das ganze Land verzeichnet nur einen einzigen Bitcoin-Automaten, und der steht in Athen in einer Buchhandlung.\n\nDas zweite Problem besteht darin, innerhalb Griechenlands etwas Sinnvolles mit den digitalen Münzen anzufangen. Während Euro-Banknoten gesetzliches Zahlungsmittel sind und selbst nach einem etwaigen Austritt des Landes aus der Währungsunion aller Voraussicht nach weiter gern genommen werden, gibt es nur wenige Stellen, die Bitcoins akzeptieren.\n\nNach einer Übersicht der Webseite Bitcoin Maps gibt es in Athen etwa nur rund ein halbes Dutzend Läden, wo die Digitalwährung angenommen wird. Darunter befinden sich ein Restaurant, ein HNO-Arzt und eine Yacht-Vermietung.']"
07/05/2015,"[""The cryptocurrency Bitcoin has not been without its problems. There have been numerous hacks leading to the loss of millions of dollars, and Bitcoin mining tool Epic Scale became embroiled in a crapware scandal with uTorrent. The latest problem to hit the digital currency is a double-spending bug.\n\nAs the name suggests, this essentially makes it possible to spend the same Bitcoins twice, and it stems from a problem with a planned upgrade. An issue with some Bitcoin miners means that tests that usually prevent double-spending are not correctly performed. The problem was discovered on 4 July as many Americans were busy celebrating Independence Day.\n\nDouble-spending is supposed to be thwarted by a safety mechanism which checks the block chain (or transaction database) to check whether any given Bitcoins have been spent or not. Some Bitcoin miners are now generating invalid blocks, making it impossible to guarantee that currency can’t be spent more than once. The Bitcoin Foundation assures users that all transactions confirmed by 15:00 on 4 July are safe.\n\nAn announcement on the Bitcoin website explains:\n\nFor several months, an increasing amount of mining hash rate has been signaling its intent to begin enforcing BIP66 strict DER signatures. As part of the BIP66 rules, once 950 of the last 1,000 blocks were version 3 (v3) blocks, all upgraded miners would reject version 2 (v2) blocks. Early morning UTC on 4 July 2015, the 950/1000 (95%) threshold was reached. Shortly thereafter, a small miner (part of the non-upgraded 5%) mined an invalid block--as was an expected occurrence. Unfortunately, it turned out that roughly half the network hash rate was mining without fully validating blocks (called SPV mining), and built new blocks on top of that invalid block. Note that the roughly 50% of the network that was SPV mining had explicitly indicated that they would enforce the BIP66 rules. By not doing so, several large miners have lost over $50,000 dollars worth of mining income so far.\n\nDespite adoption by a number of big names -- including Microsoft -- many people remain skeptical of the digital currency. But there are others who believe cryptocurrencies are the future of online, and real world, transactions. With the economy failing in Greece as the country teetering on the verge of crashing out of the EU, some Greeks have converted their money into Bitcoin in an attempt to minimize the risk of devaluation.\n\nAt the moment there is no news that the problem has been exploited by anyone, but unless the vulnerability is addressed, it's only a matter of time before this happens.\n\nPhoto credit: Lightboxx / Shutterstock"", 'To say Reddit is going through some growing pains would be an understatement.\n\nThe company has struggled for a while with if, when and how to censor content on the site, as it tries to build a real business backed by venture capitalists, all while trying not to alienate the huge community of people who help power the site. And now it has a new saga on its hands after protests by scores of the unpaid moderators who help run the site took down some of the media platform’s most popular sections this past week.\n\nWell, prominent venture capitalist Fred Wilson thinks he has a solution, as he wrote in a blog post titled “The Decentral Authority” that he published today.\n\n“It may be that there is no viable middle ground between a centrally controlled media platform and an entirely decentralized media platform,” he noted, referencing the type of entity he believes Reddit is becoming versus the type of platform many of its users want it to be. “You are either going to police the site or you are going to build something that cannot be policed even if you want to.”\n\nThat uncontrollable site is coming, he says, and will “most likely will be built on the blockchain.”\n\nWhat’s the blockchain, you ask? “Essentially, just a record, or ledger, of digital events — one that’s ‘distributed,’ or shared between many different parties [or computers],” Guardtime CEO Mike Gault explained in a guest post published on Re/code today. “The bitcoin blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single bitcoin transaction ever made.”\n\nWilson doesn’t go into many details about how a blockchain-powered media platform would work. But the gist seems to be that a media platform built on top of the blockchain would not need a company to manage it because the network of people or computers that confirm each blockchain entry would collectively serve that function.\n\nWilson said his firm has seen a bunch of entrepreneurs working on such an idea and that he believes the blockchain technology is now sophisticated enough to support such an initiative. Ryan X. Charles, a bitcoin engineer who worked at Reddit for a short period of time, laid out some details on how such a decentralized media platform could work in a blog post today.\n\nThe way a decentralized reddit works is like this. Each user has an app, the reddit app, which connects to the reddit p2p network. For most users, the app is a normal web app. Each user funds their own app with a small amount of bitcoin. In order to download content, the user pays a very, very small amount of bitcoin to the peers on the network. This incentivizes people to keep the app open so as to keep servicing the other users. Furthermore, when a user upvotes content, that sends a small amount of bitcoin to the author of that content, thus incentivizing the production of good content. If all the content is authenticated, we can be reasonably sure most payments are going to the right people. In this scenario, reddit, Inc. still exists, they just don’t have a monopoly on the hosting of reddit content. Instead, anyone can run the app to host the content, and reddit, Inc. is just the biggest service provider. Any user can run a business by running the app full-time. Any user, including reddit, Inc., can censor content they themselves deliver to other users, but cannot censor content other users send to other users.\n\nThere are some caveats. First, Wilson’s firm, Union Square Ventures, has invested in several bitcoin- and blockchain-related startups, including Coinbase and Onename. So you could make the argument that Wilson and his firm would love to see winning ideas come out of this space because they could financially benefit from them. (At the same time, Wilson has long been one of the loudest bitcoin supporters.)\n\nSeparately, there are a whole host of new questions and risks that may arise when you consider a giant media platform with no central authority over it.\n\nBut with big bets on some of the biggest tech innovators of the last decade in Twitter, Tumblr and Etsy, when Wilson speaks, many smart people listen.\n\n“To be clear, this does not mean the end of Reddit or Twitter or any other of the current media platforms that are out there,” Wilson writes.\n\n“But there is also a very interesting opportunity to build a truly decentralized media platform,” he added. “I am not sure it will be a good business. I am not sure it will even be a business. But it can be a very powerful community and platform.”', 'Nick Szabo, the cryptographer and digital currency researcher who many believe to be the real identity behind Satoshi Nakamoto, has published new research in a blog post exploring how bitcoin may help Greece avoid an ultimate financial meltdown.\n\nThe ongoing financial crisis in Greece is becoming more aggravated and the country’s accumulated debt has surpassed 175% of the nation’s GDP. The root of the current Greek financial crisis, explains Szabo, lies in the fact that the Greek government has spent 75% more than the GDP generated with its economy.\n\nHow Bitcoin Could Help\n\nBitcoin’s main advantage is its potential use case as an international borderless payment method for investments and assets overseas, and to “substitute for cash or other substitute currencies in a money-starved environment,” Szabo states.\n\nBitcoin, however, will not help the Greeks from withdrawing money out of their frozen bank accounts, he said. For the Greeks to avoid the current capital controls environment, they will have to prevent themselves from using “Greek-based-fiat-bitcoin” exchange “to futilely try to tap into their frozen bank accounts.” Szabo explained:\n\n“To have value as a medium of exchange, bitcoin must be taken up by a community of people who already frequently trade with each other, and who have a strong need to use it in these trades. It is especially important to market to the links in the cycle that have the strongest negotiating leverage with the others (in the case of [...] the Greek store scrip cycle, the store and its larger suppliers).”\n\nBitcoin could also help with the emergence of cross-border commerce issues. For example, exporters and freelancers can introduce the digital currency to the country, to avoid its payments from being locked up in frozen bank accounts which cannot be withdrawn or simply cannot be used.\n\nBitcoin could also be used by importers pay for goods instead of other electronic payment platforms like PayPal and credit cards, since the accounts are frozen and cannot be transferred abroad.\n\nThe Effects of the Banks’ Decisions\n\nTo cover up its excess expenses, the government has borrowed money from its neighboring nations, piling debt on more debt each year. With the fear that the crisis may potentially lead the nation towards a full economic collapse, Greek banks have set plans for a “bail-in” to confiscate a certain percentage of unsecured deposits.\n\nAs previously reported by CoinTelegraph, the Greek banks announced on July 4 that they will withdraw at least 30% of deposit accounts with balances as low as 8,000 euros. The announcements have caused the Greeks to rush to ATMs and banks to withdraw all of their savings if possible.\n\nHowever, the Greeks were limited to withdrawing 50 euros per day, and with the bank accounts frozen, businesses have stopped accepting debit cards. Furthermore, the banks have banned the use of credit and debit cards out of the country, which ultimately forced the country to be ejected from the pan-European money settlement system, disallowing Greek business to pay for imports and resulting in the rejection of many shipments into the country.', 'According to the following infographic from Coupofy, Bitcoin usage on Overstock.com tends toward everyday, household items.\n\nThe image visualizes data that the creators have culled from various sources about the usage of bitcoins, and notably, transaction volume using Bitcoin as a currency increased by almost 100% between 2013 and 2014, despite the downward trajectory of the Bitcoin price all last year.\n\nThe subject of bitcoins the currency versus Bitcoin the investment strategy has been a common theme throughout the history of the technology. While the technology was propelled by early adopters who saw the value of transparency in transactions as well as digital precision in remittance, the first successful use case of bitcoins was truly in dark net markets like the Silk Road, where its censorship-resistance and difficulty to track made it unique among options. Indeed, Silk Road couldn’t have happened without something like bitcoins.\n\nThe jury is still out on 2015 and Bitcoin more generally, but it seems that if trends like those depicted in the graphic continue, “mass adoption” could be a reality within our lifetime. The question of what mass adoption really means, however, has yet to be settled. Some believe that it means hundreds of millions or even billions of people holding Bitcoin wallets and intimately familiar with how the currency works. Others define it more as a situation wherein most transactions are handled by the Bitcoin network but very few actually come into contact with bitcoins.\n\nWhat do you think? Is merchant adoption an important aspect in the progress of Bitcoin, or a sideshow that doesn’t matter in the end?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Markets are reacting now that Greece has decisively voted no.\n\nAs of 12:15 PST Bitcoin was at five month high, trading at $268.\n\nThe euro is getting walloped.\n\nSpot gold opened slightly higher at $1,173 per ounce but slid.\n\nWith Greeks voting no to the EU\'s demands, the country is more likely to leave the euro. Greece may also default on debt obligations and return to the drachma, it\'s former currency.\n\nThe prime minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, says he is committed to ongoing negotiation.

French president Francois Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel will also hold a meeting on Monday.\n\nToday we celebrate the victory of #democracy.

VPN is one of the widely used service provided by number of companies across the world. These VPN services help internet users circumvent internet censorship and access blocked content in different geographies. VPN is also being increasingly used as a way to hide one’s identity as companies offering VPN services claims they offer anonymity and privacy.\n\nBitcoin is known for security and the anonymity associated with it. These features along with the technology behind bitcoins in the form of Blockchain which acts as a ledger and maintains records of each transaction has been responsible for the increased popularity of the digital currency. It is a common practice for many to use TOR (The Onion Router) and VPN services to mask their identity while making bitcoin transactions or surfing the deep web. Bitcoin transactions are considered to be pseudonymous, not anonymous. The anonymity part is associated only with the wallet address whereas transactions between wallets is publicly visible. However, with the right set of tools and expertise it is still possible to find the identity of the person associated with a particular bitcoin wallet.\n\nLet’s accept the fact that Bitcoin was popularized by its adoption as the currency of choice in the deep web. People could buy drugs, weapons and other illegal stuff from deep web marketplaces like Silk Road and Agora. In order to ensure that the online activity isn’t monitored by law enforcement agencies, people prefer using IP masking services like VPN and TOR protocol.\n\nFor those who have become too comfortable with VPN as a security layer for protecting privacy and maintain anonymity, they are out of luck. According to a study conducted by a group of researchers from Queen Mary University in London and Sapienza University in Rome, VPN services are not as good as the companies claim them to be. They tested over 14 most popular commercial VPN services to find that most of them leak IP information and some may even be vulnerable to DNS hijacking attacks.\n\nCommercial VPN services like Astrill, IPVanish, ExpressVPN, TorGuard, Tunnelbear, Hide My Ass and Hotspot Shield Elite are some of 14 VPN service analysed. With most of these services still operating on outdated technology, they end up leaking small amounts of IPv6 traffic which can be detected by the public and used to gain access to entire web browsing history of the user.\n\nHowever, in spite reports of TOR network being compromised, It is still the best out there in comparison to VPN services. So, those interested in maintaining their privacy, can go back to using Tor over a VPN service, or just TOR instead of relying only upon VPN.', 'A recent article by Forbes shows that Frontline Media Publications have started accepting the fact that Bitcoin is emerging as a leading option to help remittance market not just reduce cost but increase speed as well.\n\nAlso Read: BitPesa Expands Bitcoin Remittance Service to Tanzania\n\nThe blog post says:\n\nThe global economy spent approximately $44 billion last year on fees for remittances. Remittances—money sent from one country to another—most often goes to low-income households and is proven to reduce the overall poverty of a given nation. They also come with high transaction fees and long transfer delays—significant obstacles to people trying to pull themselves out of poverty.\n\nFrom the outset, it appears crystal clear that new technologies like Bitcoin can serve the purpose well for those who cannot afford to pay hefty fees charged by the traditional payment processor. The blogger writes about the existing financial infrastructure and calls it is still in pre-Internet days that prevents the currency from traveling efficiently. However, he believes digital currency protocols are especially significant for global remittances. He particularly mentions Bitcoin which is being used by some technology startups to help alleviate the cost of remittances. Bitcoin being a peer-to-peer currency that works freely on the internet, helps people transfer money at reduced charges than the traditional banking methods.\n\nHow big is Remittance Market?\n\nMass unemployment, the huge income gap between developed and developing or under-developed nations has created a huge number of people who look for employment opportunities other than where they live. Today, workers’ remittances are a significant part of international capital flows, especially with regard to labor-exporting countries. This news report from Business Standard says:\n\nRemittances growth to slow sharply in 2015, as Europe and Russia stay weak; pick up expected next year. Total remittances in 2014 reached $583 billion. This is more than double the official development assistance (ODA) in the world. India received $70 billion, China $64 billion, the Philippines $28 billion. In line with the expected global economic recovery next year, the global flows of remittances are expected to accelerate by 4.1% in 2016, to reach an estimated $610 billion, rising to $636 billion in 2017. Remittance flows to developing countries are expected to recover in 2016 to reach $459 billion, rising to $479 billion in 2017.\n\nBitcoin is Fresh Air in the Exploitative Remittance Market\n\nSome Bitcoin payment processing companies like Igot, Beam, BitPesa and BitX have spotted an opportunity to build Bitcoin businesses in Africa and other continents. As Forbes states:\n\nA core cause of high fees for remittances is friction—money moves slowly and inefficiently from one country to another. Transferring money is expensive because there are limited connections between financial institutions and systems. Currently, we don’t have a neutral network to tie our disparate, siloed institutions together and move money cheaply and seamlessly.\n\nBitcoin can be a solution for people who may have to pay up to 10% of the total remittance. This is an exploitative system, particularly for those who are living on $2 or $3 a day.\n\nSeveral Operating Models for Bitcoin Transactions\n\nEven through digital, remittance remains deeply dependent on third parties as banks are still validating money transfers from senders to the remittance operator and again to recipients. Bitcoin allows customers have access to several operating models e.g. full Bitcoin, From Bitcoin to fiat currency, from fiat currency to fiat currency. The three different operating models that are available for customers are:\n\nFull Bitcoin\n\nThis option is available or suitable only for those who are living in advanced/developed countries as the sender owns Bitcoins he sends to the recipient who can directly use them. The customers need to have access to e-wallets and exchange platforms like Coinbase in the US.\n\nFrom Bitcoin to Fiat\n\nThis is the model that has huge prospects in the remittance market. The sender has an easy access to Bitcoins he sends to the remittance operator that sends fiat to the recipient. The fundamental assumption in this model is that developing countries have easy access to Bitcoins wallets but paying with Bitcoins is very limited especially in developing countries. The author of this story falls in this category.\n\nFrom Fiat to Fiat\n\nThe sender pays its local money to the remittance operator that sends fiat to the recipient, using Bitcoins to transfer money from one currency to another.\n\nBitcoin is truly a game changer in the remmitence markets.\n\nImage source: The Guardian, PixaBay\n\nOriginally posted on: Bitcoin is Transforming the Remittance Market Around the World', 'Name: Reveal\n\nWhat it is: A social networking question-and-answer app for mobile.\n\nWho’s behind it: Led by the former founders of Kindr and gossip website JuicyCampus, Reveal has raised $1.5m from Boost VC and Digital Currency Group, among other investors.\n\nCost: Free\n\nDate launched: 16th June, 2015.\n\nBasic summary: Reveal is a SnapChat-like social network that allows users to ask questions and answer via photo or video. The social network uses reveal coin, an asset on the Stellar network, as its ""currency of attention"", allowing users a means to incentivize interaction.\n\nCoinDesk rating: 4.5/5\n\nThe basics\n\nLike most social networks, Reveal is a somewhat bizarre and often entertaining journey into mundane life, with users dedicating posts to everything from evidence of their omelette-flipping abilities to their thoughts on age-old questions about wealth and fame.\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, the app happens to include a built-in cryptocurrency (reveal coin) that users currently earn based on the number of others they invite to the network (tracked through referrals) and how many likes their content receives. Reveal currently offers 100 RVL for every \'like\', 1,000 RVL upon enrolment and 10,000 RVL for every new member a user invites, though these figures will change over time, the company says.\n\nIn the future, users will also be able to earn off the app\'s ad revenue and, potentially, for new actions the company wants to incentivize. Reveal intends to keep 75% of its reveal coin as an investment in the future performance of the asset, which will gain in value as advertisers remove RVL from the system through purchases.\n\nThere will only ever be a total of 52bn RVL, with 13bn allotted to app users.\n\nUsing the service\n\nReveal\'s signup process is quick and painless, requiring only a few simple steps.\n\nTo enroll, a user provides their first and last name and can opt to connect their Twitter account. Next, they are asked to connect an email account and phone number (verified by SMS message), then signup is complete.\n\nClick the gallery below to view more images of the app in use:\n\nNavigating the app\n\nOnce inside, users gain the ability to view and navigate posts in three streams, one devoted to friends, the other to trending posts and the final to all posts on the network.\n\nTrue to its name, the video or photos appear with an exterior layer designed to be peeled away so users can \'reveal\' the content within. Often, the outside of the posts takes shape with a messy combination of text, emoticons, colors and patterns offered by the app.\n\nPosting content\n\nFollowing a bit of an exploration, users who want to make an appearance can click a blue-green arrow in the top-right corner, which will access the app\'s camera.\n\nFrom there, users click to take a photo or press and hold to take a video (which can easily be erased with a back click). Videos on the service are limited to 15 seconds, with those who film for too long seeing a red bar signal time is winding down.\n\nAlso available on this screen is the option to choose how long the photo or video stays accessible to potential viewers, with users being able to limit this window to 24 hours.\n\nOnce the interior content has been created, users are able to draft a cover slide (adding their own messy exterior), then click \'post\' to share with others.\n\nAsking a question\n\nOne of the most advertised features of app is the ability for reveal coin to be used to incentivize other users to answer questions.\n\nFor example, fans of Vine stars like the Miuccio brothers (three muscled beach dwellers with 18,000 YouTube followers and 732,000 Vine followers) are able to ask questions with reveal coin attached. The more reveal coin attached, the higher the message appears in the user\'s inbox and the more likely they are, in theory, to post a response.\n\nThe incentive is also only for a limited time, as after 24 hours, those who post unanswered questions with reveal coin attached are returned the funds.\n\nUsers can also answer questions sent to them via the questions tab (accessed by clicking the three horizontal lines on the left side of the screen) or start Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions that invite other users to engage with them.\n\nMaking friends\n\nAs with other popular social networks, Reveal users are able to follow others with relative ease, clicking their photo beneath the content to access their profile page.\n\nIn line with its mobile-first design, profiles showcase a picture and a one or two sentence \'about\' section alongside metrics for how many followers the user has gained and how many posts they have made.\n\nThe profile also encourages engagement, with a prominent \'ask\' bar displayed on the page.\n\nPros\n\nContent columns ease navigation\n\nEasy to use and friendly for non-technical demographics\n\nElegant design enables feature-rich environment in mobile setting\n\nFormat encourages creativity and engagement\n\nImpressive following ensures stream of new content\n\nCons\n\nCurrently no way to withdraw or sell reveal coin\n\nDifficult to access reveal coin (requires setting up Stellar account)\n\nSome app crashes\n\nLengthy reveal coin materials may turn off young user base\n\nCompetitors\n\nReveal would be best considered a competitor to more established social networks as well as those seeking to appeal to users with ethereal features.\n\nThe app also bears some similarity to past attempts at cryptocurrency-based social networks, including projects such as GetGems and ZapChain, though these apps are focused on messaging and tech community discussion, respectively.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor all those who feel the bitcoin and blockchain industry is too serious, Reveal offers a compelling breath of fresh air.\n\nThe app positions itself as a precursor to what could be a new wave of projects that prioritize user experience and use cryptocurrency as a way to experiment within established consumer-facing business models.\n\nBeautifully designed and as entertaining (or annoying) as its fervent users, Reveal also successfully piggybacks the anti-Facebook wave of social networking, using a new economic model as a way to show how cryptocurrency can create shared ownership within these platforms.\n\nToday, however, Reveal arguably goes too far in putting cryptocurrency in the background, meaning enthusiasts won\'t have much to explore on the app given its limited functionality.\n\nFurther, it remains unclear how effective the reveal coin model will be at exposing new users to the technology should the ability to trade the coins for real-world value continue to be cumbersome.\n\nDisclaimer: This article represents the experience of the reviewer.

07/06/2015,"['The delayed implementation of a Bitcoin Core update by a small number of the network\'s miners resulted in the addition of invalid transaction blocks to the bitcoin blockchain this weekend.\n\nThe result was a fork in the network that created two versions of the bitcoin blockchain, which continued for six blocks on 4th July. An additional three invalid blocks were added to the blockchain in a repeat of the issue the following day.\n\nAs a result, Core developers issued a warning on Bitcoin.org requesting that wallet providers place increased scrutiny on incoming transactions due to the risk that funds could be double spent as a result of the discrepancy between chains.\n\nThe post, which is still live on the website, is advising these entities wait an additional 30 confirmations before considering transactions valid.\n\nRoot of the problem\n\nAt the heart of the issue is arguably the decentralized nature of the bitcoin blockchain and the degree of control over which its participants have in how they contribute to the verification of transactions on the digital currency\'s distributed ledger.\n\nThis ability for users to have some control over how they interact with the network, for example, results in miners being able to neglect software changes and for the network to carry on even if they do.\n\nAs a precaution, Core developers have taken to waiting for a majority of the miners to implement changes. In this case, BIP66 – a bitcoin soft fork designed to make the network less dependent on OpenSSL\'s signature parsing – stated that certain transaction blocks created without this update would be considered invalid once the majority – 950 out of 1,000 blocks – were mined with the latest version.\n\nIn theory, the risk of an issue was low, with only 5% of the network running the outdated version of BIP66. However, in practice, three pools running light versions of software elements were able to process six consecutive blocks that should have been invalid, creating two versions of the bitcoin blockchain, the longest of which was operating on an older software.\n\nIn this case, certain mining pools were SPV mining, meaning that they were not validating the full version of the bitcoin blockchain. In turn, these invalid blocks were being considered valid by bitcoin wallet providers and block explorers running SPV versions of software as opposed to full nodes with the entire history of the ledger.\n\nFabio Federici, CEO of blockchain intelligence provider Coinalytics, explained to CoinDesk:\n\n""SPV clients were claiming they would follow the BIP66 rules, but they were not actually enforcing them. A big part of the mining network is not running on full nodes, which would validate every transaction.""\n\nThough initiated by F2Pool, should the other mining pools have been running a full node to process the entirety of the bitcoin blockchain, invalid blocks should have been more quickly detected.\n\nCommon consensus\n\nThough not unusual with software updates, the situation was noteworthy as the invalid block was subsequently built upon by the larger mining network.\n\nPeter Gray, founder of bitcoin developer API Coinkite, noted that issues with software updates are common, resulting from the continual upgrades being made to the payment network.\n\n""I think it\'s useful to remind people that forks happen every week on bitcoin. Typically only a single block gets orphaned in a typical week, and it\'s not a bug or attack or anything; just the way bitcoin works,"" Gray said.\n\nMining firms that solved invalid blocks lost income as a result of the need to correct the issue, with Bitcoin.org estimating that $50,000 in revenue was effectively withheld from F2Pool, AntPool and BTC Nuggets, the three mining pools that effectively created and briefly propagated the invalid chain.\n\nRewards were ultimately never paid as the 25 BTC winnings per block was sent to a bitcoin wallet that invalidated the blocks after syncing with the valid chain.\n\nAfter effects\n\nIn its warning, Bitcoin.org, said customers whose bitcoin transactions were confirmed before midnight (UTC) on 6th July have not been affected by the glitch, though transactions carried out after this time are believed to have ""significantly less reliable"" confirmation scores.\n\nBitcoin.org explained the confirmation of invalid blocks is due to software clients not upgrading to Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 or later and warned that lightweight wallets using SPV and web wallets were particularly vulnerable to the bug.\n\nWarning the issue remained unresolved, Bitcoin.org urged users to ""wait 30 more confirmations"" than usual before accepting a transaction as valid. It also recommended that miners switch to a pool that validates transaction blocks using a full node and that individual miners use Bitcoin Core 0.10.2.\n\nAs for larger takeaways, those who provided comment suggested the event should be used as a reminder of the need for key bitcoin network participants to run full nodes.\n\n""The key takeaway is the distribution of full nodes versus SPV nodes. Everyone should run a full node, and maybe it doesn\'t make sense economically or there are other benefits of an SPV client, but that comes with the risk,"" Federici continued.\n\nYessi Bello-Perez contributed reporting.\n\nFork in road image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It\'s spread across thousands of computers and servers globally.\n\nIt lets people exchange bitcoin by spreading the record of exchanges and ownership history across a wide area. It adds a layer of trust that is essential to bitcoin — everyone can check a coin hasn\'t been double spent and is actually owned by the person claiming to.\n\nPalychata says that if this type of technology is applied to securities trading — the world of buying and selling company shares — then ""existing industry players might be redundant.""\n\nIf investors can trade shares directly with each other in a system that has a layer of trust built into it then middle men — stock brokers — aren\'t needed anymore.\n\nThat\'s a huge thing for an investment bank to say, especially one of BNP Paribas\' size — it\'s France\'s biggest bank.\n\nMost banks have been keen to play down the competition from financial technology, or fintech, startups, saying new technology presents opportunities rather than threats.\n\nFalling technology costs and the disruption that followed the financial crisis of 2008 have lead to a wave of innovation and competition for banks. Bitcoin and the blockchain are some of the most cutting edge financial experiments we\'ve seen.\n\nBanks like Santander and Barclays are investing in and experimenting with financial technology of their own, saying it\'s a good chance to improve their own services.\n\nBut the truth — as Palychata makes clear — is these banks are being forced to innovate. While its unlikely that any one of hundreds of startups currently springing up will replace Santander or Barclays, banks face death by a thousand cuts as startups attack different parts of their businesses from multiple angels. If they don\'t do something soon it will start to affect the bottom line.\n\nPalychata\'s scenario of blockchain being applied to stock trading isn\'t such an outlandish scenario either — US exchange operator Nasdaq is currently experimenting with the blockchain.\n\nThat said, Palychata\'s ""redundant"" prediction is a worst case scenario. He believes it\'s more likely that stock broking firms will adopt the blockchain technology to trade among themselves, rather than offer it directly to consumers.\n\nAnd even if a startup or coder builds a blockchain for trading shares and opens it directly to the public, Palychata thinks the security issues around keeping private keys — the access codes used to get digital assets traded on the blockchain — means current firms could develop a new role as the guardians of these keys.\n\nBut the fact that an analyst is using the word ""redundant"" shows how seriously banks are taking this threat.', 'If you have an online brokerage account, you can now buy shares in a fund that aims to track the price of the digital currency called bitcoin. Just don’t expect a smooth ride.\n\nBitcoin is a highly speculative investment—the kind most financial advisers say investors should only buy into with money they can afford to lose. But some analysts think the new fund could bring the digital currency a step closer to broader acceptance by...', 'Traders seem to have booked partial profits in their long positions as Bitcoin traded higher. Realizing that the massive gains have come in a very short period of time, they liquidated their positions thereby bringing the price down to its near-term support of $267.\n\nBitcoin is now trading up 0.73% at $270.97.\n\nImage: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sXPfY9X6/\n\nTechnical analysis of the 240-minute BTC-USD price chart suggests that bulls continue to have a tight grip over the situation. However, the recent price action also indicates that Bitcoin may consolidate for a brief period before making another move.\n\nBitcoin Chart Structure – As can be seen from the chart above, Bitcoin went on to touch a fresh 3-month high of $278.54 as the Greece crisis continued to worsen. But, a bout of profit booking forced the price down by $10 to $268, which has previously acted as a support level for the cryptocurrency.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence – Both MACD and Signal Line are reflecting strong positive levels. The MACD indicator value reads 4.4244 while the Signal Line value is 3.8655. The Histogram value has witnessed a considerable cut; from yesterday’s 1.6789 to the present 0.5589.\n\nMomentum – The Momentum indicator is strongly in support of the buyers with a value of 10.8500.\n\nRelative Strength Index – The underlying strength has eased a little, pulling the value from near-overbought to more stable levels. The latest 14-4h RSI value is 59.9859.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin has had a great run during the Greece crisis, and calls of Bitcoin hitting $300 by the end of this week are getting louder.

Traders can consider building light long positions at the current level for a target of $275 by placing a stop-loss below $267.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Yet if you spend a few hours in their presence, you realize that they are the closest thing the tech world has to a movement with a vision for changing the world.\n\nGet The Start-Up Israel's Daily Start-Up by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nIt’s the June meeting of the Israel Bitcoin Association, held at the Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy.\n\n“We need to educate and lobby the government about bitcoin,” says Eden Schochat, a partner at the Aleph Venture Capital firm, which has invested in at least one bitcoin startup, COLU. “If we could get (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu to say something positive about bitcoin, that would be a great start.”\n\nIn August 2014, the Bank of Israel formed a committee to study the bitcoin issue; it has yet to issue any guidelines.\n\nBut the men gathered at the Bitcoin Embassy believe history is on their side. The bathroom walls are covered with graffiti. “Bitcoin is an international language of liberty that destroys barriers and oppression!” reads one. Or “Bitcoin is the Moses of the third millennium.”\n\nFervor rekindled\n\nYou would be forgiven for thinking bitcoin is an idea whose time has passed.\n\nBack in 2013, the digital currency rose from a value of $20 to $1,242 per coin in a single year. Then the currency began to plummet, followed by a series of high-profile losses and scams. The Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange collapsed, losing $477 million worth of its customers’ bitcoin to hackers. Another $11 million have reportedly been lost in bitcoin scams since 2011.\n\nOne website found that bitcoin has been declared dead in the media no fewer than 71 times.\n\nBut the folks at the Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy don’t seem to have gotten the memo. While the number of global bitcoin transactions has held steady since all the bad news emerged at the beginning of 2014, quietly, under the radar, Israel’s community of bitcoin enthusiasts is growing. In 2013, the Israel Bitcoin Meetup Group had 100 members; today it has 1,800. The number of businesses accepting bitcoin has grown from a handful to 230, and there are currently 30 bitcoin-based startups, according to Gitai Zakh, a consultant to these startups.\n\nEden Schochat is just one of the venture capitalists prowling for opportunity in the bitcoin trenches. In January of this year bitcoin-based startup GetGems raised $400,000 from Magma Partners, while the same month COLU raised $2.5 million from local and US-based funds. The amount of venture capital going to bitcoin-based startups globally has spiked from a mere $98 million in all of 2013 to $229 million in just the first quarter of 2015.\n\nAs Marc Andreesen, one of the world’s most celebrated venture capitalists, put it recently, “One can hardly accuse bitcoin of being an uncovered topic, yet the gulf between what the press and many regular people believe bitcoin is, and what a growing critical mass of technologists believe bitcoin is, remains enormous.”\n\nJonathan Rouach, a Technion-educated engineer and the founder of Bits of Gold, told The Times of Israel, “If you focus on the price of bitcoin, that’s a mistake. The original enthusiasm about bitcoin was about two things. There were people who looked at the price going up, at nerds getting rich really quickly. But there were also people who made the effort to understand the underlying technology, like Bill Gates, who fell in love with the mathematics of it.”\n\nNouveau riches\n\nIn this view, bitcoin is not just a currency. It’s a groundbreaking new concept and a paradigm shift.\n\n“Bitcoin is an invention that opened up a brand new way of moving value and tracking ownership of things,” Rouach said.\n\nThe problem that bitcoin solves, according to Rouach, is that before the Internet, you could just give someone cash without any need for a middleman, but that’s not the case anymore.\n\n“Once we moved to the digital world, one person couldn’t hand cash to another. We’re forced to ask a third party, like a bank, to please move 50 shekels from my account and add it to your account. This is a loss of freedom.”\n\nWith bitcoin, he says, anyone can transfer money to anyone else in the world with a click. It goes directly from person A to person B with no intermediary, no wait and a negligible fee. “No entity in the world can stop me.”\n\nThe way this works is through a ledger known as the blockchain, which plays the record-keeping role that a bank or PayPal would otherwise play.\n\n“You take this huge ledger and make thousands of copies, which are distributed on the Internet among participants in the bitcoin network. They update that ledger on a timely basis to reach one consensus after another.”\n\nIn other words, the records of your transaction are not kept in a bank, but in a decentralized ledger.\n\nThis dis-intermediation of banks has practical benefits. For instance, the bitcoin Embassy frequently gets visits from foreign workers who convert small amounts, say 200 shekels, into bitcoin and send it back to their native Nigeria.Bitcoin is important for two reasons, says Rouach: the practical uses it has now and the creative ways engineers and developers are building on it.\n\n“It’s cheaper than Western Union,” he notes.\n\n“It also lowers barriers to entry for businesses and prevents haircuts,” says Rouach, referring to the practice of tycoons receiving loans, then having them erased if a company under their control fails. The practice of haircuts has been a source of popular anger in Israel because some see it as a form of subsidy for the wealthy by the rest of the population.\n\nIn addition, bitcoin makes micropayments easy and effortless, allowing readers to pay 5 cents for an article they enjoyed or contribute $1 to a Kickstarter campaign. Micropayments have been touted as one way to save the journalism industry but have been impractical to implement before bitcoin.\n\nDecentralizing the Internet economy\n\nBut the really hot topic in the cryptocurrency movement these days, the one that gets bitcoin activists fired up, is decentralizing the Internet.\n\n“The blockchain didn’t exist five years ago,” notes Ayal Segev, an architect who donated his studio to what is now the Bitcoin Embassy.\n\n“It allows computers to work together in a synchronized way without there being a server or central computer coordinating their activity. This is a very big deal. As humans, we can work together in groups of four or five without a commander. But 50 people need a commander and 500 people need some sort of management structure. Because they can do very fast computations, computers can work together in groups of millions with no hierarchy.”\n\nWhat this means is that you can use the blockchain to create organizational structures that are peer-to-peer instead of hub-and-spoke. Segev cited wildly popular social sites to make his point.\n\n“Facebook is a benevolent dictator. Mark Zuckerberg or Jimmy Wales at Wikipedia are in charge. But what happens to the system when they go? Whoever comes along can introduce censorship. They can control your access to information.”\n\nSegev says that a system where so much power is concentrated in the hands of companies with centralized servers, like Google or Facebook, is a temporary phase.\n\n“If we could copy social networks to a technology like the blockchain, there would be no Facebook. It could run without a manager.”\n\nAccording to Matan Field, a theoretical physicist and CEO of BackFeed, this decentralization idea has become the next big thing in the bitcoin movement over the last six to twelve months.\n\n“A lot of people had the same idea at the same time in different places around the world. People realized you can do much more with the blockchain than just a monetary system or currency.”\n\nHe credits this idea to Vitalik Buterin, the 21-year-old Russian-Canadian whiz kid who in 2013 founded Ethereum, a platform for building and running decentralized applications, which raised $18 million last year purely through crowdfunding. Ethereum was followed by Augur, OneName and Storj, to name a few startups, as well as the Israel-based companies Synereo, GetGems, Lazooz (also founded by Field) and BackFeed.\n\nWhat these startups have in common is that they seek to distribute the rewards and income of the digital economy more broadly. For instance, a musician whose song gets listened to 100,000 times will not have to stand by as Spotify or Pandora reaps the profits from his creativity. A photographer whose photo gets shared will receive micropayments from viewers, rather than letting Instagram or Google monetize her labor through advertising. A decentralized Uber would more or less be a cooperative of taxi drivers. Earlier this month, OpenBazaar raised $1 million for a decentralized version of eBay. The tech and business media went crazy, with Fortune magazine declaring, “OpenBazaar could be America’s most dangerous tech star.” Writ large, a decentralized Internet will bolster the middle class and reduce income inequality, its boosters claim.\n\nNeeded: Trust\n\nInside the Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy, four “ambassadors” are chatting, eating pistachios and working on their projects. An electric sign flashes the bitcoin-shekel exchange rate, while visitors pop in to convert shekels to bitcoin at the embassy’s ATM machine.\n\n“I created this space,” says Segev, “for the community, because we need more than digital forums. We need a physical space where people learn to trust each other and make personal connections.”\n\nIn Israel, Rouach estimates there are 10,000-15,000 bitcoin owners, with estimates worldwide at about 10 million.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin has staunch detractors.\n\n“The most important reason I wouldn’t transact in bitcoin is it’s not backed by anything. A US dollar is backed by the US government,” says Ari Dobner, CEO of FinTech startup ClearShift. “A single regulatory change can send bitcoin’s value to almost nothing in a single day.”\n\nDobner adds that while he admires the blockchain technology, “it doesn’t mean that bitcoins themselves are worth anything.”\n\nSegev admits that most people involved in the bitcoin movement are tech professionals\n\n“Right now we’re creating the infrastructure. We need non-techies who understand this to translate it to a wider audience. If a million people came and said, ‘give us bitcoin,’ we can’t support that yet,” he says, referring to the fact that the blockchain can currently only support four to seven transactions per second. This is the case despite the fact that bitcoin has been largest human endeavor in terms of computation for last two years, according to Rouach.\n\nSo is bitcoin doomed to die?\n\nNo, says Rouach, who half-jokingly describes bitcoin as a life system of its own that uses humans to perpetuate itself. But rather than empowering the middle class, he predicts bitcoin will empower artificial intelligence.\n\nFor instance, there could be a drone delivery service paid with bitcoin. When a drone earns enough bitcoin, it orders parts for a new drone on Amazon and pays a human to be its eyes and hands and assemble the parts, adding a second drone to its fleet.\n\n“Humans are merely labor for the machine. Humans become irrelevant and bitcoin becomes its own power.”\n\nRouach says bitcoin or another cryptocurrency is historically inevitable because now that bitcoin exists, someone somewhere will get computers to run bitcoin. Because the system is decentralized, this process can’t be stopped.\n\n“There are incentives today –and they will continue to exist tomorrow — for this experiment to run forever. Or at least that is the belief of most people in this community. This experiment has now reached a point of no return. We want to see where it goes.”\n\nYes, but is the outcome utopian or dystopian?\n\nRouach smiles. “That depends on us.”"", 'Silicon Valley entrepreneur Wences Casares has lost his motion to dismiss a fraud lawsuit brought by former employer LifeLock (LOCK), thus setting the stage for discovery and a possible trial that could cause troubles for one of the country’s hottest bitcoin startups.\n\nCasares currently is founder and CEO of Xapo, a bitcoin storage and wallet company that has raised $40 million and compiled an advisory board that includes former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. He previously ran a digital wallet company called Lemon, which was acquired in December 2013 by Lifelock, after which Casares and most of the Lemon team became LifeLock employees.\n\nWhat happened next is the crux of a lawsuit first reported on by Fortune last month. LifeLock claims that Casares would go on to form Xapo by “using a product developed by Lemon employees, in Lemon’s facilities, on Lemon’s computers, and on Lemon’s dime.” Casares argues that LifeLock didn’t originally want any of Lemon’s bitcoin-related assets, and that he subsequently secured letters from a senior LifeLock executive to that effect.\n\nCasares has not yet formally responded to the LifeLock lawsuit, but he did file a demurrer — the similar to a motion to dismiss, in which defendants don’t actually refute plaintiff allegations — that was largely based on the aforementioned letters. California Superior Court Judge Peter Kirwan last week overruled the demurrer on all four of LifeLock’s causes of action, and told Cesares that he must reply to the complaint by July 24.\n\nA LifeLock spokeswoman said that the company is “pleased with the ruling but can’t comment further on pending litigation.” A representative for Casares did not return a request for comment.', 'What\'s next for Reddit? After the abrupt dismissal of a popular staff member saw its volunteer moderators take hundreds of the site\'s most popular communities offline in protest, some users have speculated that this is the beginning of the end for the community-driven news site.\n\nBut there\'s another, far more radical vision for Reddit (or a site just like it): A decentralised, bitcoin-powered community that is impossible to shut down, impossible to censor.\n\nIt\'s the free speech advocate\'s dream — and it\'s not as unrealistic as you might think.\n\nSimilar projects are already thriving, and two new blog posts published on Sunday have made clear just how close we already are.\n\nBitcoin, meet Reddit\n\nFirst we have Fred Wilson, a prominent venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures. Wilson suggests taking one of the underlying principles of bitcoin — the blockchain — and applying to Reddit. The blockchain, if you\'re unfamiliar with it, is a decentralised ledger that stores every transaction made on the bitcoin network. It means there is no need for a central bank to keep a record of who\'s spending what, because everyone has the record. It also means that because everyone has a copy, it is all but impossible to censor.\n\nApply that principle to Reddit and it gives you a community, collectively powered by its users, that is impossible to censor. It\'s the techno-libertarian dream of effectively limitless free speech.\n\nMany of Reddit\'s recent woes have come from the tensions that have risen between the site\'s support of free speech, and the reality of having to police a website for abusive, offensive, or illegal content. (Many users were outraged when the site banned r/FatPeopleHate, a community dedicated to — you guessed it! — hating fat people.)\n\nWilson suggests that, actually, ""it may be that there is no viable middle ground between a centrally controlled media platform and an entirely decentralized media platform. You are either going to police the site or you are going to build something that cannot be policed even if you want to.""\n\nHe goes on: ""The interesting thing about an entirely decentralized media platform is that you can have clients that choose to curate, police, and censor and clients that choose not to ... The demand is there. The supply (technology) is there. And we’ve seen a bunch of teams working on this. I think one or more will get it right. And I think that will happen soon.""\n\nThis isn\'t just a thought experiment\n\nInteresting hypothetical idea, right? Well, it gets a lot more exciting when you take into account the fact that Reddit has previously tried to do exactly this.\n\nA second blog post, published by former Reddit engineer Ryan X. Charles on Sunday, sheds new light on internal experiments at Reddit. Charles, though no longer working at the company, was hired as a ""cryptocurrency engineer,"" to help develop a digital currency for the site.\n\nBut, he writes, ""we actually had a secret, higher priority goal: We wanted to decentralise Reddit.""\n\nIn a discussion last year with then-CEO Yishan Wong, Charles was told that the company ""had a high-level plan of decentralizing reddit in the works, and they needed someone to execute this vision. Soon thereafter, I left my job at BitPay, the leading bitcoin payment processing company, to join reddit, Inc. My primary goal at reddit on Day 1 was to decentralize reddit.""\n\nUltimately, the plans never came to fruition. Wong parted ways with Reddit, as did Charles just months later after a large funding round. But how might it have operated? The engineer gives an example:\n\nEach user has an app, the reddit app, which connects to the reddit p2p network. For most users, the app is a normal web app. Each user funds their own app with a small amount of bitcoin. In order to download content, the user pays a very, very small amount of bitcoin to the peers on the network. This incentivizes people to keep the app open so as to keep servicing the other users. Furthermore, when a user upvotes content, that sends a small amount of bitcoin to the author of that content, thus incentivizing the production of good content. If all the content is authenticated, we can be reasonably sure most payments are going to the right people.\n\nIn this scenario, reddit, Inc. still exists, they just don’t have a monopoly on the hosting of reddit content. Instead, anyone can run the app to host the content, and reddit, Inc. is just the biggest service provider. Any user can run a business by running the app full-time. Any user, including reddit, Inc., can censor content they themselves deliver to other users, but cannot censor content other users send to other users.\n\nDecentralised networks are far closer than you realise\n\nBitcoin is the highest-profile realisation of a blockchain-powered app, but it\'s not the only one. One of the other significant examples is OpenBazaar. Originally developed as a successor to online drug marketplace Silk Road, it has evolved to become a decentralised marketplace that lets users buy and sell literally anything using bitcoin.\n\nAs such, OpenBazaar faces all the same challenges that any decentralised media platform would. How do you tackle harassment, or slander, or deceit? How do you deal with objectionable content? How do you persuade people to contribute processing power to the upkeep of a network that will, in all likelihood, be used to help facilitate illegal activity?\n\nIn June, OpenBazaar took $1 million in VC funding from Andreessen Horowitz, one of Silicon Valley\'s most high-profile venture capital funds, as well as Union Square Ventures — the same fund Wilson is a partner at. At the time of the funding, lead developer Brian Hoffman was candid about the fact there would inevitably be ""misuse"" of OpenBazaar by criminals, but hoped the funding round would help ""legitimise development of the protocol.""\n\nHoffman\'s argument is that as OpenBazaar is a protocol (like BitTorrent), rather than a centralised entity (like the Pirate Bay), its developers can\'t be held liable for what takes place on it — the same argument the creators of a decentralised Reddit would likely use to wash their hands of illegal content.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Hoffman told Business Insider that he thinks Wilson is ""super on point with this analysis I think.""\n\nThe developer recommends some caution: ""Being both a huge Twitter and Reddit fan I certainly think building a decentralized media company is intriguing but harder than it looks. You kind of saw the difficulty with attempts like Diaspora [an earlier decentralised social network] that never really took off. Projects like OpenBazaar and others are feverishly working to unbundle those types of businesses to push profit generation to the edges rather than by charging a toll with ads or fees in the center.\n\n""The blockchain and decentralized databases enable us to do so and those offerings are improving every day.""\n\n""A paradigm shift is happening""\n\nThe outcome of the #RedditRevolt, as some are calling it, is anyone\'s guess. More than 100,000 people signed a petition calling for CEO Ellen Pao\'s removal over the weekend, while clones like Voat.co are springing up and promising users an ""uncensored"" Reddit-like experience. But at the same time, it\'s not clear how many ""ordinary"" Reddit users — the majority of whom never even register accounts — care about these company politics.\n\nWhether it is ultimately Reddit or not, however, it is inevitable that someone experiments with building Wilson\'s idea of a decentralised media platform. After all, as Charles points out, companies are already attempting it. When that happens, OpenBazaar may provide a useful social, business, and legal blueprint to follow.\n\n""Incumbents like Reddit should be watching over their shoulders,"" Hoffman tells me, ""because a paradigm shift is happening and it\'s closer than you think.""', 'TRENTON -- State and federal authorities are investigating a cyber-attack on four Atlantic City online casino gaming sites, which were apparently targeted by a hacker who promised more disruption unless a ransom was paid in Bitcoin, officials said today.\n\nNew Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement Director David Rebuck said the attack was launched Thursday, before the long July 4th holiday weekend, and continued through Sunday.\n\n""At least four casinos were impacted and experienced downtime,"" he said. ""We\'re continuing to monitor.""\n\nHe said the four internet websites were the targets of a so-called ""distributed denial of service,"" an attack that ""floods"" a network with information, rendering it inoperable. He said the attack lasted approximately 30 minutes.\n\nAccording to Rebuck, the attack was followed by the threat of a more powerful and sustained attack ""to be initiated 24 hours later unless a Bitcoin ransom was paid.""\n\nHe did not reveal how much money was demanded in the cyber currency favored within the online world\'s black markets, but said the follow-up attack had the potential to not only negatively impact the targeted casinos, but also all business in Atlantic City who share the same internet service provider.\n\nAmong the agencies now investigating include the Division of Gaming Enforcement, the State Police, the FBI and the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness.\n\nIt is not the first time a casino has been targeted by hackers. Frank Cilluffo, director of the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University told a Congressional subcommittee in June that U.S. officials believed Iran to be responsible for a 2014 cyber-attack against the Sands Casino in Las Vegas, owned Sheldon Adelson. He said attack shut down PCs and servers ""in a cascading IT catastrophe.""\n\nDavid Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said online gaming sites in this country have not yet become a major target of hackers.\n\n""It happens quite a bit offshore,"" he noted, referring to online gambling hosted on servers outside the United States. ""Often there is a ransom demand attached.""\n\nNew Jersey began allowing internet gaming in November 2013, the third state to legalize cyberspace casinos, following Nevada and Delaware. Online wagering remains a small percentage of total revenue -- casinos won $12.5 million from people betting on computers and other devices in May, up from $10.5 million in May 2014, according to state reports.\n\nRebuck, while he did not name the casinos affected in the latest hacking incident, said they believe they know the individual responsible.\n\n""He\'s a known actor.

07/07/2015,"[""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are for the unbanked – and those who'd like to become unbanked.\n\nSome say getting your hands on the bits is hard. That may be true, but it's getting easier all the time. About nine times easier as of today:\n\n1. Wall of Coins – Set your zipcode, indicate how much you want to buy, and provide your cell phone number. Wall of Coins then texts you a password. You enter the password on their website, which confirms you order. You then have three hours to deposit your cash into the bank account of the seller.\n\nText a confirmation code back to Wall of Coins once you've made your deposit and your coins will be released to you from their escrow.\n\n2. Local Bitcoins – If it's a payment method, you'll find it on Local Bitcoins: PayPal, SEPA transfer, Western Union, meet-in-person, cash in the mail, wire transfer, even trade-for-bus-pass. Be sure to check the reputation rating of a seller before agreeing on a transaction. Local Bitcoins acts as an escrow agent.\n\n3. LibertyX – Reportedly available at 2,500+ convenience stores in North America, LibertyX will sell you your first US$1,000 in Bitcoin without any fees. After that, it's only a 1 % markup from spot price.\n\nThe downside is that they won't sell to you without your name, address, and birthday, which they “check against public records.” If you check out, you receive a PIN number which you show the c-store cashier upon handing over your cash. The cashier marks your PIN as “paid” with LibertyX, and you can then retrieve your bitcoins from the company's website.\n\n4. Paxful – Coordinating buyers and sellers all over the world, Paxful prides itself on being deposit-less and without wait times. Buyers and sellers are connected to one another via live chat, where they coordinate the digital exchange of bitcoins for many things: gift cards, WebMoney, bank transfers, Walmart2Walmart, Reloadit, PayPal, and cash bank deposits.\n\n5. Mycelium Local Trader – The Mycelium wallet now contains a section called Local Trader where you can view the buy and sell orders of Mycelium users near you. Users can then rate one another after transactions to build a reputation system to protect future users of the marketplace.\n\n6. Your Local Bitcoin Meetup – Most (if not all) major North American cities feature at least one Bitcoin meetup. They're often weekly, held somewhere informal like a pub, and are a prime spot to buy bitcoins. Check Meetup.com for up-to-date listings in your area.\n\n7. Bitcoin ATM – Though waning in popularity due to pervasive requirements of government ID scans, facial photos, and even hand prints, you can still find “non-compliant” Bitcoins ATMs in some places. These machines do what they were designed to do: give you bitcoins for your cash. Ask around at a Bitcoin meetup to see if any such machines exist where you live.\n\n8. Bitcoin-OTC – This site works on Freenode Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Bitcoin-OTC stands for “over the counter,” and the chat room allows buyers and sellers to view one another's orders and reputations. Because it requires the use of an IRC client – or at least the know-how to interact with the browser-based version – the site's not for beginners.\n\n9. BitQuick – This service is pretty simple to use – view the list of available orders, and deposit your cash at the seller's bank. Many sellers also accept the use of any credit union, while those in Europe can alternatively make a SEPA transfer. BitQuick acts as an escrow agent and even offers a Proof of Reserve.\n\nRemember to do your due diligence – trading with strangers can be risky, but not nearly as risky as keeping your money in a bank.\n\nKnow of another way to get a hold of cryptocurrency without using a bank account?

Predictably branded ‘Citicoin,’ the virtual currency was coded by Citigroup’s research and design arm, Citi Innovation. Still in the early testing phase, a patent has not been filed for the mainly open-source cryptocurrency, which is based off of Bitcoin and its core blockchain ledger technology, a chronological public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever taken place. This approach will allow for less complicated and less costly cross-border payments and other transactions.\n\nRelated: Why Billionaire Investor Reid Hoffman Is Betting Big on Bitcoin\n\nCitigroup, which has eyed distributed ledger tech over “the last few years,” also admitted to the Times that it has developed three internal blockchains to test its fledgling digital coins on.\n\nWhile the company’s inaugural foray into virtual currency is promising -- and certainly a pioneering move within the traditional financial services industry -- it’s still a ways away from being the real deal.\n\n“They [Citigroup’s blockchains] are all within the labs just now, so there is no real money passing through these systems yet,” Ken Moore, head of Citi Innovation Labs, told the Times. “They are at a pre-production level, to be clear.”\n\nRelated: Is Bitcoin Speculative Foolery or a Financial Services Breakthrough?\n\nSo far, the focus of Citigroup’s digital currency system has been on cross-border payments, with trade likely up next, Moore said.\n\nHe described Citicoin, as “an equivalent to Bitcoin,” and said it’s “up and running” within company labs in an effort to give Citigroup a head start. “It’s in the labs, but it’s to make sure we are at the leading edge of this technology and that we can exploit the opportunities within it.”\n\nCitigroup has thrown down the virtual gauntlet.

The addition of the Nigerian operations, according to the company, gives it a wider geographic reach than any other company operating on the continent.\n\nThe company was attracted to Nigeria because it is a fast-growing and highly entrepreneurial economy.

BitX is also currently working with a number of businesses to bring new products to the market.\n\nNigeria has lagged in the adoption of bitcoin due to the lack of infrastructure for it in the region, but BitX said its launch would give Nigerians access to the same products and services available to other bitcoin users around the world.', ""Over the past 24 hours, the blockchain has been inundated with small, spam-like transactions that are large in data size, but significantly small in bitcoin value transferred.\n\nAt the peak, there were more than 50,000 unconfirmed transactions waiting to be mined into a block, resulting in delays for normal transactions to be confirmed. While the network has been working to decrease this backlog — transactions are down to 31,000 at time of this article’s writing — the type of transactions that are being sent suggest this is a continuation of a stress test that has been put on the system.\n\nThere have been numerous transactions hitting the network with tiny transaction values, such as 0.0001 bitcoin being sent repeatedly. While not every transaction has been this exact size, there have been numerous others sent every second, reaching hundreds of transactions per second at the peak.\n\nFurther, the physical sizes of these transactions are significantly greater than other ones with far more value. Due to the 1 megabyte cap on block size, the mining network has found it difficult to process all these small transactions.\n\nIn the past several weeks, similar stress tests have been run to inform the debate about whether to increase the total size of a block. Many argue that increasing it past 1 megabyte would be disastrous to the system. However, Gavin Andresen has argued for increasing it to 20 megabytes so that more total transactions could fit within one block, thus preventing scenarios and delays like are currently being seen.\n\nThe current proposed solution by some miners has been to raise it to 8 megabytes. Others have suggested the implementation of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which is in development to implement hashed time-lock contracts between people.\n\nUpdate on 7/8/2015 at 10AM EST: Despite early attempts to decrease the number of backlogged transactions, TradeBlock revealed today that there are currently over 81,000 unconfirmed transactions, due to the continued spam transactions being transferred. LocalBitcoins sent out a tweet to its followers this morning urging customers to increase the transfer fee when transferring to the company so that miners are incentivized to process those transactions are first.\n\nIf you're sending #bitcoin to LocalBitcoins put a higher fee than the default to avoid having to wait because of the #blockchain spam attack — LocalBitcoins.com (@LocalBitcoins) July 8, 2015\n\nRead more about how wallet companies are responding to this disruption."", 'Bitcoin is on the rise, but not in the way you might think.\n\nThe cryptocurrency, which uses strong encryption methods as a way to ensure the viability of online transactions as opposed to using a third-party bank, is starting to stabilize. Since January of this year, the price per Bitcoin has hovered right around $200 (according to CoinBase). That stabilization is a good sign, because it means more people are using the alternative payment method.\n\nIn fact, according to BitPay, the number of Bitcoin transactions (aka, BTC) doubled last year. And, North America accounts for 57 percent of all Bitcoin payments: You can now buy everything from beef jerky to flowers using BTC.\n\nYet, the really impressive news is that larger, more-established companies like Expedia have jumped on the alternative payments bandwagon. Since last year, the popular travel site has used CoinBase to handle its Bitcoin transactions. Large online retailers like Overstock.com now accept Bitcoin, and countless small (but legitimate and well-funded) etailers like BloomNation, a flower delivery service, are adopting BTC as a legitimate payment option.\n\n[Related: \'Dark\' coins rising]\n\nExperts tell CIO.com that several factors are driving adoption, including new technology breakthroughs involving the blockchain – which is a secure public ledger for Bitcoin transaction – and even a new “stock exchange” for Bitcoin called Gemini. The payment method is finally expanding beyond the world of online poker and gift cards into mainstream commerce.\n\n“Bitcoin is becoming more and more mainstream,” says Marwan Forzley, the CEO of Align Commerce, a global payments company that makes it possible to pay employees stationed overseas. “We see this in the NYSE’s introduction of the bitcoin index and IBM’s rumored development of a new blockchain based cash payment system, as well as large retailers such as Overstock.com adopting bitcoin as a form of payment.”\n\n“As more regulation and trust in bitcoin businesses is established with clear oversight, the more use cases we will see emerge,” adds Jesse Chenard, the CEO of MonetaGo, a BTC exchange. “The fringe uses helped establish the economics and function of the protocol. It also helped to prove out the security of it. As some of the baddest actors on the Internet have not been able to compromise the basics of it you can consider it very well security audited.”\n\nReducing the risk\n\nExpedia is a good example of a company that is paving the way for legitimizing Bitcoin and making it more viable for larger companies. About a year ago, the travel portal started looking into alternative payment methods beyond credit cards and PayPal. They noticed how many of their customers were inquiring about Bitcoin and noticed how it was popular with smaller etailers.\n\nConnie Lin Chung, the senior product manager at Expedia, told CIO.com that adding the payment format went incredibly smooth. They use CoinBase to handle the conversion from BTC to U.S. dollars. At checkout, Expedia users are temporarily redirected to the Coinbase site to add their account information if they want to pay with BTC.\n\n[Related slideshow: The state of mobile payments in 2015]\n\n“One of the things that matters a lot for executives was what type of risks we were taking by taking bitcoin. But we really aren’t because we convert it straight to USD right after the transaction,” says Lin Chung from Expedia, Inc. “There was a segment of people who were really interested in paying with Bitcoin, so we wanted to offer that to our customers.”\n\nHow the blockchain helps\n\nBlockchain technology is also helping making BTC more legitimate for larger companies. Judd Bagley, a spokesman for Overstock.com who works closely with the internal Bitcoin development team, says blockchain tech is a key reason why they accept the payment method.\n\n“The blockchain is very good at removing the need for intermediaries whose purpose is to bridge the transactional trust gap that exists between individuals who wish to do business without already having a trust-based relationship,” he says. “These intermediaries don’t work for free. They come at a cost of time and money. However, with the blockchain, you don’t have to trust the counterparty on the deal. You only have to trust math and the principles of cryptography.”\n\nThe real benefit of using the blockchain for any large company is that it solves some of the regulatory issues and helps companies scale out as the transaction levels grow.\n\n“Our technology can fit easily into existing business systems. We see this blockchain as a service model growing rapidly because a few simple API calls can give your accounting or document system a blockchain back end,” says Peter Kirby, the president of Factom, a company that creates a secure time-stamp of data used for transactions.\n\nNot picture perfect yet\n\nOf course, we’re still a long way from walking into a Best Buy store and paying with Bitcoin from your smartphone, and that’s mostly due to customer perception and adoption trends. Many consumers have a hard time even understanding Bitcoin or the blockchain. Indeed, when CIO.com contacted two major retail giants, Amazon and CVS, both companies said they had not announced any plans to accept the alternative payment method. To date, no mainstream brick-and-mortar retailer has started accepting the currency, although you can use an app like Gyft to purchase a gift card using Bitcoin for major retailers.\n\n[Related: Enforcement cut global banking Trojans 53 percent]\n\n“We are starting to see many POS systems accepting bitcoin – from gas stations to gaming machines,” says Forzley from Align Commerce. “It is absolutely feasible to see it offered as a payment option in brick and mortar retailers in the not so distant future.”\n\n""Bitcoin has become more legitimate or at least it is perceived as more legitimate, because of the major retailers jumping on board and accepting it,” says Marc Diana, the CEO of MoneyTips.com, an online community and information resource. “With retailers like CVS and Amazon now accepting it through third party processors, the coins are perceived as being a trusted source to buy goods with and, if they were not, retailers would not accept them, even though they are not actually accepted by major retailers outside of OverStock.com. Perception is half the battle.""\n\nAs blockchain tech improves, more people hear about Bitcoin as a payment method, the currency continues to stabilize, and more companies start accepting it, the enterprise may follow suit.', 'A proposed digital currency bill has been amended in the California Senate to include a provisional application process for early-stage industry services.\n\nAB-1326, if passed, would require individuals and companies offering services that involve bitcoin or other digital currencies to first obtain a license. A new draft version of the bill, was amended and re-referred to the California Senate Committee on Banking and Finance on 6th July after it passed with a 55-22 vote in the State Assembly last month.\n\nNotably, a new change to the draft text enables small-scale business concepts to receive conditional approval from the state’s Commission of Business Oversight under the state’s Money Transmission Act.\n\nThe text reads:\n\n“The bill would authorize a person or entity conducting virtual currency business with less than $1,000,000 in outstanding obligations and whose business model, as determined by the commissioner, represents low or no risk to consumers to register with a $500 license fee and, if approved, receive a provisional license to conduct virtual currency business.”\n\nUnder the proposed law, those seeking licensure would be required to register with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Additionally, provisional approval would be subject to a process that would consider anticipated transaction volume, existing risk mitigation strategies and the overall nature of the business.\n\nThe provisional licenses carry a two-year duration, and entities that no longer qualify would have 15 days to contact state regulators, and an additional 30 days to seek full licensure.\n\nStep forward\n\nThe inclusion of a provisional process marks a potential victory for developers and startups in California looking to work on bitcoin and blockchain-related projects, enabling development that, under existing law, might run afoul of financial regulation. A similar provision was included in New York’s BitLicense framework, which officially became law late last month, allowing for the provisional approval of digital currency startups.\n\nThe updated text also redefines what constitutes ""virtual currency business"", reducing its scope from a previous definition that would have captured any entity that maintained “full custody or control of virtual currency in this state on behalf of others” or offered exchange services to Californian citizens.\n\nUnder the new definition, exchanges would not be required to seek licensure.\n\nLanguage governing the hiring of agents was also removed. Initially, those individuals would have been subject to a state background check, and would also have been required to to sign a contract governing the scope of their work and confirming their compliance with the law.\n\nThe new version also adds provisions for transaction receipts and license conversions.\n\nCalifornia State House image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The new software is also expected to be made available to medium and small-sized firms at a later, to-be-determined date.\n\nCEO and co-founder Marco Streng indicated that the project aims to reduce the rising complexities associated with industrial-scale bitcoin mining.\n\nStreng told CoinDesk:\n\n""While this has improved efficiency it has also lead to new problems in the mining space.

Today, The Wall Street Journal reports that the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT – which began trading on the OTCQX market May 4 under the ticker symbol GBTC) could bring bitcoin broader acceptance by investors. Some analysts think the fund could prompt speculative interest in bitcoin like the launch of gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) in precious metals a decade ago.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is currently reviewing an application for what would be the first official bitcoin ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, the article noted.\n\nAlso read: Wall Street Investment Firms Can’t Resist Bitcoin\n\nA Move Towards Mainstream Finance\n\nGil Luria, an analyst with brokerage firm Wedbush Securities, sees BIT as part of bitcoin’s move toward the mainstream of finance. Other recent signs of acceptance on Wall Street include the decision of the New York State Department of Financial Services to regulate itBit Trust Co., a bitcoin exchange, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. claiming a place for bitcoin in “the future of finance.”\n\nLuria called the OTCQX BIT listing a “very big step forward” since it has made at least a proxy ownership stake in bitcoin available to practically every institutional and retail investor.\n\nHe expects nearly all of the original trust investors to sell their shares publicly by September. This selling will result in a “critical mass” of shares on the market, which is enough to bring the price of the fund’s shares more into line with prices on the bitcoin market.\n\nCameron Winklevoss, one of the founders of Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, compares a bitcoin exchange-traded product to the launching of the SPDR Gold Shares ETF in November 2004. The popularity of the gold fund was part of a gold craze that saw prices quintuple over the next seven years.\n\nWe believe some investors will behave the same with regards to bitcoin and a bitcoin [exchange-traded product] – Winklevoss said.\n\nFuture Strong For Bitcoin Growth\n\nThe article noted there are reasons to believe bitcoin usage could increase. A recent Goldman Sachs survey of 752 millennials found 44 percent said they have used, do use or will use bitcoin. And more than 100,000 merchants world-wide accept bitcoin for at least some payments.\n\nThe article also noted there are challenges for BIT. Bitcoin remains a highly speculative investment. Bitcoin is more volatile than gold in its speculative heyday, and even trickier to buy and sell directly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'CCN recently published an article about the various ways that you can get a small business funded in the cryptocurrency sphere, but we didn’t do the crowdfunding segment justice.\n\nAs such, it’s time we covered a company called BitBond, which is based in Germany, which facilitates crowdfunding in much the same way that BTCJam does. However, because of the problems that BTCJam has had, our first question for Chris Grundy, a representative of the company, was how they can ensure that funds are repaid. After all, a Bitcoin loan can very much be like a cash loan, in that once the debtor has secured the funds, they’re free to run.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Loans Are Still Loans in Kentucky\n\nCredentials can be falsified with impunity via the DarkNet and other means so that even a seemingly thorough vetting process can let through a bad apple or two. Indeed, to this day, despite advances in its platform, BTCJam has managed to allow a few bad apples onto its platform. It’s just the nature of crowd lending. To this end, Grundy told CCN:\n\nWe take numerous measures to ensure repayment of loans. This starts with emails and phone calls, in case of late repayments, and can culminate in the involvement of debt collectors to regain the owed sum.\n\nLast month, the company received 600,000 Euros in an angel funding round, which has allowed them to expand their staff improve their platform. In most ways except name, the experience of using BitBond is the same as using BTCJam. What’s not similar to BTCJam are the horror stories: so far, there haven’t been any, at least none that are easily located. It appears that prior to the company’s launch in 2013, another company had gone under the name BitBond, and they had been some horrible scam.\n\nAnother way they differentiate is in the method by which the interest rates are set. BitBond sets them, based on the creditworthiness of the applicant and the purpose of the loan. They explained in a forum post that this was the best way to do it, something they had learned from the experience of more traditional peer-to-peer lending platforms.\n\nThe reason why on Bitbond.net we set the rates […] is that experience from other p2p lending platform shows that it seems to produce the best results for both borrowers and lenders. One popular example is the second largest US based p2p lending platform. They started with interest rate setting as described in [previously in the post] after they saw that interest rates did not reflect the default risks of borrowers correctly. Lenders weren’t earning sufficient returns and the marketplace was close to stop.\n\nTo date, over 700 people have found the funding they needed via BitBond, and it appears they take recovering funds seriously. BitBond and BTCJam are both valid ways to fund your cryptocurrency business or application, and neither of them will require you to interact with a bank directly. Of course, if you got a substantial loan, you’re almost certainly going to have to deal with a bank at some point.\n\nThen, of course, there’s the obvious benefit of BitBond: being a lender. You assume the same risk as most investments, but BitBond claims to do a thorough creditworthiness check. To gain maximum returns, as is the case with other platforms, it is best not to put your whole investment into one loan. It is better to find an array of projects which spark your interest, and invest in all of them, a little bit each. The better the idea, the more you should invest. But never invest anything, in any case, that you can’t afford to lose. That doesn’t just go for peer-to-peer lending, either.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"

An initial DDoS attack was followed by threats of further and more severe attacks if the targeted websites did not complete bitcoin payments.\n\nAgency director David Rebuck said no bitcoin ransom had been paid, but noted the attack ""had the potential to not only negatively impact the targeted casinos but also all business in Atlantic City who share the same ISP provider"".\n\nThe DGE did not identify which websites were targeted nor the amount requested in ransom by the perpetrators of the attacks.\n\nRebuck added that the DGE, the New Jersey State Police, state cybersecurity officials and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in a coordinate mitigation effort that resulted in “no significant disruption to service”.\n\nHe noted:\n\n“All involved remain on heightened alert but are relieved that the holiday weekend has passed without incident.""\n\nWave of attacks\n\nThe attack timeline mirrors other attacks conducted by DD4BC, an entity that has been tied to DDoS attacks on bitcoin mining pools and web services in the in the past year and a half, ultimately prompting a warning from government cybersecurity watchdogs in May.\n\nThe DGE declined to offer further details or confirm whether DD4BC was involved, citing an ongoing investigation into the attacks.\n\nAtlantic City image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

You start talking about Bitcoin all the time at social events to other obsessives and to your significant other. ""What happens in a few years is that you have no significant others,"" he jokes, which gives the obsessives more time to work on Bitcoin.\n\nIf anyone would know about the Bitcoin rabbit hole, it\'s Smith, who is at the helm of one of the few original Bitcoin companies. He is therefore the perfect person to break it down. ""Really at its core, Bitcoin is just an open access database that anyone can write to,"" he says. You can\'t go back in time and the beauty of this is that you can know at what point in time who was responsible for something -- it can\'t be changed in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople in the financial industry have been getting pretty excited about a Bitcoin 2.0 for a while now. But Smith warns them off. ""We\'re not even at Bitcoin 1.0 yet,"" he explains. ""There will be a Bitcoin 2.0 -- please check back in 7-8 years.""\n\nWhen we do get there, we will stop seeing Bitcoin as the defining feature of those associated it, and instead Bitcoin will become a tool that people use to define themselves -- to assert their identities. ""You only have a couple of million people in the world that have any kind of photo identification,"" says Smith. ""Up until the year 2004, any high school user could make a driver\'s license in the United States of America. You could print your own."" It\'s hard for people to establish the veracity and value of different forms of ID that exist right now, and many people don\'t even have ID to start with. ""So what about all of these people in the world that don\'t have provable identity?""\n\nSmith thinks he knows the answer. ""What about crowdsourcing identity? Other verified people verify me... at some point it gets up to this threshold. Eventually you can build verifiable online identities for people who have never had one.""\n\nThe internet has only taken us so far in terms of access to information and open communication, he says -- a problem remains. ""You\'re plugged into the global network, you\'re plugged into the global world, but you can\'t transact with each other."" If only there was a system people could use to transact with each other no matter who they were...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe majority of young people in the world today live in countries where they don\'t have verifiable, internationally relevant photo identification, and they therefore don\'t have any way of getting hold of assets. Not so in the world of Bitcoin. Not only can they can assert their identities, but they can buy and sell in a world where their ownership of assets is recorded in a way that cannot be tampered with. If they throw themselves down the rabbit hole, they will find their verified selves waiting at the bottom.\n\nThe internet has opened up the world, but it would be easy for traditional banks to miss out on the new customers that the internet brings. Cryptocurrency has the power to change that. ""Bitcoin is the platform that\'s going to take banking from being closed to being open,"" says Smith.', 'Greece has not been a leading edge market for bitcoin, but the country’s current cash crisis could be making it one. Many Greeks view the cash crisis as a boost for bitcoin, according to a Bloomberg Business report.\n\nThanos Marinos, who prides himself on being the first to bring bitcoin to Greece a year ago, says bitcoin demand has jumped by 500 percent in four weeks. In a video interview, Marinos notes that when he began the bitcoin exchange btcgreece.com, there were five to 10 clients per day. Now there are 15 to 200 clients making deposits.\n\n“I didn’t see it as much as a business case back then,” says Marinos. “The main reason was to bring awareness about bitcoin and block chain technology to Greece.”\n\nMore Greeks Buy Bitcoin\n\nA random survey of 10 people on the street showed just two people still had heard of bitcoin. But more Greeks than ever are buying bitcoins.\n\nThanos is not the only one believing in Bitcoin in Greece. Felix Weis is a computer programmer from Luxembourg who’s taken a year off to travel the world with one caveat: he can only use bitcoin, cash being a last resort. He now stocks up on bitcoin at the country’s only bitcoin ATM at a bookshop in a northwestern suburb of Athens.\n\n“I have to,” Felix says to Bloomberg, because “I cut up my credit card. In Greece, I’m offering people 30 percent extra to try and convince them to start accepting bitcoins because I really believe in it.”\n\nHe has an opinion about what should happen in Greece. “It’s hard to compete in the euro zone. After all look at Romania.

The bitcoin community is small, and he knows Nikos Houtas, the owner’s son, who breaks out the ouzo and salad. It is all paid for without a coin or card.\n\nFour or five customers in the past two years have paid using bitcoin, according to Houtas.\n\nBut if bitcoin is going to be a viable alternative, many more are going to have to cash in soon.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Uber has denied that it is currently integrating bitcoin as a payment option for its on-demand mobile ride-sharing services.\n\nSuspicions regarding a potential announcement first began to circulate on social media yesterday after a user posted a cryptic interaction with one of the company\'s help desk representatives to Reddit.\n\nThe text of the message suggested that Uber was ""currently making bitcoin work"" for the service, but offered few supporting details.\n\nHowever, a representative for Uber indicated that such assertions were unwarranted, telling CoinDesk flatly: ""This story isn\'t true.""\n\nSpeculation that the company could move to accept bitcoin has emerged periodically from the bitcoin community, including in the weeks preceding the announcement that mobile payments firm Braintree would integrate a bitcoin payments option.\n\nIn a further connection between the technology and the company, Uber SVP Emil Michael was named as investor in micropayments startup Neucoin\'s $1.25m angel round in February.\n\nYessi Bello-Perez contributed reporting.\n\nImage credit: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Malmo’s central thesis is that Bitcoin uses way too much electricity.\n\nThe essay opens with a future scenario that, in view of the crisis in Greece, is beginning to appear more plausible – in 2018, Greece is long out of the Eurozone and economic malaise is spreading to neighboring countries. Panicked Europeans sell their euro for bitcoin, which is becoming a stable and respectable currency, causing even more user adoption and recognition by governments.\n\nAccording to Malmo this scenario, which sounds like heaven to faithful Bitcoin enthusiasts, is more like hell – a burning hell of bitcoin mining circuitry and electricity costs spiraling out of control.\n\nMalmo mentions huge mining operations in China with a catastrophic environmental impact, and notes that the total power consumption of the Bitcoin network is estimated by computer cooling firm Allied Control at 250 megawatts to 500 megawatts.\n\n“That’s around enough zap to power 173,000 average American households’ daily electricity usage,” says Malmo. “With about 110,000 transactions per day, that works out to 1.57 households daily usage of electricity per bitcoin transaction.”\n\nHis conclusion: “Yes, every time you buy something in bitcoin, you could be using as much electricity as 1.57 American families do in a day.”\n\nAs climate change becomes a more pressing concern for humanity every day, this huge level of energy use is difficult to justify for a currency wanting to improve on the current arrangement.\n\n“It appears there are significant challenges to ensuring that Bitcoin’s growth minimizes environmental impacts,” noted Jeremy McDaniels, a financial system sustainability expert with the United Nations Environment Program. “Energy footprints could be an issue if major scale-up is achieved.”\n\nThat’s is already a lot for passionate Bitcoin evangelists to swallow, but Malmo makes things even worse when he unfavorably compares Bitcoin to the Visa network – of all things – in terms of energy consumption:\n\n“That makes Bitcoin about 5,033 times more energy intensive, per transaction, than Visa.”\n\nThat caused the anger of many readers, who promptly pointed out that the analysis doesn’t take into account the overall energy footprint of traditional payment, banking and financial service providers. Some accuse the author of just having his facts wrong.\n\nMalmo’s analysis seems, indeed, a bit forced and overstated. However, dismissing it without consideration would be a disservice to Bitcoin, because everything needs constructive criticism to move beyond current flaws. Bitcoin is – though perhaps not to the extent denounced by Malmo – less energy efficient than it could and should be.\n\nMalmo notes that developers might be able to reduce Bitcoin’s energy footprint by moving ahead with the controversial proposed increase of the block size to 20 megabytes, or 8 megabytes.\n\nAnother option to reduce Bitcoin’s energy footprint would be implementing energy-efficient Sidechains, separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain but interoperable with it by means of two-way pegs, or Lightning Networks, where related transactions can take place instantly on “micropayment channels” off-chain, and only the final settlement is processed by the blockchain. Lightning networks could enable bitcoin scalability, efficient micropayments and near-instant transactions.', 'OKWave, Japan\'s answer to social network Quora, has announced plans to launch its own bitcoin tipping scheme.\n\nThe platform, established in 1999, claims to be the country\'s largest Q&A site.

And now one hacker is releasing the brain-thieving software to prove it.\n\nNext month at the hacker conference DefCon, security Ryan Castellucci plans to release a piece of software he calls Brainflayer, designed to crack bitcoin brain wallets and let any hacker suck out the digital cash stored in them. In fact, wise bitcoiners have known for years that brain wallets—despite their promise of hiding crypto treasure in the most private depths of the user’s mind—are often unsafe. Castellucci says his cracking program is designed to serve as a public demonstration of that insecurity for those who still haven’t gotten the message, and put an end to the practice for good.\n\n“People still want to use brain wallets because they like the idea of a key stored in your head…They’re in denial about how bad the situation is, and some of them are going to get screwed,” says Castellucci, a researcher for the security firm White Ops. He says his software, which he plans to publish online at the time of his talk next month, is meant to serve as a warning: “Please move your bitcoins to somewhere where they won’t get cracked. I want to undeniably prove to everyone that this is not safe.”\n\nBrain wallets work by taking a chosen passphrase and putting it through a mathematical function known as a “hash.” The resulting string of random-looking numbers is then used as a bitcoin private key—the long string of secret characters that controls a stash of the cryptocurrency at a certain bitcoin address. Because the same passphrase can be hashed again at any time to create the full private key, the user doesn’t need to remember that long key string, only the passphrase. The user can even delete the private key from his or her computer and walk around knowing that no one, not even cops who seize the machine, can access his or her mentally hidden treasure.\n\nThe problem, says Castellucci, is that humans don’t choose strong, random passphrases as well as they think they do. And any hacker can patiently guess millions upon millions of passphrases, converting them into private keys and trying them on every bitcoin address on the blockchain, the public ledger of all bitcoin locations. Even when a bitcoin user thinks she has chosen a sufficiently strong passphrase for her brain wallet, Castellucci says it often can’t stand up to the cracking resources of thieves motivated by an instant cash reward. “The usual bitcoin private key is long enough that no one is going to guess it before the sun burns out,” says Castellucci. “But if they just have to guess your passphrase, they’re going to do it, because people are terrible random number generators.”\n\nCastellucci first wrote the brain wallet passphrase cracker that would become Brainflayer in 2013, shortly after he read about brain wallets for the first time. He left his program running, scanning for vulnerable bitcoin addresses, while he went to a picnic for a few hours. By the time he got back, it had found a wallet containing 250 bitcoins—more than $66,000 at today’s exchange rates—ready to be stolen by anyone who had run a similar program. (Castellucci eventually managed to contact the wallet’s owner and convince him to move the bitcoins to a more secure wallet.) There are plenty of reported incidents of actual brain wallet thefts. One of those victims, Reddit user “thonbrocket,” describes how they had used a phrase from an obscure poem in Afrikaans as a passphrase, and was shocked to find that it was guessed.\n\nCastelucci wouldn’t say just how many passphrases Brainflayer is capable of guessing on a single PC, a detail he says he’s saving for his DefCon talk. But he hints that if his program were running on a botnet of malware-hijacked computers, it could try as many as a hundred billion passphrases a second. More than other passphrase crackers, he says the program is optimized for the problem of quickly generating bitcoin keys and scanning the blockchain to try them. He used a technique known as a Bloom filter, for instance, to most efficiently store and check the blockchain for matches. His results still aren’t quite as fast as the trillion passphrases a second that Snowden once warned the NSA is likely capable of. But it could nonetheless surprise many people who believe their passphrases are safe.\n\nThere’s no reason to think that Brainflayer is an especially powerful passphrase cracker compared with other bitcoin brain wallet crackers in the hands of criminals. But that’s the point, says Dan Kaminsky, the founder of the White Ops security firm that employs Castellucci and a well-known security researcher with an interest in bitcoin. Brainflayer is designed to level the playing field and prove to anyone that their insecure brain wallet can be hacked. “Ryan is not the first person to write a brain wallet cracker,” says Kaminsky. “But if he puts it out there, he’ll be the last person to have to write one, because everyone’s going to have it.”\n\nKaminsky argues that’s still a lesson bitcoiners need to hear. Despite brain wallets’ security issues, the idea is still too tempting to people who relish the thought of a perfectly private stash of virtual currency. “The thinking is, ‘this is the safest possible version of putting money under my mattress,'” says Kaminsky. “The reality is that there’s a lot of room under your mattress. There’s not enough room in your head.”"", 'We sat down with Rick Falkvinge, the founder of the first ever Pirate Party in Sweden, and discussed decentralization, Bitcoin, privacy, and the Middle East’s need for alternative media channels.\n\n“Oldmedia has basically let itself get reduced to mouthpieces for regimes in various stages of corruption; there is little to no independent reporting any longer.” — Rick Falkvinge\n\nRick’s entrepreneurial spirit began when he started his first company at 16. Currently living in Sollentuna, a suburb close to the airport of Stockholm, Sweden, Rick is now running Falconwing news, an online media outlet that aims to “defend the Internet’s fundamental values.”\n\n— Rick Falkvinge\n\nCoinTelegraph: When was the breaking point where you thought, ""This world needs more privacy""? What made you want to start the Pirate Party?\n\nRick Falkvinge: Actually, I don\'t necessarily think the world needs more privacy. I\'m concerned with maintaining the privacy levels we\'ve had for generations in non-dictatorships — to maintain the levels of privacy that existed in the analog world into the digital world.\n\nThe right to hold a private conversation without being wiretapped, the right to go to a library and read a book without being tracked, the right to read a newspaper without a government checking which articles you read, for how long, and in what order.\n\nThis was inconceivable in the analog world, but is reality today. That\'s why I frequently talk about Analog Equivalent Rights to explain where I\'m coming from.\n\nCT: What is the current state of the Pirate Party in Sweden? What about the international Pirate Party?\n\nRV: The party is trying to reinvent itself at present. We\'ll see how that succeeds — but in any case, the Swedish party was only needed as a spark plug for the international movement. My goal was to put people in parliament to demonstrate that it could be done, and I did that in 2009.\n\nAt present, the Icelandic party is by far the most successful, but there are others (Czech Republic, Germany) that are well worth watching.\n\n“A replacement of the USD as a default trade currency, means that the U.S. stops getting money for free from the entire world, and that will collapse the USA under its own weight.”\n\nCT: What do you think Bitcoin needs for mainstream usage?\n\nRV: Usability, usability, and more usability. The technology is mostly there. But doing secure cold storage on your own is nowhere near easy enough.\n\nBitcoin is usable as a small-transaction currency now, using popular phone wallets, but if you want to step up the game, say with multisig, then much better tools are needed.\n\nI can\'t see how it would be easily done, but then again, I was never a usability expert. I can merely tell it\'s not there yet.\n\nCT: Where do you see Bitcoin in 10 years in the Western world?\n\nRV: A project on this scale typically takes 10 years from inception until it hits the usability trigger. That means we should expect somebody to hit the magic recipe — the YouTube for streaming video, the Wordpress for blogging, the Napster for sharing — somewhere in the 2019 to 2020 timeframe.\n\nAn interesting consequence of that observation is that the service providing the breakthrough probably hasn\'t been founded yet.\n\nEurope\'s economy is collapsing like a slow-motion trainwreck. So is the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn the words of Andreas Antonopoulos, “You\'ve got to understand that sometimes it\'s not about Bitcoin succeeding. It\'s about Bitcoin surviving while the entire world economic system collapses, in ashes, around it!”\n\n“Right now, the geopolitical game is about becoming the next default trade currency. [...] This will have huge implications for the Middle East, not just for the oil trade, but for a cessation of U.S. projected force onto the region.”\n\nCT: Where do you see Bitcoin in 10 years in the Middle East? Do you think it will have any major political effects on the region?\n\nRV: It will have profound and enormous political effects on the region, as well as globally.\n\nSince the 1930s, there has been an increasingly-formalized agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia to only trade oil in U.S. Dollars, thereby locking the most important trade to the USD currency.\n\nThis forces practically all countries to keep a lot of USD in their currency reserves. It also ensures that the USD is the default trade currency: If you want to buy something from China, you need to first buy freshly-printed USD from the USA, and can then exchange those USD for whatever you want from China.\n\nA cessation of this mechanism, a replacement of the USD as a default trade currency, means that the U.S. stops getting money for free from the entire world, and that will collapse the USA under its own weight — it\'s been overstretched and living on borrowed money since at least August 15, 1971.\n\nRight now, the geopolitical game is about becoming the next default trade currency. It may well be that bitcoin ascends to that position, but it won\'t be with the blessing of any government, which would much rather see their own currency there.\n\nThe only way you\'ll see a government support bitcoin for this is if it would prevent a rival government\'s currency of taking that position, and they have no chance of reaching that position for themselves. So in this way, it may actually be a political least common denominator.\n\nIn either case, this will have huge implications for the Middle East, not just for the oil trade, but for a cessation of U.S. projected force onto the region.\n\nCT: Are there any pirate parties in the Middle East? Have there been any attempts at making one?\n\nRV: The concept focused primarily on the political systems of Europe when it was founded, essentially using the world\'s largest economy (the EU) as a vehicle for change. While I\'ve met with a lot of activists from the region, I have the impression that founding a political party in most countries of the Middle East has a much different set of challenges than founding one in Europe, in general, and Western Europe in particular.\n\nCT: Can you tell us about Falconwing news? How does it differ from ‘oldmedia’?\n\nRV: Oldmedia has basically let itself get reduced to mouthpieces for regimes in various stages of corruption; there is little to no independent reporting any longer. By swarming to thousands of eyes and ears, we can have a different model of sourcing what\'s important, rather than trusting what\'s being pushed onto us.\n\nCT: Given how biased media is about news coverage in the Middle East, is Falconwing News considering accepting applicants from the region?\n\nRV: We\'re starting out in Europe — it\'s tough enough to create a workflow with people from North and South Europe in the same group. Once we have learned to work together efficiently, bridging our respective cultures, and the operations are profitable, we will expand until we have global coverage. It remains to be seen exactly how, but I would personally love to expand to the Middle East and provide an alternative narrative to the very one-sided information coming out today.', 'Can bitcoin conquer Argentina?\n\nIt\'s a question that is being given increasing validity by major media outlets like The New York Times and The Economist, and it\'s easy to see why.\n\nNumerical and anecdotal evidence suggest that if bitcoin will prove popular as a currency anywhere, it should in Argentina.\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Market Potential Index (BMPI), which ranks bitcoin\'s potential utility across 177 countries, Argentina is the most likely country to adopt the digital currency.\n\nIt\'s economy is one of the most problematic globally, boasting annual inflation of approximately 35%. In theory, this means monetary stability in Argentina is particularly weak. In practice, it has led to a thriving black market for alternative means of exchange.\n\nSmall, fervent user base\n\nThe prominence of bitcoin in Argentina isn\'t in dispute, with interviewees telling CoinDesk its adoption is comparable to that seen in New York or San Francisco.\n\nTech entrepreneur Joan Cwaik, for example, estimates Argentina has anywhere from 8,000 to 20,000 bitcoin owners, trading approximately $70,000–$80,000 over-the-counter per day. Wences Casares, founder of bitcoin security company Xapo, recently told CoinDesk that Argentina presented one of the most real-use cases for the digital currency.\n\nBut an arguably better question that hasn\'t emerged amidst the coverage is \'How could bitcoin conquer Argentina?\', given that, to expand its user base, the country\'s entrepreneurs will likely need the tools necessary to develop businesses that can bolster adoption beyond a small, but fervent user base.\n\nLocal experts suggest this part of the ecosystem remains, at best, poorly developed, as evidenced by entrepreneur Sebastian Serrano, who admits he had to perform ""several hacks"" to get his bitcoin processing firm BitPagos off the ground – including relocating to San Francisco in a bid to find investors.\n\nSerrano told CoinDesk:\n\n""In South America, there are a lot of entrepreneurs, but there isn\'t that many startups. This is something more broad. It\'s not just bitcoin.""\n\nAs noted by Serrano, the Times’s expose on Argentina uncovered ample evidence of this. Its lead protagonist, Dante Castiglione, a bitcoin broker is followed as he hops from office to office exchanging stacks of pesos for bitcoin in what appears to be a thriving small business.\n\n""He\'s like a little Coinbase or broker that is not online, but he is basically going places and doing exchanges and that\'s something very typical,"" Serrano continued. ""If the country wasn\'t dysfunctional there would be big companies doing that.""\n\nFunding crunch\n\nBitPagos isn\'t the only startup active in Argentina.\n\nOther notable startups include Bitex.la, SatoshiTango and Unisend, but this handful of companies only account for approximately one-fifth of the latest batch incorporated to San Francisco-based incubator Boost VC, which supported more than 20 bitcoin firms.\n\nThough adoption may be as high as in New York or San Francisco, it\'s clear that this activity hasn\'t generated the same interest from local investors.\n\nCarlos Jorge Guberman, head of a research program on economics of cryptocurrencies at Universidad Argentina de la Empresa, described Argentina’s entrepreneurship problem in more general terms, suggesting the funding gap experienced by bitcoin firms is far from unique.\n\n“I think that the lack of funding is a fundamental problem. Argentina has a very small capital market, limited to big companies and banks are prohibited by the central bank from lending to startups,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nGuberman voiced his belief that the local distrust of banks and financial institutions may have transcended to the venture capital sector, with business owners unwilling to open their operations to capital from institutions.\n\n“There are a few private ... angel investors, there are also a few online funding platforms but they are not that well-known or used,” he added. “Argentina’s financial institutions also result in a series of limitations which can prevent entrepreneurial spirit from flourishing. This has meant that bitcoin has emerged as more of way of evading rate controls instead of people just wanting to take advantage of this fantastic technology,"" he noted.\n\nHis perceptions are backed by Practical Law\'s guide of venture capital law in Argentina. Its assessment, published in 2012, states:\n\n""Seed capital is typically provided by angel investors, generally relatives or acquaintances of the entrepreneurs.""\n\nCwaik described the process as of funding procurement as ""long-winded"", suggesting that local bankruptcy and employee rights laws also contribute to the lack of funding.\n\nThis is not to say that Argentina\'s bitcoin startups are not benefitting from large-scale funding. Xapo, perhaps the most well-known bitcoin company connected to the country, has raised $40m in two venture capital rounds. However, although its team hails from Argentina, Xapo based its operations in the US before moving to Switzerland and catering to a global user base.\n\nCoinDesk\'s venture capital funding records show funding was mostly procured from firms based outside of Argentina\'s borders.\n\nEntrepreneurial culture\n\nIt seems, however, that the apparent lack of venture capital funding has not hampered the country\'s entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n“Chile has the conditions, Brazil has the market and Argentina has the entrepreneurs,"" noted Juan Martin Rodriguez, executive director at IAE University’s startup programme Naves.\n\nThere is no perceived lack of ideas in Argentina, the issue resides in the country\'s political instability. “There are many potential startups and lots of ideas, many opportunities and a lot of talent among entrepreneurs, in fact they are some of the most qualified in the region, but the political context makes everything harder.”\n\nRodriguez, however, seemed enthused about possible changes to the socio-political landscape, speaking about what a change in government would mean for the country\'s entrepreneurs.\n\nLike Rodriguez, Guberman also highlighted the role played by Argentina\'s business schools in shaping future generations of entrepreneurs.\n\nDespite this, he said entrepreneurs like Xapo CEO and Argentinian native Wences Casares are few and far between.\n\nIt\'s probably safe to say that Argentina could benefit from a viable alternative to fiat currency, to enable its population to evade its crippling annual inflation. Whether bitcoin is the solution to the problem, however, remains to be seen.\n\nAlthough the digital currency\'s uptake is seemingly on the rise, the question of whether crypto startups can survive within the country\'s frontiers remains. The evidence suggests that whilst Argentina is a hot-bed for ideas, it seems the funding necessary to take these ideas to fruition must be procured elsewhere.\n\nSome are hopeful that the upcoming general election, due to take place in October this year, will bring renewed opportunities, perhaps enabling startups to grown and rise in Argentina.\n\nThis article was co-authored by Pete Rizzo.\n\nSalta, Argentina image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Enigma is a Bitcoin blockchain-based encryption system that enables untrusted and anonymous computers to share sensitive information with a third party without putting the data at risk of hacking attacks and breaches.\n\nThe system will be able to prevent shared information from being surveilled by government entities or law enforcement, as it can only be decrypted by the holder of the decryption keys.\n\n“You can see it as a black box,” explained Guy Zyskind, one of the developers of Enigma and an MIT Media Lab graduate researcher. “You send whatever data you want, and it runs in the black box and only returns the result. The actual data is never revealed, neither to the outside nor to the computers running the computations inside.”\n\nIn a way, Enigma’s techniques and properties resemble a few features of Bitcoin’s decentralized network infrastructure. Enigma encrypts data by disassociating it into several components, and by randomly segregating it to hundreds of computers in the Enigma network, also known as nodes. Then, each node runs calculations on its assigned block of data, until a user merges the results to decrypt a block.\n\nThe mathematical algorithms are designed by the developers of Enigma, and the nodes execute calculations only on the blocks of data that it is assigned to.\n\nThe ownership of data, or chunks of information, is then stored as metadata in the Bitcoin blockchain, which prevents the ledger of ownership from being forged or altered.\n\n“I can take my age, this one piece of data, and split it into pieces, and give it to 10 people,” says Zyskind. “If you ask each one of those persons, they have only a random chunk. Only by combining enough of those pieces can they decrypt the original data.”\n\nWhat Enigma’s Encryption System Can Bring\n\nIf Enigma’s encryption system works out flawlessly like the developers promise, it would create a whole different ecosystem where private databases can be hosted without threats from third-party entities, such as governments or law enforcement trying to surveil the information.\n\nWhile cloud databases and platforms such as Dropbox and even Facebook areobligated or often forced to pass on sensitive data at governments’ will, the same cannot be done for Enigma’s cloud services, because the data simply cannot be revealed without the decryption keys which only its owners hold and control.\n\nEnigma would also allow users to safely share all kinds of information with companies without any risks of releasing sensitive data. “No one wants to give their data to some company when you don’t know what they‘ll do with it,” explained Oz Nathan, Enigma’s co-creator. “But if you have guaranteed privacy, data analysis can be a lot more powerful. People will actually be willing to share more.”Photo Security/Photopin']"

He had suggested the idea three years ago in a pull request to codebase on GitHub, but developers rejected his idea at the time. A similar attack on the LTC network would not be not “economically feasible.” He explained:\n\n“The reason why it is immune to this attack is because it was attacked in a similar fashion (though to a much smaller degree) years ago. I noticed this flaw in Bitcoin and patched it in Litecoin.”\n\nLee said that one of the reasons he created Litecoin was because it was hard at the time to make changes to the Bitcoin network. Having different developers with distinctive ideas, however, “can only be good for the resiliency of the whole cryptocurrency movement.”\n\nIn his recent keynote address at MIT15 Bitcoin conference in Boston, Lee explained that he created Litecoin to be “the silver of Bitcoin.” Litecoin’s limited supply of 84 million is four times larger than Bitcoin’s, creating a different size “castle” of security for its network. The currency is doing well this month, following suit with its predecessor’s upswing.\n\n“When [Bitcoin is] going up, Litecoin does extremely well. In the past month, Bitcoin has gone up about 20%, whereas Litecoin has gone up about 400%!”\n\nLee, who also helps Coinbase as the engineering manager for their Bitcoin services, spoke with CoinTelegraph about his Reddit post, why he thinks altcoins are valuable, and why he felt it was necessary to speak out.\n\n- Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin (LTC)\n\nCoinTelegraph: What prompted you to post this issue to r/bitcoin?\n\nCharlie Lee: When I heard about the network spamming attack on Bitcoin, it reminded me of the time when someone attacked Litecoin in a similar fashion three years ago.\n\nI went and looked at the transactions and noticed the similar pattern: sending transactions with a lot of tiny outputs. I've fixed Litecoin to prevent this exact attack scenario three years ago, but at that time the Bitcoin devs did not agree with my fix and did not incorporate the fix into Bitcoin. I made the post to highlight the fact that: 1) there is a relatively simple fix, if Bitcoin wants to use it, and 2) there is value in having altcoins do stuff a bit differently than Bitcoin to show a different and possibly better way of doing things.\n\n“It's hard to convince these people with words. In time, I believe they will come to the realization that there is value in altcoins.”\n\nCT: Can you explain why Litecoin is ‘immune’ to the spam attack?\n\nCL: The fix implemented in Litecoin is just to charge the sender a fee for each tiny output he creates. For example, in this specific attack, the sender is charged one fee for sending to 34 tiny outputs of 0.00001 BTC. With the fix, that fee would be 34 times as much. So it would cost the attacker a lot more to perform the spam attack. The concept is fairly simple: the sender should pay for each tiny output he/she creates.\n\nCT: What do you say to people who are die-hard, Bitcoin-only idealists?\n\nCL: It's hard to convince these people with words. In time, I believe they will come to the realization that there is value in altcoins.\n\n“I think Litecoin is still very complimentary to Bitcoin — silver to Bitcoin's gold, if you will.”\n\nCT: Can Bitcoin, with its sizable network, overcome problems like this, as well as consensus issues like block size?\n\nCL: I think Bitcoin is very resilient. It might be painful, but it will find its way. And in the unlikely scenario that it cannot overcome the dev infighting, people should feel safe to know that there is an alternative cryptocurrency that's also highly secure and decentralized as Bitcoin.\n\nCT: How do you feel about Litecoin’s current price upswing, in comparison to Bitcoin’s?\n\nCL: Because Litecoin is an altcoin and a much smaller market cap, the Litecoin price is extremely volatile. So when the crypto currency market is crashing, it gets hit a lot harder than Bitcoin. And when it's going up, Litecoin does extremely well.

For instance, the report estimates bitcoin can lower online payments fees from 3-8% to less than 0.5%, while it can cut the cost of remittances from 5-10% to less than 1%.\n\nSecondary to these industries, the report predicts, will be bitcoin\'s growth as a ""banking alternative"" in times of economic crisis, its applications for machine-to-machine transactions and applications of the blockchain as a distributed ledger.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, author Gil Luria indicated that the goal of the paper was to answer a question that has long been the subject of theory, but little actual research.\n\n""At this point, with all the investments from big exchanges and VCs, I thought it was worth tackling the tougher question of how to value a bitcoin,"" Luria said.\n\nBillions in volume\n\nFor its calculations on the subject, Wedbush also sought to determine how many bitcoins could be expected to be in circulation and held for investment annually until 2025.\n\nThe report notably foresees the percentage of bitcoins being held for speculation decline at a 2% rate annually over the next decade, falling from an estimated 24% today to 4% in 2025.\n\nAt that time, Wedbush expects bitcoin to account for 10% of the $5.9tn online payments market, 20% of the $744bn remittance market and 20% of the $924bn microtransactions market.\n\nUsing these calculations, Wedbush forecasts the bitcoin network could support $595bn in online payments volume, $148m in global remittances and $184bn in microtransactions.\n\nAdditional inroads are expected in enabling financial services in the developing world, with the bitcoin network accounting for $596bn in this financial activity.\n\n""We see the scope of disruption as substantial considering 20% of US GDP is generated by industries whose main function is as a trusted third party,"" the report states.\n\nThe calculations led the Wedbush authors to conclude that, based on the amount of bitcoin needed to support such financial activities, the price of bitcoin is currently trading at 40% below its expected future volume at its current $270 price.\n\nRisk remains\n\nDespite a mostly positive outlook, Wedbush acknowledged that the price of bitcoin could ultimately fall to $0 or otherwise rise and fall erratically.\n\nThe report projected that a change in the perception of bitcoin\'s eventual value, even by as small as 0.01%, could drive a $100 change in the value of the payment network\'s currency.\n\n""This is different than most other financial instruments that have a far narrower range of outcomes, which in turn create more stable values,"" the report reads.\n\nWedbush further suggested that there remains a 50% probability that bitcoin could succumb to a ""Napster outcome"" whereby it is overtaken by another distributed payments network, rendered useless due to a fatal flaw or made broadly illegal.\n\nStill, it suggests there is also a 49.98% chance bitcoin will become a solution for its target use cases and a 0.02% probability that bitcoin will become a ""global working capital of trade"", in which case it foresees a scenario in which a single bitcoin could be worth up to $1m.\n\nPrice increase image via Shutterstock\n\nGBTC_Initiation_2015.07.09\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

I think that the innovation that the startups bring is fantastic and that the scale the incumbents – the banks, the Visas of the world – can bring is really really valuable,” he said.\n\nRemoving friction\n\nVaux’s session at the one-day conference focused on removing friction between startups and incumbents within the payments space.\n\nFormerly vice president at American Express, Vaux said bitcoin is very much on his radar:\n\n“The one thing I often get asked about is bitcoin. I do see … a separation between the currency and the technology that sits under it. From the point of view of currency, I think that\'s interesting. As Visa, that\'s what we do – we manage currencies.”\n\nHowever, he finds the attitude of some of those in the cryptocurrency space a little bizarre. When he was at South by Southwest earlier this year, he noticed a number of cryptocurrency company members arguing.\n\nHe said it came across like a scene from Life of Brian, where fractious independence movements the People\'s Front of Judea and the Judean People\'s Front spend more time fighting each other than achieving their shared goal.\n\nRegardless, he believes bitcoin has a future in the world of payments and wider finance.\n\n“I think it\'s going to be really interesting how that currency stabilises,” he said, adding:\n\n“Like any other currency, although this might not be the best week to discuss it, at Visa we are very keen to facilitate that translation of currencies on a global basis.”\n\nThe executive said he is also deeply interested in the underlying technology behind bitcoin and suggested it could be used to streamline the payments process when implemented by incumbents, such as Visa.\n\n“Ultimately, what we\'re looking for is the technology and the component parts that we can bring into our platform and into our marketplace, that delivers a richer proposition,” he explained.\n\nStartup advice\n\nVaux receives pitches on a daily basis from startups looking to form partnerships with Visa and he used his WIRED Money session to offer some advice to such companies.\n\nNumber one on his list was preparation. Startups need to “do their homework” and make sure they’re confident the service or product they are pitching is tailored to the larger company’s needs.\n\n“Ok, you want my brand, you want my money, you want my distribution, what I have no sense of is what is in it for me as the provider of that service,” he said.\n\nA lot of the startups Vaux comes into contact with are targeting their products at millennials, which doesn’t align with the target audiences of larger companies. He explained:\n\n“Many of these services are so specifically focussed on the millennials that it may be hard [to gain a partnership] because, honestly, those are not going to be most large financial organisations\' most successful customers.""\n\nAnother gripe Vaux has is startups pitching to him without having thought extensively enough about the future roadmap of their businesses.\n\n“It is a large organisation\'s worst nightmare to be dependent on a partner who cannot fulfil the obligations from a financial or from a scalability standpoint. Therefore, there\'s a lot of nervousness about that and the more clear and well thought out the plan is, the better for everyone,” he explained.\n\nAreas of interest\n\nVaux said some of the areas Visa is currently interested in include “identification, device fraud, using cloud-based technology to take some of the pain out of online payments, digital receipting”.\n\nHe said these are the kind of services Visa thinks will really add value for its current and future customers.\n\nAt the end of his session, when asked what he sees as the highest risk to the future of Visa, he replied “complacency”, concluding:\n\n“I think that you have to adapt, you have to learn … I think what we have to focus on is where we add value and collaborate with others to do that.”\n\nImages via Carsten Windhorst/WIRED.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The whole community was misinformed by either a liar, someone having fun, or an Uber support agent. Whichever the case, sitting on the story and following up with Uber first would have been the way to go.\n\nAs it turns out, Uber is not accepting Bitcoin payments any time soon. Which is too bad, since the technologies would seem to go hand in hand. Until you consider their business model, which could easily incur more than the user had pre-paid. With Bitcoin, the price could jump in a 20-minute car ride, and the user would lose value that way. Not that that is the reason Uber is not accepting Bitcoin, as surely with their size, they’d be able to figure a way to make it work for everybody. After all, the way currency works is that one party accepts value and the other offers it. Bitcoin isn’t worth anything to Uber if they don’t accept its value, and it appears that so far they don’t.\n\nWhich is within their rights, this piece is not an attack on them. This piece is rather to clarify that it doesn’t matter if Uber accepts Bitcoin or not. Not at this stage. The publicity wouldn’t be much if they did. More than likely, their adoption wouldn’t benefit anyone besides them. Yes, Uber can certainly benefit from Bitcoin. But just because they did, that doesn’t mean a lot of people would begin buying Bitcoin to use on Uber. Even if Uber offered a permanent discount, there is a significant learning curve to acquiring Bitcoin. Then there is significant effort. All of these would be neutralized, perhaps if the actual cost of using Uber were that much higher with fiat money. But the fact is, it isn’t.\n\nWhat Would It Really Mean, Anyway?\n\nSo, what would be gained in an Uber Bitcoin relationship? For the most part, Bitcoiners would now be able to take advantage of the company’s services. The chances are that when Uber begins accepting cryptocurrencies, there will be a serious profit incentive for them to do so. As it stands, they’re already a highly specialized business that garners profits from many corners of their innovation. Simply adding another payment option, which may lower cost to them, does not necessarily mean there will be enough profit to expend the effort.\n\nAlso read: Exclusive Bitcoin Interview with the igot Co-Founder: Taking over Merchant and Rebittance Markets\n\nAs has been noted elsewhere, there is a path that many merchants’ relationships with Bitcoin follows. They start by supporting it, and the community responds favorably by spending some of their bitcoins there. Then several months go by, and there are no sales processed with Bitcoin. Now, this does not mean it has cost them more to accept Bitcoin, but it does mean that there is little incentive.\n\nIn summary, there is little benefit to most merchants who accept Bitcoin, except very large retail stores that wind up seeing significant sales because they sell a wide enough range of products. If merchants accept Bitcoin, it’s because they believe a significant number of their customers are going to use it, as can be expected with sites like Newegg.\n\nThere is not enough incentive for the user of these services to then acquire Bitcoin for the sole purpose of using them. While this may happen on occasion, there is very little evangelism happening at the register. If the customer believes they would have significantly saved money by going with a different payment option, they may look into it. But let’s be honest, even then it’s more likely just a fleeting thought. Thus, it would not do much to move the price, even if many large retailers were to begin accepting Bitcoin. It would take such a massive movement, combined with discounts and other incentives for the newcomers to acquire Bitcoin, that this kind of positive movement can almost be written off as impossible.\n\nIt’s great when merchants do accept Bitcoin, but it would be best if that were always because it was a good decision for them to make, not because the community had pressured them into it. It’s great when people use Bitcoin to shop. But at this stage in Bitcoin’s history, it wouldn’t be unfair to say it makes no difference whether Uber accepts Bitcoin, Paypal, or baseball cards. The price of Bitcoin won’t move much regardless of what they do, nor will the spread of information about it. So it’s probably best to concern ourselves with more pressing issues, like how Bitcoin will work by the time they do decide to accept it.\n\nImages from Pixabay and Uber.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Michael Casey, the co-author of The Age Of Cryptocurrency is leaving a senior columnist position at the Wall Street Journal to work at MIT Media Lab as Senior Advisor at the Digital Currency Initiative. Why? “This was just too exciting an opportunity to pass up,” he said. “I sincerely believe that this is one of those moments in which a new technological platform has the potential to facilitate explosive change. I saw a role for me in helping explain it and tell the story around it.”\n\nCasey will lead the illustrious Media Lab in facilitating the growth of the Lab’s cryptocurrency research and bringing new clients and students to help study the burgeoning technology. We sat down with him to talk about his move.\n\nTC: How is the book doing? Tell us a little about what happened after publication?\n\n\n\nMichael Casey: The book has done well. It’s not a bestseller but it has sold admirably. There’s a paperback edition in the works — with the requisite afterword to catch up with the countless things that have happened in cryptocurrency-land since publication — so that’s a good sign.\n\nBut I would say the most important impact the book has had has been to start a conversation around bitcoin and digital currencies in the general public. Lots of people in the know told us they were giving our book to people who knew nothing of the topic as a way to help them not only understand the concept but to come to terms with why it matters.\n\nI was also struck by the breadth of interest from different sectors of society. That showed up in the interviews — from Leonard Lopate to the (UFO-obsessed) Coast-to-Coast radio show, from CNBC to the hip-hop All Out Show on SiriusXM — and in the many, many speaking requests we received from a wide range of institutions.\n\nTC: You moved from the WSJ to academia. Why? How will your role change?\n\n\n\nMC: This was just too exciting an opportunity to pass up. I sincerely believe that this is one of those moments in which a new technological platform has the potential to facilitate explosive change. I saw a role for me in helping explain it and tell the story around it. It was very hard to depart a profession that I’ve poured 23 years of my life into and wonderful news organization to which i’ve dedicated 18 of those. But this was a unique chance. It was, as one friend said to me when I asked his advice on whether I should jump, a YOLO moment.\n\nThis isn’t exactly an academic job. It’s more of a facilitating role. Much of what I will do will involve communicating, both to get the broader message out and to act as a liaison between the future consumers of this technology and those who are developing it, such as the grad students at MIT. As a journalist, I’m trained in communicating. So in that sense it’s a continuation. But clearly, this is a big change: I’ve moved into more of an advocacy position.\n\nTC: Why is MIT interested in cryptocurrency?\n\n\n\nMC: \u200bThe MIT Media Lab is interested in cryptocurrency for the reasons many people and institutions with a technology-bent are interested in cryptocurrency. The blockchain technology that underlies cryptocurrency offers an open, extensible platform on which to build all \u200bsorts of potentially powerful applications that could disrupt the economy in profound ways. In my mind, cryptocurrency technology is a new form of governance; that opens up a wealth of possibilities — from making money and payments more efficient to creating powerful new forms of record-keeping, from enabling service-sharing services such as car rides to facilitating smart contracts between online appliances in the forthcoming Internet of Things. For MIT, those possibilities mean there are vast opportunities for grad students and staff to develop new ideas and come up viable products.\n\nTC: What will you do at MIT? What are your plans?\n\n\n\nMC: \u200bMy role is twofold.\n\nI’ll be closely involved in helping the Digital Currency Initiative achieve its social impact mandate. The idea is to incubate projects and products that could have a positive impact on the world. Because of my background living in and covering emerging markets, I’m especially interested in applications for the developing world. In particular, I’m keen to develop blockchain-based property title solutions. This is the idea that people in such countries who until now have been held back by shoddy record-keeping and a lack of executable title to their property could, with a system like this, create legal collateral against which they could borrow, take out insurance and generally access the financial system that we all take for granted. I’m also interested in ways to use the blockchain to create irrefutable, self-sovereign markers of identity, which will also help give these “unbanked” people access to the financial system. I’m not a coder; that work will be done by others. But I’ll be helping coordinate the projects, bringing the relevant people and institutions together, and managing the communication around them.\n\nI’m also there to help build public awareness around the technology generally and the Digital Currency Initiative specifically. \u200bI expect to be writing blogs, helping produce videos, speaking publicly, etc., all with an eye to spreading the word.\n\nTC: What’s the future of cryptocurrency, based on your research? Will bitcoin survive?\u200b\n\n\n\nMC: \u200bI think its future is bright. We don’t know what shape it will take — just as no one could predict in the early 90s that TCP/IP would lead to the myriad, ubiquitous applications that dominate our lives. Although the general public is still ill-informed (and often misinformed) about cryptocurrency technology, there’s rapidly growing interest at the enterprise level in its disruptive potential. Every major bank has a blockchain task force, the big consulting firms are all diving in to develop applications for their clients, and there’s increasing interest from governments and regulators in how these technology could actually help them achieve key social goals rather than threaten them.\n\nI do think bitcoin will survive. It has made it this far, after all. And it clearly has a big first-mover advantage. But I’m agnostic as to whether it needs to be the dominant platform on which these applications are built. I think we will see all sorts of blockchain models arise, some decentralized, others less so. I do think the sidechains initiative and others aimed at expanding bitcoin’s potential will be important in giving it a place in this future. \u200b\n\nTC: How many bitcoin do you own?\n\n\n\nMC: \u200bA tiny amount, used only for transactions in an experimental way when I was a reporter. \u200bDogecoin? \u200bNone. \u200bMITcoin?\u200b One day…\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'It’s much too early to tell whether Bitcoin is the future of money, but a recently launched Nasdaq experiment will test whether it can be the future of financial record keeping.\n\nThe stock exchange announced recently that it has begun experimenting with the blockchain—the publicly accessible and cryptographically verified record of every single Bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred. Transactions are verified and recorded in the blockchain by a network of “miners” all over the world who exchange their computing power for a chance to solve complex cryptographic puzzles and earn money—freshly minted bitcoins. Specifically, Nasdaq will take advantage of a feature in Bitcoin’s design that allows additional data to be recorded on the blockchain along with information about a Bitcoin transaction (see “Why Bitcoin Could Be Much More Than a Currency”).\n\nNasdaq intends to use this feature of the blockchain to streamline financial record keeping while making it cheaper and more accurate. Though the company says the blockchain initiative could ultimately be used to record trades of stocks in public firms listed on its exchange, it will begin by focusing on its relatively new private market platform, a service that connects private companies with investors. In this case, record keeping via the blockchain will complement a cloud-based data management tool that tracks who owns shares of a given company, and how much they own.\n\nKeeping track of a company’s ownership structure can be a complicated, time-consuming, and expensive task, especially for fast-growing startups looking to attract new investors. In many cases, companies manage their own data in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, and pay lawyers to validate the information every time the table changes.\n\nMeanwhile, errors in this record can be costly, says Brad Peterson, Nasdaq’s chief information officer. “There’s really no great system in place to ensure that this is done accurately along the way and is auditable to the beginning of time,” says Peterson. He and his colleagues at Nasdaq think the blockchain can be essential to such a system.\n\nTo understand how this will work, imagine an employee wants to sell a percentage of her shares. Nasdaq’s existing service will match those shares to an investor who wants to buy them, facilitate the transfer, and update the record of the company’s shareholders. Now, for the few companies that have agreed to experiment with the blockchain, a “corresponding entry” will be made in the Bitcoin transaction record that would contain certain important information about the transaction, such as the timing and number of shares involved. Last month, Nasdaq announced that it has partnered with blockchain technology startup Chain to help it technically implement this part.\n\nThe beauty of storing high-value information in the blockchain, says Chain’s founder Adam Ludwin, is that it does not require that people trust any single entity, like a company that may go out of business or change hands, with the task of accurately recording this information. The blockchain, he says, is an “immutable record that everyone can see and agree with.”\n\nChain, which is itself one of the first companies participating in Nasdaq’s blockchain program (the others haven’t officially been announced), is helping Nasdaq determine exactly how to represent company shares on the blockchain. It is also developing blockchain reader applications that will allow companies and individual shareholders to access certain information that they have permission to view, using private encryption keys (see “What Bitcoin Is and Why It Matters”).\n\nPeterson says Nasdaq will explore opportunities to implement blockchain technology in other areas of its business, a large part of which is supplying the underlying technologies that run various securities exchanges around the world. One potential complication to the vision, however, stems from the current uncertainty and controversy over how Bitcoin’s core developers should modify its software so it can better handle growing transaction volumes (see “Leaderless Bitcoin Struggles to Make Its Most Crucial Decision Yet”).\n\nIn addition to Chain, the first test cases will be “a handful” of companies and investors that are “really supportive of this industry because they are in it,” says Peterson. If things work out, the plan is to expand the project to include other small startup companies that would have a “natural affinity” to this kind of secure record keeping, he says. In particular, says Peterson, “We think information security companies are going to see the merits of this approach and will want to show that they are forward thinking.”', 'This past weekend, bitcoin miners lost up to US$50,000 as the Bitcoin network was affected by the generation of invalid blocks due to the appearance of two separate versions of the blockchain or a “fork.” This fork continued to exist for six blocks and later, three more invalid blocks were generated as the issue repeated the following day.\n\nThis article will look at the reason for this problem, possible solutions and blockchain alternatives.\n\nUnder the hood\n\nA signature must be generated in order to conduct a Bitcoin transaction. The signature generated with cryptographic algorithm ESCDA includes transaction data, private key and some random data.\n\nActually, the signature is two integers: r and s. It is generated by OpenSSL library and encoded using strict DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding. DER encoding is an ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) presentation format. Different versions of OpenSSL library might encode the signature in various ways.\n\nDue to this fact, in case network users utilize clients with different versions of the libraries (e.g. when people compile binaries on their own; in such situation version of the OpenSSL depends on OS), network might face issues when nodes reject the chain, as they cannot correctly verify the signature, leading to forks.\n\nTherefore, Bitcoin had depended on signatures parsing from OpenSSL library for a long time. In winter of 2015, an issue of OpenSSL 1.0.0p / 1.0.1k incompatibility rose. As a result of OpenSSL\'s change for CVE-2014-8275, many clients rejected any signature which was not encoded in a strict manner.\n\nThen Core Bitcoin team came to a conclusion that using the software, which was not designed or distributed for consensus use (in particular OpenSSL) for the purposes of consensus-normative behavior was incorrect, and measures had to be implemented.\n\nBitcoin Core Developer Gregory Maxwell wrote:\n\n""While for most applications it is generally acceptable to eagerly reject some signatures, Bitcoin is a consensus system where all participants must generally agree on the exact validity or invalidity of the input data. In a sense, consistency is more important than ‘correctness.’""\n\nMaxwell proposed a solution when the signature should have been decoded and then re-encoded before verification to ensure that it was properly consumed. BIP66 created in January of 2015 proposed to transfer the signature validation control to the core Bitcoin code to make Bitcoin independent of OpenSSL.\n\n- Gregory Maxwell\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIn order to implement this feature, Bitcoin needed a “hardfork,” which was supposed to be performed in two stages. Before the start of voting, all Bitcoin blocks were v.2. New rules were to be introduced when at least 750 blocks out of 1000 generated would have been v.3. Then, as soon as 950 out of 1000 generated blocks would have been v.3, all v.2 blocks were supposed to become invalid, and all the next blocks would have enforced the new rules.\n\nFirst, the voting took place, and everyone voted for the new signature format, i.e. 750 of 1000 blocks generated were v.3. After passing the second threshold, v.2 blocks should not have been accepted by the network.\n\nThe network kept generating them, quite logically, as not all clients were updated. The strange part, however, was that instead of declining these blocks, the network kept accepting them.\n\nThey were accepted by 50% of the network, because these 50% were SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) clients, which do not verify everything in the block, but instead rely on either connecting to a trusted node, or high difficulty as a proxy for proof of validity. As a result, 50% of the network accepted blocks while the other 50% did not. The network was split.\n\nWhy did it happen?\n\nIf we look at the list of invalid block hashes on the Bitcoin Wiki, we can see that invalid blocks were generated by 4 pools and (maximum) two big miners. We can assume that they had an older version of Bitcoin, with a few changes from the following version introduced manually. The pools might very well have their own patched Bitcoin code.\n\nSolution\n\nAccording to the announcement on the Bitcoin.org website, everyone should upgrade to get only the correct chain. Miners should upgrade their software not to lose their money. Any non-upgraded miners will lose their money. After the situation is solved, all v.2 blocks will be recognized as invalid. It will happen sooner or later, but it is inevitable.\n\nSellers should increase the required number of transaction confirmations, since there is a possibility of a long branches not being accepted by the network, as the orphans generate 50% of the network. However, these chains would not likely be longer than 30 blocks, so 30 checks would suffice.\n\nWhat’s ahead?\n\nThere is nothing to fear, as the problem will finally be solved. However, miners will lose quite a lot. Currently it is announced that several large miners have lost over US$50,000 dollars’ worth of mining income. Merchants, on the other hand will probably not be affected. The hardfork is a very complicated process. Bitcoin had a few months to realize that 50% miners do not verify the blocks as they should, but this did not happen.\n\nIt may be possible that light clients (SPV mining / SPV wallets) are not reliable enough. At least, it is not enough to simply listen to a single node. Some alert mechanism should be used to notify the users that something wrong is going on in the network.\n\nAltcoin alternatives\n\nBitcoin-based currencies\n\nAll cryptocurrencies, which have Bitcoin codebase in its core, have the same issue with transaction signature verification by OpenSSL libraries. That means that potentially every altcoin network might have problems with block rejection due to different signature encoding by different clients.\n\nNowadays, a hardfork for the implementation of BIP66 recommendations is the best solution for solving the problem in Bitcoin-based currencies. Meanwhile, for every cryptocurrency developer team it is very important to utilize this experience of Bitcoin’s hardfork planning pitfalls and light clients’ unreliability for future hardforks.\n\nCryptoNote currencies\n\nBytecoin and other CryptoNote currencies are different because they do not rely on OpenSSL and have their own cryptography and codebase. Roughly speaking, CryptoNote team accounted for everything that was described in BIP66, among other improvements when the network was only designed.\n\nNXT & Ethereum\n\nNXT utilizes bouncycastle.crypto, a lightweight cryptography API for Java and C#. Ethereum relies on Crypto++, also known as CryptoPP. Both of them are external libraries as well as OpenSSL. We cannot be confident that changes in the libraries would not affect these cryptocurrencies’ network consensus.\n\nFull disclosure: The author of this article Joseph Lin is a Bytecoin developer.', 'Due to the continued spam attack on the blockchain network that Bitcoin Magazine has previously reported on, multiple bitcoin wallets have implemented either increased fees or the ability for individuals to increase the fees paid for a given transaction. Based on the nature of the software, miners prioritize which transaction to process first based on the fees associated with it, among other factors. The standard bitcoin fee is 0.0001 BTC per kilobyte. However, with so many spam transactions occurring, the standard transaction fee is not sufficient to ensure quick confirmations.\n\nBitGo announced what it is calling its surge pricing —named after Uber’s surge pricing—which stipulates that the fees will vary depending on how congested the network is. In times of low congestion, the fees will remain low; whereas, in times of high congestion, the fees will be boosted. The company’s goal is to see transactions verified in roughly 2 blocks.\n\nLedger, the hardware wallet, deployed its 1.3.12 version of the Chrome application, which includes dynamic fees. Based on the speed in which users want the transaction to be confirmed, the software will calculate how much in fees they should pay. By allowing users to decide, they can dictate whether speed is more important or an overall decreased cost.\n\nBTCJam, a peer-to-peer lending platform, announced today that it would be waiving any late fees & late payment penalties for payments that come within 48 hours of the payment’s due date.']"
07/10/2015,"['Joaquin Fenoy was wandering the streets of Athens Friday, doing his bit to ease Greece’s currency restrictions. He wasn’t handing out cash, but rather installing an ATM with a withdrawal limit of €1,000 (about $1,100). That’s €940 above the €60 daily ATM withdrawal limit the Greek government put in place to stop a bank run as its creditors decide the country’s financial fate.\n\nThere is one catch, though: You need to have the virtual currency bitcoin to use it.\n\nFenoy, 36, is the CTO of Bitchain, a four-month-old startup based in the Barcelona suburb of Sant Cugat del Vallés. He and his co-founders—Jordi Alcaraz, 39, and Miguel Alcaraz, 44—launched the company in March to build an international network of bitcoin-based ATMs manufactured by BTCPoint, a Barcelona/Silicon Valley company (and Fenoy’s former employer).\n\nBitcoin ATMs are a fast-growing offshoot of the six-year old bitcoin currency. The first one was opened in a Vancouver coffee shop in October 2013, and there are now 429 worldwide. To buy bitcoins at an ATM, a user inserts money, and the equivalent in bitcoins are put into his virtual wallet. To turn bitcoins into cash and withdraw it (which is more likely in cash-strapped Greece), users send bitcoins to a virtual address supplied by the ATM; they are then given a QR code that they scan to receive cash.\n\nFree of ties to government financial systems, bitcoin appeals to people looking to hedge against unstable currencies and banking systems. Demand for bitcoin has picked up in recent days, especially in Europe (Greece’s bitcoin use has risen 500% in the last four weeks), suggesting that Greece’s travails may even be inspiring people in other southern European nations to shift into bitcoin in case their countries ever have similar problems.\n\n“The suspicion is Spanish, Portuguese, Italians, and others worried about going down this route are buying in speculation,” says Michael Casey, senior advisor of MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative and co-author of The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and Digital Money Are Challenging the Global Economic Order.\n\n“You buy a bitcoin now because you think sometime in the future you’ll have your banks shut and your currency reintroduced,” he adds. “Gold was the old hedge against this sort of thing. Bitcoin is the new one.” Usage is still low, Casey notes, so big growth numbers have to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nFenoy frames building an international bitcoin ATM network as a way to help people easily move money around the globe without paying the high fees of traditional money transferring services.\n\n“It’s very good for people in the Third World, who are now dependent on Western Union and services like that,” he says. “Someone in one part of the world could put in money, and a family member could take it out in Africa, for example. That is one of the objectives: remittances.”\n\nIn Greece’s case, worried relatives in London could buy bitcoins and transfer them to the digital wallet of a family member in Athens, who could then withdraw the bitcoins as euros from Bitchain’s ATM. Similarly, tourists could also buy bitcoins with dollars in New York and then take them out of a Barcelona bitcoin ATM in euros.\n\nBitchain ATMs charge a 4% commission on transactions, a bit below the worldwide average of 5.61%, according to industry site Coin ATM Radar; the ATM in Athens will offer a zero commission rate to start. Fenoy says that for someone exchanging currencies, that 4% commission represents an 80 to 85% savings when compared with a physical moneychanger.\n\nSending money the old-fashioned way is certainly more expensive: On a transfer from the U.S. to Greece, Western Union takes a cut on the conversion (€1,000 would cost $1,180 from Western Union, compared with $1,120 at the current exchange rate) and charges $81 on top of that to put the transfer on a credit card and deliver it immediately.\n\nFenoy and his partners will soon find out how many Greeks (and visitors to Greece) have access to bitcoins. Their ATM, based at a downtown Athens co-working space called The Cube, is slated to open Saturday. The two ATMs Bitchain installed in Barcelona a few weeks ago see about 20 transactions a day each, he says, split 60/40 between buying bitcoins and withdrawing cash.\n\nThe company plans to have 40 ATMs installed worldwide by the end of the year, including in other countries with the kind of currency problems and byzantine money transfer regulations that make them prime for bitcoin usage, like Argentina and Venezuela.\n\nEach machine costs about €8,500 and according to Fenoy, between six and nine months worth of commissions are needed to pay off each one. So far, he and his partners have put in about €100,000 to bootstrap the company.\n\n“The situation [in Greece] is a lot calmer than I’d envisioned from what I’d seen in the media. The lines at ATMs are just one or two people,” Fenoy says, talking from Athens on his cell phone. “Tourism is normal. People are in a better mood than I expected.”\n\nA Greek exit from the euro would no doubt change that—and make Bitchain’s ATM much more popular. After all, bitcoins are not any weirder than other alternatives being tried out in Greece right now: Some stores are taking neighboring Bulgaria’s currency, the lev, while a small Greek island, Agistri, is trying out a gold-backed digital currency, the Nautiluscoin.', 'In another sign that the Bitcoin and the Blockchain are becoming a platform for the long term, BitFury, the Bitcoin Blockchain infrastructure provider and transaction processing company, has secured $20 million in funding from investors including DRW Venture Capital, iTech Capital and the Georgian Co-Investment Fund.\n\nAmong other things, Bitfury offers the HexFury, a USB mining rig with six small semiconductors (ASICs).

Roszak is also founding partner at Chicago-based Tally Capital, a venture capital firm focused on investing in block chain technology and in bitcoin.\n\nThe Center counts among its advisers some experienced finance and venture capital leaders, including Don Wilson, founder and CEO of DRW Trading; Andrew Filipowski, founding partner of Tally Capital; Ezra Galston of Chicago Ventures; and Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Washington-based Chamber of Digital Commerce.

He said 1871 now accepts payments in bitcoin but that “we’ll be rushing to the bank to convert it to dollars,” since some may have concerns about holding payments in digital currency.\n\nTullman cited Citibank’s revelation this week that it is developing a digital currency called Citicoin as evidence of growth in that sector.\n\n“When you have the biggest banks in the world starting to acknowledge that this is a viable currency and everybody has to be involved in it, we think it’s going to have implications for our companies,” Tullman said. He said the Center is one part of 1871’s fintech offerings, which will include a retail incubator whose launch date is not yet known.\n\nEntrepreneurs who work with the Center will have access to its office space in 1871, as well as mentors and public relations and government affairs services. The first group of companies includes Glidera, which gives merchants a secure way to buy or sell bitcoin, and Red Leaf, which is creating a network of bitcoin ATMs across Chicago.\n\nRoszak said he aims chiefly to connect blockchain entrepreneurs to his network of experience technologists, marketers, advocates, investors and others. These people will help the entrepreneurs navigate the development and regulatory challenges of building a blockchain or bitcoin company, he said.\n\nTullman said the work of blockchain companies could transcend financial technology.\n\n“The whole blockchain-based technology space is really going to be used beyond currencies pretty soon,” Tullman said. “We think the next thing you’ll hear is cyber security.”', 'Bitcoin jumped more than 10 USD within a few minutes climbing above 290 USD while the Litecoin price plunged with more than 35%.

Wedbush said that the relatively low-cost transaction fees associated with using bitcoin will give the currency a leg up against other e-commerce payment methods like credit cards or Pay Pal.\n\nBanking For The Unbanked\n\nWedbush analysts also said they saw potential for bitcoin in developing and struggling economies where the financial system isn't very secure or accessible. The firm cited the situation in Greece and the rise in bitcoin's popularity as capital controls took hold of the nation's financial institutions as a good indicator of bitcoin's potential in that arena.\n\nRisks Still Evident\n\nWhile the Wedbush report was mostly positive, the firm did acknowledge the potential for uncertainty when it comes to bitcoin trading.

Complicating matters, however, were reports that often confused the expected usefulness of a more mature digital currency ecosystem with its current market.\n\nArguably more problematic were attempts to tie the issues in Greece to seemingly tangential events, such as the increase in the digital currency\'s price and issues with its payment network, that ventured into speculation while providing little, if any, plausible conclusions.\n\nBitcoin, the new safe haven?\n\nThough little evidence was found that Greek buyers were behind bitcoin\'s rising price, some commentators noted that the perception of the digital currency\'s utility as a hedge for the euro was convincing investors of its potential.\n\nNasdaq\'s David Floyd offered a truly relatable description of bitcoin\'s current market position, asserting that bitcoin is ""growing up"" in the eyes of investors as a result of its association with the crisis.\n\nFloyd wrote:\n\n""People are beginning to acknowledge that the kid [bitcoin] has a point.""\n\nStill, he suggested that bitcoin perhaps isn\'t a practical solution for currency crises today. ""Bitcoin\'s identity crisis,"" he said, can\'t last for ever. ""It\'s high time the cryptocurrency found a niche and made a productive contribution to the financial ecosystem. In short, bitcoin, get a job.""\n\nFloyd also adddressed the digital currency\'s potential in Greece, pointing to how the underdeveloped bitcoin ecosystem was holding back its utility in the current crisis.\n\n""Some observers have called the price move purely coincidental. Others have suggested that the increased demand is coming not just because of Greece, but from within Greece, as panicked citizens move their savings into the digital currency. Greece\'s one bitcoin ATM, however, has seen zero activity since capital controls were imposed on June 28: no one who\'s managed to get euro bills is about to convert them,"" he said.\n\nReports from on the ground differ from this conclusion, as Greek ATM owner Vedran Kaji? estimates his ATM conducted €800 worth of business on Friday alone.\n\nStill, drawing the connection between market movements and the media\'s coverage, he added, is an exercise in armchair psychology. He argued the hypothesis that a potential Greek default would drive nervous capital into bitcoin is ""perfectly plausible"".\n\n""Bitcoin is the new safe haven,"" he added.\n\nThe comments did much to boost the validity of many in the bitcoin community, who trumpeted how the price of gold, a traditional safe haven asset, has moved little over the course of the Greek crisis.\n\nWhy bitcoin?\n\nLess convinced of the usefulness of such debate was FT Alphaville\'s Izabella Kaminska, who instead put forth the opinion that the attention given to bitcoin made little sense given that the country was not experiencing a currency crisis.\n\nHer argument, put simply, seemed to imply that as a non-government currency, bitcoin or another blockchain-based money, while potentially helping individual citizens, would do little to solve the problems a government would face during a crisis.\n\nShe asked:\n\n""Why on earth would Greece want to replace the euro, a currency it already thinks too restrictive, with another which would be even more constraining and give Greeks even less control over monetary affairs!?""\n\nIn her argument, Kaminska cited FTCoin, a cryptocurrency-based solution proposed by Greece\'s former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis. Using this concept, he had attempted to find a way to normalise Greece\'s tax evasion issues – sometimes branded a national sport.\n\nKaminska, however, attacked the argument that a digital currency would solve tax collection issues in Greece, stating:\n\n""If and when this [adopting a parallel currency] happens, the parallel scrip will remain a highly politicised form of money whose true value will be linked to the government\'s democratically-approved authority to extract taxes and spend funds on the public\'s behalf. Whether that coupon comes as FTCoin or drachma makes little to no difference.""\n\nCited in a CNBC piece by Kalyeena Makortoff, Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics put things into perspective, agreeing it was unlikely that the Greek government would officially adopt bitcoin.\n\nSearch for answers\n\nFinally, the narrative propagated in sometimes problematic ways in stories that sought to connect more specific issues with the technology to Greece.\n\nReporting for Bloomberg, Olga Kharif picked up on the surprise bitcoin fork that took place over the Independence Day celebrations in the US, leading to the validation of some transaction blocks meant to be invalid.\n\nThis fault, caused by the delayed implementation of a bitcoin core update by a small part of network participants, seemed to cause some concern among mainstream journalists, though it was written off as regular activity by many steady market observers.\n\nKharif led her piece with the Greek economic crisis, describing bitcoin\'s price movements in relation to events in the European country but soon took to reminding people that the digital currency was flawed, suggesting it was not an ideal solution for the debt-ridden economy.\n\n""Over the weekend, bitcoin\'s software provided a well-timed reminder of why it\'s not the perfect financial system, either.""\n\nGiven the attention Greece has driven to the technology, however, it remains to be seen whether next time there is a macro-level crisis, the ecosystem will be more prepared.\n\nPete Rizzo co-authored this report.\n\nGirl image, beach image, man image and clock image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Now, a solution being touted by a technology company sees the virtual currency being used to track movie and music leaks by turning pirates into paid snitches.\n\nWhile money may very well be the root of most evil, it’s still a commodity most people want to get their hands on. Trouble is, most financial systems rely on expensive middle-men who are always keen to retain a piece of the pie in return for their transactional skills.\n\nFor users of Bitcoin, however, things are somewhat different. The system relies on a peer-to-peer architecture which allows users to transact directly without needing an intermediary. And, of great value to privacy lovers, the system is somewhat less intrusive, unless users provide information about themselves as part of a purchase, for example.\n\nThese aspects have generated interest among those in the ‘pirate’ community, with some torrent sites now accepting donations via Bitcoin donations instead of through the troublesome PayPal. However, a service currently being promoted by a technology company will see Bitcoin used in the fight against piracy instead.\n\nThe solution comes from South Africa-based Custos Media Technologies who say that for a fee they can embed a “digital alarm” into movies and music that can alert content owners when their material is uploaded to torrent sites or other file-sharing platforms.\n\nDeveloped by researchers at Stellenbosch University, the CustosTech system aims to discourage leaks and reward those who find them while exploiting the publicly accessible information associated with Bitcoin.\n\nThe concept is fairly straightforward. Content creators are given the opportunity to embed a unique identifying watermark into a movie, music track or other digital content before they sell or loan it to a customer or client. One suggested use that may catch the industry’s eye is when so-called ‘screeners’ are handed out to Academy members and critics.\n\nHowever, instead of having a “For Your Consideration” watermark in the middle of the screen, protected movies in this scenario have a trick up their sleeve.\n\n“Custos embeds watermarks into the analog and/or digital content of media items, which are imperceptible but difficult to remove. Each watermark contains a Bitcoin wallet, with a reward for anyone who anonymously claims it once the media has passed out of the control of the original recipient,” Custos explain.\n\n“Media downloaders who want to search for such rewards (‘bounty hunters’) can do so anonymously, from anywhere in the world. The moment a bounty is claimed – and by the nature of cryptocurrencies, this can only happen once – the transaction reflects on the blockchain, and Custos notifies the media provider of the incident, and to which recipient the content was originally licensed.”\n\nIn other words, when content appears on a site somewhere, the first person to download it, view the code, and report it via a special Custos tool, wins the Bitcoin bounty. It’s essentially a people-powered leak reporting system that could lead to a number of possibilities for the content provider.\n\n“[The person to whom the content was originally given] could then be subject to financial or legal penalties, or to reduced access to future content,” Custos explain.\n\n“In this manner, authorised media users are strongly discouraged from actively sharing files or carelessly leaking them, while at the same time, they need not be inconvenienced by cumbersome security measures.”\n\nThe company is marketing CustosTech as a system that “turns the downloaders against the uploaders” and in some ways it’s difficult to argue with the assertion. Whether the system will prove popular enough with ‘snitches’ will remain to be seen – that will probably rely on the size of the ‘bounties’ up for grabs.', '[Update 11am GMT: The Bitcoin price has been soaring in the past few hours seemingly due to an influx of buying in China. Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin have seen bitcoin trading for US$350 and US$380, respectively, compared to ~US$286 on Bitfinex and elsewhere.]\n\nChina’s stock market woes have been part of the reason for bitcoin’s recent rise in price. Considering the country’s dominance in bitcoin trading, continuation of falling stocks could fuel another record boom similar to what occurred back in late 2013 when the price soared beyond US$1,000.\n\nTrillions destroyed\n\nThe Shanghai and the Shenzen have been in freefall in recent weeks despite actions by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to reassure investors. This has resulted in over US$3.9 trillion in wealth destruction. To put this in perspective, that is bigger than the entire French stock market (CAC).\n\nThe most disconcerting aspect of China’s stock market debacle is that this is happening with aggressively easy monetary policy. This is extremely rare. Most bubbles or rabidly bullish rallies end with central bank tightening. Things have gotten so bad that 71% of stocks had to be halted from trading.\n\nThe question everyone is asking is whether or not this is a correction within a bull market or a bubble bursting that could spill over to other global markets.\n\nReasons for the Crash\n\nSimply put, the crash has happened due to extreme amounts of margin lending via retail investors and the companies listed on the exchange. Retail investors have been given generous margin terms and have used them voraciously as the chart below shows. However, retail margin lending has been only partially responsible for the crash.\n\nChinese companies have also been partaking in their own form of margin lending by using their own corporate stock to secure loans from the bank. This was working out really well when the market was soaring, but as share prices began to sink and the banks would probably start to call in their loans, companies decided to halt trading of their companies to avoid getting called.\n\nIt got so bad that at its peak, 71% of exchange listed companies stopped trading. In other words, a massive selling stampede started and a negative feedback loop of selling caused more and more selling, which triggered margin calls leading to more selling until the PBOC was forced to intervene and introduce “stability measures” to try and stop the carnage.\n\nSo on top of halting stocks, the selling of stocks owned by major shareholders (5% or more) has been suspended for 6 months and if they sold in the last 6 months they are required to buy them back. This comes on top of a group of major stock brokers and fund managers pledging 19 billion of their own money to support stocks.\n\nGlobal Fallout\n\nAs the chart below shows, in the last 30 days alone, all commodities associated with global growth have taken another leg down as the Shanghai collapsed. The selloff is due to fears of a growth meltdown and a contraction in the Chinese economy.\n\nIron Ore, which is a proxy for the Chinese economy has fallen to a decade low on the fear of Chinese demand stalling.\n\nA Boon for Bitcoin\n\nGoldman Sachs noted that 80% of bitcoin trading volume comes from the Chinese market. In previous articles, it was stated that money flows to where it can make money. As bitcoin began its descent last year, the Shanghai started its massive uptrend. Thus, speculative Chinese money left bitcoin for the Shanghai.\n\nBelow is a chart showing that as the PBOC initiated its easing cycle, the Shanghai skyrocketed while the bitcoin price began to sink even further.\n\nIn the last month the picture has changed dramatically. The Shanghai has collapsed as bitcoin entered an uptrend. This could be the beginning of the return of speculative Chinese money back into the bitcoin market.\n\nBelow is a chart comparing the Shanghai versus the bitcoin price since the beginning of June. Bitcoin is up 20% while the Shanghai is down nearly 30%.\n\nAnother ominous chart, which could have a positive impact on the price of bitcoin is displayed below. This is an overlay of the Shanghai Composite versus the S&P 500 going back to 2005.\n\nNotice how when the Shanghai collapsed in 2008 it took the S&P a few months to follow. In other words, it lagged the crash. Could history be repeating itself this time around or is this just a correction within an uptrend?\n\nSince the collapse has been by more than 20%, a bear market has been triggered in the Shanghai. Goldman Sachs believes there is no bubble and they see a 27% rally from here. That would make this a cyclical bear within a secular bull market i.e., it’s nothing more than a deep and nasty correction.\n\nThe Forest through the Trees\n\nThe 1 year chart of the Shanghai shows an epic and rapid collapse. If we look at the forest through the trees with a long-term chart, the Shanghai is still in a major uptrend.\n\nBelow is a 10 year chart of the Shanghai, which shows its still in a healthy uptrend and hasn’t even pierced its 50 week EMA.\n\nIf we dive out deeper and go back 20 years you would not even know this had happened and that the breakout that began in the summer of 2014 will continue as seen below.\n\nHas the crash in China run its course or is it portending something worse are questions that will be answered in due time. Meanwhile, a bigger concern for the Chinese market is how to restore confidence to those who have been wiped out or lost money along with trust in market.\n\nThe Chinese authorities have used extreme measures to try and calm the fears, but these measures show desperation more than anything since they are attempting to control what are supposed to be free markets. Regardless of outcome, money is starting to flow into bitcoin and that should not stop.', 'In 2008, an individual or group writing under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto published an open source program outlining the Bitcoin protocol. It ushered in a new era or peer-to-peer data exchange, providing a financial infrastructure that no longer depends on central institutions, specifically banks.\n\nOver the years central authorities have reacted cautiously to what was then an unregulated exchange of value. Banks issued warnings to consumers regarding the currency driving the new standard. In 2013, during a period of unprecedented bitcoin price highs, the Bank of France released their opinion on the risks related to the digital currency.\n\n- The Bank of France\n\nThe mainstream media’s focus on the illegitimate aspects of the digital currency industry detracted from the new financial paradigms potential. Now banks are turning their heads, shaking off the dust and experimenting with a range of bitcoins features.\n\nBlockchain transactions are faster, cheaper, and globally accessible. The French bank and financial services company BNP Paribas, which claims to be “the bank for a changing world”, recently released an article explaining the benefits of disrupting the legacy banking systems, in their magazine Quintessence.\n\nIn the article, written by Research Analyst Johann Palychata, two scenarios are outlined. “In its purest form, a distributed blockchain system allows all market participants direct access to the DSD (Decentralised Securities Depositary), to the exchange and to the post trade infrastructure (clearing & settlement). If this setup develops then existing industry players might be redundant.”\n\nThe second, explains Palychata, is integration with the post trade infrastructure. “In this scenario custodians or settlement infrastructures might use the blockchain to record the ownership and trades between themselves; however end investors will still need to use a custodian to have access to the market.”\n\nBanks around the world are showing ever increasing interest in utilizing the blockchain technology which underpins the bitcoin currency. Barclays recently ran a 13 week accelerator programme which included three blockchain based companies; online cryptocurrency exchange Safello, bitcoin-based debit card creators Atlas Card, and the diamond tracking service using blockchain technology Everledger.\n\nThe Swiss Cooperative KPMG, with US$26.5 billion in revenue, have been delving into the challenges behind three fundamentals of retail banking - lending, deposits and payments. In a report released early this year, The Changing World of Money, the Head of Alternative Banking at KPMG, Warren Mead, explains banking is approaching what he calls the ‘e-book moment.’\n\n- Warren Mead, Head of Alternative Banking at KPMG\n\nMead goes onto explain that bitcoin is one of the challengers in the financial industry, and worth paying attention to. “In the face of this new wave of disruption it is more than likely that the major banks, with their smart employees and deep wallets, will swiftly develop the products and services that allow them to become ‘fast followers’ that with their long-established customer relationships and brand reach will make them strong challengers to the challengers.”\n\nOther challengers, often Blockchain based companies, are entering themarket with a slew of innovative products. Some are embracing traditional lures, including interest bearing deposit accounts, and competitive loans.\n\nBTCjam is a peer-to-peer lending network that implements a risk-based interest model. This form of pricing is widely used by lenders in traditional financial service industries. The interest rate is determined by a credit score completed online. The higher the score, the lower the risk, and therefore the lower the interest.\n\n- BTCJam\n\nBTCJam also recently announced Autoinvest, their automatic lending tool. The tool is designed to make investing simpler and less time consuming. It gives lenders the ability to diversify their investment portfolio amongst hundreds of loans, spreading the risk of default.\n\nIf you have an official government ID and a proof of address then you can apply for a loan on BTCJam. It isn’t restricted to a country of residence either, the platform is accessible globally.\n\n- BTCjam\n\nEarning interest on Bitcoin has also been an ongoing topic of discussion in the industry. BTC.sx is a cryptocurrency platform based out of London, that recently rebranded as Magnr. Colin Kwan, COO at Magnr, spoke to BraveNewCoin about creating the Bitcoin Financial Services platform.\n\nKwan’s attraction to Bitcoin came from his background in IT and investment banking. “There are a lot of inefficiencies in investment banking. It comes down to manual processing in the back office.” Kwan believes that Bitcoin has the ability to disrupt both traditional and investment banking.\n\nThe Magnr model is designed to pay out 2.18 percent per annum, on up to 10BTC. The interest is compounded monthly. “The traditional model of banks is to pretty much lend out their funds to mortgages, or whatever they may be, to get the funds from the mortgages to return to the customers. In a similar way we are doing the same thing,” Kwan explained.\n\nThe Magnr business model uses funds from their trading platform to supply the 2.18 percent interest. The bitcoin deposits can be lent out, for a fee, to traders. “Just like any financial service we are providing an interest return, we have to actually make those funds to create the interest return,” Kwan said.\n\nThis simple mechanic, and achievable interest rate, works regardless of the price of Bitcoin. Kwan explained that there is a direct correlation between trading activity and price, “when the price goes up, there is a lot more interest in Bitcoin. This you can see very easily in all sorts of statistics, number of wallets created, number of tweets,and media attention all spike. This correlates to more people being interested in what we do.”\n\nMagnr is attempting to position themselves as the ‘go-to’ cryptocurrency financial service. Kwan explained that, “there are many people without bank accounts around the world however they have cash that they need to use. Not only to maintain their lifestyle, but to invest. Right now they just don’t have that.”\n\nBanking the unbanked, and more efficient systems, are essential in this technological age. If a service provides what the customer wants at a lower cost, it will almost always draw in more clients.\n\n- Warren Mead, KPMG\n\nMead goes on to clarify the current situation for Bitcoin, and just how far its come, “the forces combining to challenge the position of the established big name retail banks are the same factors that are shifting the balance of power in many other markets. This process is what Harvard Business School’s Clayton Christensen dubbed ‘digital disruption’. New challenger organisations, from banks to peer-to-peer lenders to PayPal and Bitcoin, are smaller, more agile and quicker to respond to changing trends. With few or no legacy systems and greater responsiveness to customer needs (and with few requirements to offer full-service solutions to non-profitable customers), they can attract affluent, intelligent and profitable consumers.”']"
07/11/2015,"['The value of Bitcoin has been a roller-coaster ride for years. Now, we see a sharp, recent rise, and we wonder: is this a temporary pump, or are we on the way back to a $1000 Bitcoin?\n\nWe may like to believe there’s no reason it couldn’t happen, but let’s hope for gradual growth in that direction. It would be much better to get there over time, rather than over night so that we could count on the value being spread out, and people holding at various levels being many. This would be an ideal growth rather than a few days of crazy trading upwards.\n\nOne form of crazy growth would be a spike in demand, with people from some part of the world wanting as much coin as they can get their hands on, at whatever price. When that happens, that’s a good, natural form of growth as well, and that should be encouraged. The price can rise dramatically if a lot of people need to buy it right away.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Price Rearing To Go!\n\nBitcoin has had many sharp rises as well as many crashes. If anyone’s honest, they’ll say that anything can happen. To try and make an overall, long-term prediction is madness. It would be good for everyone if the price were to get back to where it was at the end of last year. That wouldn’t be such a bad thing, surely. But moving forward, we want to see even more growth if we’re going to start talking about “the moon.”\n\nThis kind of growth will mean that a lot of people are coming in and buying Bitcoin, at increasingly higher prices. Those who bought a little earlier will see a rise in the value of their holding, and the newcomer may as well see a gain as well. Or they could both lose it all if someone came in and started dumping coins at dirt cheap prices, for whatever reason. Large holdings trying to exit the market can have a dramatic impact, as well.\n\nTherefore, it is best not to predict anything. Saying that we’re going to the moon right now would be as wise as saying we were going to zero last week. You never really know with Bitcoin, and that’s all you can truly know. Obviously, gains are good for everyone. Merchants will not an increase in people spending bitcoins, as the higher the price is, the more likely people are to do that since they are getting the most value for their coins. Holders will see a rise in their net worth. It will become gradually harder for a new trader to enter the market and have massive holdings right away, but never impossible.\n\nIs Bitcoin going to the moon? Like and share above, and comment below!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'For those who are tired of playing the central banker’s fiat currency game of Monopoly, the benefits of Bitcoin easily outweigh the negatives. Currency is far from all that Bitcoin can do, and is just the first application, but creating sound global currency anyone can use is one hell of an app!\n\nHere are fifteen reasons why the future of money is changing due to the technological innovations of Bitcoin.\n\nThe First Global Peer-to-Peer Monetary System\n\nThought you needed a government to have money? That is so 20th century! Bitcoin is the money of The People, for The People, by The People. There have always been local currencies since people were trading chicken eggs for cow’s milk. Now, trade money digitally. No animals, private printing presses, or interest rates needed.\n\nThe Block Chain. Bitcoin’s Public Transaction Ledger\n\nBitcoin’s Block?hain has been praised worldwide by even the establishment’s biggest players for its revolutionary abilities. It represents the heart of the Bitcoin protocol and provides a way to track all BTC transactions. This ledger will be able to replace paper trails, lawyers, and many other things adding friction to the current monetary system. Record-keeping made for the Internet and the 21st century. Central banks wish their technology were here.\n\nUltra-Flexible and Transferable\n\nBitcoin can most easily be transferred online, yes, but it can be sent in many other ways. Your feature phone, not even a smartphone, can send it by SMS text message. You can receive it in your paper wallet. It can be sent in Morse Code in ""Burst"". And soon, you can send it via satellite to nodes in outer space. What do you need to transmit bitcoin? Two nodes with the Block Chain. I think the world can handle that from now on.\n\nWelcome to a world of Altcoins\n\nBefore there was Bitcoin there were no altcoins. Bitcoin begets other amazing digital currency technologies, with amazing features that may be added to Bitcoin in the future. In baseball, altcoins would be the minor league farm team that can have young talent occasionally join the big league team.\n\nThere may be a time when sending a bitcoin may not be desirable, and different forms of digital currency may be required. Maybe someone wants even more security, greater anonymity, faster transactions, or just to use full coins instead of millibitcoins. In the future, there will be an altcoin to fit your needs.\n\nProgrammable money\n\nA little ahead of even the savvy Bitcoin users of today, a ""Smart contract"", coined by Nick Szabo over twenty years ago, can be a big part of our future. This enables a contract to go automatically into effect once conditions are met, such as payments, signatures, or periods of time elapse. In other words, Bitcoin has made money programmable and gives us another reason to phase out lawyers.\n\nYou’re in control of your bitcoins; Governments? Not so much.\n\nGovernments adore fiat currency because they get to abuse it at will, while the citizens pay the price for their malfeasance. Inflation is a government scheme to factor into a flawed fiat currency system.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t have such Keynesian economic flaws. Governments don’t control Bitcoin, steal citizens’ money, manipulate its volume or fix interest rates. Governments have a very bad habit of creating more and more money until a fiat currency is worthless. You can almost set your clock by it. Owners of bitcoin know the total amount that will ever be in existence (21 million coins) and don’t worry about inflation anymore.\n\nBitcoins are much faster than dollars\n\nSpeed kills and Bitcoin’s speed may kill fiat currencies. To say Bitcoin is faster than what we have now would be a gross understatement. Have you ever tried to move $100,000 USD or Euros to another country before? As a former banker, I’ve done it countless times and it\'s not fluid or efficient system, currently.\n\nAfter you travel to the bank, play twenty questions with the bank officers, pay fees, and wait for approval and transfer, the recipient on the other side does the same - you\'ve lost at least a day. Bitcoin transactions of millions of dollars, in a matter of seconds, for negligible fees, are now commonplace. In a decade or so, your local bank will be able to do the same as Bitcoin can do today. Maybe.\n\nCrowdfunding without the crowd\n\nImagine you are a farmer in Argentina, and you need the equivalent of US$1,000 to buy materials, food, and animals to expand your farming business. Place your Bitcoin address QR code on your web page, or someone else\'s webpage, or even on the outside of your house, and people anywhere in the world can crowdfund your business. No checks, ID, or signature required.\n\nWelcome to new world of Micropayments\n\nDo you have a blog? Would you like to get paid for your new videos, stories, or interviews? Or you can pay your favorite author or content creator easily with bitcoin. When primitive merchant account payments are under about US$5, the fees required to send these transactions make payments very inefficient.\n\nSince bitcoin transactions are peer-to-peer, with no middleman, and cost less than a penny, the money goes where you want it, and ""the cost of doing business” becomes a distant memory as profits go where you wanted all along.\n\nConveniently move your wealth\n\nLet\'s say you had 10 gold bars, or one million dollars that you’d like to take to another country. (You are still silly enough to think a grown, free man should be able to do so, freely.) If you don\'t get robbed first, you will meet some police or government official at the border or airport, and they will make it very difficult for you to do so, freely. That’s kind of the thing these days.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you can make a ""brain wallet,"" a collection of words you can memorize, that will bring your entire bitcoin wallet contents with you anywhere in the world without a single question about your net worth being asked. The Gestapo is defeated before they even check your papers! Bitcoin 1. Gestapo 0.\n\nMakes merchant accounts obsolete\n\nI have an idea. Forget merchant accounts! Have one bitcoin wallet for your personal bitcoin and one wallet for your business account, on the house. No fees, no monthly invoices/statements, and no “customer service” needed. Just get paid fast, with no middlemen. Sound better than a 2.9% fee, plus a charge per transaction?\n\nBrings private banking to remote 3rd-world areas\n\nOk, let’s say you weren\'t lucky enough live in a modern metropolitan city with a pizzeria around the corner. What if you lived in a remote area of Africa, with no 4G or cable TV? You just weren’t fortunate enough to have a car in your town, much less a car company. You may live 50 miles from the nearest town with just a dirt road and a mountain between you and a banking relationship? How would you do business locally, much less globally?\n\nWith Bitcoin, even with modest SMS messaging on your basic phone, you can transact business globally. You are the bank. Buy, sell and trade worldwide, with no banking fees. No car, debit card or ID required.\n\nBitcoin is definitely real money\n\nI’m sure someone a very long time ago said “What is that? Shiny gold rocks? That’s not real money. No, we only accept feathers here.” We have since evolved past trading seashells, feathers, chunks of gold, notches on “Tally sticks,” to the current fiat currency system. Now, as countries like Greece collapse under the debt of the fraudulent currency creation, the world is just about ready for digital currencies, led by bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is probably more real than the cash in your pocket. There is no such thing as a fake or counterfeit bitcoin, but the money you have right now could be a fake. Any fiat currency has and will get duplicated, after a few years in service, that\'s why their look of it changes every few years. Counterfeiting is expensive to counteract and brings distrust to the currency and the market. Again, something Bitcoin technology has been engineered to stop from Day One.\n\nStill think Bitcoin doesn’t have “intrinsic” value? Here is a good article on where Bitcoin gets its real value from.\n\nSave trees. Get timestamps of bitcoin ownership and purchases\n\nThe Bitcoin Block Chain keeps a record of all purchases made with a particular bitcoin or the ownership trail of a bitcoin through the Blockchain. Evolve past the old paper receipt system.\n\nInstantly make any company or nation fiscally responsible and transparent\n\nA government or even a country COULD become truly ""transparent"" by utilizing the Bitcoin Blockchain for all or some of their departments of services. Countries like Honduras are already experimenting with the blockchain for land registry, for example.\n\nOr maybe there is a great deal of corruption in a particular department that the government would like to stamp out? The budget for that department could be metered out in bitcoin only with the Blockchain acting as a company ledger for that department\'s activity. Accounting is lawyer-free, inexpensive and instantaneous.\n\nAnd since bitcoin appreciates over time, sans any known market bubbles, that department reaps the benefits and can grow through reinvestment, or take annual bonuses (in bitcoin, of course!)\n\nThe Future of Money\n\nBitcoin is a very special and disruptive invention, which BNP Paribas equated to the steam or combustion engines. It does not have a centralized location, president, or a publicist to look after its best interest, and tell the world how great it is every day. Bitcoin is simply here to exist, like the Internet, while making current services like debit cards and PayPal obsolete.\n\nIt cannot be uninvented or wished away by the establishment, central bankers, or governments. Bitcoin is far from perfect, as the mainstream media makes sure to express at a moment’s notice. It is not yet easily acquired, understood, or stored. Yet, these fifteen reasons should give us cause to invest our time, effort and resources into nurturing Bitcoin into becoming “the future of money.”', 'Ever since Reddit abruptly fired Victoria Taylor, the company\'s popular director of talent, the community has been in revolt. Hundreds of popular subreddits were effectively shut down in protest, and thousands of redditors flocked to Voat, a Swiss-based Reddit clone that emphasizes its commitment to free speech. But tensions between Reddit and its community have been building for years. Now, a former Reddit engineer believes he can save the community experiment using one of the core technologies behind bitcoin.\n\nRyan X. Charles, who previously worked as Reddit\'s cryptocurrency engineer, is already working on a prototype of a Reddit spin-off that utilizes blockchain. Blockchain, a database which notably serves as bitcoin\'s distributed public ledger, is cryptographically secured against revisions. That hardening means no one can manipulate existing content within the system, which could be theoretically distributed across thousands of computers.\n\n""I think there is a huge opportunity here,"" Charles told WIRED. ""There is a social moment happening now where people are realizing that something like that would be awesome.""\n\nThat opportunity comes from the struggles Reddit has had dealing with community criticisms. Many redditors believe the company behind the popular news aggregator and message board overreaches its authority by closing subreddits deemed illegal or harassing. Just this week, Ellen Pao stepped down as Reddit\'s CEO following controversy over Reddit banning at least five subreddits for violating the company\'s new anti-harassment policy. The move was seen by some members as censorship.\n\nUnder Charles\'s system, that would be impossible. By leveraging bitcoin\'s technology, a new blockchain-based system could ensure that content cannot be retroactively removed. Instead, it would simply be up to operators of nodes, or endpoints which display data from the distributed database, to choose which information they wish to hide. If any person was upset with which information that an operator was suppressing, they could merely switch to using another competing node or start their own.\n\nOther developers have already repurposed bitcoin for applications beyond cryptocurrencies. Last year, a Brazilian developer released a decentralized, unsuppressible Twitter-like application called Twister. Much like Charles\'s project, Twister leverages blockchain, but additionally implemented BitTorrent\'s underlying technologies to ensure users would not have to maintain servers to distribute posts to other users. Another project, Ethereum, has raised roughly $15 million to create a platform for programmers to build distributed apps atop of. Ethereum, it is believed, could power everything from distributed ride-hailing apps like Uber to social media networks.\n\nAccording to Charles, Reddit\'s centralized structure—as the company operates all the servers, code behind the site, money, and administration—is a major source of its current woes (though, to be clear, he made this comment before the news of Pao\'s resignation). Blockchain is the antidote.\n\n""The turmoil highlights the moral hazard of having a company at the middle that owns the entire experience,"" Charles explains. ""It\'s inevitable that the company and the users will come into conflict sometimes. But with a centralized experience, it\'s extremely difficult for the users to have a say in resolving any conflicts. A decentralized approach would give more power to the users.""\n\nAnother motivation behind the currently unnamed project is money. Reddit is run largely by volunteer moderators, and some redditors feel exploited by a company that profits off their donated time and labor. In a decentralized system, Charles believes that moderators and contributors could be paid based on the quality of their work. On a post to Medium, which serves as a call to arms to build a new Reddit, Charles outlines exactly how a payment system could work.\n\nEach user has an app, the Reddit app, which connects to the Reddit p2p network. For most users, the app is a normal web app. Each user funds their own app with a small amount of bitcoin. In order to download content, the user pays a very, very small amount of bitcoin to the peers on the network. This incentivizes people to keep the app open so as to keep servicing the other users. Furthermore, when a user upvotes content, that sends a small amount of bitcoin to the author of that content, thus incentivizing the production of good content.\n\nCharles\'s vision has already received some indirect support from tech investors. On July 5, the same day Charles published his Medium article, prominent venture capitalist Fred Wilson wrote a blog post analyzing Reddit\'s ""growing pains,"" concluding that there is a ""very interesting opportunity to build a truly decentralized media platform.""\n\nHowever, Charles has a long road to travel. Once the prototype is built, he will still have to enlist redditors to adopt the platform—not that there isn\'t precedent for such a community exodus. Much of Reddit\'s success can be traced to the demise of the original Digg, a similar aggregator service that alienated its userbase in 2010 following a widely-hated redesign of the product that the company would not walk back. But Charles is not sure Reddit is experiencing a Digg-like moment, saying he is ""convinced the current leadership is competent and can repair the damage.""\n\nBut even if Reddit regains the favor of its community, Charles is determined to move forward with the project.\n\n""New technology has enabled new possibilities for users to be directly rewarded for their contributions. The opportunity is for something different. Not something that competes with Reddit, but something new that allows a community to have ownership over their content.""', 'CNBC ran an article earlier this week announcing that the Greek Island of Agistri will test Brian Kelly’s Nautiluscoin. The tumultuous economic environment in Greece provides the opportune climate to deploy a new altcoin, Kelly argues. The CNBC article is a highlight reel for Nautiluscoin. It never mentions the serious challenges any altcoin faces, or that a rapid large scale deployment of a virtually unknown cryptocurrency is a pipe dream. That makes a lot more sense though, when you realize Brian Kelly is the article’s author.\n\nWhat is Nautiluscoin?\n\nNautiluscoin was first heralded in a CNBC article (we’ll call this article “the 2014 article”) published more than a year ago. In the 2014 article, Brian Kelly documents his experience creating an altcoin using the now defunct coingen.io. In that article, Kelly admits his new altcoin has some flaws, and “I decided that the best use of Nautiluscoin was education.”\n\nI have to assume that the Nautiluscoin Brain Kelly described creating in the 2014 article is not the same Nautiluscoin he is pimping pumping today. My assumption is based on one simple reason: Matt Corallo’s coingen.io was a snazzy one-stop shop for altcoin creation, but it didn’t have a proof-of-stake option.\n\nSo what’s the deal with this new and improved Nautiluscoin? Kelly designed a proof-of-stake coin that uses a large pre-mine reserve as a central bank, which Kelly calls the “Nautiluscoin Stability Fund.” It will employ counter-cyclical monetary policy to keep growth relatively steady. When growth occurs rapidly, the central bank reserve will pay low interest rates to Nautiluscoin owners. When growth is lagging, it will pay higher interest rates.\n\nAdditionally, Kelly says Nautiluscoin will be backed by gold. He says he has designed the system so that the gold backing will remain consistent as more Nautiluscoin is released:\n\nThe fees generated will be used by the Nautiluscoin Stability Fund to purchase gold – in this way, as the monetary ecosystem grows the amount of gold backing Nautiluscoin will also grow. Our goal by recycling the fees is to grow the amount of gold backing Nautiluscoin.\n\nThis isn’t an exhaustive description of Nautiluscoin, but it’s the basic points. You can read the whole Nautiluscoin White Paper here.\n\nRead more: Litecoin Overtakes Bitcoin Trading Volume\n\nHow Greece Fits into the picture\n\nThe main thrust of Kelly’s announcement this week is that his Nautiluscoin will debut on the main stage in Greece later this month. He cites the ongoing debt crisis as the perfect backdrop to unveil his new coin. Kelly has struck a deal with the Mayor of Agistri to use the small island as a “pilot program” for Nautiluscoin. What isn’t clear is what this means- how will he possibly convince merchants to accept Nautiluscoin?\n\nKelly specifically cites the tourism industry as the vector for promoting Nautiluscoin. This is where I get really, really confused. Perhaps I’m daft, but I don’t understand how an altcoin will promote tourism. My research indicates the island is already a tourist destination, so let’s assume that’s true. I have to imagine in times of crisis (like the present), merchants want what tourists already have: cold, hard cash. This was Andreas Antonopoulos’ take:\n\nThe Greeks on the island of Agistri have access to cash that most other Greeks can only dream of at the moment. I harbor serious reservations they would entertain the idea of giving up that advantage.\n\nOf course, the situation in Greece does seem to be encouraging interest in bitcoin, but that is not necessarily true in Agistri.\n\nWhere Does That Leave Us?\n\nWith the news that Greece will likely accept harsh austerity measures in return for a new bailout, the basic premise for Brian Kelly’s Nautiluscoin experiment appears to be unraveling. But let’s pretend it’s not.\n\nAt best, Nautiluscoin is a pipe dream. Some analysts have dubbed Nautiluscoin, and the CNBC announcement, a scam- citing the massive price rise on Cryptsy following the announcement. I’m not ready to call it a scam, but it certainly has a lot of loose ends, and I wouldn’t recommend selling the farm to invest.\n\nMaybe Nautiluscoin does address the concerns that some people have with bitcoin. Maybe it addresses them successfully. Will Agistri provide the launch pad for the bitcoin-killer? No.\n\nWhat’s your take on Nautiluscoin? Share above and comment below\n\nDisclaimer: The author of this article presently has no holdings or financial interest in any altcoins, including Nautiluscoin. He does own bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'With so many Bitcoin exchanges emerging in the last two years, it can get quite confusing knowing where to get your Bitcoins. Most people do “the obvious thing” which is to compare the different Bitcoin exchanges based on the exchange rate and then usually go with the cheapest one.\n\nThe problem is that the exchange rate is only part of the equation, and sometimes a very small part of it. When trying to figure out how much it will cost you to get your Bitcoin from a specific trading platform or broker, you have to take into account the total money you spend in comparison to the total Bitcoins you’ve received.\n\nThe right thing to do would be to also calculate the transaction fee a specific platform would charge you. But there isn’t just one fee to take into account – there are actually five.\n\nFive Transaction Fees is Normal on Bitcoin Exchanges\n\nThe most common fee you’ll encounter is the transaction fee. This is what any trading platform or broker will take as a fee for their service. This fee can vary between exchanges from as little as 0.2% to as high as almost 3%. Finding the transaction fee should be pretty easy, as most exchanges list it on their FAQ or fees section.\n\nNow we come to the second tier of fees – deposit and withdrawal fees. Whenever you’ll want to use a specific platform, whether it is a broker or a trading platform, you’ll have to deposit some money first. Depending on your selected payment method you’ll have very different deposit fees. Usually, the riskier the payment method is to the exchange, the higher the fee.\n\nWhen I say “risky”, what I mean is: how much is the seller exposed to chargebacks by the customer? For example, when you wire your deposit to the exchange, there is no option for chargebacks. Once the money arrived at the exchange it’s theirs. On the other hand, if you use a credit card, debit card, PayPal or any other form of 3rd party payment form you will usually be entitled to chargebacks if you request them. Since the exchange needs to take this into account they will usually have higher fees for these methods\n\nFor example, you can find an exchange that has a 0% deposit fee on wire transfers and a 4% deposit fee on debit cards, so as you can see this can become a pretty considerable amount when added to the transaction fee.\n\nBut unfortunately it doesn’t stop there…\n\nSeveral exchanges will even charge you a withdrawal fee for withdrawing your own Bitcoins. Although not as common as the deposit fee, the withdrawal fee is another variable for your calculations.\n\nMost of the time you’ll find the deposit and withdrawal fees only on the “deposit” and “withdrawal” sections after you’ve registered an account and logged in.\n\nSo that’s it? Are we done with all of the fees? Not quite…\n\nThere are two more types of fees we need to consider. They may not be directly related to the exchange we are buying from but they will affect our bottom line.\n\nThe first is the payment processor deposit fee. Depending on your payment method, the payment processor may charge you a fee for using their services. For example, if you wire in money to an exchange, your bank will probably charge you some sort of fee for that. If you use your credit card to deposit at an exchange you may get charged as well.\n\nThe main issue with this fee is that it’s pretty hard to locate. You will need to contact each payment processor individually and ask them how much they will charge for this specific transaction. You’ll be able to avoid this fee if you wire domestically or within the same region (e.g. SEPA transfers).\n\nThe last fee, which you will most likely be able to avoid in many cases, is the currency conversion fee. If you deposit US dollars in an exchange that accepts only Euros you will also need to pay a fee for converting your currency; this may be done by your bank or the exchange. The wise thing to do here would be to avoid the need to exchange the currency in the first place. Try depositing currencies that are accepted by your exchange of choice.\n\nYes, now we’re done.\n\nAn Example of a Bitcoin Exchange’s Fees\n\nLet’s use a short example to see just how much these fees can affect the exchange rate. I’ll use Bitstamp as the exchange and a wire transfer as the payment method. The reason for this is that the fees on wire transfers are (supposedly) the lowest.\n\nLet’s say I have $250 to spend and if I just take Bitstamp’s current exchange rate at face value that should give me exactly 1 Bitcoin. But now let’s see how much the addition of fees will affect this.\n\nInternational bank transfers to Bitstamp carry a 0.05% deposit fee with a minimum of $7.5. In our case the deposit fee comes up to $7.5 since we don’t hit the minimum. So we’re already left with $243.\n\nTransaction fees for under $20K are 0.25% that is pretty reasonable. This means that I will need to deduct another $0.6 from my balance that will give me a total of $242.4.\n\nNow assuming the exchange takes place at the market price I will receive 0.9696BTC.\n\nKeep in mind that I haven’t even taken into account how much my bank will charge for the initial wire. Wire transfers in the US can cost up to $65. Even if we add a “decent” fee of $30, we’ll still arrive at only 0.8496BTC in the end.\n\nFor the final part, let’s calculate the effective exchange rate for buying $250 worth of Bitcoins with Bitstamp using a wire transfer in the US. 250/0.8496 = $294 per 1 Bitcoin.\n\nNow of course the wire transfer fee isn’t directly related to Bitstamp and it’s not “their fault”, but perhaps in this case I’m better off with a different exchange that will supply me with a deposit method that doesn’t have any bank fees. For example, if I live in the US, I can use Coinbase which supplies ACH transfers that cost virtually nothing.\n\nTo conclude, you can see that the exchange is only one out of many variables you should take into account when selecting where to buy your Bitcoins. Also, I’m hopeful that as competition ramps up and more exchanges emerge, fewer fees will be charged. At the current situation, even though Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, we’re just substituting old banks for new ones with all of these fees.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'F2POOL, one of the largest Chinese bitcoin mining pools has generated the largest bitcoin transaction ever recorded in an attempt to alleviate the massive spam attack launched on the bitcoin network this week, which Bitcoin Magazinepreviously covered.\n\nAn anonymous figure or an organization has sent thousands of micro bitcoin transactions across the network now referred to as “dust,” to temporarily clog up the bitcoin network.\n\nWhile the attack appears to have ended, miners are still catching up on the backlog of transactions. At the time of writing, the number of unconfirmed transactions had dropped to 33,000. In order to process these transactions at a faster rate, F2POOL took the unusual step of creating a custom transaction that occupied an entire block\n\nThe transaction generated by F2POOL was 999 kilobytes in size, taking up the maximum storage of a block or a packet of transaction data.\n\nNicholas Weaver, current UC Berkeley computer security researcher toldMotherboard, “Overall, quite impressive. But I can still think of things that could further increase the effectiveness of the attacks.” He explained that the individual or the group that have initiated the attack can add rewards to their junk transactions to encourage miners to process their transactions first, “leaving real transactions out.”', ""Matthew Spoke is a senior consultant at Deloitte Canada and is actively involved in the company's internal initiative to explore uses of blockchain technology in accounting. Here, in an article co-authored with his colleague Shannon Steele, he explores why a blockchain-based audit system is the future of accounting.\n\nFollowing the Enron Scandal in October of 2001, something unprecedented happened. For the first time in its modern history, although for a short period, the global audit industry lost its most precious asset: public trust. Although the industry has since recovered, and the rules have changed to limit the risk of another scandal of similar proportions, the potential for auditor fraud, as uncovered in 2001, still remains.\n\nOver the course of the evolution of financial markets, primarily in the 20th and 21st centuries, there was an obvious and increasing need for a system of public accountability. Traditional methods of accounting and bookkeeping allowed companies to record and report their financial information in a standardized format that could be more easily digested by public investors; but without adequate trust, the public was often left at the mercy of self-interested businesses. Enter auditors.\n\nThe role of the auditor\n\nAn audit is quite simply an opinion provided on the financial statements of a company based on pre-determined accounting guidelines (most commonly International Accounting Standards). The role of the auditor is to provide the trusted voice that states that opinion. On this, an enormous and lucrative industry has been built, with the majority of large players in global financial markets being audited by the “Big Four” (Deloitte, PwC, Ernst & Young, KPMG).\n\n“Bitcoin, the most common use of a blockchain, has proven to be tremendously valuable as a network for broad transparency and security”\n\nTo be clear, the intention of this article is not to suggest that the public trust placed in auditors has been compromised or misplaced. In fact, I am suggesting quite the opposite. Because of our trusted roles, I’m suggesting that auditors are best positioned to shift the paradigm from one of trust to one where trust is required less and less.\n\nThe evolution of bitcoin, and more broadly of distributed ledgers, has been discussed as being potentially disruptive in the context of many major industries. In different scenarios, significant variations of blockchain architectures have been suggested. Bitcoin, the most common use of a blockchain, has proven to be tremendously valuable as a network for broad transparency and security, where public participation and visibility is essential.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum have emerged private solutions that share common characteristics of blockchains but that have greater flexibility for data privacy and authorized access. Across this spectrum (from fully public to private) lies the solutions to many of the world’s centralized data problems, including financial reporting and auditing. Although I don’t claim to yet have that solution, I am confident that such a solution will soon emerge that will slowly start to alter the auditing industry for the better.\n\nProblems and opportunities\n\nTo better understand the solution, let me first explain the problem, or the opportunity. Those familiar with accounting will understand the concept of double-entry bookkeeping. Yuji Ijiri, one of the leading minds in accounting of the last few decades, explained double-entry bookkeeping as being an evolution “from single-entry, which just recorded what happened, to double-entry, where what happened has to be explained by reasoning with another account. So if you don’t have an explanation, you can’t have an entry”.\n\nThis is the basis of debits and credits in accounting, where one account tracks a balance and the other an event or activity. Consider a scenario where, on June 1, 20X5, Company X sells $100 of product and receives a promise to pay (i.e. an Account Receivable) for $100:\n\nJune 1, 20X5\n\nCR Revenue $100\n\nDR Accounts Receivable $100\n\nOver the course of an operating period, balances like the ones shown above accumulate with each additional entry. By the end of the year 20X5, Company X may be owed $500 from this same customer after all invoices and payments are netted together. This is the point in time where the auditor comes in. Because Company X is accountable to several investors, they require accurate financial statements to characterize the financial health of their business.\n\nIn addition to the Accounts Receivable balance from this one customer for $500, Company X has numerous accounts that are being reported with other customers and suppliers. In essence, the auditor will test a reasonable sample of these balances, and the transactions they are comprised of, to make sure that the reporting is “close enough” to the truth (based on the materiality of the company). Often, the auditor’s test will include communicating with the respective trading partner to have them confirm the balance reported on Company X’s financial statements.\n\nIn addition to this entire process, consider that for each customer and supplier, there could be another auditor testing the very same transactions on the other end. In terms of instances of redundancy and inefficiency, this is one of global proportions.\n\nQuestioning the underlying premise\n\nThe audit processes involved in the scenario described above have remained relatively unchanged for decades, with slight improvements to change the nature of the information from paper to digital, but without questioning the underlying premise and the role of the auditor. The technology of a distributed decentralized ledger is very well suited to address this scenario.\n\nWithout suggesting a particular architecture, according to bitcoin investor Trace Mayer, a blockchain solution provides “a globally distributed decentralized ledger that everyone has the exact same copy of”.\n\nWith the ability to compare accounting entries between two trading partners, while maintaining data privacy, this solution could significantly reduce the reliance on auditors for testing financial transactions. Once a match is posted to the blockchain, the transaction is time stamped and irreversibly recorded. “Everyone agrees on consensus that those transactions actually happened, and boom you have that verification. You have the debit, the credit, and the confirmation by the network.”\n\nA blockchain solution could essentially allow for an automated third party verification by a distributed network to ensure that transactions are complete and accurate and unalterable.\n\nAs described, it is difficult to properly convey the size of this opportunity. The use of a blockchain for the purpose of audit is unique from other uses as audits impact all industries and are the fundamental basis by which global financial markets are trusted by investors.\n\nOf course, along with the suggested solution above, there are many questions that need to be answered. What blockchain is best suited for this function? Who will secure this blockchain? How can you ensure data privacy relating to companies’ financial information? etc.\n\nThe purpose of this article is not to answer these questions, but rather to suggest that no one is better suited to facilitate this obvious and inevitable transition than today’s auditors and public accountants.

They can also buy bitcoin at One Kick Nick’s Mixed Martial Arts Gym which now has a bitcoin ATM. The popular Las Vegas gym recently installed a bitcoin ATM to meet the growing interest in bitcoin among the youthful, tech-savvy mixed martial arts community. Bitcoin Direct LLC, an Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company, mounted the General Bytes ATM on a wall in plain view of visitors and students.\n\nPatrons can buy bitcoins from the unidirectional ATM with cash or by using their smart phones and the QR code. The ATM, made in Prague, Czechoslovakia, distributes bitcoin from wallets and bitcoin exchanges.\n\nA Way to Promote MMA Fighters\n\nGym owner Nick Blomgren sees bitcoin as a way to promote the fighters he sponsors. He sponsors several professional mixed martial arts fighters who regularly compete on national television for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Bellator MMA, and World Series of Fighting.\n\nBlomgren became interested in bitcoin after hearing his fighters talk about it. “The fighters wanted to know if they could get paid with bitcoin,” he said. “(Bitcoin) is on the minds of the 25-to-35-year olds.” The gym’s fighters now wear Bitcoin logos on their shorts when they compete in front of the Pay Per View, Access TV and Spike TV cameras.\n\nBitcoin Direct LLC processes the transactions for the gym via a web server. Gym patrons can pay for memberships and merchandise in bitcoin. Bitcoin Direct LLC has a technician in Las Vegas who can address any technical issues with the ATM.\n\nPeter Klamka, owner of Bitcoin Direct LLC, believes One Kick Nick’s is the first gym in the country to accept bitcoin. As part of the ATM service agreement, Bitcoin Direct LLC has become a gym sponsor, giving the company the opportunity to place display ads in the facility.\n\nAlso read: Midtown Manhattan Vegan Restaurant Lets Patrons Buy Bitcoin From ATM\n\nMore Bitcoin ATMs Coming To Vegas\n\nKlamka, who is based in Ann Arobr, Mich., relocated to Las Vegas temporarily and expects to have seven General Bytes bitcoin ATMs open by the end of the month. He has also installed a bitcoin ATM in a Las Vegas smoke shop. In addition to his two Las Vegas installations, Klamka operates one in New York City, one in Grand Rapids, Mich. and one in Montreal, Canada.\n\nKlamka said retailers like bitcoin ATMs since they generate attention and build customer traffic, thereby improving sales. He gives retail customers the choice of purchasing an ATM outright or contracting to allow the company to operate the machine in exchange for a commission. Thus far, most retail customers have opted for the commission arrangement.\n\nThere are currently a total of eight bitcoin ATMs in Las Vegas, according to coinatmradar.com, which tracks bitcoin ATMs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Nutzer des bekannten Bitcoin Tipping-Service ChangeTip können nun ihre Accounts um Visa und MasterCard aufstocken und mit diesen Kreditkarten bezahlen.\n\nNachdem nun diese neue Bezahlvariante verfügbar ist, können ChangeTip Nutzer ihr Tipping-Wallet mit Kreditkarte, Bitcoin oder direkter ACH Transaktion nutzen.\n\nKäufe können mit jeder Karte durchgeführt werden die im Visa oder MasterCard Netzwerk sind, jedoch sind American Express und Discover nicht verfügbar.

07/12/2015,"['People line up to use an ATM outside of a bank in Greece, where there is a daily euro withdrawal limit. Photo: Konstantinos Tsakalidis/Bloomberg News\n\nBitcoin, the volatile digital currency, cannot help the Greeks of today. But it could mean a great deal to those caught up in currency crises to come.\n\nGreece’s fundamental problem is that it cannot work its way out of its financial hole the way just about every other country outside the eurozone would: by printing money, and in the process making its goods and labor cheaper. With a freeze on transfers of funds out of the country and a daily limit on how many euros Greeks can withdraw from the bank, there is a very real threat that countless Greek businesses will go bankrupt and Greece’s people could become unable to buy the basic necessities of everyday life.\n\nFor the average Greek, getting one’s hands on bitcoin requires buying it with euros—the last thing any sane Greek would give up. That’s why the bitcoin of today has no bearing on what could easily become a humanitarian crisis.\n\nBut Bitcoin is at an inflection point, and it’s evolving much more quickly than all but its most dedicated observers realize. Whatever happens to bitcoin itself, the technology underlying it opens up previously unimagined possibilities for the future of just about anything humans exchange.\n\nYou don’t have to take my word for it. Hardly a week goes by that a large institution doesn’t announce its interest in bitcoin, whether it’s the chief information officer at UBS saying it could lead to “massive simplification” of banking, or the Bank of England declaring it will someday have “far-reaching implications.” Deloitte recently issued a report on the potential for state-sponsored cryptocurrencies as an alternative to conventional money, and even Nasdaq is testing bitcoin technology for use on its stock exchange.\n\nBitcoin, the volatile digital currency, is accepted world-wide. Photo: Reuters\n\nYanis Varoufakis, Greece’s former finance minister, proposed on his blog more than a year ago that if Greece wanted to create its own currency to replace the euro, it could use the technology of bitcoin to create a currency that he called “Future Taxes” coin, the value of which would be guaranteed by future tax revenue taken in by the government.\n\nIf the idea of Greece rapidly switching to an alternate currency seems ridiculous, consider that it is happening already. In Greece, companies are doing what they often do in times of currency crisis, which is paying suppliers and employees in IOUs, or scrip, which are promises to pay back a debt as soon as the banks unlock a firm’s money.\n\nI asked Michael Casey, the senior adviser to the MIT Media Lab on cryptocurrencies—and until recently, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal—whether or not the technology underlying bitcoin, known as the blockchain, could be used to issue this scrip.\n\nAbsolutely, he assured me, and the mechanism might be a new technology called “sidechains.”\n\nTo understand sidechains, it helps to know how bitcoin itself works. Broadly, transactions are recorded on a main digital ledger, called the blockchain, which is like any other account of transfers going back to the clay tablets that recorded pharaoh’s stores of grain.\n\nBitcoin’s ledger isn’t processed or stored by one central body. Rather, it is distributed across a global network of computers, some of which are granted an economic incentive to keep the whole system running. Owing to this and other characteristics of bitcoin, no one on the system has to trust anyone else, neither a central transactional authority or the person sending them bitcoin, for the system to work. No third-party verification of the transfer of bitcoin takes place, nor is it needed. Not only is this system potentially faster than current forms of digital transactions, it could also be a lot cheaper.\n\nOn top of this basic protocol, there are a host of proposals to modify bitcoin to let anyone use it for pretty much any transaction, including signing contracts, issuing stock, and representing any kind of currency, from U.S. dollars to frequent-flier miles. Sidechains are arguably the leading contender among these proposals.\n\nBut that’s just the start. Because bitcoin is becoming not a currency unto itself but a protocol, like the communications protocol that makes the Internet possible, as well as a platform, like Apple’s app store, the kinds of transaction systems developers could build on top of it are limited only by our imaginations.\n\nOne idea, says Mr. Casey, is that Greece could create a “collateralized currency” backed by state-owned assets. Cryptocoins representing a fraction of all the country’s islands, ports and factories would hold their value as long as people believe the underlying assets do.\n\nThinking even further into the future, it isn’t hard to imagine a way to use digital tokens to permanently institutionalize the last resort in all currency crises—barter.\n\n“The reason why barter was flawed is you can’t cut a horse in half in return for a bunch of arrowheads or whatever,” says Mr. Casey. But crypto-tokens that individually represent a portion of an asset are infinitely divisible, he says, and “if you have infinitely divisible claims on an asset, then you could trade a third of a horse for a trip to Acapulco.”\n\nIf that sounds a lot like the abstraction known as money that is at the root of Greece’s problems, you can appreciate that no technology can solve poor planning or badly designed systems. That said, the most exciting thing about bitcoin’s blockchain technology is that it has the potential to democratize how money is created. And that, for many observers, is fundamentally what the debate over Greece and the fate of the entire European Union is about.\n\n—Follow Christopher Mims on Twitter @Mims or write to christopher.mims@wsj.com.', 'Coin Cafe is meant to be an easy way to buy and hold bitcoins, but they apparently do not like people attempting to use bitcoins at the free classifieds provider Backpage.com. After the problems that the website had in the last several weeks, with all of its other merchant processing accounts closed, Bitcoin has garnered some coverage.\n\nHowever, it appears that users of Coin Cafe are not welcome to use their hosted wallet to purchase services from Backpage.com. The site seems almost hostile to those who would use its services to hire ads from Backpage.com. It seems this is a company policy, not necessarily the company folding under law enforcement pressure.\n\nSo far, Coinbase and others have yet to say anything about Backpage.com, but these hosted services are known to work with the government. If the government happens to currently trying to shut down Backpage.com, it seems likely that these wallets will eventually help them.\n\nThe solution, for anyone trying to pay Backpage.com, is to get the bitcoins separately and use an actual wallet. Even a mobile or SPV wallet like Electrum will work fine for this purpose. In this scenario, the acquisition of the bitcoins becomes the problem. LocalBitcoins.com will probably be a good way to make this happen. You could buy bitcoins for the long-term usage of the site, for instance, by buying a Paypal MyCash card and going on LocalBitcoins (up to $500). Depending on how fast you want to get your bitcoins, you set a price per BTC you’re willing to pay, and just have one transaction for $500 worth at that price.\n\nOnce a user has the bitcoins, they should not leave them in the LocalBitcoins wallet though they could probably do that as well. It would, however, be much more wise to send them to their wallet from there, which is very easy to do. Then using their wallet, pay for the advertising, and keep the coins safe by password protecting or otherwise encrypting the wallet. That would be more ideal than trying to use a web wallet service that ultimately may do something like Coin Cafe is doing.\n\nIt would seem that Coin Cafe is fully within their rights, but it becomes a question of whose addresses are interacting with Backpage.com – Coin Cafe, or the user? It would seem that if the user were renting the address from the site, then the address would belong to him or her. Therefore, whatever traffic was taking place to and from the address, it would be associated with the user, not the site.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The possibility of a crackdown on encryption systems in the UK has risen again, ringing alarm bells in the bitcoin community.\n\nA terrorist attack that killed 30 UK citizens in Tunisia last month led one MP to question prime minister David Cameron on whether popular social networks and internet services would have to abandon their claimed privacy policies.\n\nCameron and the UK government are on record as saying they do not approve of any communication medium that is 100% secret.\n\nThe question is: given bitcoin\'s cryptographic foundation, would bitcoin businesses find it impossible to function in the UK if such secrecy were banned outright? At least one company has threatened to leave, and others could follow.\n\nA long time coming\n\nThe issue has been simmering since January, when Cameron delivered a speech in which he noted it has always been possible for governments to monitor communications under certain circumstances.\n\n""In our country, do we want to allow a means of communication between people which, even in extremis, with a signed warrant from the Home Secretary personally, that we cannot read? Up until now, governments have said no.""\n\n“Inserting backdoors into encrypted systems for government agencies would effectively render them open.”\n\nWhen Cameron\'s Conservative Party won an outright majority in the UK\'s general election in May, he pledged to parliament that his legislative agenda for the next five years would indeed include targeting the communications of ""terrorists, pedophiles and other serious criminals"" under the Investigatory Powers Bill.\n\nThe bill revives the UK\'s so-called ""snooper\'s charter"", a mass surveillance and monitoring agenda for telecommunications that had been stymied in 2012 by the Conservatives\' then junior coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats. That coalition no longer exists.\n\nReports that the government\'s plan would result in a \'ban\' on PGP, Apple Messages or WhatsApp have been based on speculation so far. The government has not stated explicitly how it intends to handle the issue.\n\nInserting backdoors into encrypted systems for government agencies, however, would effectively render them open since it would be impossible for the provider and end user to ever be certain their communications were not being monitored.\n\nApple enabled system-wide encryption by default with the release of iOS 8, prompting a stark response from John Escalante, chief of detectives for Chicago’s police department, who said the iPhone would now become ""the phone of choice for the pedophile.""\n\nThe realm of possibility\n\nAt this stage it is not clear whether the plan to ban encryption is even possible. The technology has been in the wild for decades now, and previous attempts to limit its use have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe UK\'s own Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology said in a briefing that a ban on encryption is ""infeasible"" from a technological standpoint – though its report is not binding on government decisions.\n\nThe United States National Security Agency (NSA), as Edward Snowden\'s leaked documents revealed, has tried to weaken encryption algorithms as part of its BULLRUN program. It is not known how successful these efforts have been.\n\nEris\' departure\n\nUncertainty over encryption boundaries appears to have cost the UK one business already.\n\nEris Industries, which assists other companies in building distributed blockchain and smart contract applications, announced in May it would shift its headquarters from London to North America if the government took further steps towards limiting encryption.\n\nCOO Preston Byrne told CoinDesk the issue is actually twofold: interference with encryption and retention of user data.\n\n""The idea of banning crypto is so patently ridiculous that I and many others in the data security space were so stunned by the idea that we laughed it off.""\n\nEris, he said, is not a financial services company and does not hold any user funds. But the tools it uses to build its distributed applications such as PGP, Tox or IPFS, rely on strong cryptography in order to provide a peer-to-peer platform with the same functionality as a web server.\n\nAny regulatory burden would fall on the operator of an Eris-based platform that is running a financial service.\n\nRegarding data retention, Eris wants to hold as little user data as possible, preferably none. But there is a fear the telecommunications provisions of the government proposals may cover SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies such as his.\n\n""From a business perspective, the only way you can secure data is by not recording it anywhere.""\n\nByrne added that the response from the community had been ""mostly positive"". While there had been some grumblings that Eris Industries\' announcement was a PR stunt, he said the company had campaigned on civil liberties issues since its launch, and had submitted comments to the British government on the issues upon request.\n\nSince Eris\' software is all open source, it would be difficult to insert anything into the code without users noticing. That said, the company still hopes the UK legislation will never make it to law, saying: ""It\'s our hope the bill will die in committee.""\n\nThe voucher shop\n\nAkin Fernandez, founder and operator of London bitcoin voucher shop Azteco, also has doubts the government will be able to legislate against encryption. ""There is little chance of this idea making it to the statues,"" he said.\n\n""It is not possible for any government to block encryption. They cannot block the software that creates encrypted messages and files, and they have no way of blocking transmission of those files over the net.""\n\nLikening any attempt to block encryption to authorities\' failure to block transmission of copyrighted material over the years, Fernandez said computer-illiterate lawmaking is ""completely toothless and impotent"".\n\nBitcoin businesses could move jurisdiction, but software like bitcoin does not rely on businesses to work. Therefore, the law of the internet is the law of the world\'s least restrictive jurisdiction, Fernandez added.\n\n""When they say, \'bitcoin allows you to be your own bank\', this is meant literally, not figuratively.""\n\nWhen asked to speculate on ways a national government might attempt to restrict bitcoin use, the entrepreneur suggested a \'key escrow\' system similar to encryption-snooping proposals of the 1990s. With bitcoin key escrow, governments retain one private key of a multisig wallet and would retain the right to seize the funds in case of a user\'s wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, Fernandez pointed out that such a system would be fundamentally unworkable, as there is no way a government could maintain adequate key security in a world where all encryption is backdoored, or inherently broken.\n\nThis would also be true if governments were allowed to keep a \'bitcoin master key\' to access any funds at will. Forcing 100% compliance on either program would also be difficult, since users would have access to bitcoins from outside such a system.\n\nWhile Fernandez said he would not be making any changes to the way his company does business, the option to incorporate in a friendlier jurisdiction, like Luxembourg or Lithuania, still remains should the situation worsen.\n\nA familiar scene\n\nThe early 1990s saw what has come to be known as the \'crypto wars\', as the US government had laws to limit the world\'s access to encryption it could not itself crack.\n\nLeading the fight was Phil Zimmermann, inventor of the cryptography system in question, open-source \'pretty-good privacy\' or PGP software. Alongside him was fellow \'cypherpunk\' Hal Finney, also noted for receiving the first ever bitcoin transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nPGP was released onto the internet in 1991, and Zimmermann was investigated by the State Department and other US government agencies for his \'crime\'.\n\nThe authorities responded with their own encrypted chipset called the \'Clipper Chip\', to be used in all communications devices. It was released in 1993, but by 1996 it withered from lack of adoption by manufacturers.\n\nPGP was already in the wild, widely used, and completely unstoppable. Its use was integral in facilitating the growth of the e-commerce economy. Zimmermann himself has described the UK proposals as ""absurd"".\n\nAny UK attempt to ban encryption, or restrict bitcoin in a similar manner, is highly likely to meet the same fate. Both are already firmly within the general public\'s reach.\n\nCollection and retention of personal data, however, remains popular with policymakers worldwide, and is likely to play a greater role in the way future commerce is conducted.\n\nDavid Cameron image via 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

She publicly took responsibility for the management errors that ultimately sent the platform into chaos, motivating a large portion of the user base to switch to a Reddit-clone news aggregator called Voat.\n\nLast week, more than 213,000 people signed a petition demanding Pao’s resignation. The majority of the users who signed were furious about the company’s decision to relieve Reddit administrator Victoria Taylor.

The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of Reddit.”\n\nWith the resignation of Pao, Reddit co-founder Steve Hoffman, who founded the website 10 years ago, will replace Pao as the new chief executive officer, after stepping down as the CTO of Hipmunk, a popular travel search site.\n\nSteve Huffman announced on /r/IAmA, “I know we have a lot of work to do. One of my first priorities is to re-establish a relationship with the community.

And does it have money?\n\nThe long lines at money machines have emerged as a key symbol of a nation in crisis. Since June 29, capital controls, designed to keep money within Greek borders, have restricted daily withdrawals to 60 euros per day. It has wreaked havoc on daily life in a country where most people pay for nearly everything in cash.\n\nIt\'s also led people to devise creative ways to game the system.\n\n""My parents go to the ATM just before midnight, then get back in line and withdraw again at 10 past,"" said 18-year-old Anna Chatziparisi, a student. Other tips being spread among people include avoiding ATMs with no lines in busy areas — they likely don\'t have money — and keeping an eye out for machines in uncommon spots, such as inside hospitals, schools and supermarkets.\n\nAs Greek and other European leaders enter their second day of heated discussions over Greece’s latest bailout proposal, ordinary Greeks are worried that they won’t be able to withdraw money within the next few days – and that their deposits won’t be safe when the banks reopen.\n\nFinancial analysts have warned that banks may run out of cash by Monday if a deal is not reached this weekend. For days, ATMs have been running low on ten and 20-euro banknotes, meaning many people have only been able to withdraw 50 euros per day.\n\nSeveral major companies – including supermarket chains Sklavenitis and AB Vassilopoulos along with electronics retailer Kotsovolos – paid their employees in cash this week. Had they paid by direct deposits to employees\' bank accounts, they would not have had access to their funds.\n\nPeople stand in a queue to use ATM of a bank as others sit on chairs put out from the branch in Athens.\n\nBut other Greek companies did not pay their employees at all.\n\nThe Greek government has stepped in to help where it can. In the Athens metropolitan area, home to 4 million of Greece’s 11 million citizens, all forms of public transportation have been free for the past two weeks.\n\nThe government also reached agreement with telecommunications firms so they would not cut off Internet and phone access for people who can’t pay their bills. Public utility companies have also promised not to interrupt access.\n\nPeople wait for public transportation at a bus stop in central Athens. Public transportation is currently free as Greece tries to keep its economy running without much money. Image: Emilio Morenatti/Associated Press\n\nMany have been unable to pay their rent. Chatziparisi, for example, is goes to school in England and hasn\'t been able to pay her landlord electronically, as she usually does. Greeks are restricted from sending money across borders with their Greek bank cards.\n\nHer saving grace? ""He\'s been on vacation, "" says Chatziparisi, who is home in Greece for the summer. ""I haven\'t been able to reach him so I don\'t think he\'s noticed.""\n\nFotis Georgopoulos, a 40-year-old cab driver in Athens, says he’s never seen so many customers short on cash.\n\n“They get in and they tell me, ‘I have this much. How far can you take me?’” he says. If he can, he’ll take them the full route, he says. But his business has fallen greatly over the past few weeks.\n\nSometimes people are not paying at all. On the islands of Santorini and Agistiri, ATM machines ran out of money within the first few days of capital controls, according to news reports. With few public transportation options on Greek islands, some tourists felt they had no choice but to stiff local cab drivers.\n\nSantorini, one of Greece\'s most beautiful islands, used to attract tourism and competitions like this Red Bull Art of Motion. Now it is struggling for money. Image: Predrag Vuckovic/Red Bull/SIPA/Associated Press\n\nSuch tales have spurred tens of thousands of hotel and booking cancellations across the Greece just as the country hits the peak of its tourist season. Tourism accounts for about 17% of the Greek economy.\n\nThe retail sector is feeling the crunch, too. Stores in Athens are plastered with advertisements for sales and special prices weeks before the usual summer sale period. Restrictions on ATM withdrawals mean people are spending their cash on staples like food and gasoline instead. So retailers are practically begging people to keep spending with credit and debit cards.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the National Confederation of Commerce and Entrepreneurship said it “urges customers to forget closed banks and restrictions on access to their accounts and take advantage – with their credit cards – the opportunities that will undoubtedly make for cheap shopping.”\n\nA boy plays with a small Greek flag in a shop for tourists in the old town of Kos on Kos island, Greece. Tourism spending is down but Greece is encouraging people to buy, buy, buy, and sales are getting more prevalent. Image: Santi Palacios/Associated Press\n\nBigger-ticket items, however, have seen sales increases over the past two weeks as people flock to stores for “panic buying”: people are afraid prices will shoot up if Greece leaves the euro. Electronics, home appliances and jewelry have sold especially well.\n\nGreeks are also loading up credit and debit cards because they fear a bail-in, a situation where Greece would skim money from people’s deposits to avoid a banking system collapse as happened in Cyprus in 2013. Newspapers have floated the idea of a possible “kourema” – the Greek word for “haircut” – of 30% on accounts over 8,000 euros when banks reopen.\n\nIn public statements, however, Greece’s Bank Association dismissed these reports as baseless.\n\n\n\nBut many Greeks have lost faith in their government throughout the six-year financial crisis and particularly in recent months.\n\nOne 33-year-old mother of two in Athens says she has been spending heavily over the last two to bring her 14,000-euro bank account below 8,000. She has paid off all her bills with her debit card. And she also spent at least 1,000 euros on winter clothing for her children.\n\n“I do not have a problem if they were to ask me for the money so that I can help my country,” she said. “But I will not allow them to take it from me without asking.”\n\n“We are Greek,” she added. “We have learned to think like this over the past few years.”\n\nA Bitcoin ATM in Texas. In the past month, the machines have started popping up in Greece as bitcoin advocates hope to gain fans who despair of getting cash.

The virtual currency is not tied to geography or government-run financial systems, which means users aren\'t restricted to capital control limits. And because the machine is two-way, people who use the virtual currency can both buy and sell bitcoins and euros.\n\nThe machine, located at an Athens-based startup and coworking space called The Cube, has a withdrawal limit of 1,000 euros. For now, the machine does not charge a commission for each transaction.\n\n""The freedom bitcoin gives you is greater than the freedom euros give you right now,"" said 23-year old Bitchain representative Adrian Verde at a gathering Saturday of a dozen bitcoin entrepreneurs who had flocked to Greece to discuss increasing bitcoin use here. ""Everyone presumes that a bank won\'t fail them, but right now has demonstrated that banks can\'t be trusted because people can\'t get their own money.""\n\nVerde dubbed bitcoin ""Greece\'s Plan B."" If there was a similar crisis with a bitcoin-based currency, he added, people would not be restricted from accessing their funds. Demand for bitcoin in Europe has picked up in recent weeks, shooting up 500% in Greece alone. About 20 people made 2,000 euros worth of bitcoin transactions on Bitchain\'s machine on Saturday, Verde said. Bitchain\'s ATM brings the number of bitcoin kiosks in Greece to four, with three installed just this weekend. The first came to Greece less than a month ago.', '', 'The future of electronics cooling is a topic plaguing many technology and Bitcoin enthusiasts alike. With the mounting electricity costs, air cooling is no longer a viable option if you are deploying electronics en masse. And water cooling is a possible solution, but far from practical. But there is a good news, as researchers have cracked the code on how to use graphene-based film for electronics cooling.\n\nAlso read: BitFury’s Allied Control to Reduce Energy Footprint for Chip Cooling\n\nEfficient Graphene-Based Chip Cooling\n\nOver the years, scientists and engineers have been working hard to unlock the mystery of how to use graphene)based solutions to cool electronics. Researchers at the Chalmers University of Technology have been working with graphene-based film, and so far, their efforts have proven to be quite successful.\n\nThe main reason for this success is because the graphene-based film has a conductive thermal capacity four times the one of copper. Additionally, this graphene-based film can be attached to electronics made of silicon, which in turn favours the film’s performance. Previous tests have always struggled to overcome this hurdle when applying graphene to silicon-based electronics.\n\nIt is no secret that modern electronics generate quite a bit of heat, mostly due to the levels of performance required from the chips inside. Due to inefficient ways to removing excess heat, the lifespan of our electronics is affected. This is most notable in portable devices such as smartphones and tablets, which are facing overheating problems after 12-15 months of heavy usage.\n\nJohan Liu, Professor at Chalmers University of Technology stated:\n\n“It has become evident that those methods cannot be used to rid electronic devices off great amounts of heat, because they have consisted only of a few layers of thermal conductive atoms. When you try to add more layers of graphene, another problem arises, a problem with adhesiveness. We have now solved this problem by managing to create strong covalent bonds between the graphene film and the surface, which is an electronic component made of silicon.”\n\nGraphene-Based Film To Cool Bitcoin Mining Hardware?\n\nThe long-term result of the increased thermal capacity provided by the graphene-based film could lead to the development of faster and more energy-efficient high-power electronics. For the time being, however, practical applications will be limited to LEDs, radio frequency components and lasers.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that graphene-based film cooling solutions could not play a factor in the world of Bitcoin mining. In recent years, cooling solutions for Bitcoin mining hardware have transitioned from air cooling to data center solutions, and even immersion cooling. Perhaps graphene-based film is the next evolutionary step in the process, but only time can tell.\n\nWhat is your opinion on graphene-based film cooling, and will it ever make its way to consumer grade electronics?

Britain cut off Mr Modi diplomatically after riots in his home state of Gujarat in 2002. Most of the dead were Muslims and critics have accused him of being complicit. Relations were only restored in 2012 after Indian investigators cleared him of any responsibility. Downing Street is promising to pull out all the stops for his first official visit as prime minister, with Mr Cameron keen to boost the trading relationship between the two countries. The government is looking for ways to use the Indian diaspora living in the UK to improve the relationship between the two countries, which has been difficult at times during the past few years. As part of that effort, people with knowledge of the visit have told the Financial Times that Mr Modi is likely to address a crowd of Hindus at the temple in Wembley soon after the Diwali celebrations. One Conservative MP involved in the discussions said: “We’re keen to do everything we can to maximise the effect of the Indian community here in the UK to bring us closer together.” But Muslim groups are unhappy about what they see as an uncritical welcome being afforded to Mr Modi. Shamsuddin Agha, president of the Indian Muslim Federation in the UK, said: “We know [Mr] Cameron has to look after business in this country, but he should be more careful about how he deals with Mr Modi,” said Mr Agha, who said his group was talking about the possibility of protesting against the visit. A cricket mogul tests the image of the Modi government Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s government has found itself battling an unexpected political fire, sparked by allegations that Sushma Swaraj, foreign minister, did favours for Lalit Modi, the exiled architect of the riotous Indian Premier League cricket tournament. Continue reading The UK prime minister is keen to downplay such concerns as he makes a big push to improve trade between the two countries, having promised to double UK trade with India from 2010 to 2015. But despite carrying out high-profile trade missions to the country, Mr Cameron is a long way from meeting that goal — exports to India last year were more than £100m lower than in 2010. Ministers point out, however, that India is now the third-biggest source of foreign investment into the UK in terms of the number of projects being financed. During Mr Cameron’s tenure, relations between the two countries have occasionally been strained, not least because of frustration among Indian businesses about UK visa restrictions. Last month, the Confederation of Indian Industry expressed “deep concern” over Mr Cameron’s immigration policies. “There are over 800 Indian companies operating in the UK,” said Sumit Mazumder, CII president. “Many companies avail the ICT [Intra-Company Transfer] visa and their operations may be severely disrupted.” Britain says 91 per cent of Indians applying in the year to March obtained their visas, and the number of work visas issued rose 10 per cent to 55,000. Officials in London, meanwhile, are hoping that the UK will join the lengthening list of nations whose short-term visitors are granted so-called e-visas that take only four days to process. A delegation of business leaders visited the UK last week for talks on how to improve the bilateral business relationship, but the visit by Mr Modi comes relatively late in his tour of foreign capitals. The Big Read India: Land in demand As the country shifts from an agrarian to an industrialised economy, selling farmland fairly is a priority Continue reading Successive Indian leaders, perhaps mindful of the uncomfortable 400-year-old legacy of British colonialism, have been slow to respond to the eager commercial overtures of British governments in recent years. Mr Modi will be the first Indian prime minister to visit Britain for nearly a decade, even though Mr Cameron has been to India three times. Mr Cameron is also likely to plead the case for British investors in India — including Vodafone, which is embroiled in tax disputes over retrospective demands running into billions of dollars. Mr Modi’s visit will happen just a month after the state visit to the UK by Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, which was announced by the government at the beginning of this parliament. Mr Xi and his wife will be given an audience with the Queen, nearly two years after Mr Cameron took the largest ever UK trade delegation to China. Chancellor George Osborne helped improve relations between the two countries when he decided to join the China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which the US sees as a rival to the World Bank.

This could, as a result, have driven today's bitcoin price decline.\n\nSome commentators took to social media to reinforce the connection between the events in Greece and bitcoin's price movements.\n\nA tweet sent from the Twitter account belonging to Charlie Shrem, a bitcoin entrepreneur and the digital currency's 'first felon', currently serving a two year prison sentence for aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business, added to the speculation, suggesting that fellow Greek inmates were showing an increased interest in the digital currency.\n\n#GreekCrisis continues and Greek inmates now asking me how to buy Bitcoin while in prison. #Bitcoin@rogerkver@ErikVoorhees — Charlie Shrem (@CharlieShrem) July 12, 2015\n\nLooking at the data\n\nSome bitcoin exchanges reported a surge in EUR/BTC trades from Greece in the wake of the country's crisis.\n\nAccording to Finextra, Bitstamp reported an increase of 79% on their 10-week average, which drew some criticism from redditors who questioned whether the exchange previously had a lot of Greece-based customers.\n\nWhilst other exchanges also reported a notable increase in EUR/BTC purchases from within Greece, these surges could be attributed to the fact that some companies – such as Coinbase – canceled fees for euro trades in a seeming attempt to drive bitcoin purchases.\n\nAccording to Bitcoinity, a data website which offers an insight into the trading volumes of the major bitcoin exchanges, the EUR/BTC trading volume reached unprecedented levels in the last six months, peaking on 12th July.\n\nPrice predictions\n\nAs a highly volatile digital currency, bitcoin's price has previously captivated the attention of both skeptics and enthusiasts in the past.\n\nJust last week, a new report by Wedbush Securities predicted the price of bitcoin would reach $400 during the next year.\n\nAt the time of press, bitcoin's price stood at $282.16.\n\nPrice chart image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

One thousand entries from that list were published on the site at the time. The website is currently offline.\n\nCloudminr, which its owners previously said was hosted in Norway, had been offering mining contracts since November of last year. The service drew criticism for its operational opacity and accusations that Cloudminr was a mining-related Ponzi scheme soon followed.\n\nOn 6th July, the primary Bitcoin Talk account for the service claimed that a hack had taken place. Payouts hadn\'t happened, it was asserted, because of internal concern over the legitimacy of the payment addresses on file.\n\nThe message continued:\n\n""Part of the bitcoins went to hackers addresses instead of our own payment addresses. Currently we are looking for any logs related to the hack and estimating the losses. We need to create a new website from scratch on new servers as hackers usually leave backdoors for later access.

The site is said to sell millions of classified ads to women in the United States, and a sheriff in Illinois instigated the shutdown. Before that, MasterCard and Visa had no problem processing transactions for Backpage.\n\nBackpage began accepting Bitcoin at some point, and now it is the only form of payment that works for the website. Of course, the Bitcoin network cannot be shut down. But if you investigate the site, you do see that it is used for sex work largely. These sections are the most active. Then the question becomes: is this a liability or an opportunity to shine for Bitcoin? In essence, how should the Bitcoin community react?\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Wallet and Exchange Coin Cafe Refuses Backpage Users\n\nBeing that the community is largely libertarian in nature, the response will likely be positive. In the end, it doesn’t matter how these people make their money. What matters is that there is only one reliable way left to process online payments. The Dutch company that owns Backpage has repeatedly said it is not specifically trying to facilitate sex work, but it will also not censor paying customers who are not saying things that are illegal. The ads, after all, are often carefully worded to be informative and innocuous.\n\nSo, many see this as an opportunity. Still others will readily point out that this will bring on unwanted attention to Bitcoin, that we will then be subject to being, basically, a community around money for sex and drugs. The community could be defined in harsher terms, even, but not if it were to find some other killer application. Censorship resistance is, after all, not the only feature of Bitcoin. Therefore what needs to happen now is that companies that have a stake in the future of Bitcoin need to start developing around the idea of giving a positive image to the currency.\n\nIs Bitcoin Just Money for Drugs and Sex?\n\nIn the mainstream media, bringing up Bitcoin allows you to bring up the Silk Road. Mixing drugs and prostitution just makes sense, and it doesn’t matter if these things would go on regardless of Silk Road or Backpage. It doesn’t seem to matter. What seems to matter is that bitcoins were used in these transactions, or in the case of Backpage, could be used. That’s the worst part. At least with the Silk Road, where Bitcoin became the equivalent of digital drug money, bitcoins were being used. With Backpage, it’s just something the mainstream media noticed, that Bitcoin was an accepted payment method.\n\nBitcoin, of course, will not shut Backpage down. After all, if you have cash in your pocket, it doesn’t stop being cash just because what you’re doing is illegal or someone with a lot of power doesn’t want it to work for you. It’s still cash until it is destroyed, and it is the same truth with Bitcoin.\n\nImage from Pixabay.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""A US district judge has signed a court order mandating a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent arrested in connection with the Silk Road investigation forfeit hundreds of bitcoins to the federal government.\n\nOn 9th July, US District Judge Richard Seeborg approved the preliminary order against Carl Force IV, requiring the surrender of roughly 690 bitcoins.

But recently, Bitcoin theists have taken issue with associating blockchain to the private distributed ledger systems, such as Eris Industries and Hyperledger.\n\nInstead, to this contingent, the blockchain refers to the public distributed ledger the Bitcoin protocol uses to record the growing list of bitcoin transaction data. The core concept for a digital cash system has been around for some time, but until the release of Bitcoin, many of these systems which relied on reputation suffered from Sybil attacks, where certain participants forge identities to subvert peer-to-peer systems.\n\nBitcoin\'s implementation is resistant from such attacks because it uses a proof of work algorithm where anonymous participants, called miners, that verify blocks must put forth a certain amount of computational processing power. Further incentive against harming the network or being deceptive, comes in the form of newly ""issued"" bitcoin that miners are rewarded when they verify a block using specialized computer hardware; plus individuals who invest tens of thousands of dollars into Bitcoin mining equipment are unlikely to try and destroy the network.\n\nThis distributed ledger concept has been privatized, although the companies that are developing these systems use a consensus algorithm instead of proof of work. These systems are controllable, repeatable, reversible and accountable, all features the financial services industry needs, harps Preston Byrne, chief operating officer and general counsel at Eris Industries.\n\nBut there is an ongoing debate among cryptocurrency enthusiasts over whether a private blockchain is a sustainable model and anything more than a traditional database.\n\nDigital Asset Holdings, which launched in March headed by former JPMorgan Chase exec Blythe Masters, uses cryptocurrency technology to enhance the settlement and recording of financial assets. Masters is seen as a force to be reckoned with in the financial services industry and isn\'t taking bets on either cryptocurrency infrastructure play. Digital Asset Holdings acquired two companies in its few short months of existence: Bits of Proof, which built an enterprise-ready implementation of the Bitcoin protocol; and Hyperledger, which developed distributed ledger technology that allows financial institutions to run multiple private networks for managing assets.\n\n""Banks are looking at multiple different systems...to offer in-house,"" said Dan O\'Prey, founder and CEO of Hyperledger.\n\nThe teams at Digital Asset Holdings and Hyperledger have a very similar approach to the market, O\'Prey said. Both companies want a platform-agnostic system that targets financial institutions and is pragmatic about where the distributed ledger technology is useful (unlike the initial Bitcoin craze that sought to put everything on a blockchain), he said.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and private distributed ledger network providers seem to be in competition, O\'Prey says the groups are addressing different problems and can coexist.\n\nBitcoin\'s censorship-resistant digital money model is well-suited for purposes such as funding a free press in countries where the government limits free speech. But it has also been used for illegal activities such as the purchase of drugs and weapons on black marketplaces, like Silk Road. These use cases aren\'t particularly appealing to the risk-averse financial services industry, which has been quick to pull support from controversial or legally questionable services.\n\n""So far, venture capitalists aren\'t funding [censorship resistant models],"" said Tim Swanson, an industry pundit that is currently a researcher at SKBI in Singapore and advises Hyperledger and a number of other blockchain startups.\n\nInstead VCs have thrown a remarkable amount of money at Bitcoin-based startups building ""censored"" or regulated services for allowing consumers, merchants and financial institutions to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. These include Coinbase, a Silicon Valley-based exchange, which has raised $105 million in venture capital since it\'s launch in 2012 and Circle Internet Financial, a consumer mobile wallet and merchant services platform, which has altogether raised $76 million.\n\n""Private blockchain"" companies haven\'t received funding close to the hundreds of millions of dollars raised by Bitcoin companies in the past few years, but the concept is still new. And many Bitcoin companies, such as Peernova hope to attract more VC interest by shifting their message to emphasize blockchain technology over specific uses of Bitcoin.\n\nBut these recent rebrands seem more like marketing and less like technological shifts at this point.\n\nBut Eris\' Byrne insists that the Bitcoin community\'s narrow view of what a blockchain is limits the technology\'s potential.\n\n""The magic of any blockchain is that it allows someone to easily deploy an interactive application, on the public Internet, that runs itself automatically, predictably and without human supervision or dedicated hardware,"" Byrne said. ""Secure data infrastructure that doesn\'t require physical infrastructure is the game-changer here. And it\'s going to be much, much bigger than just digital money.""\n\nRather than duplicate the economic incentives that Bitcoin offers to miners, Eris\' technology allows known validators to come to a consensus on the state of a ledger, while also allowing an overseer to handle exceptions, remove bad actors and/or restore the ledger if it was falsified.\n\nTraditionally, in database reconciliation, participants only have part of the copy of the global ledger, said Robert Sams, an industry pundit who writes at cryptonomics.org. With distributed consensus everyone comes to consensus on the global state of the ledger, said Sams, who is also the founder and CEO of Clearmatics, which applies distributed consensus technology to the over-the-counter derivatives market.\n\n""Regulators are so interested in this because it could increase transparency,"" Sams said.\n\nThese private ledgers systems also differ from traditional databases in that they use digital signature cryptography for validation (much like Bitcoin does).\n\n""If you look at blockchain as using cryptographic signatures to link the ledger from one point to the next, then the concept of a private blockchain makes perfect sense,"" Sams said. ""If you think the distinguishing feature of blockchain is the use of proof of work or proof or stake to solve for a Sybil attack, then it doesn\'t make sense.""\n\nSo the debate is largely semantic. And even private network providers, including Hyperledger and Ripple Labs, concede that they aren\'t really in the blockchain business.\n\nCalling Ripple a blockchain company ""is not technically correct but that\'s just the vernacular,"" said Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple Labs, Inc. He likened the argument to Kleenex versus facial tissue. Kleenex, as a brand name, has become so prominent that many people use its name when referring to any brand of tissues.\n\nRipple doesn\'t require consensus nodes to carry the whole ledger of all transactions that ever happened. Instead, nodes only need to use the ""last closed ledger"" to come to agreement on the changes to the present ledger.\n\n""\'Blockchain\' is used as a generic term for distributed ledgers...even though a lot of these ledgers don\'t have a blockchain,"" said Larsen.\n\nEven with the hype around controlled distributed ledgers growing, the businesses that are publicly testing blockchain projects continue to use the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nIn May, the Nasdaq stock exchange announced plans to test Bitcoin\'s blockchain with its private markets platform, designed for firms planning initial public offerings (IPOs). Users will be able to link specific units of bitcoin to represent ownership and issue and transfer securities on the blockchain.\n\nBarclays recently announced a proof of concept with Safello, a Stockholm-based Bitcoin exchange and recent Techstars accelerator graduate. Techstars powers Barclays\' accelerator program.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has been overshadowed as of late by private blockchain concepts, the attention is shifting back to Bitcoin, said Frank Schuil, CEO and co-founder of Safello.\n\nBlockstream, which builds sidechains that are pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain, is Schuil\'s muse for the Barclays proposition. This could enable the use of a closed ledger system where users are verified and transact with each other and then moves to the Bitcoin blockchain to clear transactions.\n\nThis scheme could end up looking like Citigroup\'s new cryptocurrency, aptly named Citicoin, for cross-border payments. Banks could start deploying their own cryptocurrency networks, available only to their customers. These transactions would then be cleared over the Bitcoin network, which could lower costs for the banks and their customers, especially when dealing with international funds transfer.', 'New York City based bitcoin broker and exchange with an institutional feature set serving professional traders and bitcoin businesses announced today they have released margin trading and shorting capabilities to all Coinsetter users.\n\nPer the announcement sent to all current and prospective clients, previously only select businesses were able to receive margin on Coinsetter’s exchange.

LifeLock claims that Casares started Xapo by “using a product developed by Lemon employees, in Lemon’s facilities, on Lemon’s computers, and on Lemon’s dime.” Casares initially pushed to have the case thrown out, but a judge in Silicon Valley disagrees, and the lawsuit against current Xapo CEO will move forward.\n\nThe case could have serious ramifications for Xapo, who are considered one of the hottest Bitcoin start-ups in the country.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""Founded by 24-year-old Ruben Galindo and 29-year-old Antonio Garcia of Mexico City, AirTM is a service that depends on the Bitreserve API to make transfers from the “new money” in the cloud to the “old money” of the cash system.\n\nThe two founders wanted to solve what they found to be an unfair problem in today’s remittance system. Garcia told CoinTelegraph, “You're accustomed to hearing about all the hell that Mexicans go through to get to the U.S. and to work really hard to send money home, doing hard jobs that Americans don't want to do.” He continued:\n\n“But for remittance, we need to be established in both the source and destination countries and that's a lot to bite off for a small startup. So we're focusing first on harsh currency regimes where there's a compelling use case for us — to help our brothers and sisters in Argentina and Venezuela to protect their wealth from devaluing currency due to the country's fiscal mismanagement.”\n\nThe Basics\n\nThe duo had met on numerous occasions through a common interest in Bitcoin, where they discussed the pros and cons of digital currency over beers. The epiphany of AirTM came to them, however, when they both signed up as interns at Bitreserve.\n\n“Bitreserve's message of inclusion, free and instant transactions, and real-time transparency really spoke to us both,” says Garcia. The founders cite Halsey Minor, the founder of Bitreserve and CNET, as their inspiration.\n\n“Our mediation solves any problems. We are like Uber in that we connect clients who want money in the cloud, with cashiers who want to make money from helping clients consummate those transactions.”\n\nThe app will not reinvent the wheel with complex and in-depth UI. “There are just three buttons on our app — deposit, withdraw, and send. First use case is wealth preservation. Second is cross-border payments and remittance.”\n\nPegging Fiat to Fiat\n\nThe service is currently still in alpha testing, but it is set for release in Argentina in August. “Venezuela and Mexico will follow soon after,” said Garcia. “Then China and Europe. But we can't really say when. We want to nail one country and then move on to others. We don't want to try to drink the ocean.”\n\nThey plan to make money by taking a small cut from the cashier’s commission.\n\nAirTM is similar to the money-transfer network Abra, but with a twist. Abra depends on a peer-to-peer network of tellers and clients, without the necessity for a bank, whereas AirTM matches clients with cashiers, both of whom must have access to the old money system of banks, and the new money system of Bitreserve.\n\nA client makes a deposit by sending fiat money via bank transfer to a cashier. The cashier sends the client money to the Bitreserve cloud, the value of which the client can peg to the currency or precious metal of their choice.\n\nIn principle, with Bitreserve's real-time transparency, clients know their value is safe because Bitreserve publishes a real-time proof of solvency. Whereas countries like Greece could impose a restriction on how much money the populace can withdraw, fiat money that is safely stored in the cloud is easily accessible via AirTM, simply by finding a cashier willing to trade.\n\nWithdrawals involve the reverse transaction between client and cashier. “Our Escrow and Bitreserve's focus on membership and financial identity make the transactions safe,” says Garcia.\n\nThe Gift of API\n\nAirTM has no need to worry about compliance with AML or KYC, since the Bitreserve signup and verification process handles that tedious responsibility. Bitreserve, which has numerous developers already using their API, helped the Gsp and Garcia get on their feet. “The Bitreserve team has been super helpful connecting us with investors, lawyers, banks, everything,” says Garcia.\n\nTo use AirTM, users need a Bitreserve account, and to use Bitreserve one must provide identification and other information about sources and uses of funds. Both cashiers and clients will have to be fully identified by Bitreserve in order to use AirTM, rendering any attempts to move dirty money quite difficult.\n\nWhen asked about Bitcoin as a payment option, Garcia said that the digital currency is a direct-payment option with AirTM. The end user never sees or needs to know about Bitcoin. Instead, cashiers use the bitcoin rails to move value into Bitreserve.\n\nAirTM enables clients to hold value as stable currency (USD, EUR, etc.) in Bitreserve's cloud money system. Cashiers facilitate those deposits and withdrawals by first acquiring Bitreserve's cloud money. The only way to do that today is via Bitcoin. Therefore, the founders say, “AirTM is not really a Bitcoin app. It's a Bitreserve app.”"", 'A report commissioned by secretive distributed ledger consulting group R3CEV and authored by bitcoin developer Peter Todd has raised questions about the ability of the Ripple protocol to serve the needs of global financial institutions in its current iteration.\n\nThe release notably comes at a time when Ripple Labs, the corporate entity overseeing the network, has been increasingly attracting the attention of legacy financial institutions interested in bitcoin and the wider blockchain ecosystem. Ripple Labs has raised $37m to date, and partnered with Commonwealth Bank, Fidor Bank and Western Union.\n\nIn a companion report, R3CEV researcher Jo Lang asserts that the intent of the effort is to provide clarity to financial institutions as they conduct due diligence on companies and solutions in the nascent industry.\n\nThough critical of some aspects of the company\'s approach, Lang ultimately found that the problems identified in Ripple\'s consensus algorithm are not unique to its protocol, writing:\n\n""When taken as a whole, the risks and indirect incentives discussed in this and the companion paper have the potential to position Ripple Labs as a new trusted third party within the global payments landscape.""\n\nThe wording of the report suggests that other evaluations will soon follow, all with the intent of providing a deep dive look into the technological capabilities of the industry\'s most well-known blockchains and ledgers.\n\nR3CEV\'s team is led by former Wall Street financial markets expert and managing partner David Rutter, and the group boasts Perkins Coie senior counsel Jacob Farber, Open Mustard Seed chief architect Patrick Deegan and bitcoin industry critic and pundit Tim Swanson as advisors.\n\nAreas of concern\n\nAlthough it includes praise for Ripple Labs, the R3 companion report to Todd\'s research identified a number of ""areas of concern"" for large financial institutions regarding the open-source technology offered by the company.\n\nSpecifically, R3 highlighted its belief that if more than 20% of Ripple\'s network nodes do not agree, the system\'s ledger would effectively fork. This issue, the report said, would be compounded at scale due to the differing settlement needs of the financial institutions potentially seeking to use its payment network.\n\nPerhaps most troubling given the decentralizing nature of the technology, R3 concluded Ripple would not likely result in any significant changes to the currently centralized settlement model.\n\n""The highly centralized model that the Ripple Network encourages fails to eliminate any need for a trusted third party but rather creates a new type of third party,"" the report reads.\n\nR3 also suggested that the use of a cryptographic token (XRP) by the consensus algorithm effectively creates an ""incentive misalignment"" that puts it at odds with nodes operating on the Ripple network.\n\n""Ripple still holds the majority of XRP, and it is in their favor for its value to increase,"" the report continues. ""Ripple justifies XRP as an \'anti-spam mechanism\' to deter transactions... However, as the volume of transactions increases the server load, transaction speed is slowed while the cost of the transaction and the amount of required XRP continues to increase.""\n\nRipple\'s original founder, Jed McCaleb, has notably been involved in a number of high-profile battles over his ability to sell XRP holdings.\n\nFurther, R3 suggested that Ripple lacks a ""clearly defined validator incentive"" that would encourage the number of nodes on the network overseeing transactions. Ultimately, the report added, financial institutions would have to weigh these pros and cons when seeking to leverage the company\'s solutions.\n\nTodd dissects Ripple\n\nIn his 16-page analysis, Todd begins by explaining the overall architecture of Ripple, providing an overview of how it has evolved from its original concept of attempting to record debt relationships to a global ledger of transactions and account balances.\n\nAfter explaining the architecture of Ripple\'s ledger, Todd dives into a list of open questions that remain regarding the company\'s approach to network consensus.\n\nIn particular, he contends that it is not clear how account balances on the Ripple network can be negative, if it supports single payment verification (SPV) or if there is the ability to shard the Ripple blockchain so that it becomes a series of independent, yet interoperable blockchains, an attribute he argued would be beneficial for the protocol\'s scalability.\n\nEmbedded throughout are insights into how Ripple differs from the bitcoin blockchain, its distributed payment network, such as how the network requires changes to codebase for technology that can be implemented through software elsewhere.\n\n""For instance, while on bitcoin the implementation of multisig was possible without modification to the protocol in Ripple the lack of extension capabilities such as scripting require a consensus-critical change,"" Todd writes.\n\nTodd concludes that the blockchain technology underpinning Ripple is ""relatively uninteresting"", but that it is currently unclear whether there is the proper alignment of incentives for the network to come to a global consensus on activities carried out on the ledger.\n\n""A key question that should be answered in future work is if the goals of the Ripple system need global consensus at all? If global consensus can be avoided, or at least its use minimized, many of these issues may go away,"" he adds.\n\nAttack scenarios\n\nTodd next walks readers through a number of theoretical attacks that could take place against the Ripple protocol, discussing his estimates of the cost, scope, duration and probability of the scenarios.\n\nThose discussed include the risk of a ""consensus split"", whereby Ripple is unable to process transactions or a fork is created that allows the attacker to execute invalid transactions. Todd projects that Ripple could survive a consensus split that is either malicious or accidental ""fairly quickly"", due to the ability of the bitcoin network to overcome the scenario in 2013.\n\nA ""transaction flood"" is also discussed, though Todd details how the Ripple protocol\'s use of a native token, XRP, could deter such efforts. Any attacker wanting to flood the network would need to purchase XRP to execute the transactions, driving up fees in the short term.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring, Todd\'s writing infers, is the damage that could be done due to a ""software backdoor"", as he finds that Ripple ""does not provide a secure way to download any of their software"".\n\n""This is a serious omission that has lead to significant monetary losses in the past. Ripple Labs should be following industry best-practice by signing git commits and tags as well as PGP signing their Ubuntu packages,"" Todd added.\n\nTodd ends by highlighting the potential real-world implications of these attacks in an elaborate scenario involving a dispute between the Russian government and Shell Oil, forecasting how these parties might attempt to achieve their aims through coercion on the network.\n\nReaction\n\nReaction of the paper, released on Saturday, has so far been subdued, with some criticism being voiced on XRP Talk, a community forum dedicated to the Ripple protocol.\n\nWhile concerns were raised, however, the report was viewed by some contributors as ""the first serious, non-malicious attempt at pointing out perceived weaknesses in the system"".\n\nOther commenters took issue with the criticism that it is unclear what the incentive is for nodes to participate in the ecosystem and pointed to potential problem areas that are being worked on by the development community.\n\nAt press time, Ripple Labs had not issued a response to the paper on its official blog.\n\nRipple Protocol Consensus Algorithm Review_Peter Todd_May 2015\n\nNode visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

07/14/2015,"['Turns out, going after someone’s Bitcoin transactions is much easier than you might think. After all, as the saying goes, once you’re pwned, you’re pwned.\n\nAfter Hacking Team, the Italian spyware vendor, was hacked earlier this month, and 400GB of its internal data was released, Ars reviewed many internal e-mails from the company. These documents clearly illustrate how simply Hacking Team\'s ""Money Module"" worked, and they provide a small glimpse into which customers were particularly interested in it.\n\nIn general, the Italian spyware company sold (and hopes to continue to sell) software that allowed targets to be surreptitiously surveilled as they used computers or smartphones, and its clientele included law enforcement agencies worldwide. Back in January 2014, Hacking Team internally announced a new feature as part of its version 9.2 upgrade to its Remote Control System suite, and the new iteration would include a way to ""track cryptocurrencies, such as BitCoin [sic], and all the related information.""\n\nThe Money Module also included support for Bitcoin alternatives including Litecoin, Feathercoin, and Namecoin.\n\nNicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California, went through the same e-mails. He says that such a feature ""shouldn’t be surprising.""\n\n""It is straightforward to grab the wallet.dat and related files and for malcode to get the password for this file when the user accesses their bitcoins,"" he told Ars by e-mail. ""Similarly, one can also search for Bitcoin-related keywords in e-mail messages and other content on their computer. And once you have a copy of the wallet.dat file, you have the entire transaction history (as Ross Ulbricht can attest to).""\n\nFurther Reading Silk Road trial: How the Dread Pirate Roberts embraced violence The wallet.dat file contains a user’s private keys, so when combined with the public transactions posted to the blockchain, Bitcoin’s shroud of secrecy is removed. In short, the attacker gets the keys to the kingdom.\n\nThat’s very close to what American federal authorities did to prove that Ross Ulbricht’s Bitcoin transactions were the same as Dread Pirate Roberts’ transactions. The biggest difference is that the FBI didn’t need to digitally infiltrate a computer in that case—they had physically seized Ulbricht\'s device, still running, during an infamous raid at the San Francisco library.\n\nUsing Hacking Team\'s solution, it wouldn’t matter if a target had encrypted wallet.dat, nor if he or she was using an online wallet (such as Coinbase.com). The company\'s embedded keylogger would surely capture the relevant password. And as one leaked company e-mail explained, the Money Module feature automatically exported this data to the ""evidence"" portion of the Remote Control System software.\n\nA job well done\n\nHacking Team\'s Alberto Ornaghi, a software architect, e-mailed his colleagues in Italian with a few more details:\n\nHi all, from the 9.2 backend will support the new module MONEY for all platforms. We keep track of transactions in crypto-currencies targets (see history of silk-road) and in the demo we can also make a bitcoin transaction to buy drugs and see in the form of correlation to those who got that money (DEA: anyone interested? : P) the information we can get are: addressbook (list of all contacts and local accounts of the target), files (the wallet itself, containing the money and spend it for private keys), transactions (transaction history in/out of the target , useful for making correlations).\n\nA few days later, Daniele Milan, the company’s operations manager, wrote:\n\nI’m sure all of you heard about BitCoin, however here is some relevant context to position them in your pitch: cryptocurrencies are a way to make untraceable transactions, and we all know that criminals love to easily launder, move, and invest black money. [Law enforcement agencies], by using our Intelligence module combined with this new capability, can correlate the usage of cryptocurrencies, defeating the financial opacity they provide.\n\nHours later, CEO David Vincenzetti responded: ""Well done!!!""\n\nEgyptian, Saudi authorities interested in Bitcoin tracking\n\nAt the moment, no one knows the comprehensive list of who installed or used Money Module Version 9.2 in early 2014. But leaked e-mails show that both the Egyptian Ministry of Defense and the Saudi Ministry of the Interior e-mailed Hacking Team with support questions. Both countries rank quite low on Freedom House’s 2014 ""Freedom on the Net"" list.\n\nHacking Team e-mails also reveal that Vincenzetti himself was quite skeptical on the entire concept of Bitcoin even before his company’s introduction of Money Module. He wrote:\n\nA currency offering close to total anonymity is obviously the currency of choice for ransoms of all kinds. This is just one of the reasons for Bitcoin should never become a monetary standard.\n\nIn February 2014, he also told his e-mail list:\n\nBitcoin as it is now has no future. But this does not imply that virtual currencies don’t have a future. That is, a modification of the actual Bitcoiin [sic], something different, fully traceable and supported by clearing houses and the global financial system as a whole might have a future.\n\nIn May 2015, after Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison as a result of being convicted of running Silk Road, Vincenzetti again opined on Bitcoin:', ""One year after raising AU$17k (~US$13k) in a crowdfunding campaign, and days after it picked up two awards at its world premier at Freedom Fest 2015 in Las Vegas, Torsten Hoffmann's “Bitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It” was released on several video-on-demand platforms today.\n\nBitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It traces the history of money over the course of the centuries, until present day. As such, it details the practices of central banks and the role of other actors in the financial industry. It highlights how most money today is created by commercial banks, and explores the role of governments in the money creation process. Ultimately, the documentary presents Bitcoin as a possible alternative to the current monetary paradigm.\n\nWriter, director and producer of the documentary Torsten Hoffmann said:\n\n“The documentary reveals some surprising and little known facts about the money we use everyday and introduces Bitcoin as a potential alternative. Our film is targeted at anyone who wants a crash course about this disruptive technology and has yet found good and balanced media coverage. We suspect that the film will be popular among young adults working in the technology, start-up and finance sectors as well as anyone interested in Libertarian ideas.”\n\nPerhaps more than most other Bitcoin documentaries, Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It delves deep into the history of money itself. While important in the second half, Bitcoin is not even mentioned until the halfway point of the film.\n\nHoffmann explained:\n\n“I originally thought that we can just jump right into Bitcoin, but then there is no context for the audience to understand what makes Bitcoin so revolutionary. So we decided to start at the very beginning; with the history of money – before coins were even minted. Much later, governments got involved in creating and controlling money as a central authority. In my research I was surprised, and shocked, to find out that most money today is actually created by private banks, which of course leads our story directly to the last financial crisis.”\n\nHoffmann, a German serial media entrepreneur with a Finance MBA degree from the University of Oxford, makes his debut as a director with Bitcoin: The End of Money as We Know It. The film features a variety of thought leaders in the Bitcoin space, including Andreas Antonopoulos, Roger Ver, Bernard von NotHaus, Jeffrey Tucker, Michael J. Casey, and more.\n\nTo find out where it can be seen and for more information on Bitcoin: The End of Money as We Know It, visit the film’s website, Facebook page, or Vimeo page."", 'Hackers appear to have stolen the entire user database of cloud-based Bitcoin mining outfit Cloudminr.io and are offering to sell 79,267 accounts including passwords for a single Bitcoin.\n\nThe Norwegian company\'s website is offline and criminal advertisements showcasing some of the CSV database of members has popped up on web clipboards like Pastebin.

Colin also holds an MBA from the Australian Graduate School of Management.\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nAt the time of writing, the Greece debt crisis appears to have been averted, or at the least delayed. A €50 billion bailout package has been offered, if the Greek parliament agrees to implement extensive reforms that have been demanded by the eurozone.\n\nAlthough the risk of a Grexit has been reduced, it has not been eliminated. If the parliament votes to reject these reforms, then a Grexit remains a possibility. Nor does the package change the fact that Greece owes €320 billion to its creditors.\n\n\n\nIt should be no surprise that the crisis has provoked questions around the safety of government-backed currencies.\n\nIf Cyprus and Grexit are anything to go by, there are three solutions to the European debt crises. In each scenario, however, European citizens are left financially vulnerable.\n\nScenario 1 — A Member Country Defaults and Leaves the Eurozone\n\nIn this situation, the government's pre-euro currency is reintroduced wholly. This would be implemented through a government purchase — or confiscation, from the perspective of the citizens — of euros for freshly minted local currency. The euros are then used to pay creditors. Unfortunately, a new local currency is likely to have incredibly weak purchasing power. In this case, citizens would not be able to afford to purchase as much with their local currency as they could with their euros.\n\nScenario 2 — A Member Country Reaches a Deal with Creditors\n\nIn this situation, the ailing country remains within the eurozone. However, this does not absolve them from their debt obligations. Indeed, with a weak bargaining position, a country in crisis will have significant reforms imposed. These are likely to include a Cyprus-style haircut,” in which a percentage of citizens' bank deposits are used for debt repayments. In this case, citizens are left with fewer euros than before the crisis.\n\nScenario 3 — A Member Country Runs a Dual Currency\n\nIn this situation, the local currency is introduced to only purchase a proportion of their citizens' euros. This is essentially a hybrid of scenario one and two. For European citizens, it means they both have a weak local currency and fewer euros in their bank accounts.\n\nHow Greek Citizens Are Responding to the Crisis\n\nThe primary concern for the Greeks at this point is wealth preservation. In investment banking, clients looking for such a scenario would be advised to purchase financial assets that are classified as stores of value. These assets include real estate, precious metals, precious stones and even collectibles.\n\nWhile stores of value may not have tremendous utility, they are less volatile than other financial assets. This makes them good at preserving wealth.\n\nGiven the harsh capital controls restricting the flow of bank deposits, Greeks are looking to turn physical cash into stores of value. This means investing in jewellery, gold coins, appliances and even luxury handbags.\n\nBut the trade-off they make for low volatility is fungibility. Compared to currency, the stores of value being purchased by Greeks are more difficult to trade for goods or services. Just imagine trying to convince your supermarket to accept jewellery as payment for your groceries. Stores of value also do not come with the perceived security of bank deposits.\n\nWhat the Greek citizens really need is a store of value that is safe from confiscation, can be purchased with cash and has similar properties to money.\n\nThe Bitcoin Price Response\n\nThe digital currency community believes Bitcoin meets these requirements. Or at least part of them. This, combined with huge media hype, has ignited a 37% rally over the past month. In contrast, gold — the world's traditional safe haven — is down 0.5% over the same period.\n\nDespite what the media claims, the rally has not been caused by Greeks rushing to buy Bitcoin. Capital controls make this next to impossible. Instead, the rally is caused by shift in perception that government-backed currencies are not as reliable as previously thought.\n\nOn our bitcoin trading platform, BTC.sx, we have seen a notable increase in activity from Eurozone countries during the climax of the debt crisis, as the following chart shows:\n\nCountry % Change in Activity Greece 50.00% Ireland 36.36% Portugal 73.47% Spain 10.24%\n\nWhat we appear to be observing is that eurozone countries, which have experienced economic turmoil, are seeing the benefits of Bitcoin as a store of value. Essentially, they are going long on Bitcoin, with 10:1 leverage, to hedge against the risk of their own country experiencing a debt crisis. This has proved to be a profitable strategy in June.\n\nUltimately, a lot of traders believe that Bitcoin has become a viable store of value.\n\nWhy Bitcoin Is a Store of Value\n\nMany people will be asking how a volatile asset could possibly be considered a store of value. Volatility is Bitcoin's biggest weakness as a store of value right now. However, it beats other assets on numerous attributes. This makes holding Bitcoin a great wealth-preservation strategy during a crisis.\n\nLet's take a look at how Bitcoin stacks up against other stores of value being used in the Greece debt crisis.\n\nVolatility Liquidity Fungibility Ease of confiscation Portability Divisibility Security Bitcoin High Medium Medium Low High High High Jewellery Medium Medium Low Medium Medium Low Low Gold coins Low Medium Medium Medium Medium Medium Low Appliances Low Low Low Medium Low Low Low Luxury goods Medium Medium Low Medium Medium Low Low\n\nAs the above table shows, Bitcoin is a vastly superior store of value in terms of its low ease of confiscation, high portability, high divisibility and high security. These attributes stem from the digital nature of the currency. Anyone who owns their private keys has full ownership of their money. This makes Bitcoin a secure store of value against the threat of confiscation and looting.\n\nFor example, Greek citizens investing their wealth into jewellery make themselves targets to criminals. The pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin, however, means that their wealth would not be tied to their personal identity. The blockchain makes it next to impossible to steal or confiscate Bitcoin through brute force.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin is an attractive store of value. Greek citizens looking to preserve their wealth should hedge against scenario one above by using Bitcoin, and hedge against scenario two by using other stores of value.\n\nUntapped Potential\n\nFor all of Bitcoin's strengths, one problem remains: accessibility. Unfortunately, capital controls in Greece make it incredibly difficult to purchase bitcoin. Those in Greece using Bitcoin as a store of value bought before the capital controls were put in place.\n\nNonetheless, accessibility to Bitcoin can only increase from here. What Bitcoin needs is further growth of Bitcoin ATMs and P2P marketplaces such as LocalBitcoins or Mycelium.\n\nHopefully, we will see further adoption of Bitcoin across Europe as citizens become more pessimistic about the euro, and buy stores of value before capital controls are implemented."", 'The bitcoin blockchain could hold the keys to reducing the cost of credit cards, money transfers and remittances, according to Standard Chartered chief innovation officer Anju Patwardhan.\n\nIn a new LinkedIn post, Patwardhan outlined her views on the technology, suggesting that the true innovation behind bitcoin is its decentralized public ledger, the blockchain.\n\nPatwardhan dismissed the idea that bitcoin could become a viable alternative currency, inferring that she saw these developments in the space as a distraction that has taken attention away from the system\'s underlying benefits.\n\nPatwardhan wrote:\n\n""The banking industry is starting to see the many potential benefits of its underlying technology. For banks, the blockchain has the potential to become a technology model for a low-cost and transparent transaction infrastructure.""\n\nFurther, she said the public, yet pseudonymous nature of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain could help make financial institutions more transparent, while combating against money laundering and other fiscal crimes.\n\n""Another area where the blockchain technology can be useful is trade finance. This has traditionally been a paper-intensive process but it is possible to use blockchain technology to digitise and authenticate the records,"" Patwardhan continues.\n\nAs evidence that banks should perhaps be paying closer attention to the space, Patwardhan cited the increasingly positive remarks of government financial entities such as the Bank of England and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nThough she suggested that the blockchain may provide the most immediate opportunity for financial entities, however, Patwardhan suggested that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could prove just as disruptive long term.\n\nImages via LinkedIn; Wikipedia\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Your encrypted keys might not be as safe as you thought, as a new hack has been created that can steal keys without even needing an online connection. Just radio waves from your laptop can leave you vulnerable to the latest in hacking technology.\n\nAlmost perfect hacking device\n\nIt seems that as hot as Bitcoin has been in attracting venture capital and corporate partnerships recently, the hacking community has been trying to stay ahead of advances in security.\n\nHacking has taken over the news, from government targets to the private sector, as this latest hacking tool takes things to a whole new level of sophistication. Created in Israel by Tel Aviv University and the Technion research center, the hacking device can be commonly recreated for about US$300 with many easily accessible parts. It is called PITA, which stands for Portable Instrument for Trace Acquisition.\n\nThis is how PITA works. For power, all that’s needed is four AA batteries. The hacking device has an antenna that reads electromagnetic waves from any computer device within 19 inches. It swipes the RSA and ElGamal data signals from the computer while decrypting the files. It can store the information on a microSD card or send it via WiFi to another computer.\n\nIn other words, you build a small radio about the size of a piece of pita bread to capture radio waves emitted by any nearby computer. The creative team describes the device on their website as follows:\n\n“We successfully extracted keys from laptops of various models running GnuPG (popular open source encryption software, implementing the OpenPGP standard), within a few seconds. The attack sends a few carefully-crafted ciphertexts, and when these are decrypted by the target computer, they trigger the occurrence of specially structured values inside the decryption software. These special values cause observable fluctuations in the electromagnetic field surrounding the laptop, in a way that depends on the pattern of key bits (specifically, the key bits window in the exponentiation routine). The secret key can be deduced from these fluctuations, through signal processing and cryptanalysis.”\n\nWhat can be done to beat this new hacking system? The common PC laptop may have limitations when it comes to this new threat, according to the creators.\n\n“However, inexpensive protection of consumer-grade PCs appears difficult,” explains the creative team. “Alternatively, the cryptographic software can be changed, and algorithmic techniques employed to render the emanations less useful to the attacker. These techniques ensure that the rough scale behavior of the algorithm is independent of the inputs it receives; they usually carry some performance penalty but are often used in any case to thwart other side-channel attacks.”\n\nRaising the security bar\n\nOne of the great things about Bitcoin’s blockchain technology is that venture capital is being invested into improving Bitcoin security, not just functionality. But while this hack makes mobile laptop users the most vulnerable, it only has a range of fewer than two feet, so PITA is far from a perfect hacking tool. Still, the Bitcoin and computer technology community have a new security bar to reach, and I’m sure there will be plenty of computer geniuses working on overcoming this new challenge.\n\nThe group of hackers from Israel plans a presentation of their design at the Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems in Saint-Malo, France this September.', 'Signs on window advertise a bitcoin ATM machine that has been installed in a Waves Coffee House in Vancouver, British Columbia October 28, 2013. Reuters\n\nAnalysts at Wedbush, the West Coast brokerage and investment bank, are embracing the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).\n\nThe instrument, which is quoted on the OTCQX over-the-counter market, is the first and only means to buy and sell bitcoin with a standard brokerage account in the U.S. It\'s structured as an open-ended trust, and the price of the trust is meant to represent 1/10 of bitcoin\'s price. GBTC has been trading a premium since May. The Wall Street Journal last week highlighted some of the early hiccups associated with trading GBTC.\n\nBut it\'s a buy for Gil Luria at Wedbush, which appears to be the first Wall Street firm to assign a rating to the trust. He assigns an ""outperform"" rating and a $40 price target. GBTC added 0.6% to close at $30.50 on Tuesday.\n\n""We believe bitcoin and its associated blockchain technology have the potential to disrupt the existing financial infrastructure over the next few years.\n\nWe see BTC as a financial instrument the likes of which has not previously existed, which requires a new valuation approach. We see BTC as equity in a payment network, much like Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, which we also cover.\n\nHowever, since BTC does not generate cash flow like equity, we use a commodity-like valuation approach that values each BTC as a \'packet\' in limited supply that fuels the bitcoin network. The more the bitcoin network is utilized for current and future applications, the more demand for the packet.\n\nBy aggregating the utilization of the various applications, we arrive at our $400 BTC price target, which translates to $40 per share of GBTC. This implies ~$6 billion market capitalization, which we would also describe an option on bitcoin supplanting some payment volumes from Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), PayPal (PYPL) and Western Union (WU), who combine for >$300 billion in market cap.\n\nWe believe much of the demand for BTC will come from payment applications where bitcoin offers significant benefits over alternatives - online payments (especially cross-border), remittance and micro payments. We believe bitcoin can reduce the cost of online payments from the current 3-8% to <0.5% and for remittance from 5-10% to <1%. Previously impractical, electronic payments of <$1 could broadly change content monetization on the web, possibly supplanting ads.\n\nWe see some potential for BTC as a banking alternative in developing or distressed economies, as is becoming evident to citizens of Greece unable to access or transact in their government currency. We also see possible applications for more far reaching applications such as facilitating machine-to-machine transactions (“Internet of Things”) and as an “anchor” for other blockchain technology applications in the securities industry, real estate sector and beyond.""', '50 Cent, who accepts Bitcoin for his online shop, has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy under his legal name Curtis James Jackson II in bankruptcy court in Connecticut. The rapper has played off the filing as a cost of doing business, even making light of the situation, recently posing next to a smart car for an Instagram photo as if to make fun of his current circumstances. The Southpaw actor has been open about his decision to file for chapter 11.\n\n“I’m taking the precautions that any other good businessperson would take in this situation,” the rapper told E! News about his current bankruptcy filings. “You know when you’re successful and stuff, you become a target. I don’t wanna be a bull’s eye. I don’t want anybody to pick me as the guy that they just come to with astronomical claims and go through all that,” the rapper says about his choice to file. 50 Cent takes a realistic approach to his most recent business decision.\n\n“Walt Disney has filed bankruptcy. Donald Trump has filed bankruptcy,” he said. “It means you’re reorganizing your finances, but it does stop things from moving forward that you don’t want moving forward.” He isn’t worried, and he doesn’t think you should be either: “I gotta decent legal team,” he added. “You don’t have to worry.”\n\nIn the legal filings, 50 Cent claims his assets are worth between $10 million and $50 million, the same range as his listed liabilities. The debts are primarily consumer debts and his estimated number of creditors is listed as between 1 and 49.\n\n“This filing for personal bankruptcy protection permits Mr. Jackson to continue his involvement with various business interests and continue his work as an entertainer, while he pursues an orderly reorganization of his financial affairs,” 50 Cents attorney William A. Brewer III said in a statement Monday.\n\n50 Cent accepted Bitcoin for his latest album, Animal Ambition, stating, “All money is money” in interviews at the time. In a Reddit AMA, 50 Cent expanded on his acceptance of Bitcoin through BitPay: “Stay with times. [T]echnology is what’s changing the business gotta get with it. I take money no matter if its coins or dollars.” Alongside 50 Cent, Nas and Snoop Dogg have also promoted Bitcoin in their own ways. To shop for 50 Cent material with Bitcoin, you can visit the rapper’s online shop. In his book The 50th Law, 50 Cent imparts some of the wisdom he has learned in his life.\n\nReassess Yourself — Detachment: Your increasing powers of observation must occasionally be aimed at yourself. Think of this as a ritual you will engage in every few weeks — a rigorous reassessment of who you are and where you are headed. Look at your most recent actions as if they were the maneuvers of another person… The goal here is not to beat up on yourself but to have the capacity to adapt and change your behavior by moving closer to the reality.\n\nIn his book, the rapper states that there is only one thing we can control — “the mind-set with which we respond to these events around us. If we are able to overcome our anxieties and forge a fearless attitude toward life, something strange and remarkable can occur — that margin of control over circumstances increases. At its utmost point we can even create the circumstances themselves…” How do we free ourselves? The rapper thinks he has some insight.\n\nTo free yourself from fear you must work backward. You start with the thought of your mortality. You accept and embrace this reality. You think ahead to the inevitable moment of your death and determine to face it as bravely as possible. The more you contemplate your mortality, the less you fear it — it becomes a fact that you no longer have to repress. By following this path, you know how to die well, and so you can now begin to teach yourself to live well.\n\nAmong 50 Cent’s most successful business ventures are his investments in Vitamin Water, off which he made upwards of $100 million when the product was sold to Coca-Cola, the biggest brand in the world; his G-Unit clothing line; SMS Audio, which he envisages as the Lucasfilms of music; a philanthropic effort to feed children through Street King energy shots; and, Thisis50.com, his music oriented social networking site;. and his work as an actor, namely in the film Southpaw. The rapper joins a long list of celebrity figures who have filed for bankruptcy, including musicians Toni Braxton, MC Hammer, Tom Petty, Marvin Gaye and Wayne Newton.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Blockchain solutions company BlockTrail has launched a service called Mint, that sells bitcoins sourced directly from miners.\n\nThis will be the first service that allows consumers to purchase brand-new bitcoins, which were historically sold alongside used bitcoins on open exchanges.\n\nThese coins will most likely appeal to investors primarily as a collectible, much like the first strike of a physical coin. In an interview with Brave New Coin, Alejandro De La Torre, from BlockTrail Business Development told us that “Fresh Bitcoins are more limited in supply than used Bitcoins, anything with a limited supply usually gains in value.”\n\nBlockTrail's website says that there are no limits on the amount of new coins you can buy, although the larger your order, the longer it will take to fill. They do, however, state a minimum order of 0.1 BTC. Currently, the only payment method accepted for the Mint service is bitcoin, although in the future they plan to accept fiat currencies as well.\n\nWith new bitcoins currently being created at a rate of 3,600 per day, there are only so many coins to be sold. Since the service provider has to form a relationship with each mining pool or solo miner, in order to buy their coins, the number available through Mint is much smaller. De La Torre did assure us that they have already formed a substantial amount of relationships.\n\n- Alejandro De La Torre, Business Development at BlockTrail\n\nThe fee structure for the service is dynamic, determined by the availability of inventory and market demand at the time of your order. The exact fee rate is only displayed at the time an order is placed, immediately prior to payment.\n\nThere is an advantage to adding a considerable fee to these purchases. Doing so can make your purchase harder to track on the blockchain.\n\n- BlockTrail\n\nDespite being based in The Netherlands, where Bitcoin has little regulation, and even though they are only trading bitcoins for other bitcoins so far, BlockTrail has implemented the United States' Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. This requires you to identify yourself to them before they are able to complete your sale. This policy is likely to turn away many customers who appreciate bitcoin for its privacy.\n\nAlso highlighted by the service is the users choice of wallet. Centralized services can mix your coins with those from other accounts, trading out your fresh coins for regular bitcoins.\n\n- BlockTrail\n\nFor collectors, the perceived advantage of owning fresh coins reflects the limited supplies. For others, new coins without transaction histories are more desirable than used coins with longer and unknown histories. A brand new coin has no ties to illicit transaction, and has never been stolen or used to buy illegal items, unlike coins used on the Silk Road.\n\nBoth arguments make economists question the fungibility of bitcoin, which demands every unit of a currency spends just as well as every other unit. The value placed on uniquely new coins, by collectors, is not considered harmful to bitcoin's fungibility. There are plenty of collectable collectible coins in other functional currencies. They are seen as rare editions that often command a markup in price for individual coins, or bills, but their existence never hurts the usefulness of the mainstream currency overall.\n\nThe question of bitcoins used in illicit trade, resulting in what is often referred to as tainted coins, could possibly make a big difference one day. If governments or regulators decide to enforce some kind of ban on tainted coins a significant proportion of the bitcoins in circulation could be blacklisted. In this circumstance, a hefty premium for fresh coins may one day be warranted, the holder will always know he can spend those coins anywhere.\n\nAnother scheme that regulators may try and force upon bitcoin is a whitelist, which are generally considered more safe. A whitelisted bitcoin would have had it's entire history scrutinized before being added, a service that at least one company has attempted to create.\n\nUsing either list type on bitcoins is still pure speculation, for many of the same reasons there are no widely-used, serial-number-based lists for US Dollar bills. In some some countries, including the UK, laws protects people who receive the proceeds of crime unwittingly. “Where the funds or property have been acquired by a purchase for a proper market price or similar exchange and to cater for any injustice which might otherwise arise: for example, in the case of tradesmen who are paid for ordinary consumable goods and services in money that comes from crime,” states the UK Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nNo matter which threat to bitcoin's fungibility comes to light, Bitcoiners shouldn't worry much, says the Nakamoto Institute's Director of Research Daniel Krawisz, a noted economist and speaker in the bitcoin space. “A new coin can't remain ‘new’ for long, as long as it gets spent.” he told BraveNewCoin. “Once those coins start getting mixed in with everything else, then there isn't a difference between them any more.”""]"

The project is entitled “Enable Universal Acceptance of Mobile Money Payments,” and if the project is successful, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will offer another research grant of US$1,000,000.\n\nBitsoko has already begun to attract local businesses to accept bitcoin, including restaurants and cafes. “We have signed up local businesses including restaurants, cyber cafes, and mama mbogas (roadside vegetable vendors). If you go to a restaurant and pay using bitcoin, the owner of the business will send us the bitcoin and receive mobile money in exchange. We are trying to build the infrastructure around bitcoin, which is lacking here,” the Bitsoko team announced.\n\nSeveral businesses in Kenya have already started to accept bitcoin through Bitsoko, including Bejo’s bar and restaurant and Chase Cyber Café, where people can pay their fees in bitcoin.\n\nThe technology and opportunities that Bitsoko will bring to Africa will fuel the on-going development and improvement of the financial infrastructure in Kenya and Africa that MPesa, Africa’s most popular mobile payment platform, initially began.\n\nBy using bitcoin’s blockchain technology, the underbanked and underserved states, countries and cities can send payments across borders easily and quickly, and accept payments with low transaction fees.\n\nCo-founder of Bitsoko, Allan Juma, stated:\n\n“The financial structure in Kenya and throughout Africa has changed rapidly since the birth of mobile money by MPesa. We believe that this will only continue to grow and tools such as Bitsoko that leverage Blockchain technology to lower transaction costs will be at the forefront of this boom.”\n\nGrand Challenges Exploration\n\nBitsoko is one of the 9 winners of Grand Challenges Exploration initiated by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a contest in which 304 startups applied from 30 different countries. The winners of the contest received US$100,000 investment, “to help them refine and build merchant out their idea”, said Kosta Peric, deputy director for the ""Financial Services for the Poor"" initiative at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nBill Gates & Bitcoin\n\nBill Gates’ interests in bitcoin caused a stir back in December 2014, when Microsoft partnered with global bitcoin payment processor BitPay to start accepting BTC for digital goods.\n\nA month after, Gates’ appeared on national television in an interview with Jimmy Fallon, and discussed bitcoin along with its potential as a remittance tool that could be used to send payments in emergencies.\n\nGates explained:', 'Italian spyware vendor Hacking Team’s internal data was hacked and released this week, leaking research and information on how its bitcoin spyware called “Money Module,” which was used to spy on protesters and political dissidents works.\n\nThe Italian spyware vendor has been selling the software that surveils computers or smartphones to a range of clients, including international law enforcement agencies. The software was launched in January 2014, and has been used to track down transactions of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin and namecoin.\n\nThe software targets one key file in a bitcoin wallet called wallet.dat, which contains a set of private keys needed to settle a transaction on the blockchain. Once the software gets hold of the keys, it acquires the entire transaction history.\n\n“It is straightforward to grab the wallet.dat and related files and for malcode to get the password for this file when the user accesses their bitcoins,” Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California,told ArsTechnica. “Similarly, one can also search for Bitcoin-related keywords in e-mail messages and other content on their computer. And once you have a copy of the wallet.dat file, you have the entire transaction history (as Ross Ulbricht can attest to).”\n\nAccording to the email leaks on Wikileaks, the software is able to collect a wide range of information apart from bitcoin and cryptcurrencies.\n\n“The module is able to collect various information: list of contacts and local accounts, wallet (i.e., the money) and the history of transactions,” reads an email dated January 12, 2014, published by Wikileaks. “Currently it is intended only for Desktops (Windows, OS X, Linux), while introduction in Mobiles is still under evaluation.”', 'As the Greek Parliament readies to vote on a third bailout agreement today – which would inevitably seal the country\'s fate within the eurozone – there\'s still a steady stream of media reports suggesting bitcoin could prove useful to Greek citizens.\n\nAlthough it\'s difficult to quantify whether the economic crisis has driven Greeks to purchase the digital currency, perhaps the more important question to ask is this: Have recent events even increased awareness of bitcoin in Greece?\n\nOne man\'s wish\n\nNikos Houtas owns Tavern Agelos – a traditional Greek restaurant opened by his father 20 years ago – and thinks ""virtual currencies are the future"".\n\nBitcoin is not new to him. His restaurant has been accepting payments in the digital currency for three years, after Houtas was introduced to bitcoin by an American friend.\n\nPayments in the cryptocurrency, Houtas said, are still few and far between, but he hopes this will soon change.\n\nCurrently offering customers paying with bitcoin a 20% discount, Houtas told CoinDesk:\n\n""No one in Greece has asked me whether I accept bitcoin, but I hope that this will change due to the capital controls. Bitcoin has the potential to be successful in Greece, we need more stores to accept bitcoin and to offer a discount for bitcoin payments.""\n\nThe few bitcoin payments he has received have mainly come from European tourists, with the average transaction amounting to €10.\n\nLast day in #Greece & we enjoyed a tasty lunch at Tavern Agelos, Athens\' 1st #bitcoin-accepting resto!

Inundated with offers from fellow bitcoin enthusiasts, Houtas was particularly taken with a proposal from a bitcoin ATM operator.\n\nCommenting on reddit, Eric Grill, CEO of Coinoutlet, offered to meet with Houtas and discuss the possibility of installing a bitcoin ATM machine in his restaurant. Although the two have yet to meet, Grill told CoinDesk:\n\n""I do think bitcoin ATMs will be successful even if capital controls are lifted. The Greek people are now aware that the money they relied on is not under their control and can be used against them.""\n\nCoinoutlet, however, is not the first company in the space to focus on the Greek market during the country\'s economic turmoil. Amid increasing speculation that people within Greece – fearing their country would crash out of the euro – had been buying bitcoin and inadvertently driving the the digital currency\'s price, some bitcoin exchanges waived fees for EUR/BTC transactions.\n\nOther bitcoin ATM operators, such as Bitchain, are also attempting to crack the Greek market. Having installed a bitcoin ATM last weekend, J. Fenoy, CTO and co-founder of Bitchain, said he witnessed reasonable demand for bitcoin it the first couple of days since the machine\'s launch.\n\n""We have been pleasantly surprised by peoples\' response. In the last two days, the working ATM machine has completed over 70 transactions and the support from the bitcoin community has been overwhelming.""\n\nBitchain has also temporarily waived commission fees.\n\nMeeting the Greek bitcoin community\n\nMiriam Liapi, a founding member of Bitcoin Community Greece – represented by Anthony A.Tsakoumis, founder of Bitcoinx.gr, at the first ever bitcoin meetup held in Athens yesterday – said incoming information requests on the group\'s Facebook page had soared by 423% in recent times.\n\nSome of these requests portray concerns over the safety of bitcoin transactions and generally seek more information about the different ways in which the digital currency can be purchased. Exploratory enquiries, she added, are also flooding in from companies curious about how Greeks are surviving in the wake of the capital controls.\n\nWhile it seems awareness of bitcoin has increased in the country, Liapi isn\'t convinced this is behind the recent increase in the price of bitcoin.\n\n""I am convinced that we are experiencing a new kind of war, a noiseless financial war ... I think the Greek crisis, amid other financial crises during this period, awakened citizens\' fears about who is going to be next ... The citizens around the world have every reason to fear that their country might be next. This is where I attribute the rise of bitcoin\'s price. Not to the Greeks who, according to academic research, are late adopters,"" she said.\n\nSpreading the word\n\nLiapi believes more education is needed in order for bitcoin to reach mainstream adoption, a sentiment shared by Felix Weiss, a freelance programmer originally from Luxembourg, who is currently on a mission to raise bitcoin awareness in Greece.\n\n""There\'s still a lot of scepticism towards new technology in general,"" Weiss said.\n\nHe has devoted time recently to handing out bitcoin flyers to people protesting outside the Greek Parliament in Athens. What he learned during the exercise is there is a burgeoning interest in the digital currency.\n\n""Lots of questions were asked ... [but] unfortunately it\'s not easy to explain bitcoin in five minutes,"" he said.\n\nNevertheless, he still has still hope, explaining:\n\n""Bitcoin can now show people that they don\'t have to fight the old system. The solution is to stop using central bank issued paper bills and start using free, open source money: bitcoin.""\n\nIt\'s safe to say bitcoin has entered the spotlight once again, with numerous news headlines suggesting the people of Greece are turning to it in their droves.\n\nIn reality, there are few hard facts to indicate that understanding, acceptance and adoption of bitcoin have significantly increased in the country over the past month. The country\'s existing advocates are trying their best to push the agenda, but it seems there is still a long way to go.\n\nAthens image via Shutterstock.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated that Bitcoin Community Greece had organised the first ever bitcoin meetup held in Athens yesterday.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Users storing bitcoin with hardware from a leading data protection company have been urged to update their devices or risk losing funds.\n\nIn a company blog post on Friday, Gemini CSO Cem Paya released details of a vulnerability he encountered that allows attackers to brute-force secret keys from SafeNet\'s brand of hardware security modules, or \'HSMs\'.\n\nThese tamper-proof, specialist devices are used to safeguard all manner of cryptographic keys for the likes of governments, banks and payment companies. They\'ve been hailed as the \'next step\' for bitcoin security.\n\nWhile testing the SafeNet Luna G5 for use in the forthcoming exchange\'s cold storage, Paya discovered a design flaw in its software that meant both public and private keys could be extracted – even though they are designed never to leave the device. Clients using any of Safenet\'s three HSMs to manage their bitcoin keys would be at risk, he said, adding:\n\n""Bitcoin is the one payment technology where possession of money can be boiled down to pure cryptographic capability: generating a signature with an ECDSA private key is money. If you lose control of that private key, you lose the ability to spend your funds, plain and simple.""\n\nAccording to SafeNet, which released a fix last Thursday, the firm rated the severity of the vulnerability as \'high\'.\n\nChris Dunn, VP of technology and crypto management at Gemalto, the company that acquired SafeNet in January, told CoinDesk there have been no known exploits so far. This, he added, was partly due to the specialised nature of the hardware – which can only be accessed by a trusted client.\n\n""Vulnerabilities with the HSM itself are quite rare and difficult to exploit given where and how customers deploy their HSM. The HSM also includes several usage and access control policies that can be used to protect against this type of vulnerability.""\n\nCommonly, HSMs are held in air-gapped, covert locations that are only known to select staff members. Certain models are even programmed to self-destruct if they are compromised.\n\nBitcoin and HSMs\n\nThough the company protects some 750 million encryption keys, relatively few of its 25,000 clients are using these machines to protect their bitcoin.\n\n""We ... have some bitcoin focused customers currently, however this is a new use case for our HSMs,"" Dunn said.\n\nThe devices are still a relatively niche, and costly, product for the bitcoin industry. However, as part of a wider move to traditional security standards – also visible in insurance – venture-backed companies like Gemini and API developer Gem are now utilising these bits of kit as part of their offline (or \'cold\') storage solutions.\n\n""There are things [in bitcoin] we can do better than Visa, MasterCard and American Express, but they do a pretty good job of securing private keys. How do they do that? They do that through HSMs,"" Gem\'s COO Ken Miller told CoinDesk.\n\nHis company has been vocal about its eight-month integration with Thales, a manufacturer of military-grade HSMs, which required a team of engineers from both companies to create new software that allowed the machines to ""speak bitcoin"", not RSA.\n\n""We\'ve since found out that a lot of really well-known companies in the bitcoin space have gone down this path and decided not to for that very reason, it\'s too much work,"" Miller said, adding that if enough people come knocking, Gem might consider reselling its custom machines.\n\nBy contrast, Paya said Gemini did not run into any significant compatibility issues when using SafeNet for bitcoin key storage. ""Their HSMs supported ECDSA algorithm as well as the specific bitcoin curve out-of-the-gate without any problems,"" he said, adding:\n\n""While I\'m not familiar with the specific problems Gem face, I can say that each product has a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. Some units we are evaluating did not support bitcoin until recently, while others had OS/software issues that required additional workarounds.""\n\nFuture adoption\n\nDue to its rarity, Paya said the vulnerability – now patched – does not impact Gemini\'s plans to use HSMs as part of its back-end security, or Safenet hardware in particular.\n\n""This vulnerability serves as a reminder that sometimes even the additional layers of defence that go above-and-beyond (such as using dedicated HSMs to manage keys) can fail,"" he said.\n\nHowever, he added: ""HSMs remain the best-practice for managing cryptographic keys.""\n\nGem\'s COO agreed. While there is no silver bullet for companies to safeguard bitcoin and prevent attacks, the best strategy, he said, was one based on multiple layers of security – including HSM hardware.\n\n""Any hardware or software solution is only going to be as good as the implementation of that solution so it’s critical to be rigorous and thoughtful around the implementation, management, and review of the solution. But having the best available hardware solution is worlds better than not having it.""\n\nCircuit image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Now, banked workers in Canada can use the domestic payments provider Interac to pay for a Bitcoin transmission to a Coins.ph wallet, which may be cashed out at a range of Philippines locations.\n\nLorne Lantz, creator and CEO of Zinger, told CoinTelegraph that he came onboard with Coins.ph, one of a considerable number of remittance-focused startups in the Philippines, due to their strong market presence in the country and further afield in Southeast Asia.\n\n“I partnered with Coins.ph because they have the best fintech product in the Philippines, and I knew that if I integrated with them, Zinger would be of high quality as well,” he explained. “As well, every encounter I've had with their team has been extremely positive.”\n\nCanadian-Filipino corridor\n\nZinger relies on the concept of Interac ‘pushing’ transactions by purchasing remittances in CAD, authorizing a user’s bank transfer and signaling a BTC transfer in Zinger. Funds then arrive in the corresponding Coins.ph wallet in BTC, before being converted to peso to be cashed out as required.\n\nThe Interac method ensures that the sender only needs to share their personal payment information with their bank. Consolidating the BTC purchase and sale process into one step also takes away much of angst associated with traditional remittances, Lantz said. He continued:\n\n“Under the hood things get very complicated very fast, which is an important problem we solve. Right now Filipinos sending remittances through bitcoin have to buy their bitcoin in Canada [and] then send it to coins.ph. We have streamlined that process for them and taken out the complexity of managing multiple exchange rates and multiple fees along the way.”\n\nInterac has become something of an institution in Canada, with over 450,000 domestic merchants using its debit network to secure payments. The increased speed with which bank transactions are cleared has the knock-on effect of adding some certainty as to whether a fiat-based transaction is genuine.\n\nOn the recipient end, coins.ph balances are able to be cashed out at one of 24 banks, in person in cash or even courier delivery or cardless ATM. Long term, indicative of the growing optimism surrounding cryptocurrency as an enabling force among Filipino startups, Lantz sees considerable mileage in Bitcoin as a backend tool.\n\n“I think the remittance market in the Philippines will continue to grow in the mid to long term, it is one of the world’s fastest growing economies,” he said.\n\nHe added:"", 'Director: Torsten Hoffmann, Micheal Watchulonis\n\nDocumentary\n\nRunning Time: 60 minutes\n\n[/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_3quarter_end]\n\nDirector Torsten Hoffmann breaks out into the world of money with his energetic documentary, “Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It” (2015). It’s dynamic, filled to the brim with hard-hitting history. There’s electricity in the pace, a kineticism in the narration, a fervor in the subject matter and the high-stakes world of finance. It is a rapid film that catches you off guard, with a title as provocative as itself.\n\nThe picture begins with a luring score that ushers us in, not to explore simply Bitcoin, but to hint at the basis of trade, commerce, and civil society. Montaging clips of personal interactions and crowds of people, Hoffmann opens the film as if opening the blinds on a warm and beautiful morning. His story of money is one filled with promise like a sunrise over a landscape of human spirit.\n\nIt is this very story that Hoffman brings us along, flitting through moments of civilizations past, guided by the deep vibrato of John Barrett’s narrating voice. It is interesting, intriguing, and above all, intellectual.\n\nYet, as a filmmaker in the realm of Bitcoin, one must straddle and balance the call of activism with the power of art. They are two forces that when utilized effectively, complement each other, but if misunderstood, falls flat on its face. Unfortunately for Hoffmann, this film is a somewhat uneasy mix of both.\n\nThere are moments when it seems he forgets this, fitting stock footage into empty spaces and losing the vigorous dynamism that sparks the opening montage in the first place. Even his credits sequence plagues his film retroactively with an almost suicidal use of comedy that bluntly bludgeons the audience with absurdity, as if to ironically poison the conversation he spent 60 minutes building up.\n\nAdditionally, the choice to film talking heads in front of the black curtain background cuts the film’s presence off from the vivid world that Hoffmann is attempting to point at. Unlike “Ulterior States” (2015), where the black curtain supported the gritty and underground guerrilla realm that Tomer Kantor explored philosophically, Hoffmann cuts himself off, weakening his own thesis of tying the historical and ideological underpinnings to the present and future reality.\n\nHowever, despite the shortcomings of the methods, “Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It” is undoubtedly an enjoyable documentary that thoroughly explains why bitcoin exists and what questions it poses to the establishment. Most definitely, the concept of a digital, decentralized currency is tearing those questions wide open and the answers being spilled out are deep-seated, long-standing propositions that place a magnifying glass onto the seemingly untouchable financial institutions at the base of modern commerce. What may be uncovered in the philosophical, political, and economic questions could have radical implications for the rest of the 21st century.\n\nAt the end of the film, Hoffmann lands with this potent quote:\n\n“I’m sure that in twenty years, there will either be very large Bitcoin transaction volume… or none.” – Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin could be the end of money as we know it, but perhaps it is the beginning of money as we will all find out.\n\nWhat do you think about this film?

This is insane, of course, but it makes one wonder what a true ceiling on bitcoin value would look like.\n\nThe asset is fixed which means there will never be more than a certain amount. This should contribute to a higher value, but won’t matter until interest is significant enough that people are willing to buy it at higher prices because of it. There is always the possibility that a large group of people may want to migrate into Bitcoin at the same time, which would cause a bull run up the ladder of prices, as high as we could dream, if their (chinese?) pockets were deep enough.\n\nFor years, there have been those who have talked about the Bitcoin that will be worth thousands of dollars each.

As some kind of unit in some account, probably, it's possible.”\n\nHe added reservations about the ultimate usefulness of Bitcoin as a currency, stating that “We do not reject anything, but there are serious, really fundamental issues related to its wider usage, at least, today.”\n\n- Russian president Vladimir Putin\n\nThe situation regarding digital currency within Russian territory has taken a turbulent course over the past two years. From an initial plan to ban the use of Bitcoin outright, itself shelved several times, regional authorities have meanwhile taken steps to ban online resources providing information on cryptocurrency, also since widely overturned, as well as pressure related discussion groups.\n\nWith his latest comments, Putin appears to reverse this trend, with the Russian community slowly showing cause for optimism.\n\n“Right now, it feels like a ‘thaw’ compared to last year,” BTCSec CEO, Ivan Tikhonov, told CoinTelegraph. “Nevertheless, the Ministry of Finance is still supporting a proposed law to define virtual currency as money surrogates.”\n\nTikhonov nevertheless remained cagey about what the future ultimately holds for the freedom to use Bitcoin in Russia.\n\n“Currently, it is impossible to predict what kind of future is in store for cryptocurrencies in Russia. It’s promising that the central bank started to study the possibilities offered by cryptocurrencies in greater detail while withholding from passing any more restrictive laws,” continued Tikhonov.\n\nHe added:\n\n“If this continues, then it is possible to expect more reasonable laws and regulation in the future. But if [the Russian Ministry of Finance’s] version of the law is passed, then you can forget about legal operations with cryptocurrency for businesses in Russia for the next few years.”\n\nKevin Rinta of Bitcoin exchange Exmo, which counts a large number of Russian users among its clientele, was more critical.\n\n“In my opinion, it will be some time before any decision will be made regarding its legality,” he said. “Russia will only legalize bitcoin once it has been determined that it does not pose a threat and if the country can somehow benefit from it.”"", 'Readers may remember BitQuest, as covered here on CCN. The Minecraft server uses Bitcoin for its economic component, and the results are fantastic efforts from those wishing to earn Bitcoin. They even had an architecture contest recently.\n\nA group of players recently decided to take the market component of the Minecraft server to a new level by creating a market that would be supply and demand responsive. Players were able to purchase in-game currency using bitcoins and then buy blocks. Each in-game emerald is worth a bit, or a millionth of a Bitcoin.\n\nSome blocks are more valuable than others, but at present the average price of a block is about 23 bits. The most valuable in-game block is quartz because it is the hardest to find. Players can trade their blocks in for emeralds, which are worth bits, and then they can take these emeralds and cash out of the game if they like. Or they can use them to buy other blocks and continue playing.\n\nUsing a market model where each time an item sold, the price of the item increased, the group sold 1.54BTC worth of product in the course of six months. Developer Cristián González believes that the group’s experiment in Minecraft economics is illustrative, and that Bitcoin can play a serious role in virtual worlds. He writes:\n\nBut the best part is that for the first time a game currency is not a product to sell or a “pay to win” scheme, but the veins of a proper economy. Game money sucks because it’s all on walled gardens, and we believe multiplayer games of the future will use only one open, transparent currency that will work as your virtual world passport.\n\nWhether Bitcoin is properly integrated into other online worlds, time will tell.

07/16/2015,"['On July 15, Coinbase, one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchange and merchant payment processors, released a half-year report on Bitcoin trends in 2015. They included information about increases in such activities as the creation of wallets, daily transactions, Github repositories and investments.\n\nIncrease in Wallets\n\nIn 2015, the number of bitcoin wallet registrations has substantially increased. Coinbase estimates that there are currently around 5 to 10 million bitcoin wallet holders around the world.\n\nOf those, 3.1 million are Coinbase wallets and around 3.8 million have been created on Blockchain.info. The number of blockchain.info wallets has doubled since last year, due to the increasing worldwide adoption of the digital currency.\n\nAccording to the “My Wallet Number of Users” chart on blockchain.info, the number of Blockchain wallets has increased from 1.8 million to 3.8 million since July 21, 2014.\n\nDaily Transactions and Coinbase’s Expansion\n\nAccording to Coinbase, daily transactions on the bitcoin network have rapidly increased since last year. In June 2014, around 60,590 transactions were settled on the blockchain. A year later, in June of this year, there were more than 110,000 daily transactions, marking a 94% increase in monthly transactions.\n\nCoinbase has seen the highest user growth in the areas of Hong Kong, Tanzania, Philippines, Romania and Algeria in the first half of this year, following their international and European expansion in late 2014. Currently, 47% of Coinbase wallet holders are based outside the U.S.\n\nThe number of developers using Coinbase’s API has significantly grown in the past year, as there are now more than 7,000 applications built on the platform’s API. Furthermore, popular apps such as ChangeTip, Lawnmower and Zapchain have gained a lot of traction from Coinbase users.\n\nInvestments\n\nThe sum of bitcoin investments in the first half of 2015 have already surpassed total investments made in 2014. Over the last six months, more than US$350 million has been invested in bitcoin startups. The world’s largest bitcoin wallet service provider, Blockchain.info, in its latest round of funding, raised over US$30 million while leading Bitcoin infrastructure provider Bitfury has secured another mega funding round, raising around US$20 million.', 'Bitcoin operations should be exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT), the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice said in an opinion document published today.\n\nCiting existing exemptions for currency and money transactions in Europe’s VAT Directive, Advocate General Juliane Kokott urged the court to opt against applying a tax to bitcoin purchases and sales. She further argued that bitcoin, while not legal tender, is still a form of money.\n\nKokott wrote in the opinion:\n\n“I therefore propose that the Court should reply...[that] these operations are exempt from tax under section 135, paragraph 1, point e) of the VAT Directive.”\n\nSwedish tax officials asked the ECJ to look into the matter last June. At the time, the Skatterverket – Sweden’s tax office – challenged a court decision that ruled bitcoin transactions in the country should be exempt from VAT, an outcome that grew from a dispute between the tax authority and bitcoin forum operator Daniel Hedqvist.\n\nMember-state level decisions\n\nThe publication of the European Court of Justice\'s opinion follows the release of bitcoin VAT exemptions by various EU member states.\n\nLast year, Belgium\'s Federal Public Service Finance (FPS) released a statement which noted that certain domestic digital currency transactions were exempt from VAT.\n\nSpain\'s bitcoin community rejoiced in April following the news that the digital currency had been declared exempt from VAT. A spokesperson from Spain\'s Ministerio de Hacienda, the tax Office, told CoinDesk that the cryptocurrency had always been exempt from VAT but that the decision clarified existing readings of the law.\n\nThe confirmation, the spokesperson said, was based on the interpretation of EU VAT Directive 2006/112/CE, which defines bitcoin as a ""financial service"".\n\nLast month, it was Switzerland\'s turn to celebrate a VAT exemption for bitcoin in the country.\n\nNot all European Union countries have come to support a VAT exemption for bitcoin. In December, Estonia opted to apply VAT to the full amount of bitcoin trades, not just the commission or the fee incurred by the transaction.\n\nImage credit: European Court of Justice image via Peter Fuchs / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This rejection is typically the result of the peer believing that the transaction is non-standard.""\n\nHe continued: ""Whatever the reason, when a transaction is propagating more slowly, it increases the chance that a double-spend transaction could be present in the network and reach miners before the slowly propagating original transaction reaches them.""\n\nBitnet, Khan noted, does not decline the transactions to the merchant. ""We notify the merchant accordingly and take liability for funding that transaction.""\n\n""If the probability is not high, we don\'t decline the transaction, we fallback to waiting until the transaction confirms and notify the merchant accordingly, thus maximising the chance that the merchant can accept the transaction.""\n\nAccording to Khan, Bitnet, which raised $14.5m last year, will also take into account other risk factors, but he declined to divulge further details, noting these were of a confidential nature.\n\nMonetisation\n\nThe new service is being offered at no extra charge and as part of Bitnet\'s current payment processing solution.\n\nWhen asked about monetisation, Khan said the on-boarding of new clients – attracted by the speedier transactions on offer – would help the payment processor increase its revenue prospects.\n\nSpeed image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""We’ve not measured so I don’t want to make any claims.""\n\nLevel39 was set up in 2013 by the Canary Wharf Group to encourage a new generation of finance firms to come to the East London office peninsula — financial technology, or fintech, startups.\n\n""Canary Wharf deserves credit because this is not cheap,"" says Van de Kleij. ""This is a serious long term investment. But I think it’s a good thing because what we want is one of these companies to turn around and say can you build me my new headquarters in Wood Wharf.""\n\nJust over 2 years on, the space has broadened out to welcome ""smart city"" and cybersecurity startups too, as well as opening new space for high growth businesses on Level 42 and 24. The building can now house a startup from being a 2-man operation up to a 20-plus team.\n\n""They want to eat the banks’ lunch""\n\nThe huge number of startups under Van der Kleij\'s nose gives him a good overview of what exactly the fintech world is up to.\n\n""We find they fit into two camps,"" he says. ""There’s the camp that wants to help the existing world of financial services to improve, to be more transparent, to provide better customer choice, to lower their costs. And then there are those that want to be the new bank, they want to eat the banks’ lunch. We love both of them.""\n\nVan der Kleij is very excited about one particular type of new technology — the blockchain, the software that runs bitcoin.\n\n""The real powerful work being done in fintech is blockchain,"" he says. ""I can tell you now with certainty that every major western bank we’ve spoken to, and some eastern ones, are looking at blockchain technology.""\n\nThe blockchain creates bitcoins, allows transactions to happen, and creates a public record of all transactions, shared across hundreds of computers. Transactions can\'t be reversed and are much faster than the current system.\n\nBanks currently have to interact with each others\' systems when transferring money between accounts. This can be a slow, cumbersome, and a costly exercise, given how old many of the banks\' computer systems are.\n\nBut if a secure, transparent, piece of software could automate these types of interbank transfers, it would be vastly quicker and cheaper. Barclays, UBS and Citi are all exploring how it could be used.\n\nThere are potential applications beyond payments too — Santander says it has 25 use cases for blockchain technology, while BNP Paribas says the technology could make some companies that hold stock ""redundant.""\n\n""Very similar dynamics to music""\n\nVan der Kleij calls blockchain ""the real frontier"" of finance and likens its evolution out of bitcoin to the rise of peer-to-peer technology out of illegal music-sharing website Napster.\n\nHe says: ""In the world of music you had Napster as the unregulated challenger to the establishment. What they did is prove that technology can enable peer-to-peer file sharing to take place without the establishment controlling it. What that industry did is they wisely embraced that technology to reduce their costs and you now have the iTunes Store, Spotify. That transformed the model of music distribution.\n\n""Who’s the Napster? It is companies involves in open ledger or blockchain technology. Of course its origins came from Bitcoin. Bitcoin is incredibly interesting and very exciting but very challenging for the regulator because of the privacy it affords.\n\n""The challenge is we don’t want this to become the money launder’s weapon of choice, which is what the regulator is worried about. It has very similar dynamics to the world of music.""\n\nLevel39 residents working on bitcoin and blockchain technologies include CodeStack, BitReserve and Coinjar.\n\nVan der Kleij is confident that, as with music, blockchain technology will mature and enter the mainstream — we\'ll get our iTunes or Spotify of finance.\n\nNot only will blockchain adoption make banking faster and cheaper, he also thinks the blockchain has the potential to make banking safer.\n\n""You know the thing that caused the big problem in the financial crisis?"" he asks. ""It was these derivative mortgage-backed securities. Cunning people were repackaging different mortgage securities into products. When institutions bought them they had no real way of looking at the underlying assets they were buying because they were so complex. If they were forced to build that on blockchain, an investment manager could press a button and see the truth because of the immutability.""\n\nFor now though, it\'s early days for the blockchain.', 'If you and I are ready to settle our trade in Bitcoin, this technological marvel is here to stay.\n\nBut even a nobel award winning — and stubbornly ideological — economist like Paul Krugman has to be explained this very simple fact. The poster child of traditional finance system has once again tried his very best to besmirch Bitcoin, while repeating the age-old rhetorics related to the digital currency’s longevity as a value-holding asset.\n\nThe comments come during a show, ironically called “The Genius of Economics”, where Mr. Krugman is asked about his views on the disruptive digital currencies “such as Bitcoin” and how they refute the idea of government-backed currencies. With a few public laughs that come after this question is asked, the economist begins with saying that “Bitcoin is not looking too good”, a statement that takes everything — that is said afterwards — to the south.\n\n“Money is a pretty amazing thing,” he stammers and states. “Why does a piece of green paper with a dead president on it have value? Ultimately, it’s because other people believe it has value, and [it] circulates. However, there is an anchor for dollar bills which is not gold. It is the fact that you can use it to pay taxes.”\n\n“And then you have someone try creating Bitcoin which has nothing in the end. It’s a purely self-fulfilling prophecy; it is purely levitating on itself, which is not impossible but is kinda unlikely. And I have to say that Bitcoin really looks like a bubble in multiple senses. Its a technically sweet solution to a problem, but it is not clear that the problem is one that has much economical relevance.”\n\nKrugman goes on rubbishing Bitcoin by indicating it as an inessential payment solution, saying that the world already has platforms like credit cards and their monetary system currently already has billion dollars of “ones and zeros” for doing the same thing Bitcoin does.\n\nBitcoin Community Reacts\n\nThe Bitcoin community has criticized Mr. Krugman for distributing groundless propaganda against the digital currency. As many believe, including us, the celebrated economist is too immersed in his own narcissistic thoughts that makes him blind enough to see Bitcoin as something more than a value holding asset.\n\nFor instance, his opinion on the digital currency being an inessential payment solution literally evokes laughs. He fails to realize that whether Bitcoin is a reliable store of value or not, most people do not hold it for too long. The payments are easy to make, and are also backed by the real time exchange infrastructures, like BitPay, that protect merchants from Bitcoin’s price volatility.\n\nMeanwhile, Krugman’s opinion on treating taxes as the anchor to prove value further evokes ‘rofl’ — a slightly animalistic version of laughter. He wants to imply that if a government will start accepting Bitcoin as a means of tax payments, then only it will be termed ‘legitimate’. By the same logic, Gold is illegitimate as well.\n\nKrugman never speaks of the growing Bitcoin industry. He never cares to mention blockchain and its adoption by some of the world’s leading financial institutions, and even governments.\n\nThe last time I checked, it only took a day for me to receive my cross border payment, thanks to Bitcoin.

It operates a network of more than 1,700 branches and outlets (including subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures) across more than 70 countries and employs around 87,000 people.\n\nPatwardhan has 25 years of banking experience, with Standard Chartered and Citibank, in regional and global roles in Credit Risk and Operational Risk Management. She is an IBF distinguished fellow, the highest banking accolade in Singapore, and a fellow of Singapore Management.\n\nFinextra notes that Citi, UBS and Barclays all have recently confirmed that they are exploring the blockchain, while a BNP Paribas analyst speculated that the distributed ledger has the potential to completely upend post-trade infrastructure.\n\nWriting on Linkedin, Patwardhan proposes that Bitcoin could be a disruptive force for good. The financial services industry is being disrupted and digitally re-imagined, and some of the disruptors, who are working to revolutionize current business models from the ground up, could become mainstream.\n\n“Bitcoin has been viewed uneasily as an exotic alternative currency,” notes Patwardhan. “But the banking industry is starting to see the many potential benefits of its underlying technology. For banks, the blockchain has the potential to become a technology model for a low-cost and transparent transaction infrastructure.”\n\nPatwardhan is persuaded that the technology of Bitcoin could permit drastically reducing the price of financial services to the benefit of consumers, and be adopted to make financial transactions more secure and traceable for banks and regulators.\n\nOf course, Standard Chartered and other financial institutions must comply with regulations (anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, etc.) and make sure that their financial technology systems aren’t used to fund undesirable activities. Of course, Patwardhan mentions drug trade or terrorism, like all banks and financial service providers are doing these days, although some restrictive regulations seem rather aimed at keeping peaceful, law-abiding citizens and business under constant surveillance.\n\nThe reason why the regulatory authorities and world of mainstream finance are warming up to the emerging blockchain-based fintech is that, contrary to naïve perceptions, bitcoin transactions are not anonymous. Every transaction and the full transaction history of any bitcoin address are permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain, and therefore open to analysis and often more easily traceable than traditional transactions (let alone paper cash transactions).\n\nTherefore, “sanitized” implementations of blockchain fintech could become useful tools for the authorities to fight crime, as well as any activity that they find undesirable. With the use of blockchain technology, says Patwardhan, transactions can be fully recorded and traced, making the ultimate destination and use of the funds clearer.\n\n“Whether cryptocurrencies, the likes of Bitcoin, will fail or succeed remains to be seen,” concludes Patwardhan. “But if they do take off, it is not impossible to imagine a scenario where even the central banks themselves might look at issuing digital currencies. No bank can afford to ignore what it augurs for the ongoing avalanche of digital innovations to come.”\n\nPhoto Tomkasing / CC BY-SA 3.0', 'British multinational banking and financial services company Barclays launchedRise New York, a physical space and virtual global community designed to pioneer the future of financial technology. By the end of 2016, Barclays plans to open other Rise hubs in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia.\n\nBarclays’ existing open innovation sites in London and Manchester (previously known as Escalators) will be rebranded as Rise locations.\n\n“It is time to redefine financial services,” said Michael Harte, Barclays’ chief operations and technology officer. “Rise is designed to help shape the future of our industry and drive growth. We’re seeking to connect the world’s most active innovators to each other, to corporates, and to resources and support networks. By accelerating the development of groundbreaking products and services, we know that we can help to keep Barclays at the cutting edge of financial services, all while helping to revolutionize the industry.”\n\nBased in the Castro Building on 23rd Street, in the heart of Silicon Alley, Rise New York will host the first Barclays Accelerator program in New York. The Barclays Accelerator program, offered in partnership with the Techstars global network, includes mentorship and opportunities for financial technology startups to access industry experts, influencers and potential clients. The program covers all areas of fintech, from cybersecurity and artificial intelligence to wealth management, investment banking, big data and cryptocurrencies.\n\n“With Rise and the Barclays Accelerator, we are unlocking the power of open innovation,” said Derek White, Barclays’ chief design and digital officer. “By using our collective resources, we hope to accelerate the speed of innovation in financial services, and potentially unlock significant benefits for millions of people across the globe.”\n\nIn March, speaking at the Morgan Stanley European Financials Conference in London, Barclays’ CEO Antony Jenkins warned that the “banking sector has not yet felt the ‘full disruptive force’ of technology – but it will.” He elaborated on the growing concern among financial institutions that faster, cheaper payment systems will start to seduce their consumer and business customers in the coming years.\n\nAfter the last Barclay Accelerator program in London, several fintech startups that participated in the program started to explore opportunities with the bank. Barclays signed a deal with Swedish Bitcoin company Safello to explore how the blockchain could be used in traditional finance.\n\nThe 11 companies that will participate in the Barclays Accelerator program in New York were selected from hundreds of applications received over the past four months from companies based in 55 countries. Among the participants, Bitcoin company Chainalysis offers a service that provides financial institutions with the means to obtain regulatory compliance through real-time analysis of the blockchain. The company provides an API for sophisticated in-depth real-time blockchain transaction analysis.\n\nChainalysis customers – including regulatory entities, law enforcement and financial service providers – have tools to trace all transactions recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain and determine the origin of the bitcoin held by any address.\n\nChainalysis’ snooping angers the underground, crypto-anarchist parts of the Bitcoin community, but it’s evident that mainstream financial operators like Barclays want to promote a totally different concept of regulated digital currencies and fully compliant operators.', 'The bitcoin price has given us a tough time over the last few days. Having peaked out just short of 320 on Sunday, and declining considerably to around the 280 mark on Monday, we saw some pretty flat action throughout the first half of this week and expected (not least because of a number of fundamental risk-off drivers) bitcoin to recover before we headed into this coming weekend.\n\nHowever, things have not turned out this way, and the sideways action seems to have given way to some bearish momentum during last night’s Asian session. So, with this said, what are the levels that we are keeping an eye on today in the bitcoin price, and how can we try and get in and out of the markets according to our intraday scalp strategy? Take a quick look at the chart.\n\nAt the chart shows, action overnight has seen the bitcoin price break to what serves as intraday lows and in term support concurrently, around 281.98. This is the level that we will be watching to the downside during today’s session. To the upside, 287.15 brings us in term resistance, having served as a key support level over the past few days on numerous occasions. To the upside, this is the one to watch.\n\nWith the current momentum seemingly bearish, we will first address a short entry. If we can close below aforementioned in term support (281.98) it will put us short towards a medium-term downside target of 275 flat. A stop loss somewhere around 283.4 (current levels, coincidentally) will help us to maintain a positive risk reward profile on this trade.\n\nLooking the other way, if we get a bounce from in term support, an aggressive long entry could be towards in term resistance with a stop loss just below 280 flat, and a target of 287.15. Further to this, if we get a break above 287.15, it will put us long towards 293.67 with a stop around 286 flat keeping the trade attractive from a risk management perspective.\n\nCharts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Trigo further said that at one point, up to €1.5 million was being transferred into Ramírez’s accounts every day.\n\nSergey Mavrodi\n\nAccording to another former collaborator, Ramírez got the unete idea from Sergey Mavrodi, a Russian criminal who founded the MMM series of pyramid schemes.\n\nIn 2007, Mavrodi was found guilty in a Russian court of defrauding 10,000 investors out of 110 million rubles (US$4.3 million). The Russian court sentenced him to four and a half years in a penal colony, in addition to a 10,000 ruble (US$390) fine.\n\nIn 2011, Mavrodi launched two other pyramid schemes called MMM-2011 and MMM India. MMM-2011 was able to function openly as Ponzi schemes as financial pyramids are not illegal under Russian law.\n\n""José Manuel was obsessed with Mavrodi,"" the former collaborator said, adding that his former employer was constantly trying to work out how to set up a bank, an alternative financial system, and even a city to be called Unetecity.\n\nThe Ponzi scheme extended to a dozen countries, according to experts. So far, more than 100 of the 6,000 Spanish victims filed the class-action lawsuit.\n\nRamírez\' name is linked to System World Investment, a firm operating under the brand name Dextraplus. Spain\'s Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, a governmental agency responsible for the financial regulation of the securities markets in the country, issued a public warning on System World Investment in 2009, calling the company a ""financial scam.""\n\nRamírez also worked for Finanzas Forex, a Panama company that operated a pyramid scheme. Founder Germán Cardona was sent to prison in March 2011 for scamming 100,000 investors with total losses amounting about €300 million.\n\nPolice are still searching for Ramírez and his girlfriend, Pilar Otera. Both are located in a European country and could be arrested in the coming days, the police said on Wednesday.']"
07/17/2015,"['Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of media coverage and its impact.\n\nBerklee, Deloitte, Standard Chartered, Vladimir Putin – the mainstream media was spoilt for choice this week as big names from mainstream business circles and global newsmakers contributed their opinion of the technology.\n\nToo bad the press didn\'t notice.\n\nWith the bitcoin price down from last week\'s highs and speculation about a Greek eurozone exit finally waning, mainstream journalists seemed to have taken a much-needed respite from awkward attempts at analyzing the industry this week.\n\nEven with comments from Russian President Vladimir Putin (likely the first head of state to publicly acknowledge the technology) or a key opinion related to how value added tax (VAT) could be handled in Europe, the press responded with a resounding shrug that suggested mainstream news may not soon recover from its Q2 decline.\n\nMacro trends emerge\n\nSpeaking of trends, this week saw at least two notable reports celebrate the halfway mark of 2015 by attempting to make sense of developments in the ecosystem.\n\nThe most extensive was CoinDesk\'s State of Bitcoin Q2, which offered nearly 100 slides of insight. Its most notable conclusion? That bitcoin is increasingly behaving like an asset that can be used in times of macroeconomic uncertainty, while showing more signs of price stability away from its volatile peaks.\n\nAs for bitcoin in the headlines, the report found overall press coverage was down in Q2 across all major news outlets surveyed including Financial Times, The New York Times, Sina and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nUS bitcoin services firm Coinbase also released a mid-year review, finding similar conclusions regarding the price and volatility of bitcoin.\n\nThat report\'s most notable conclusions may have been regarding transaction volume on the bitcoin network, as it asserted:\n\n""The network averaged 60,590 transactions per day in June 2014 and 117,474 transactions per day in June 2015. (Note that this does not include the recent spikes due to load testing and spam on the network.) That’s a 94% increase in monthly transactions over the past year.""\n\nElsewhere, Coinbase noted the growth in the use of its API and what it believed to be the increase in exciting projects such as 21 Inc, Abra and Blockstream.\n\nPutin\'s uncertain address\n\nPossibly the highest-profile – and perhaps unexpected – piece of news this week came during a Russian TV appearance by President Vladimir Putin, who in a question-and-answer session, was asked for his thoughts on digital currencies.\n\nThough the comments hinted at Putin\'s lack of understanding regarding the technology, interestingly the remarks were generally neutral in tone.\n\nPutin suggested he agreed with the Bank of Russia and its approach to understanding the technology. Implicit in the remarks was that the Bank of Russia has opposed a draft bill put forth by the Ministry of Finance which has called for bitcoin and digital currencies to be banned.\n\nStill, it was the community\'s somewhat comparably hostile reaction to Putin\'s remarks that arguably received more play that the comments themselves, which were publicized only by International Business Times and in China-based news outlets.\n\nWriting for NASDAQ, Martin Tillier took aim at comments that sought to belittle the Russian leader and his assertion on how the technology is ""backed by nothing"".\n\nTillier said:\n\n""As with all of the old men before him (and many young ones too) he completely ignored that the same thing is true of every modern conventional currency. Dollars, euros, yen and rubles are also backed by nothing and have value because people believe they do. If anything it could be argued that because of the computing power and trustless account network behind Bitcoin it has more backing it than the others, not less.""\n\nTillier took aim at Reddit in particular scolding the community for its ""tizzy"" on the subject, though he grounded the comments somewhat in overall criticism for online news reactions.\n\n""With maturity comes respect, and so long as bitcoin users and followers continue to overreact to everything, the respect that the currency deserves as a potentially transformational idea will be withheld by the vast majority of people,"" he continued.\n\nBank news narrative falters\n\nThis week also brought the first signs that interest in statements from major financial institutions toward bitcoin may be waning as comments by ""big four"" auditing firms Deloitte and Standard Chartered Bank failed to draw much interest.\n\nIn an interview with CoinDesk, for example, Deloitte detailed the breadth of its bitcoin and blockchain program, noting it was currently exploring use cases for the technology in two of its core verticals, auditing and consulting.\n\nDeloitte Consulting principal Eric Piscini told CoinDesk:\n\n""The solution we\'re developing using the blockchain will accelerate the audit process because that company would post every transaction in a blockchain.""\n\nThough the statements were not from any major Wall Street firms, and in the case of Standard Chartered, didn\'t coincide with announcements about the actual use cases of the blockchain, the overall quiet period could be read as the first signs that interest in this news narrative is waning.\n\nOn one hand, the reaction is logical. As evidenced by CoinDesk\'s State of Bitcoin Q2 report, many major banks have already come out in favor of blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, the development should have a particular resonance, as this news cycle is starting to bear similarities to last year\'s furor around the adoption of bitcoin as an e-commerce payment option by merchants such as Overstock and Expedia.\n\nThough these announcements were heralded as major milestones, 2015 has seen a dramatic decline in the number of big brand merchants accepting, or even publicly speaking about, bitcoin and its use as a currency.\n\nThe development perhaps hints that despite the increase in attention from banks, real developments at major enterprise financial institutions may still be years away.\n\nMan sleeping with newspaper via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

She had the time of her life. But the surprising difficulty we had with money and banks got me thinking, once again, about the huge potential of crypto-currencies.\n\nSeveral months ago, our daughter told us she would need a bank-issued debit card for her trip. Other friends, however, said a prepaid Visa or MasterCard, purchased at CVS or Walgreen’s, would work just as well. I made some jokes about traveler’s checks — so old-school — and assumed our friends were correct. So a couple days before her trip I loaded prepaid Visa and American Express cards with several hundred dollars. But when I got home, I realized that despite my attempt to read the fine print at the store, the cards might not work internationally.\n\nMy wife did a little more research and found that “Green Dot” cards work internationally. So she took the cards I had purchased, found a retailer of Green Dot cards, and bought new cards. Upon opening the package and reading the instructions after returning home, however, we found that these were temporary Green Dot cards, which would probably not work internationally. It would take several weeks to activate a fully operational Green Dot card.\n\nOur daughter was leaving the next morning, however, and so we gave her cash and told her we’d figure out other ways to send her money. Our next step was to get in touch with the (much more conscientious) parents of a friend traveling with her. We were able to load money onto this friend’s debit card. And for a week it seemed to work just fine. Our daughter was able to make purchases and get euros. ... Until, that is, a French ATM machine ate the friend’s debit card. Luckily, the girls had enough cash for the return trip. But they never did get the card back.\n\nYes, we could have saved a lot of trouble by listening to our daughter the first time. We should have just ordered a bank-issued debit card several weeks before the travel date. But we didn’t. I’ve traveled a good bit internationally and have always had good luck using my own debit and credit cards. It never occurred to me that in 2015 simple international banking and payment card transactions could be so cumbersome.\n\nWhich gets us back to crypto-currencies, like bitcoin. As a decentralized platform of distributed trust, bitcoin has the potential to alleviate many of these headaches of our more-centralized payment system, which is based on banks, payment networks, and national laws and regulations. Bitcoin does not depend on this complex web of firms and laws. I know there are reasons — some good reasons — why payment cards don’t work like cash. I’ve written about the big problem of payment card fraud. Often times, the price of protecting against fraud is lost simplicity. Well-intentioned national and international regulations, meanwhile, often end up reducing the consumer friendliness of these financial platforms. Anti-money laundering laws, for example, may stop a few criminals from serious offenses. But often times the criminals find ways around the laws, and the systems set up to catch the bad guys end up making life more difficult for regular people. Our little story demonstrates that the global system of money and payments is not keeping up with rest of the frictionless digital economy.\n\nCrypto-currencies offer a solution to this problem. Bitcoin is universal and largely frictionless as self-contained platform. It knows no national boundaries. My bitcoin wallet can interact with other bitcoin wallets, whether I am in Chicago or Singapore — and the same goes for my counterparty. We don’t have to depend on the relationships among an American payment card network, a French bank, a Japanese consumer, and an Indian monetary authority. No central authority needs to approve my bitcoin wallet for international travel. Bitcoin is already, of course, finding a chief use as a remittance platform for developing nations.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin has its own limitations as money. It is not remotely universal, nor is it frictionless in its interaction with the rest of the economy. Yes, if I can find a solitary bitcoin ATM in Paris, I might be able to get some euros. But how many stores in the eastern foothills of France, where my daughter was traveling, accept bitcoin today? Bitcoin’s price volatility is also a demerit. Bitcoin backers are confident its volatility will decline over time, but we don’t yet know how the story will play out. We are still trying to figure out how to reduce the volatility of sovereign currencies that have been around for hundreds of years. And there is no consensus, even among economists, about what stable value is or whether currencies should be fixed or float against one another.\n\nBitcoin’s strength is as a decentralized platform that mimics, and improves upon, the traditional debit-credit ledger function of banks. This virtue is not — not yet, anyway — matched by the other virtues of a truly useful money: as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.\n\nRegardless, bitcoin (and blockchain technology more generally) has solved some fundamental problems of information in a decentralized, complex world. And it highlights some of the unneeded and frustrating obstacles of our current monetary and financial platforms. If nothing else, it could spur monetary and financial incumbents — and policymakers and regulators — to improve their game. As Jamie Dimon just told his JPMorgan shareholders, in a warning about complacency, “Silicon Valley is coming.”', 'Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik has proposed increasing bitcoin\'s block size limit to 2MB.\n\nBlocks – which are created every 10 minutes – currently hold only 1MB of transactions each. However, if the bitcoin network is to scale competitively it will need to exceed the three to seven transactions per second it currently supports.\n\nWith the 1MB limit looking to be reached within the next few months, Garzik says his proposal, BIP 102, is an emergency \'fallback\' if consensus among bitcoin\'s stakeholders is not reached.\n\n""If we can find a more complete solution, yes, by all means, let\'s throw BIP 102 in the trash,"" the developer told Reddit.\n\nGavin Andresen first proposed to increase the block size to 20MB earlier this year. The idea has since sparked a highly politicised debate among fellow core developers and the wider community.\n\nWhile some think the limited space for transactions in each block will create a market for fees, others have warned doing nothing could disrupt the robustness of – and people\'s trust in – bitcoin.', 'In mid-June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law HB 483, paving the way for Texas to repatriate $1 billion in gold from an underground vault in Manhattan operated by HSBC bank, bringing it home to be stored in a yet-to-be-built Texas Bullion Depository, reports HNGN, which also speculated whether this is the first step in Texas’ plan to secede. The gold is owned by the University of Texas’ endowment fund.\n\n“Today I signed HB 483 to provide a secure facility for the State of Texas, state agencies and Texas citizens to store gold bullion and other precious metals,”Abbott said in an official statement in June. “With the passage of this bill, the Texas Bullion Depository will become the first state-level facility of its kind in the nation, increasing the security and stability of our gold reserves and keeping taxpayer funds from leaving Texas to pay for fees to store gold in facilities outside our state.”\n\nRep. Giovanni Capriglione, the author and sponsor of the bill, recently appeared on the Trunews talk show to speak with host Rick Wiles about what the legislation could mean for Texas.\n\n“The really interesting part about this depository, which hasn’t been getting a lot of press,” said Capriglione as reported by Texas Observer, is that “with this depository, private individuals and entities will be able to purchase goods, and will be able to use assets in the vault the same way you’d be able to use cash.”\n\nThe Texas Bullion Depository – basically a private currency backed by gold just like old-time currencies – is, according to the show host, “the biggest threat in 102 years to the Federal Reserve System.” Capriglione agrees that it could very well make the Federal Reserve System unnecessary.\n\n“The federal government can sue all they want, and I hope they don’t because I think they will lose,” said Capriglione in June, adding that Texas is on good solid legal ground to create the depository and operate it as stated in the bill. “There is a motto in the office of almost every state legislator in Texas, and it’s a flag that we have [from the Texas Revolution], it’s below a cannon and what the motto says is, ‘Come and Take It’,” he said.\n\nSome observers read this story as an example of extreme anti-federal libertarianism and relate it to questionable political positions on other issues. On the other hand, as recent events in Europe show, many people throughout the world don’t trust their governments much and want to explore alternative forms of economy, including, of course, bitcoin.\n\nIn reply to a question on the possibility of “a Texas-style bitcoin,” Capriglione said “OK! That would be awesome, too. I personally own bitcoin. You could make transactions with bitcoin, use the gold depository as a medium, and then make payments on the other side.”\n\nIt isn’t clear what that means exactly. The concept of bitcoin backed by gold doesn’t seem to make too much sense, however, several alternative digital currencies that are backed in gold do exist. Instead, it seems likely that Capriglione refers to the possibility of using bitcoin to purchase gold held in the Texas Bullion Depository, and to sell the gold back for bitcoin.', 'The web wallet service Snapcard has partnered with Ifeelgoods, a company that facilitates reward programs for companies with large customer bases such as Walmart and McDonald’s.

Others shrugged and shook their heads because it was news to them. But most people interviewed were wary of the idea of virtual money, even if they do use debit and credit cards every day.\n\nOne patron said that he\'s used bitcoins for the past three years to buy everything from marijuana to supplements and was excited to hear about the installation inside the smoke shop.\n\n""You feel a lot safer when you\'re using bitcoins,"" said Jae ""The Hybrid"" White, 33, of Jersey City.\n\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency that was created about seven years ago and its value fluctuates with supply and demand. A bitcoin currently trades for roughly $300. The virtual money can be used to purchase things all over the world, but finding sellers who accept it is the key.\n\nThe currency has been criticized because it\'s an easy way to buy and sell black-market items like drugs and weapons under the radar.\n\n""I personally don\'t use bitcoin,"" said Monir Khillah, 27, a New Jersey City University journalism student. He said he knew people who use websites like Reddit and Tumblr and are into ""that internet culture"" also use bitcoin, but he was wary about the currency\'s safety.\n\n""I just pay cash and that\'s it,"" said Mylanda Lee, 42, and a Jersey City resident. Neither she nor her friend, Maria Corporan, 29, had heard of bitcoin.\n\nA couple who walked into the smoke shop around 4 p.m. shrugged and shook their heads when the topic of bitcoin was brought up.\n\n""I only do cash,"" said the male who didn\'t want to be named.\n\nA woman cashing her checks at a Money Gram, a money transfer company, just a few stores away from the smoke shop said she had heard about bitcoin but didn\'t know much about it.\n\n""I\'ve never used that before,"" said Kareenah Evans, a Jersey City resident.

Having gained considerably during the end of last week and especially throughout Sunday’s European session, the bitcoin price has declined at a consistent rate throughout the majority of this week, and – while we thought we may get some reprieve heading into the weekend – action on Thursday night and early Friday morning has simply compounded the recent bearish momentum and brought us to trade pretty much at the levels we were looking at pre-gains last weekend. We have managed to enter according to our intraday breakout strategy couple of times – and have drawn a few downside profits – but in the grand scheme of things, we would rather be looking to the upside. So, with this said, what are the levels that we are keeping an eye on in today’s European session, and will we finally see some upside momentum returns as we head into this weekend? Take a quick look at the chart.\n\nAs you see from the chart, action overnight has brought the bitcoin price to trade at what now serves as intraday lows and in term support at 272.28, around 7:30 AM this morning (GMT). From this level, we have corrected slightly to trade around current levels (275 flat – or thereabouts) and 279.05 will bring us in term resistance during today’s session.\n\nWe will initially look for a break of 279.05 to validate a medium-term upside target of 284.52. On this trade, a stop loss somewhere around 277 flat will help us to maintain a positive risk reward profile on the trade, whilst keeping just about enough room for us to avoid a chop out in the event that we turn around to trade within range during the day.\n\nLooking the other way, if we get some further bearish momentum, a break below 272.28 would validate 268 flat as a short-term downside target.\n\nCharts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

07/18/2015,"[""A very common question from new and current bitcoin owners alike is “What bitcoin wallet is best?” The answers to this are as varied as the needs and functionality desired of each user. One size does not fit all, and this article will cover the necessary steps that need to be considered when creating and maintaining a bitcoin wallet.\n\nBasic security measures\n\nStart with the basics. Do you want to use a popular online wallet like Blockchain.info, which controls your private keys? This increases the potential for you to fall prey to a mass hacker. More people use Blockchain.info than any other wallet, with millions of accounts already created, but they have not proven immune to hacking of these wallets.\n\nOr do you want to use a downloadable wallet or app that may need periodic updating, but may provide more security in exchange for some convenience from an online ready wallet?\n\nCheck to see if the wallet offers its own internal data encryption measures and two-factor authorization, like requiring a password and a separate code for access that can be kept online or offline, or can be emailed to you upon entry.\n\nWhere are your private keys?\n\nThe holder of the keys is the owner of the bitcoins. Just ask those unfortunate souls who lost their shirts in the Mt. Gox collapse. Holding your own private key is always the best move, no matter how trustworthy someone else may seem. Owning a bitcoin wallet is a constant struggle between convenience and security. Don’t cut corners here. Hold onto your private keys!\n\nMulti-Signature\n\nOne of the many great security innovations Bitcoin has wrought is multi-signature, or multi-sig, which didn’t exist before a couple of years ago. It is most practical for long-term, offline storage applications and requires more than one person or entity to authorize a transaction, so it is not terribly practical for a daily Bitcoin user.\n\nIf there are three keys, and you only have one, and two keys are needed to create a transaction, the chances for theft drop dramatically.\n\nOne can be kept with a friend or relative, and one in a safe deposit box or vault offline. Probably best if you save some bitcoins in one wallet long-term like a “cold wallet.” However, it’s best not to keep all of your bitcoins in one wallet anyway.\n\nOpen-Source Wallet Code\n\nWallet companies may ask you for information to be compliant and you should do the same. Is the wallet code open-source, like the wallet from Coinomi? This is becoming increasingly common, but it’s best to always check.\n\nIn other words, you want a fully transparent operation to work with and not some company operating as a frontman while subcontracting to another wallet that you don’t know anything about. You need to know how they do business, and who they are really protecting.\n\nHD Wallets\n\nAn HD wallet stands for Hierarchical Deterministic and this gives the ability to obtain a new public key address every time funds come in, dramatically enhancing security. Most wallets just provide one just address, making the user easy to track the more the wallet is used. This is a great option to have if you prefer not to leave to many footprints on the internet.\n\nIdentity Protection vs. Compliance\n\nSome people are more compliant than others. Giving your information out online carries its own risks, and more and more wallet providers are asking for personal information of bitcoin wallet owners to be compliant with government regulators.\n\nThis covers the wallet providers, but makes the owner easier to track, tax, hack from a centralized database, etc. You must decide if you want to make life easier for a wallet provider and regulators or do you want more anonymity with your bitcoin transactions.\n\nLocation, Location, Location\n\nDo you roll with the NSA or FSB in your country? Where you are in the world and how heavily regulated the area is important. Some places have never heard or recognized Bitcoin and will give your free reign over your bitcoin, while others are scheming on how to suppress it or tax it to pay national debts.\n\nIf the wallet provider is in the wrong country, your bitcoin could be subject to confiscation by domestic authorities or tracking of your transactions, hiding behind the guise of thwarting “terrorist activities.” You may want to think long-term about how you handle where you live versus where you do bitcoin transactions.\n\nEase of use\n\nSecurity and ease of use have generally been mutually exclusive so far in the bitcoin wallet world. Generally, the easier a wallet is to use, the less security it has attached to it, but this is improving, slowly.\n\nDo you need to download multiple gigabytes of the Blockchain? Do you just need it for your smartphone, because you can get one specifically made for iOS or Android. You can set up multiple passcodes for entry to the wallet and to perform any transaction.\n\nLet's say you left your smartphone with 5 BTC at a bar, and your phone doesn’t have a passcode set on it when it falls into a sleep mode. Someone could pick up your phone and access your wallet if it doesn’t have a passcode. You should have another passcode to perform a transaction, not just when checking your balance.\n\nYou’ll Want a Backup\n\nOne great thing about digital currency and wallets are that they’re just digital computer files, like pictures. You can copy them and keep them in multiple places, but maybe your wallet gets a virus or some unknown glitch that destroys it.\n\nDoes your wallet provider offer a service to backup your wallet? Is it encrypted? MultiBit HD offers these features automatically for users. Can you set how often this takes place and how easy is this to use in an emergency?\n\nWhat’s their reputation?\n\nThis is a double-edged sword because the longer a wallet has been around as a brand the more they are targeted by hackers as they acquire more wallets. It is best if you know someone who owns the wallet and can give you the low-down from the inside on how it works and whether it is very useful and secure. The industry is only six years old, so how much are you going to get as far as history?\n\nIf the wallet provider hasn’t been around a long time, see if it is endorsed by people you trust or have them on their board of directors, or as partners. Or have they set up a system well enough where their trust is not required? The idea of digital currency is a trustless, verifiable system of transactions, so removing a third party from your wallet transactions altogether is always optimal.\n\nSo what’s the best wallet?\n\nRecently, the top leading wallets were ranked for security, effectiveness and convenience, including 38 separate privacy tests for each wallet. As of May 19, 2015, Dark Wallet and Armory took the top spots in the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP).\n\nMore popular names like Blockchain and Coinbase took the bottom of survey results. Scoring 54 points out of 100 was enough to be ranked #1 overall, while Coinbase received just 11 points. This proves there is still a long way to go before the Bitcoin wallet has been perfected, but innovative wallet alternatives like Airbitz, Trezor and Case Wallet are moving in the right direction.\n\nChances are slim that you'll find every single security and convenience feature listed here in one wallet, but if you can get the majority of them, move forward. Wallets are adding new features all the time, and new options are hitting the market as we speak. If your provider doesn’t have something you want or need, let them know. They won’t add it if they don’t know you want it. If you don't trust your wallet and don't like using it, use this checklist to get what you need today."", ""Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik has submitted a proposal to raise the block size limit from 1MB to 2MB. The proposal is intended to buy more time to reach a consensus on a more durable solution before the maximum amount of transactions on the Bitcoin network is reached.\n\nAs the debate on a possible raise of the block size limit has been raging for months – years even – without consensus on a durable solution within sight, Garzik has proposed to adapt a temporary solution. This new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), named BIP 102, holds that the Bitcoin block size limit be doubled on November 11 of this year. If adopted, it should take longer before the maximum capacity of transactions on the Bitcoin network is reached.\n\nGarzik does emphasize, however, that he still hopes his own BIP 100 will eventually be adopted. BIP 100 proposes to install a dynamic block size limit, the size of which would determined by the mining community. On GitHub, Garzik wrote:\n\n“This is an alternative to BIP 100, as a fallback if other consensus is not reached. It allows for limited experimentation to explore a size increase without going overboard. But it's not flexible, probably requires another hard fork, and still is an arbitrary [economic] policy not informed by the market, so inferior to BIP 100 [...] However, having a minimum-agreed backup plan is better than no plan at all.”\n\n- Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik\n\nRaising the block-size limit has been a controversial issue for several years. Satoshi Nakamoto originally intended it to be a temporary measure in 2011 to prevent spam, but several developers and other prominent Bitcoiners now believe a limit on the block size may actually be much needed. They believe such a limit safeguards the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and provides a long-term incentive for miners to secure the network.\n\nWhile it seems that most developers currently agree that the block size at its current limit of one megabyte is too small, consensus over how exactly to move forward is still lacking. This has recently even led to former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen to shift his efforts to Bitcoin XT in order to allow for bigger blocks through a controversial fork.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to Jeff Garzik, but had received no response at time of publication."", 'Two of the industries most historically owned by the government are now venture capital targets—money and spaceships. According to Mattermark data analyzed by Tomasz Tunguz of the venture capital firm Redpoint, bitcoin and space travel were two of the four fastest-growing areas for startup investment in the past three years.\n\nThe seven fastest-growing investment areas have seen funding levels double every year on average since 2012, according to this data.\n\nHowever for some of these, it’s partially a result of the level of investment in those areas. Bitcoin-related startups received just 0.18% of all startup funding in the last 12 months, and space travel just less than 1%. Mathematically, it’s “easier” to grow fast when investment is low.\n\nLooking at the list this way, it’s easy to see that dollar-for-dollar, hospitality related startups—like Airbnb—and transportation startups—like Uber—have collected an outsized share of investment, while also collecting huge sums.\n\nSpace travel is shown in this data to have captured a similar amount of investment as food and beverage startups such as Blue Bottle Coffee, and Blue Apron. Bitcoin startups have received substantially more than drone startups, but substantially less than those involved with photo sharing.', 'BlockCypher provides Bitcoin wallet services to larger organizations such as exchanges and payment providers. During the recent fracas of “dust” transactions crowding the Bitcoin network, one of their larger clients, Erik Voorhees’ ShapeShift.io, suffered a double-spend attack amounting to 2.6 BTC.\n\nThe biggest offering of BlockCypher is what they call a “Confidence Factor” which basically means what it sounds like – if the processor is reasonably sure (as in more than 99%) that a double-spend will not be attempted, the transaction is processed with zero confirmations. BlockCypher describes their method like so:\n\nIn simpler terms, if an unconfirmed transaction returns a confidence factor of 99.9%, then our data says there’s a 0.1% chance that an attempted double-spend will succeed. By design, we’re conservative. Even when we return 90% confidence, the likelihood of a successful double-spend is significantly lower than 10%.\n\nThe ability to do fast transactions is crucial to a business like ShapeShift, which offers instant conversions between cryptocurrencies. The technology is useful to Bitnet, the payment processor that has made several strategic partnerships in the last few months, not the least of which was with Cardinal Commerce, one of the bigger payment providers on the globe. Their ability to process transactions quickly and seamlessly is critical to their business model, and so it is no surprise that they have integrated BlockCypher’s Confidence Factor as well.\n\nMore Than 100,000 Double-Spend Attempts\n\nAlthough vague as to how it occurred, a representative of BlockCypher, Josh Cincinnati, has published an insightful blog explaining that the attack vector used to execute the double-spend has already been patched. By successively implementing improvements to their algorithm after any successful attack, Cincinnati says, the company has systematically improved the likelihood that zero-confirmation transactions passed through will not wind up double-spent. He writes:\n\nIn fact, we’ve witnessed dozens of different kinds of double-spend attempts, some successful, some not. All those cases — this one included — provide useful lessons that iteratively improve our Confidence Factor. […] 99.989% of double-spend attempts were against transactions with less than 90% Confidence, and even fewer were successful. Our Confidence Factor, even with a low threshold of 90%, does an excellent job of filtering the most problematic and risky transactions.\n\nHe says that there were more than 100,000 double-spend attempts on the network during the same period as the ShapeShift double-spend, but of those, only 11 were targeted at transactions that BlockCypher’s Confidence Factor had rated more than 90%. In large enough quantities and if successful, these could have been very damaging, but they were not successful. Out of all these attempts, the post illustrates, only one was successful, and it had nothing to do with Bitcoin being broken.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""The proof-of-work concept was the original innovative idea that allowed decentralized cryptocurrencies to emerge. It allows network nodes to reach consensus on which version of the blockchain should be considered correct. However, since Satoshi implemented it in Bitcoin, a great number of new algorithms have been created, giving birth to numerous cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe brief history of all popular proof-of-work algorithms and their peculiarities was covered in the recent Bytecoin blog post by Ray Patterson, titled “The Proof-of-Work in Cryptocurrencies: Brief History.” The overview starts with the prerequisites that led to the invention of the concept and proceeds by explaining the motivation behind and the background of each popular algorithm in the market.\n\nThe author argues that the rationale for introducing each new proof of work was to diminish ASIC share, decentralize mining and promote the coin among ordinary PC users. He writes:\n\n“Naturally, we could try to explain it by a common grudge or by a wish to 'make a fast buck': there were forks, pre-mines and pump'n'dumps before Tenebrix. But the arguments provided by supporters of the ‘ASIC-resistant’ functions are rational.”\n\nPatterson explains sophisticated terms and tendencies in a clear and witty manner. The article covers in layman’s language the exact algorithms of a number of popular cryptocurrencies, such as scrypt, X11, Momentum, Primecoin’s prime numbers, CryptoNight and others. It goes into detail about how exactly these proof-of-work functions work, what led to their popularity, and how the mining industry historically responded by providing GPU and ASIC miners for them. The blog post also provides an overview of certain exotic deviations. It says:\n\n“Due to different marketing techniques some SHA-3 finalists became popular as solo-versions. For instance, Keccak itself, being SHA-3. It is quite clear: ‘SHA-2, improved!’ That is, there was no specific concept for ASIC resistance, except the one that developing and starting production takes at least a year. On the other hand, we have a real, brand-new modern standard! A special Skeincoin appeared as well, using (according to its name) Skein algorithm (must have been Bruce Schneier's fans).”\n\nIt is yet unclear whether cryptocurrencies based on proof of work can at some point be overtaken by other solutions, such as proof of stake, proof of burn, and others. However, it seems that the market is still mostly following its pioneer, Bitcoin, in the arms race for the hash rate.\n\n- Illustration by Ryan Etter"", ""Following the July 10 DDOS and CC attacks at OKCoin, the topic of socialized losses and the negative impact they have on trader’s accounts has come to light again. On Friday, OKCoin announced a 55% socialized loss on the futures contract for Litecoin.\n\n“Above all kinds of attacks, the toughest challenge is defending DDoS attacks.” — Zhou Minghao, Huobi Director of Security\n\nLast year BitVC suffered losses of 47% — and quite a backlash as a result. Generally these incidents occur because of the massive speed and volatility of the price dump. A “system loss” results, caused by high leverage and low liquidity.\n\nIt’s important to note liquidations are not market orders. So when the price moves excessively and the DDOS attacks occur, many traders do not have access to the website. Their positions get margin-called as limit orders and it causes severe losses which are exacerbated by a selling stampede.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nThe sequence of events went like this:\n\nA user opened a large long position. When the price goes down, this position will lose money. Eventually the position gets margin-called, so the system needs to liquidate the position by placing a short order in the market. Usually the closing order is filled in the market and everything is fine. However, in a volatile market where there isn’t a lot of liquidity (due to DDOS and CC attacks, among other reasons), there’s no one to buy at certain prices and the order doesn’t get filled. Since this order doesn’t get filled, the long position is still open and will experience a huge loss. Since the accounts aren’t liquidated successfully due to no counterparty, the price keeps going down, and the losses pile up, to a point where traders owe more than their trade was worth. All the trades together become “the system loss,” including the traders who profit. The exchange then has to ask the person who profited to share the loss with everyone else on the settlement day at a certain percentage. In this case it turned out to be a 55% loss, leaving even those who profited to be margin-called.\n\nAs a result, OKCoin has agreed to partly compensate users who couldn’t access the website during the DDOS attack. This, however, does not cover the 54% share of the socialized losses. The first 1,000 BTC of OKCoin’s compensation comes from their fund of risk provisions. The other 1,000 is coming from the clawback — in other words, the remaining assets in customers accounts after liquidation.\n\nThe chart below shows the event that occurred.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nCointelegraph spoke with two senior executives at Huobi — Wang Huaiqiang, Senior Operating Director of Trading, and Zhou Minghao, Huobi’s Director of Security — as well as another representative from the international team. We discussed lessons learned from their own problems with socialized losses on BitVC last year, new enhancements they’ve added to BitVC, and their risk-control methodology.\n\n“First, we established a risk reserve system, of which Huobi is the first company in the business to do so.” — Wang Huaiqiang\n\nCoinTelegraph: What did Huobi learn after the incident last year?\n\nWang Huaiqiang: In terms of BTC futures, BitVC came up with three steps for improvement.\n\nFirstly, an exchange platform should be responsible for its users. According to our analysis, a large amount of system loss is caused by highly leveraged trading and lack of liquidity. Compared to bitcoin, litecoin futures trading has higher risks. Under that circumstance, we adjust the maximum leverage level of bitcoin futures trading season contract from X20 down to X10. Then, because of high price volatility of LTC futures trading, BitVC decided not to provide LTC futures trading service any more. Moreover?BitVC reduced the liquidation risks from 90% to 85% and introduced a leading system of automatic counterparty deleveraging to manage forced liquidations.\n\nFirst, we established a risk reserve system, of which Huobi is the first company in the business to do so. We put 20% of BitVC’s service fee income into this risk reserve, prioritizing to compensate our users’ loss caused by system losses. There are some other exchange platforms coming up with similar strategies after us.\n\nSecond, all the liquidated accounts during that period and the trading status of each order in the market are totally opened to the public.\n\nThird, even though the cause of system loss is the market risks, we would like to cordially return the full amount of each user‘s share of socialized loss in the form of waiving the service fee in the future.\n\nNow, the most leading automatic counterparty deleveraging system created by BitVC has solved the problem of system loss thoroughly.\n\n“While [socialized losses have] succeeded in preventing insolvency during periods of extreme volatility, as it was designed to do, it has also been unpopular with many users. Now we have designed an alternative.” — Wang Huaiqiang\n\nCT: Does Huobi still use socialized losses? If not, how is BitVC different now?\n\nWang Huaiqiang: The automatic counterparty deleveraging system has solved the problem. Detailed information about this system is as follows.\n\nIn order to offer high-leverage bitcoin futures trading while managing systemic risk, BitVC has used a system of proportionally allocating systemic losses from forced liquidations at contract settlement time. This is commonly referred to as socialized losses. While this system has succeeded in preventing insolvency during periods of extreme volatility, as it was designed to do, it has also been unpopular with many users. Now we have designed an alternative which will eliminate the need for socialized losses.\n\nBitVC introduced a new method of managing forced liquidations — automatic counterparty deleveraging. When a trader's dynamic equity falls to the forced liquidation trigger level, the system automatically closes his position.\n\nHowever, during periods of extreme market volatility, there may be insufficient counterparty buy or sell orders in the order book, resulting in a failure to complete the forced liquidation at the target price and a negative account balance. Under the socialized loss system, these negative account balances were covered by deducting the cumulative negative amount proportionally from profits at contract settlement time. Under the new system, if a forced liquidation occurs and there are insufficient counterparty orders to close the position, the system will automatically reduce the leverage of open counterparty positions to ensure that the liquidation order can be filled at the target price, thus preventing negative balances.\n\n“A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. It does a lot of damage when the price is volatile.” — Zhou Minghao\n\nCT: What are the main threats to an exchange and how have you prepared for such incidents?\n\nZhou Minghao: The biggest threat is a cyber attack. Above all kinds of attacks, the toughest challenge is defending DDoS attacks. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. It does a lot of damage when the price is volatile. We have deals with the leading technology companies who ward off these types of attacks.\n\nCT: Talk more about your security. Do you use multisig? What percent is in a cold wallet? Why and when did you implement this?\n\nZhou Minghao: Yes, we use multisignature to reserve most bitcoins. 98% of bitcoins are in cold wallets. By multisig, we could do a double check when authorizing transactions. It is a good practice to avoid single point risk. We make use of the core concept of defense-in-depth to design our system.\n\nBesides multisig wallets, we set up many measures to make our system work securely without integrity of one server or one employee. Most of them have been achieved last year, and they are being improved continuously according to the Deming circle theory.\n\nCT: Can you talk about new features on BitVC and what's different from last year?\n\nWang Huaiqiang: Besides introducing automatic counterparty deleveraging, BitVC never stops improving the product, aiming to perfect with practical functionalities. The Split account function has helped enhance traders’ ability to control risk and close out large positions easily (see also here). Adding BTC-USD spot trading provided more options for our users (see also here). Enabling transfer between BitVC, Huobi and BitYes offered a much more convenient way of asset management between accounts under Huobi brand (see also here).\n\nCT: Anything else Huobi would like to highlight?\n\nHuobi Representative: Huobi believes that an exchange platform should be responsible and secure for all of its users. We also believe professionalism, security and customer service come before the pursuit of profits, so we urge our customers and potential customers to give us feedback on how we can enhance our product suite. We respect our customers, and their opinions matter most to us. Only by improving the product and having a customer-first attitude can we push the progress of the industry in a positive direction."", 'For Kosta Peric, overcoming finance\'s last mile means looking for ways to do so from the ground up.\n\nAs deputy director of the Financial Services for the Poor initiative for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Peric is the forefront of the organization’s efforts to build what he calls a digital financial system that, if successful, would connect everyone to financial services.\n\nInclusion isn’t simply a matter of opening the door to products such as microloans or insurance policies geared toward low-income families and individuals, he said in a new interview with CoinDesk. Rather, inclusion means creating channels of financial support during times when people need it the most.\n\n“These include challenging shocks like debts, death in the family or some expense that has to be taken care of,” Peric said. “Having access to an affordable and secure, reliable financial system is very important.”\n\nAs part of its efforts, the Gates Foundation is working in a number of African and Asian countries to foster the development of digital money systems, with the overarching goal of building interconnected webs of finance that enable poor households to connect with the wider global financial system.\n\nIt’s within this context that Peric and others at the Foundation see the blockchain playing a powerful role.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“The very powerful thing about bitcoin in general and specially the technologies behind it, is they are essentially leapfrogging all the technology and providing a new system for processing these huge amounts of transactions for very small costs.”\n\nThe organization recently published materials for the Level One Project, an umbrella initiative for the Foundation’s various development projects around the world.\n\nThe goal, according to Peric, is to spur local private stakeholders, government agencies and everyday people to support the creation of interoperable financial pipelines.\n\nNew channels for old problems\n\nAs part of its broad research efforts, the Foundation has looked closely at how blockchain technology can be implemented to make such networks fast, simple and secure – characteristics that Peric said would align it with existing money systems like M-Pesa in Kenya and bKash in Bangladesh.\n\nAs outlined on the Level One Project website, the blockchain, within the context of the Foundation\'s work, could theoretically be used to provide a crucial means of settlement between payment systems being established in developing economies.\n\nThe site notes the blockchain can be ""used as an alternative to current transaction switching and settlement models. In theory, it could also be used to lower the costs of providing these functions"".\n\nThis fits in with what Peric described as a need for a system that can is capable of supporting large amounts of small transactions, which are typically the norm for value amounts sent by people in developing nations.\n\n""What we try to foster is national systems that are, essentially connecting providers together in an interoperable system that can reach out to the entire population and can serve huge amounts of small value transactions every day,"" he continued. ""That\'s the primary goal we are trying to achieve.""\n\nBitcoin\'s utility\n\nPeric has said in the past that he is far more interested in bitcoin the technology versus its use as an alternative currency.\n\nWhen asked in interview whether his view has evolved on this question, he cited the work of the Foundation in developing digital financial systems and looking for ways to utilize innovative technologies for doing so.\n\nCiting feedback from individuals in some of the countries that Foundation works in, Peric says that bitcoin can\'t quite meet the needs of those regional because people in those countries are accustomed to using local currency.\n\nHe explained:\n\n""You receive your salary in your national currency so you can pay your schools, the bills for your house, in your national currency. So that\'s what is most required at this moment, and that\'s where bitcoin the currency cannot really help right now.""\n\nHowever, he went on to clarify that bitcoin ""can help in other contexts like international remittances, international money flows"".\n\nInvesting in the future\n\nPeric has said that the key to jumpstarting financial inclusion isn\'t simply a matter of throwing money at an idea or providing support for a particular project. Most important, he said, is fostering self-sustaining ideas that can continue to grow as support mechanisms subside.\n\n""We can help bootstrap the system, to get it over, until the scale works, so that at the end of the day, the providers have a valuable and profitable business case to bring this forward and their systems become self-sustainable,"" he said.\n\nIn conversation, Peric touched on the recent awarding of a $100,000 grant to Bitsoko, a Nairobi-based digital currency startup that focuses on payments and wallet provision, as part of the Foundation\'s Grand Challenges Exploration (GCE) initiative.\n\nPeric framed the grant as one component of the Foundation\'s broader efforts to support innovation and entrepreneurship in developing companies, reiterating how the organization sees financial inclusion growing out of a diverse ecosystem of initiatives rather than one central effort or another.\n\nThis, he suggested, means providing grants to startups and initiatives that can contribute to that broader goal of bringing financial tools and services to developing communities.\n\n""I don’t want to leave any stone unturned,"" he said.\n\nKosta Peric is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.

Such a paradigm shift could change the global economy as we know it, and Ascribe.io is on the front lines.\n\nAscribe.io is working to help usher art into the digital age with blockchain-based authentication for digital projects. The company has been in production since February 2015, beta since fall 2014, and alpha since late 2013.\n\nThe startup has been working closely with artists, galleries, museums, conferences and others in the art ecosystem. Artists have used the Ascribe platform in various ways. MAK Vienna, a 150 year-old art institution, purchased a piece of blockchain-ascribed digital art by artist Harm van den Dorpel.\n\nArtists have used Ascribe.io to try to re-imagine the true potential of digital art: Bitforms NYC sold ascribed digital work by artist Jonathan Monaghan. Cointemporary is an online art gallery that has also sold blockchain-ascribed digital art for bitcoins. The artwork featured by that website is by artists Valentin Ruhry, Harm van den Dorpel and Dan Periovschi, among others. The Berlin Art Prize saw 349 artists ascribe 598 art works to the block chain.\n\nAscribe’s open-sourced ownership protocol can be viewed here. The company employs in-house art experts and copyright lawyers. The firm supports the basics of supporting, registering and transferring ownership, as well as the essential ownership actions such as consignment and loans. Indeed, the first blockchain secured digital art ownership swap was with Ascribe.\n\n“We love how people are finding new ways to use the Ascribe platform. It makes sense that people will want to transfer, swap and share digital property,” Bruce Pon, founder and CEO at ascribe GmbH, tells CCN.\n\nAscribe.io recently made a seed funding announcement with top investors Earlybird (Germany), Digital Currency Group (USA) and Freelands Ventures (UK). Earlybird is Germany’s premiere VC, and Digital Currency Group has invested in over 50 bitcoin startups around the globe. Ascribe plans to use the funding to continue winning over users and building out their platform, and has released a white paper on ownership using the blockchain with one of the original architects of the internet, David Holtzman. Holtzman ran the DNS of the late 1990’s.\n\n“We use the blockchain as a notary to timestamp the registration of a file or digital asset,” Pon tells CCN. “The blockchain supports copyright practices by giving immutable proof of the existence of a digital work the moment it’s ascribed on our platform.”\n\n“We think that it should be easier for creators to license and commercialize their digital IP,” he adds. “There’s a huge amount of latent value in digital content that is waiting to be unlocked. More and more value is moving digital – and we are all becoming creators – so it’s important to solve.”\n\nAscribe.io would love to see digital marketplaces spring up to give creators more options to market and sell their work. The Ascribe.io team also believes creators should be able to define unique editions to create digital scarcity and incentivize buyers to pay for authentic content.\n\n“We’d love to have banks and insurance companies to consider digital IP as an asset class, that can be banked and used as collateral,” Pon says.\n\nWe think that anyone should be able to do this, not just big corporations with teams of lawyers.\n\nChris Messina posted about Ascribe.io on Product Hunt. Many companies are using Product Hunt as a launchpad, including rapper Snoop Dogg. “Investors use it to look for promising companies, and consumers look for interesting products there – so it’s nice to be profiled and to finish in the top 10 for that day,” Pon says. Pon has interesting insights into recent Adobe stock news regarding sales channels in Photoshop.\n\n“It opens up the concept that you can conceive, design and then sell your intellectual property directly out of the software,” he tells CCN. “I think Adobe is prescient in seeing that intellectual property can be more effectively commercialized if creators are given the tools and channels to do it. Ascribe is complimentary. If we can integrate into Adobe’s software, we can also support the IP registration, handle the license management and give visibility on where it gets used.”\n\nNot only has the Ascribe.io team looked to solve this problem. For example, entrepreneur and artist Stephan Vogler’s novel block chain technology inspired license seeks to create a system of rights to copyrighted works in digital form.\n\n“Copyright is frustratingly localized, yet we live in a digital world where ideas are global and spread at the speed of light,” Pon says. “Ideas can be perfectly copied and instantaneously transmitted – and copyright hasn’t kept up. We need to give creators more tools to globally register, set license terms and gain visibility on their intellectual property.” Ultimately, the point is to put money in the pockets of the content creators.\n\nPeople need to see that for everything they make – a photo, a song, an article – easier copyright and licensing can open up new ways to earn money.\n\nThe answer to unlocking this potential is to decentralize, according to Pon, who believes that Bitcoin will rewrite daily life for people all across the globe. “Decentralization opens up so many opportunities to rethink the way we register intellectual property, process payments, store private data, and run our governments,” Pon opines.\n\n“It’s an innovation that allows us to simplify transactions across borders but at the same time has the flexibility to handle complex contracts and conditions. It’s an elegant solution that is going to bring massive changes to our society,” Pon says. Ascribe.io’s goal for the future is to spread the word and let people know that they can claim and control their intellectual property.\n\n“There’s a lot of work to be done,” he adds.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'New York State Department of Financial Services has recently released a 31 page application for anyone who wants to engage in doing business with virtual currencies. The application is a convoluted and cumbersome to say the least. But most of all it is costly. If the objective was to create an entry barrier, then mission accomplished!\n\nIf an OpenSim grid owner uses Bitcoin-based currency only to buy or sell goods or services then there is no need to register.\n\nBut if someone stores virtual currency on behalf of someone else, then yes absolutely, they need to, or if a person is running a grid and wants and creates their own version of a Bitcoin-based currency — especially if the owner creates that currency for use exclusively on his own grid. Then they must register with both New York State and federal regulatory authorities.\n\nIf the grid accepts Bitcoin payments for another fictional virtual currency, that is a more complicated question. If the fictional currency cannot be redeemed for cash then no, there is no need to register. If the fictional currency is something like the Linden Dollar used to be, where it could be easily converted back to real currency, then yes, registration is necessary.\n\nPotential costs\n\nFor starters, the BitLicense application fee itself is a whopping $5,000. But that is not the only thing bitlicense applicant will have to shell out the money for. Any BitLicense applicant will have to post a surety bond or set money aside in the trust account.\n\nThe decision on the amount of surety bond or trust account is left to the applicant. However the BitLicense application calls for an applicant to justify how the proposed sum will be sufficient for the protection of the customer. Implicit in that language is the notion that if New York deems the amount insufficient, the application can and will be denied.\n\nAnother potential source of costs for a potential BitLicense applicant is under “Information Regarding Financial Statements.” This subheading calls the applicant to provide DFS with audited financial statements prepared by an independent certified public accountant. These documents can be potentially costly.\n\nBackground information\n\nThe BitLicense application requires every applicant to provide a list of other businesses – including in different states; current and former litigation; bankruptcy proceedings as well as myriad of financial liabilities for owners and directors.\n\nBefore the application can be submitted, any potential applicant must already be registered with FinCEN – a federal regulator. (If the reader wants to know who must register with FinCEN, read here)\n\nBesides registration with FinCEN, any applicant must have Anti-Money Laundering policies and procedures that meet the guidelines provided by the Bank Secrecy Act. The applicant is directed to submit written policies and procedure along with the application.\n\nIn conclusion, the application process is quite complicated overall, but with that said not surprising. It will be interesting to see how the industry adjusts to this developing regulatory landscape', 'Despachos de abogados, restaurantes, cafeterías, tiendas de ropa y hasta un hotel. Son algunos de los negocios de la zona madrileña de Serrano que ya utilizan bitcoin, la principal divisa electrónica, en sus transacciones cotidianas.\n\n“Queremos dar esa imagen de que estamos al día en cuanto a los avances en todo lo relacionado con nuestro sector”, afirma Carlos Serra, socio administrador de la marca de ropa patria Scotta1985, que comenzó a aceptar pagos en bitcoin en 2014 al poco de abrir su primera tienda en el barrio de Salamanca.\n\nLa idea vino de un grupo de entusiastas de la divisa electrónica que a lo largo del año pasado convencieron a más de una veintena de establecimientos para hacer de Serrano la primera ‘Calle Bitcoin’ de España -y la más larga de Europa durante un breve periodo. Desde la presentación de la iniciativa el pasado octubre, el número de negocios colaboradores no ha dejado de multiplicarse.\n\n“No queríamos más que demostrar que era fácil y se podía”, asegura Félix Moreno, uno de los organizadores de la iniciativa y apasionado de las criptomonedas. “Sabemos que no hay suficientes usuarios de bitcoin en España como para que esto les reportara a los establecimientos muchísimos clientes”, dice, aunque afirma que “hay afición”.\n\nLa razón por la que se escogió la zona de Serrano radica en que allí se encuentra el Instituto de Empresa, que apoyó el proyecto, y el Instituto de Estudios Bursátiles, además de ser una zona turística donde ya existía algún negocio que utilizaba bitcoin, afirma Moreno.\n\n“Es una apuesta por la tecnología”, dice Enrique de Solís, socio de la cadena hotelera One Shot, cuyo hotel en la zona permite gestionar reservas con divisa electrónica además de contar con un cajero bitcoin. “No hay mucho movimiento de cara sobre todo al español, que todavía tiene un poco de miedo… Siempre lo vemos más en clientes americanos o de otros países”. De Solís indica que es más común entre los españoles utilizar el cajero que realizar reservas y que en todos los casos el ‘cliente bitcoin’ es un gran amante de la tecnología.\n\nUna imagen de la calle de Serrano, con la Puerta de Alcalá al fondo. (EFE)\n\nUn reciente informe de la agencia de viajes Destinia ilustra que los viajeros que usan bitcoin gastan un 49% más que los que usan tarjeta de crédito, convirtiendo a este colectivo en un objetivo jugoso para la industria turística.\n\nBitcoin es la moneda digital más extendida hoy en día. Nació en el año 2009 de las manos de un desarrollador (o desarrolladores) oculto bajo el pseudónimo Satoshi Nakamoto. Es una divisa descentralizada -no la emite un banco central- y muchos la comparan al oro, ya que es un recurso limitado. Solo pueden existir 21 millones y actualmente hay más de 14 millones en circulación, según datos de Blockchain.info. Las nuevas bitcoins se generan ‘minando’, un complejo proceso computacional. Su valor en el mercado es muy volátil. Este sábado una bitcoin valía en torno a 250 euros.\n\nDesde marzo, en España el bitcoin se considera como un objeto de pago, y por lo tanto está exento de IVA.\n\nLos establecimientos convierten los ingresos en bitcoins a euros por medio de un procesador de pagos, ya que el valor de las bitcoins es de gran volatilidad\n\nPoco antes de que la Dirección General de Tributos tomase esta decisión, Alberto Gómez, CEO de la startup española Coinffeine, la primera del mundo en constituirse en bitcoins, visitó el Congreso para hablar sobre la divisa digital y la legislación española. Su empresa ha patrocinado el proyecto ‘Calle Bitcoin’ de Madrid.\n\n“Se les propuso [a los negocios] que aceptasen este medio de pago porque no suponía nada para ellos”, afirma Gómez. “Ellos no reciben bitcoins, sino que reciben euros directamente en su cuenta bancaria si así lo desean”.\n\nLos establecimientos consultados por este diario convierten inmediatamente los ingresos en bitcoins a euros por medio de un procesador de pagos, ya que el valor de las bitcoins en el mercado es de gran volatilidad. Físicamente, la tecnología bitcoin permite al usuario pagar desde su móvil a través de una aplicación.\n\n“Para el comerciante, aceptar un pago con tarjeta de crédito sí que implica una pequeña comisión y con bitcoin no existe”, explica Gómez. De esta manera, las transacciones en bitcoin no implican comisiones -tampoco los procesadores de pagos las cobran- y permiten al consumidor proteger su identidad de una forma similar al efectivo.\n\nRespecto a importancia de la divisa electrónica en el futuro, Gómez sentencia: “creo que bitcoin es lo más parecido al internet de nuestros días”.']"
07/19/2015,"['As global banks are increasingly experimenting with the blockchain to search for possible use-cases that they can implement in its existing banking systems, CoinTelegraph has compiled a list of some of the most notable banking giants experimenting with Bitcoin’s underlying technology.\n\nSome of the world’s most prominent banks including Citibank are even trying to create their own blockchain to facilitate transactions and settlements quickly. The following list will explore which big banks are closely studying and developing interesting use-cases for the blockchain.\n\nSantander Bank\n\nSantander Bank, the world’s 10th biggest bank has found over 25 possible use-cases of the blockchain that could be implemented to traditional banking systems. Santander has also co-authored report in which they discovered that the integration of the blockchain technology could eliminate up to US$20 billion of banking costs.\n\nDBS Bank\n\nDBS bank, a Singaporean bank with around US$9 billion annual income hosted a blockchain hackathon sponsored by IBM back in May. The hackathon offered US$33,000 in cash prizes and was sponsored by Startupbootcamp, Infocomm Investments, Coin Republic, and Ideator. Through the hackathon, the bank wanted to find use-cases of the blockchain technology that could help the unbanked and could optimize current banking systems.\n\nBBVA\n\nBanco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., (BBVA) a multinational Spanish banking group with over 21 billion Euros in annual income participated in one of the largest investments in the bitcoin industry - Coinbase’s US$75 million series C funding round. One of the main reasons for the investment was for the bank to become familiar with the blockchain technology.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nArguably the most passionate supporter of the blockchain technology in the banking sector has been Goldman Sachs, as the bank led a US$50 million funding round for Circle Inc., earlier this may. The bank has also been keen on searching for applications of the blockchain technology that could transform trading, which could be used in the stock market.\n\nBarclays\n\nBarclays, a British multinational banking and financial services company has launched a startup accelerator called Barclays Accelerator dedicated for fintech and blockchain related startups. By incubating Safello, Atlas Card, and Blocktraces, the bank will explore use-cases of the blockchain technology that could change and transform traditional banking systems.\n\nLHV Bank\n\nEstonia’s LHV bank has been experimenting with blockchain technology using colored coins, bitcoin-based certificates of deposit. After exploring different blockchains, the bank has concluded their research, stating “The Bitcoin blockchain is the oldest, most tested and secure [public-key cryptography], and hence suitable for our current applications.”\n\nWhile many other banks are looking into different blockchains or even thinking of building their own, LHV bank is “utilizing existing reliable components” of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBank of New York Mellon\n\nThe bank of New York Mellon has been trying to integrate bitcoin’s p2p model into their own client-server systems. The bank has also launched their own BK Coins, which is used internally by their staff and employees.\n\nCBW Bank\n\nCBW Bank, a Kansas based community bank partnered with Ripple in 2014 to become one of the first banks to use the Ripple protocol to enable instantaneous transactions “between customers and the network of Ripple gateways using the protocol.” This integration enables CBW bank customers to receive payments in real-time.\n\nWestpac, and Commonwealth Bank of Australia\n\nWestpac and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, two of the largest banks in Australia, have also partnered with Ripple Labs to incorporate the blockchain technology into their systems. While Westpac has integrated the Ripple protocol to track down transactions and settlements, Commonwealth Bank of Australia is trying to implement the Ripple protocol to settle international payments quickly.', 'Bitcoin payments processor Bitnet has launched a new tool that allows merchants to mitigate the risk of accepting bitcoin payments without confirmations. The new “Instant Approval” service applies data provided by blockchain web service company BlockCypher to determine if a transaction is safe to accept.\n\nBecause of how the Bitcoin network is designed, bitcoin payments cannot be fully trusted until they have been confirmed by miners and included in at least one block, while waiting up to six blocks is advised. But since this can sometimes take more than an hour, it makes Bitcoin a less-than-perfect payments system. Bitnet, therefore, has now introduced its Instant Approval tool to solve this problem to a large extent. Seamus Cushley, VP Product at Bitnet, said:\n\n“One of the biggest challenges for merchants wanting to accept bitcoin is how to accommodate the delayed confirmation times into their ‘real-time’ checkout flows and still be assured of being funded. […] We partnered with BlockCypher to provide key data for our ‘Instant Approval’ service due to their best-in-class metrics and enterprise service.”\n\nTogether with BlockCypher, Bitnet analyzes all ongoing transactions on the Bitcoin network. Taking into account factors such as the amount of fees paid and the propagation speed, the payment processing company believes it can calculate the probability that a bitcoin transaction will actually confirm on the blockchain. Importantly, Bitnet takes on the financial liability for that estimation as well, so that a merchant won\'t be at risk of double spends.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Bitnet\'s Chief Commercial Officer Akif Khan explained:\n\n""Most transactions propagate across the bitcoin network with predictable speed, if this is not the case it means that the transaction is being rejected by some peers or nodes. This rejection is typically the result of the peer believing that the transaction is non-standard.""\n\nBitnet made headlines in October of last year for raising US14$ million in an investment round. The payment processor\'s most notable partnership to date has been with Universal Air Travel Plan (UATP), a global payment solution for the airline industry.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to Bitnet, but received no response before time of publication.', 'Bitcoin exchange Kraken (Payward, Inc.) has announced a reduction in Bitcoin trading fees, along with a new model that rewards its users who provide liquidity to the exchange with even bigger savings, which they call a “maker taker” model.\n\nThe company announced the new rates in a blog post, stating that the change comes by popular demand since many clients had told them they would like to see a maker taker model with reduced fees overall.\n\nAccording to Kraken, under the maker taker model, reduced fees are applied to market “makers” who provide liquidity to the market “takers.”\n\nThe maker fee applies when a user adds liquidity to the Kraken order book by placing a limit buy below market price or a limit sell above market price. The maker fee is paid only when such orders are taken by new incoming orders.\n\nThe taker fee applies when a user removes liquidity from the Kraken order book by placing a market or limit order that executes immediately against a limit order already on the book.\n\nAll advanced orders on their exchange platform trigger either market or limit orders and the triggered market or limit order will be maker or taker.\n\nThe advantages of the new system are said to be that traders adding liquidity to the book will benefit from the reduced maker fee, on top of the overall reduced fees Kraken has now introduced. Although takers pay a little more than makers (0.10 percent more), takers still benefit from the reduced overall fee structure, as well as the extra 0.10 percent more also being offset by (in theory anyway) deeper liquidity and tighter spreads that the model is expected to provide.\n\nAppealing idea for regular traders\n\nFees under the new scheme vary (see the image to the right,) with the maker fee going as low as 0 percent and up to 0.16 percent depending on the amount that a user trades. The taker fee ranges from 0.10 percent up to 0.26 percent, again depending on the amount that is being traded.\n\nOverall Kraken has dropped their general rates, which will further make its service even more competitive than it already is, but to regular traders, in particular, the maker taker model is highly appealing as it not only embeds further discounts, but its encouragement of increased liquidity on the Kraken exchange can only be a positive in terms of the amount of trades available, particularly compared to smaller exchanges that often do struggle from the amount of traders, due to liquidity of the overall exchange, available.\n\nThe new maker taker fee structure starts on Kraken August 1.', 'CoinTelegraph recently learned that the United States military is considering using Bitcoin tipping as a platform for providing bounties in combat and terrorist hot zones. The relative anonymity that the blockchain provides and the cost-cutting nature of crowdsourcing are the driving forces behind the scheme.\n\nEarlier this year, in February, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) released the Advance Planning Briefing for Industry (APBI), which forecasted its funding requirements for Fiscal Year 2016 and advertised solicitations, or government “bids,” using a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).\n\nBid R3962 contained a solicitation for the Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats (IW/ET) group. The bid was entitled “Micropayment-Enabled Gamified Civil Reporting In Conflict Zones” and states that the CTTSO is looking for someone to:\n\n“Develop an operational concept and application that enables civilians in conflict zones or at-risk areas to be rewarded in near real-time with ‘tip-sized’ amounts of virtual currencies, or other stores of value.”\n\nWhile the announcement makes no mention of Bitcoin, it does mention the blockchain, which is the worldwide immutable public ledger that Bitcoin utilizes. The announcement says:\n\n“The current approach [of paying sources for information] is costly and labor intensive to manage. It fails to realize the potential to dramatically increase the volume and precision of reporting possible through crowdsourcing applications, particularly when they are combined with ‘rewards’ owing to the breakthrough in payment processing afforded by blockchain technology.”\n\nCTTSO is taking a cue from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk human marketplace, which posts bounties for Human Intelligence Tasks or HITs. As NPR recently explained:\n\n“People around the world race to perform those tasks, sometimes for pennies, [...] ’street-level’ community information […] — for cents rather than thousands of dollars.”\n\nFor instance, right now there are approximately US$362 million dollars worth of bounties listed at the Department of State’s Rewards for Justice program. According to reporting by Kathy Gilsinan for the Atlantic, bounty values are determined by the Secretary of State based on the “perceived threat a given terrorist poses to U.S. people or property.”\n\nGilsinan notes, however, that some — such as Alex Tabarrok, a professor of economics at George Mason University — believe the government should be increasing the amounts of bounties, rather than decreasing them, as suggested by the CTTSO proposal. Tabarrok said:\n\n“We could’ve put a bounty on bin Laden’s head in 2001 of, let’s say, $500 million [rather than US$25 million ...]. Instead we chose, no, we’re going to spend something like a trillion dollars invading Afghanistan, and then we’re going to be there for now over 10 years, and this is going to cost so many U.S. lives.”\n\n- Alex Tabarrok\n\nI don’t believe the professor considered using Bitcoin or another decentralized currency to pay for bounties, however, which opens up the number of bounty hunters exponentially. This includes those who don’t have banks accounts and even those that who do, who might be putting themselves at risk by claiming a cash reward.\n\nGilsinan also notes that Robert Grenier, the CIA station chief in Islamabad, explained that, historically:\n\n“Some of the speculation in the past has been […] that these are folks who can understand having a new Toyota Land Cruiser or 50 head of sheep, but $25 million is just like an abstraction, it doesn’t resonate with them.”\n\nScott Stewart wrote in Stratfor Security Weekly that the rewards used to be much smaller. He said:\n\n“The rewards initially offered by the program were much smaller, up to $500,000. That amount was increased to $1 million in 1990, and then augmented to $2 million total through matching funds provided by the Air Transport Association and the Air Line Pilots Association. The program gained the ability to offer large payments for figures such as al-Zawahiri under the 2001 Patriot Act, which was passed after the 9/11 attacks.”\n\nHe said further:\n\n“There is a general distrust of the U.S. government in the parts of the world where most of the critical suspects are hiding — places like Lebanon and Pakistan. Individuals who might otherwise be induced by the cash rewards do not trust the U.S. intention or capability to protect them or their extended families. This protection would be required against reprisal not only from the terrorist group but also from the government itself.”\n\nThis is a particularly important consideration. While the BAA solicitation notes that the “largely telephone-based approach can present risk of exposure to the ‘tipper,’ potentially reducing the effectiveness of such programs” it implies that Bitcoin-based systems do not have the same risks.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may have provided anonymity in its early days because there weren’t any sophisticated government surveillance systems built to trace transactions, time (and adoption) has shown these systems have been implemented.\n\nThe government has proven itself as a privacy advocate through TOR, which “was originally designed, implemented, and deployed as a third-generation onion routing project of the United States Naval Research Laboratory [...] for protecting government communications,” and provided funding from 2006 through 2010.\n\nThis is the same government, however, that surveils its own citizens and was rumored to have “broken TOR” in the Silk Road investigation.\n\nThat said, there is an incentive for the military to obfuscate who they are sending funds to. It would then be possible to send bounties to actors who might otherwise raise an eyebrow or two. OFAC notwithstanding, truly anonymous payments could be made to persons that were previously incompatible for rewards under similar programs.\n\nThe Bitcoin founder(s) who used TOR to introduce the cryptocurrency to the world has thus far remained anonymous. It remains to be seen if our bounty hunters will be afforded the same level of privacy.\n\nBid R3962 should be awarded sometime this October.\n\nNo word yet if ChangeTip, a leader in Bitcoin tipping, “building a micropayments infrastructure for giving and generosity on the Internet,” has responded to the solicitation.', 'Benedict Mander in Buenos Aires JULY 19, 2015 13 Soledad Rodríguez Pons admits she had no idea what bitcoin was when it was suggested to her two years ago that the digital currency could provide a neat way of dodging Argentina’s strict capital controls. “I was suspicious at first,” says the 29-year-old owner of a budget hostel in Buenos Aires. “But I took the risk, and it was well worth it,” she adds, explaining that she takes credit-card payments from foreign tourists in return for the digital currency. At the moment, she can sell her bitcoins on Argentina’s unofficial currency market for 50 per cent more than she would get at the official exchange rate. The prolonged use of capital controls in Argentina since 2011 has wreaked havoc for businesses operating in South America’s second-largest economy — not only restricting access to foreign currency and leading to a heavily overvalued official exchange rate, but also exacerbating economic stagnation and double-digit inflation. Under the leftist government of President Cristina Fernández, no immediate change is expected in Argentina’s complicated economic conditions, which have seen the use of bitcoin more than double over the past year, mainly among small businesses. This represents much faster growth than elsewhere in Latin America, according to bitex.la, a regional bitcoin exchange. Recent raids on currency trading houses and new powers for the national spy agency to prevent speculative attacks pushed the peso’s black market value this week to its lowest levels since Argentina defaulted last year on its foreign debt for the second time this century. Greek woe brings powerful sense of déjà vu for Argentina On a cruise round the Mediterranean, Domingo Cavallo, Argentina’s economy minister in the run-up to the country’s dramatic economic collapse in 2001, was bemused when he was unable to use his credit card during a brief stop-off on Greek soil last week. Continue reading However, presidential elections in October are expected to bring in a more market-friendly administration, and investors hope that untangling capital controls will be one of the top priorities for the new government. That has triggered a heated debate over how to defuse a situation that has caused an investment drought in Argentina. “As always happens with such controls, it is much more complicated getting rid of them than it is putting them in place,” says José Luis Espert, an Argentine economist. The two leading candidates advocate sharply differing methods. Daniel Scioli, the one-armed governor of Buenos Aires province backed by Ms Fernández, favours a more gradual approach, although there is growing concern that his government ties will limit his room for manoeuvre. Mauricio Macri, the centre-right mayor of the city of Buenos Aires, backed by the markets, prefers a more immediate solution. Although Mr Espert also recommends a swift removal of capital controls, he says it must be accompanied by a “technically solid economic plan” that inspires strong confidence in the markets. “Without a credible plan, shock treatment can be just as damaging as a more gradual approach,” he warns. José Urtubey, vice-president of the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), a powerful business chamber, doubts that shock therapy will work. Although capital controls played a big part in a 2.6 per cent contraction in Argentina’s industrial sector last year — foreign currency is essential to import materials needed for industrial production — he fears that central bank reserves could not withstand the pressure on the currency generated by the controls’ sudden removal. “The remedy could be worse than the illness,” he says. As always happens with such controls, it is much more complicated getting rid of them than it is putting them in place José Luis Espert, Argentine economist Such resistance to change explains why Mr Espert believes that Argentina’s volatile economy has for the past half century been stuck in a “vicious triangle”, whose vertices are crisis, followed by a rebound and then mediocrity — which every decade or so leads to another crisis. “Soon there will be another one,” he says, pointing to a lack of consensus over how to fix the country’s serious macroeconomic imbalances, especially a gaping fiscal deficit, which he fears will lead to more mediocrity. “Argentina finds it very difficult to escape that triangle. We are afflicted by a kind of [economic] Stockholm syndrome,” he says. If the future of Argentina’s economy is as gloomy as Mr Espert fears, that would be good news for bitcoin, which is still in its infancy in Argentina, with only about 6,000-8,000 users. Franco Daniel Amati, a co-founder of Bitcoin Argentina, a kind of embassy for bitcoin in the heart of the Buenos Aires financial district, is optimistic about prospects for the digital currency in a country where still only half the population entrust their money to the formal banking system. “A recurring inflation crisis, capital controls and overall financial repression make life very difficult in Argentina. More and more people here are looking for ways to get around these problems, and bitcoin is the perfect solution,” he says.

Global Insight S Korea grapples with legal contradiction presented by ‘chaebols’ While other countries fret over banks that are too big to fail, South Korea is grappling with the concept of systemically important human beings.  Continue reading Shareholders in building company Samsung C&T on Friday approved its acquisition by family controlled affiliate Cheil Industries, a key step in shoring up heir apparent Lee Jae-yong’s position within the Samsung group’s opaque circular shareholding structure. But Elliott’s attempt to block the deal failed by just 3 per cent of votes cast — the closest any foreign fund has come to a defeat of management at a major South Korean group. This came as a shock to those who had assumed the chaebols’ elaborate shareholding structures made them invulnerable. “Even if Elliott has failed, I think there will be more to come,” says Lee Wonil, founder of Seoul-based hedge fund Zebra Investment Management. “There is too much money in US activist funds\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and one of the main targets for them will be Korea, because the valuations are extremely cheap and the corporate governance is the worst among OECD [the Paris-based group that aims to promote sustainable growth] countries.” Elliott was not the first foreign activist fund to try its luck in South Korea: Dubai-based Sovereign Asset Management and US raider Carl Icahn both pursued high-profile campaigns in the past 12 years. But Elliott’s Samsung campaign was bolstered by extensive support from overseas investors, who have become increasingly assertive against a perceived lack of accountability among the chaebols’ controlling families. Some saw this problem exemplified by a takeover that appeared to undervalue Samsung C&T while benefiting Mr Lee, Cheil’s biggest shareholder. The struggle followed a similarly controversial event in September, when Hyundai Motor Group announced that it was spending $10bn on land for a new headquarters in Seoul — triple the plot’s appraised value. Investors condemned it as a vanity purchase driven by group chairman Chung Mong-koo, and knocked a combined Won8.4tn ($7.3bn) off the market capitalisation of the three companies funding the deal — Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and Hyundai Mobis — on the day it was unveiled. Stung by the criticism, Hyundai responded by setting up a board-level committee to protect minority shareholders — unprecedented at a big South Korean group — and increasing its dividend 50 per cent for last year. Other major companies such as Samsung Electronics and LG Display have also raised their payouts by a similar proportion. Yet South Korea’s dividend payout ratio remains far lower than those in most major markets, and investors remain sceptical that there has been a deeper shift. “There’s a lot of tinkering around the edges, but it’s all still business as usual,” says one senior asset manager in Seoul. “If the chairman issues instructions, no one challenges that.” In seeking to defend the status quo, the chaebol can rely on widespread fear of economic disruption caused by short-term focused foreign funds — a major theme in domestic media coverage of the Samsung C&T debate. By strengthening defensive attitudes to foreign investors, Elliott’s campaign may even result in a setback for shareholder rights in South Korea, says Lee Ji-soo, head of the Law and Business Research Centre The campaign prompted the proposal in parliament of measures to protect against activist funds, such as the legalisation of dual-class share structures and “poison pill” defences, he notes. South Korean corporate governance campaigners took another blow last week when President Park Geun-hye said she would consider pardoning several jailed chaebol leaders in the interests of economic growth — a controversial practice under her predecessor from which she had previously distanced herself. Yet her government has taken steps to shake up long-established chaebol practices, from restrictions on circular shareholding structures to tax penalties for cash hoarding. Samsung’s founding family strengthens grip on group Hedge fund Elliott loses fight against takeover by Cheil Continue reading Legislators are pushing for more radical measures, such as a law that would confiscate corporate stakes acquired through breach of trust by executives — a measure openly aimed at Mr Lee, whose Won2.5tn stake in software company Samsung SDS was ruled in 2009 to have been bought through an illegal convertible bond sale. The public entity with the key role in the Samsung C & T struggle, however, was the National Pension Service — the biggest investor in that company and in the country as a whole, with more than $400bn under management. The NPS has taken stands against chaebol management: it opposed the re-election of two Hyundai Motor Group company directors over the Seoul land purchase and last month voted against the merger of two SK Group companies. But the fund, which holds big stakes in both companies, cast the deciding vote in favour of the Samsung C&T-Cheil merger, angering critics who accused it of wasting an opportunity to stand up for governance standards. Samsung: welcome to South Korea As activist Elliott has found out, the big guy always wins Continue reading Elliott, which has a history of pursuing drawn-out legal battles, is continuing to try to block the merger in court and has taken stakes in two Samsung businesses that hold shares in Samsung C&T, which could enable it to sue their directors. While the odds are low that Elliott can derail the takeover, the prospect of further investor rebellion could restrict Samsung’s options in its efforts to strengthen Mr Lee’s position, say analysts at Bernstein. Market speculation has raged about an all-share takeover by Samsung Electronics of Samsung SDS, Mr Lee’s second-biggest holding. Such a deal would allow him a tax-efficient way to boost his shareholding in the group flagship. But it would be dilutive to Samsung Electronics shareholders, who could block it with just 20 per cent opposition under South Korea’s small merger laws — a threat that looms larger after Friday’s close result. “We’re not against family control; some of the best companies in the world are family controlled,” says Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets. “But it should be proportional to the amount of shares that the family has and intercompany dealings should be fair.” Controversial takeover of Samsung C&T Play video Fund chief is determined and persistent He may have been demonised by some in South Korea as a foreign vulture, writes Stephen Foley in New York. But for Paul Singer that just goes with the territory. The founder of Elliott Associates is determined to bring western corporate governance standards to the Lee family’s sprawling empire — and by extension to the chaebol system. Speaking before Friday’s vote, Mr Singer told the Delivering Alpha conference in New York that the Cheil-Samsung C&T situation was an opportunity for South Korea to prove it is “a rule of law place”. It is a theme he has pounded in other situations, including his pursuits of sovereign governments who renege on obligations to bondholders. And the narrowness of his hedge fund’s apparent legal options in South Korea may not deter him from continuing the fight, as anyone who followed Elliott’s 14-year pursuit of the Argentine government will suspect. The fund pursued Buenos Aires through the domestic and US courts, ultimately securing American court victories that forced the Argentine government to the negotiating table. The Elliott team spent this weekend considering its next move in South Korea, having said after last week’s vote of Samsung C&T shareholders that it “reserves all options at its disposal”. It has also appealed to the South Korean supreme court to grant an injunction against the takeover, something lower courts refused to do.', 'The Fed’s Confusion Over the ""Natural Rate"" of Unemployment and Inflation\n\nIn May, the US unemployment rate stood at 5.5 percent against the rate of 5.3 percent for the “natural unemployment,” also known as the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU).\n\nAccording to the popular view, once the actual unemployment rate falls to below the NAIRU, or the natural unemployment rate, the rate of inflation tends to accelerate and economic activity becomes overheated. (This acceleration in the rate of inflation takes place through increases in the demand for goods and services. It also lifts the demand for workers and puts pressure on wages, reinforcing the growth in inflation).\n\nBy this way of thinking, the central bank must step in and lift interest rates to prevent the rate of inflation from getting out of control.\n\nRecently however, some experts have raised the possibility that the natural unemployment rate is likely to be much lower than the government official estimate of 5.3 percent. In fact, earlier this year, economists at the Chicago Fed argued that the natural unemployment rate since October last year has fallen to 4.3 percent.\n\nThe reasons for this decline are demographic changes and an increase in the level of education. (The natural unemployment rate tends to fall, so it is held, with the rising age of the labor force and with its education.)\n\nExperts are of the view that these factors should continue to lower the natural unemployment rate for at least the remainder of the decade.\n\nIt is held that a lower natural rate may help explain why wage inflation and price inflation remain low, despite the actual unemployment rate recently reaching 5.5 percent.\n\nAdvocates for a lower natural rate also claim a lower rate would mean the Fed can keep interest rates lower for longer without worrying about lifting the rate of inflation.\n\nWhy NAIRU Is an Arbitrary Measure\n\nThe NAIRU however, is an arbitrary measure; it is derived from a statistical correlation between changes in the consumer price index and the unemployment rate. What matters here for Fed economists and others is whether the theory “works” (i.e., whether it can predict the future rate of increases in the consumer price index).\n\nThis way of thinking doesn’t consider whether a theory corresponds to reality. Here we have a framework, which implies that “anything goes” as long as one can make accurate predictions.\n\nThe purpose of a theory however is to present the facts of reality in a simplified form. A theory has to originate from reality and not from some arbitrary idea that is based on a statistical correlation.\n\nIf “anything goes,” then we could find by means of statistical methods all sorts of formulas that could serve as forecasting devices.\n\nFor example, let us assume that high correlation has been established between the income of Mr. Jones and the rate of growth in the consumer price index — the higher the rate of increase of Mr. Jones’s income, the higher the rate of increase in the consumer price index.\n\nTherefore we could easily conclude that in order to exercise control over the rate of inflation the central bank must carefully watch and control the rate of increases in Mr. Jones’s income. The absurdity of this example matches that of the NAIRU framework.\n\nInflation Is Not Caused by Increased Economic Activity\n\nContrary to mainstream thinking, strong economic activity as such doesn’t cause a general rise in the prices of goods and services and economic overheating labeled as inflation.\n\nRegardless of the rate of unemployment, as long as every increase in expenditure is supported by production, no overheating can occur.\n\nThe overheating emerges once expenditure is rising without the backup of production — for instance, when the money stock is increasing. Once money increases, it generates an exchange of nothing for something, or consumption without preceding production, which leads to the erosion of real wealth.\n\nAs a rule, rises in the money stock are followed by rises in the prices of goods and services.\n\nPrices are another name for the amount of money that people spend on goods they buy.\n\nIf the amount of money in an economy increases while the number of goods remains unchanged more money will be spent on the given number of goods i.e., prices will increase.\n\nConversely, if the stock of money remains unchanged it is not possible to spend more on all the goods and services; hence no general rise in prices is possible. By the same logic, in a growing economy with a growing number of goods and an unchanged money stock, prices will fall.\n\nFrank Shostak is an adjunct scholar of the Mises Institute and a frequent contributor to Mises.org.

They have some valid points. US GDP, to date, has underperformed most modern recoveries. Corporate revenues have been soft lately due to the USD’s bull market. Interest rates are at historical lows and can only go higher, eventually. Record corporate stock buy backs have been helping to drive the stock market higher. Nearly everywhere you look Central Bankers are increasing their balance sheets by buying debt, and stocks in some cases. And, there are bubbles forming in the Bond market, Biotech, and Social media sectors.\n\nThe solution, it appears, to fill the void created by the private sector’s failure to service its debt during 2008, was to create more public debt. Which the FED, in the US, promptly bought as it increased its balance sheet. During the past few years corporations started using the bond market to finance their stock buy backs. This increase in debt, both public and corporate, has many concerned. Can the solution to a debt crisis be creating more debt? A strategy that certainly does not work in the private sector.\n\nWhen we look back at the 130 year documented history of the US stock market, we can quantify each and every bull and bear market using OEW. Most of them only lasted a few years. Each of them had their own fundamental problems. Some of the problems proved to be correct, others took longer to unfold than most expected at the time, and many, in the end, did not matter. Throughout this long history there have only been five bull markets to last 5 calendar years or longer. Two lasted five years, 1932-1937 and 2002-2007. One lasted eight years: 1921-1929, and another lasted thirteen years 1987-2000. Notice 5, 8 and 13 years are all Fibonacci numbers. The fifth, of these lengthy bull markets, is currently underway. In calendar years it is in its sixth year, (2009-2015), in months its seventh year (76 months). In fact, as you can tell, it is the third longest bull market in the entire history of the US stock market.\n\nReviewing the four longest completed bull markets we find three of them had a price relationship to each other. During 1932-1937 the bull market rose about 4.75 times its value from the 1932 low. During 1921-1929 the bull market rose about 6.00 times its value from the 1921 low. And, during 1987-2000 the bull market rose about 7.25 times its value from the 1987 low. Notice the increment of rise increased by 1.25, or 125%, as the bull market stretched in years. The bull market we dropped from this comparison, 2002-2007, rose about 1.95 times its value from the 2002 low. Since the current bull market exceeded that level within its first two years, that bull market does not fit into this study.\n\nWhen we review the internal wave structure of the three bull markets that are comparable, we find that two of them, 1921-1929 and 1932-1937, had short first and third waves then an extended fifth wave. Since this bull market has clearly had a short first wave, 2009-2011, and an extended third wave, 2011-2015 so far, it does not look anything like those two bull markets. It actually looks more like the 1987-2000 bull market above: its first, third and fifth waves were 3, 8, and 2 years respectively.\n\nDuring that thirteen year bull market the first wave lasted three years, 1987-1990, and the DOW increased 87% from its 1987 low (see chart below). Then after about a 20% correction in 1990 for the second wave, the long extended third wave was underway. During this bull market the first wave lasted two years, 2009-2011, and the DOW increased 99% from its 2009 low (see chart above). Then after about a 20% correction in 2011 for the second wave, a long extended third wave has been underway. Notice, up to that point, the current bull market has been outperforming the 1987-2000 bull market in price and time. Currently the third wave is in its fourth calendar year, 2011-2015, which has five months to go. From the 2011 low the DOW has gained 76%, despite its choppy activity since 2014.\n\nFour years into the third wave of the comparable 1987-2000 bull market the DOW had gained 71% from its 1990 low (see below). Again the current bull market is outperforming the 1987-2000 bull market in price and time.\n\nWhen we review the internal wave structure of each of the three rising waves during the 1987-2000 bull market, we currently see some comparisons as well. The first wave up took three years, rose 87%, and was a very clean five wave structure. The current bull market’s first wave took only two years, rose 99%, and was a clean five wave structure as well.\n\nThen over the next four years, from the 1990 low, that bull market rose 71% and became quite choppy. The current bull market’s third wave is in its fourth year, has risen 76%, and is also quite choppy.\n\nAfter 1994 concluded, during the 1987-2000 bull market, the subdivisions that occurred from 1990-1994, set the stage for the explosive uptrends into that 1998 third wave high. Interesting, right? Makes one wonder what is in store for this bull market.\n\nOne last comparison before we try to draw some conclusions. Seven calendar years into the 1987-2000 bull market the DOW had gained 148% from its 1987 low. Six calendar years into the current bull market the DOW has gained 184% from its 2009 low, with five months still to go. The current bull market is outperforming that bull market in time and price on every comparison.\n\nDespite some negative fundamentals, and a near tripling in price over the past six years, this market is displaying price/time characteristics relative, or better, than some of the best bull markets in US history. It is already the third longest bull market in history, and should at least match the second longest which is eight years. It continues to outperform, in price and time, the 13 year longest and most explosive, +625%, bull market in history.\n\nBefore we jump to any conclusions there are two lower price levels to consider. And if either is achieved, it would still have been a spectacular bull market. These two levels were noted in paragraph four: a 375% gain (+4.75 from the low) and a 500% gain (+6.00 from the low). The first level equates to DOW 30,500, and the second DOW 38,600.\n\nBut let’s get conservative. The price gain relationship of the three best bull markets in history are: 4.75, 6.00 and 7.25 from their respective lows; or +375%, +500% and +625%. Since there is an increment of 1.25, let’s notch it down one level to 3.50 for this bull market. This suggests the DOW could gain 250%, or hit a level of 22,600 before the bull market ends. This gives us three potential levels going forward: 22,600, 30,500 and 38,600.\n\nWe offer this historical analysis not as a projection as to how high this bull market will go. We offer it to display the possibilities suggested by historical bull markets similar to the current one. Very few, I would imagine, expected the 1920’s bull market to reach the heights that it did at that time. Hardly anyone expected the 1990’s bull market to be the strongest and longest bull market in history. Many were calling for a top every time that bull market paused. Just like today.\n\nLooking ahead we see this bull market probably lasting until at least 2017. Fibonacci number bull markets have occurred every time in the past. Although the sample is small. As for price. We currently have an SPX projection of 2500+ by 2016. This equates to about DOW 21,400+ using the current DOW/SPX price ratio. This is not too far from the most conservative level of DOW 22,600. But still a long way from the minimum historical DOW 30,500 level. However, if it does hit that historical minimum level, or even higher, before this bull market ends, it would not be anything that has not already occurred before. The next few years could prove to be quite interesting. Let’s see what unfolds.\n\nCHARTS: http://stockcharts.com/public/1269446/tenpp\n\nhttps://caldaro.wordpress.com\n\nAfter about 40 years of investing in the markets one learns that the markets are constantly changing, not only in price, but in what drives the markets. In the 1960s, the Nifty Fifty were the leaders of the stock market. In the 1970s, stock selection using Technical Analysis was important, as the market stayed with a trading range for the entire decade. In the 1980s, the market finally broke out of it doldrums, as the DOW broke through 1100 in 1982, and launched the greatest bull market on record.\n\nSharing is an important aspect of a life. Over 100 people have joined our group, from all walks of life, covering twenty three countries across the globe. It's been the most fun I have ever had in the market.

07/20/2015,"['Bitcoin is the fastest growing area of startup investment since mid-2012, a venture capitalist at Redpoint has claimed.\n\nIn his recent analysis of Mattermark data, Tomasz Tunguz noted that investment in bitcoin companies – closely followed by photo sharing and physical storage startups – has grown by 151% in the last three years.\n\nHowever, Tunguz pointed out that bitcoin startups represent a ""minuscule fraction"" of the total invested funds – receiving just 0.18% of the total funding in the last year.\n\nVC investment in the banking industry has only grown by 65% since mid-2012, but the sector received a 1.85% share of the total number of dollars invested in the last twelve months.\n\nRedpoint, which has funded 434 companies to date, offers seed, early and growth stage investment to startups.\n\nTunguz\'s assertions follow the publication of CoinDesk\'s State of Bitcoin Report (SOB) Q2 2015, which found that total VC investment in the digital currency space was on the rise, noting an increase of 21% to $832m.', 'Bitcoin services firm Coins.ph has launched Teller, a mobile app that matches up its customers in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand via the blockchain as a way to facilitate financial services.\n\nTeller users who want to access funds for mobile phone top-ups and remittances, for example, can use the app to find a third-party seller to accept local currency, allowing the buyer to gain access to digital money.\n\nAll transactions are denominated and held in local currency, with Coins.ph using the blockchain as the rails to facilitate the exchange of funds.\n\nCoins.ph CEO Ron Hose indicated that he sees Teller as the next step in the company\'s mission to move money services ""off the financial grid"" in the Philippines. The launch is the latest for the platform, which also offers merchant payment processing and the ability for customers to withdraw bitcoin funds into cash at select bank ATMs.\n\nHose told CoinDesk:\n\n""We’ve been getting really good traction with our existing bills, payment and money transfer services after shifting to using blockchain in the background. We think this is the natural progression as far as being able to reach customers.""\n\nAbra connection\n\nHose further acknowledged that the app bears a similarity to the much-anticipated remittance app Abra.\n\nThough it was launched just four months ago, former Netscape director Bill Barhydt\'s project has already proven to have an outsized influence in the evolution of thought regarding how bitcoin can be used to impact the $435bn remittance industry.\n\nAbra\'s app, which eschews connections to the traditional banking system by turning app users into mobile money exchange kiosks, has been lauded by VCs for its disruptive potential, and at least in the short term, its ability to sidestep onerous remittance regulations.\n\nHowever, Hose sees Teller as a different take on the Abra model, given that Coins.ph provides additional services to local users.\n\n""We are offering a full spectrum of services to the customers, not just remittances,"" Hose said.\n\nBeating the branch\n\nHose sees services like the Teller app becoming increasingly important given that it continues to be costly for traditional banks to service the developing world.\n\nThe argument has gained increasing merit in the industry given that, while many banks and financial institutions seem more eager to leverage decentralized ledgers, bitcoin the currency perhaps remains a compelling use case for reaching customers outside this established system.\n\n""It’s impossible to serve [the unbanked] with branches,"" he continued. ""The costs are too high, even in cities. Think about someone who is earning $200 a month, and has an average balance of $100. The bank will make $3 a year on them, if lucky. The minute that customer walks into a regular branch, the bank is already losing money.""\n\nTo safeguard customers, Coins.ph suggests it will screen app users before allowing them to engage in activities via the app, though it did not provide additional details as to any specifc criteria they would need to meet.\n\nAs with Abra, Teller will employ an Uber-like rating system it believes will reduce the risk of customer dissatisfaction in using the app.\n\nThailand image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He also added that “other directors at Coinsilium have significant experience with AIM listed companies.”\n\nAdditionally, given London’s rising status as a FinTech hub and a US$14.6 million UK government fund pledged for digital currency research, the location of the IPO for this blockchain-focused company does not come as a surprise.\n\nTravia noted the UK’s favorable climate for crypto startups:\n\n“Listing in London was considered due to the British government and institutions positive and progressive attitude to the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem. Thanks to organizations such as Innovate Finance we have been able to spend time talking to regulators, the Bank of England and members of government, so we know that there is a supportive environment in which to list and grow Coinsilium.”\n\nThe company is hoping to take advantage of the increasing interest in blockchain technology, particularly from big banks such as Citi, which has been experimenting with its own version of cryptocurrency dubbed “Citicoin.”\n\n“We don’t have resistance when we talk to investors. They’re curious and interested,” he explained to Business Insider. He continued: ""There is a little of education of course, putting facts and putting news into context regarding blockchain and cryptocurrencies. But the reception has been good and a lot of people are starting to contact us, of course now more than before because we just announced the coming IPO.""\n\nPortfolio Plans\n\nCoinsilium’s portfolio includes other blockchain-focused companies such as Factom, bitSIM, Hive, and SatoshiPay. The company envisions the public listing of these companies on AIM in the future, as it hopes to blaze a trail for blockchain startups IPOs.\n\n“We are opening the way for future IPOs of blockchain startups and we hope to help some of the companies we have invested in to list on AIM in the future,” Travia told CoinTelegraph. “In the near term it means a wider access to professional services and I believe that having one of their shareholders listed on an internationally recognized exchange can help when approaching later stage investors.”\n\nTravia explained, however, that the Coinsilum IPO shares will not be available for purchase to everyone.\n\n“The initial raise is for qualified investors only. However, when the shares are admitted to trading on AIM, then you will be able to purchase through any UK stockbroker,” he said.\n\nIn other words, after the initial offering, anyone will be able to buy shares from a brokerage firm like Scottrade, which includes international investors who have access to a UK stockbroker.\n\nCOIN\n\nMoving forward, Travia believes that the next wave of investment interest in the space will “continue the current diversification in the sectors and industries it touches upon, moving away from a financial/merchant focus to creating solutions for a wide range of industries and economic sectors.”\n\nCoinsilium expects to be listed in August under the ticker COIN. When asked what the difference is between this ticker and Bitcoin Investment Trust’s GBTC, which started publicly trading in late March, Travia replied:\n\n“GBTC value and performance are related to the bitcoin price. Coinsilium is a company operating and investing in the blockchain industry; although its interests include bitcoin-related startups, COIN\'s own performance, its investees\' performances and the company\'s revenues from advisory service provision are not related to the bitcoin price.”\n\nTravia was unable to comment on the expected price range for the IPO.', ""A UK cybersecurity watchdog has issued a warning about new bitcoin ransomware attacks disguised as messages from several government agencies.\n\nAccording to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB), unknown parties have been reported spoofing emails from the UK Home Office and Ministry of Justice, as well as from domestic energy giant British Gas.\n\nThe emails are being used to distribute TorrentLocker, one of a number of malware variants that, when activated, lock up a user's files unless a ransom in bitcoin is paid. A report last year found that the vast majority of TorrentLocker victims opt not to pay.\n\nThe NFIB indicated that malicious attachments as well as links to websites are being used to distributed the ransomware. In some instances, affected users are being prompted to fill in a captcha code after being warned about bills or unspecified legal action.\n\nThe notice further advised potential victims to back up their data and to report any incidents to cybercrime authorities.\n\nSecurity lock on keyboard image via Shutterstock"", 'Attendees of a recent Arcadia Association of REALTORS (AAR) event in California were each given $1 worth of bitcoin as part of a 9th July talk centered on the technology.\n\nThe California-based trade organization offers behind-the-scenes services to real estate agents, including continuing education on subjects relevant in the San Gabriel Valley. The event was the organization\'s first aimed at highlighting bitcoin and its potential use cases in real estate.\n\nAccording to event emcee and Meson.re CEO Ragnar Lifthrasir, the emphasis for his talk at AAR centered on how bitcoin could be used in the lucrative international real estate trade as it relates to California.\n\nWith Meson.re, he said, his business focus is on helping mainland Chinese investors purchase real estate in the US, though Lifthrasir argues the service provides a prime example of how bitcoin could increasingly play a role in the real estate industry at large.\n\nLifthrasir told CoinDesk:\n\n""I think there\'s understanding of the problem and why there\'s a need in China. They immediately got it. There are two ways to buy [now], the black and the gray markets. The black market is you know someone who knows someone and the gray market is I don\'t know how it works but they money gets there.""\n\nUsing these options, Chinese investors purchased $22bn in real estate in 2013, up from $10bn in 2011 and accounting for 25% of all US house acquisitions by foreign buyers. Much of this sales process today involves complicated workarounds that could be simplified with bitcoin.\n\nAs for its part, the AAR felt this use case relevant due to the attractiveness of California real estate to Chinese buyers, though it said it is agnostic on the technology.\n\n""Bitcoin is in the media and in the news,"" AAR CEO Andrew Cooper said. ""We wanted to educate our members on how it\'s being used for real estate so they can have it top of mind if their clients ask for more information.""\n\nTough questions\n\nThe big opportunity, he explained to an audience composed of real estate agents hoping to lure investors from China, lies with a Chinese law that limits wire transfers to $50,000 annually per person, a restriction not currently applied to bitcoin.\n\nLifthrasir noted that his audience was receptive to this broad message, but that he was asked sometimes tough questions about whether bitcoin could serve the needs of potential clients.\n\nFor example, he suggested that one participant asked if bitcoin potentially violated the spirit of the law, and would therefore be only a limited-time option for Chinese buyers.\n\nLifthrasir, however, rebuffed these concerns, noting that bitcoin is being used to circumvent capital controls in Argentina, Greece and other struggling economies.\n\n""I wouldn\'t consider it a gray market, what we\'re doing is legal,"" he explained. ""You can buy as much bitcoin as you want and there\'s no issue with that. We help clients acquire bitcoin and if they want to purchase the property we help them convert that into dollars.""\n\nLifthrasir compared bitcoin favorably to the current system, suggesting that existing alternatives could also be considered loopholes.\n\n""You don\'t have to compare us to perfection, just compare us to the other options,"" he said.\n\nGrowth potential\n\nWhile Lifthrasir isn\'t sure every attendee walked away from the two-hour talk with a solid grasp on the topic of bitcoin, he expressed his optimism it could emerge as a viable solution given recent volatility in the Chinese markets.\n\n""When I left the presentation I was disheartened, a lot of them didn\'t get it,"" he said. ""[But] in the last few weeks we gained interest in what\'s been happening in their stock market, freezing their ability to move in and out of financial instruments.""\n\nPerhaps given this connection, Lifthrasir\'s talk was profiled by Chinese-language news outlets, though its reports also hinted at the confusion of some talk attendees.\n\nMeson.re has not yet facilitated any sales as a result of the event.\n\nStill, AAR\'s Cooper chose to emphasize that the conversation remains useful given that bitcoin is projected to penetrate international commerce and cross-border payments.\n\nCooper went on to suggest that increasing awareness is a solid outcome given that many people simply don\'t understand bitcoin.\n\n""Attendees weren\'t necessarily into purchasing bitcoin on their own but wanted to learn how it would work in real estate,"" he said, concluding:\n\n""The feedback we got was tremendous.""\n\nHong Kong real estate image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

When asked by CoinTelegraph, developers from both sides of the debate were skeptical of the small bump in size.\n\nLong-time critic of raising the block size limit, Peter Todd, remains critical of any raise for now, including a bump to 2MB. Instead, he'd still rather let Bitcoin hit the maximum amount of transactions the network can handle, in order for a fee market to establish. He told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“As it is the development team is working flat out to keep Bitcoin functioning with the current block size. If not for the hard work Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille have put into performance optimizations it's likely the P2P network would have already collapsed under the load. With that in mind, do we really want to undo much of those gains and reduce our safety margin? I personally think at this point in time we're much better letting fees go up a bit and giving the market an incentive to come up with real solutions to scaling Bitcoin.”\n\nOn the other side of the debate, Bitcoinj and Bitcoin XT developer Mike Hearn is still set on raising the block size to at least 8MB, through Bitcoin XT if it must. Speaking to CoinTelegraph, Hearn said:\n\n“Most players already indicated they wanted larger block sizes. I see no reason why 8MB would suddenly hit problems when it was chosen to satisfy Chinese miners, who have very unusual network constraints. Most miners would be fine even with larger blocks.”\n\nAdding:\n\n“[Like Gavin’s initial proposal,] Jeff's latest proposal is also a proposal to raise the block size by changing the consensus rules. I see no reason why it would be acceptable when Gavin's isn't, unless they follow pure personality politics.”\n\nBitcoin Core lead developer Wladimir “wumpus” van der Laan responded slightly more positive to the suggestion, however. Van der Laan, who has been critical of raising the block size limit before, told CoinTelegraph he has no fundamental problems with BIP 102:\n\n“I think raising the block size limit from 1MB to 2MB can't do much damage. It's a conservative and limited measure.”\n\nHe did, however, indicate that Garzik's proposal to raise the limit in November of this year might be too soon:\n\n“Given the tight time frame Jeff has given for this proposal – less than six months to deploy – I doubt it will be feasible.”\n\nEarlier this week, Garzik submitted a proposal to raise the block size limit from 1MB to 2MB by November of this year. The proposal is explicitly intended to buy more time to reach a consensus on more durable or alternative solutions before the maximum amount of transactions on the Bitcoin network is reached.\n\nMuch like other adjustments to the Bitcoin blockchain, especially when they require a hard fork, BIP 102 will probably need to reach a (broad) consensus among developers in order to be adopted.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to Jeff Garzik, but had received no response at time of publication.\n\n- Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn"", 'Deloitte has announced its partnership with the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) to “work on the strategic, tax and regulatory changes that will need to happen” in Australia.\n\nThe world’s fourth-largest accountancy firm will form a working group with ADCCA members, tasked, iTnews reports via Silicon Angle. The focus of the group is due to comprise “creating accounting practices” for businesses dealing with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nSpeaking about the news, Deloitte Australia partner Jonathan Perkinson underlined the firm’s long standing interest in the Australian digital payments space.\n\n“Deloitte has had an interest in digital currencies for quite some time, so this was a great opportunity to get involved. Digital currencies have a lot of momentum at the moment,” he said. “With ADCCA, we’ll be working on the strategic, tax and regulatory changes that will need to happen, and we’ll be recommending and challenging specific changes in those arenas.”\n\nPerkinson made specific reference to the situation regarding taxation of cryptocurrency transactions, which have made it compulsory for entities registered for Australia’s general sales tax (GST) to pay a 10% fee on any trading in bitcoin. Regulatory reshuffles have so far not altered governmental perspective on the practice, which Perkinson hinted at as a barrier to Bitcoin’s future success in the country. He emphasized:\n\n“The challenge is to get cryptocurrencies taxed in an appropriate way.”\n\nPerkinson’s words echoed those of fellow Deloitte Partner Ivan Zasarsky at the Global Digital Currency Convention in Brisbane last November. In a presentation on the feasibility of blockchain and Bitcoin technology for use within Australian finance, Zasarsky urged regulators to “go slow.” Citing the example of US legislator practice regarding prepaid debit cards, “just making a kneejerk reaction could cause more harm than good,” in the case of digital currency in Australia.\n\n“It’s very difficult to put together a regime of laws,” he added. “They’re complex, and any change that takes away can also cause other ramifications and loopholes or openings accordingly.”\n\nDeloitte has been making noises internationally on the issue of blockchain technology in its own business practices. In an interview with CoinDesk earlier this month, Deloitte Consulting principal Eric Piscini said that as a company, Deloitte “needs to understand more about the blockchain and the underlying technology.”\n\n“We believe it can really change the way our clients operate and how we operate,” he added.\n\nThe Australian inititiate in the meantime is still very much in its infancy, Deloitte Australia Director Taralyn Elliot said.\n\n“We haven’t started working on developing accounting standards yet. They’re in a fledgling state at the moment. But as crypto currencies get more global attention, we will soon need global accounting standards,” she told iTnews.', 'For timely updates on price updates, follow me @sammantic.\n\nBTC price at press time: US$276\n\nLast week’s price alert began with:\n\n“The RSI became overbought and it now correcting that condition. The price is testing support levels now and needs to hold. Nevertheless, RSI is on a buy signal. Right now, 50-55 looks like the support area in RSI. The Money Flow Index is also on a buy signal and in bullish territory. OBV has begun picking up slightly but is not convincing; it is not at the pace one would expect with the rise in price. It would be good to see volume confirm price. A line of resistance has been drawn through the OBV chart and it still has not broken above that line, volume continues to be light to the upside. If volume picks up this may be what lifts the price in its next leg up.”\n\nPrice has retreated in the wake of a Greek Deal, a DDOS attack on OKcoin, and a PBOC that is attempting to stabilize the Chinese markets. Over the last few days, price has traded in a tight range below US$280, unable to remain above. The price fell below a few levels identified as support, i.e. US$300, US$289, and US$280. Price continues to consolidate in the wake of the big June run-up. The big test that must hold is ~US$272, which is the 200 day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nLong Term\n\nAfter the big run-up in price and the cross over of the 50 day EMA and 100 day EMA, price has fallen back to consolidate near the 200 day EMA at ~US$272. All the overbought signals in the indicators have corrected themselves and the RSI remains above 50, which is bullish. The Money Flow Index looks bearish here as volume has weakened and it remains on a sell signal.\n\nOn Balance Volume (OBV) has never confirmed the move up, which has been concerning for months. Volume has yet to follow price in this up-move. This continues to be bothersome and confirmation in the form of volume with an up-move would allay much of that worry. OBV tried to break above resistance and failed.\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has lost momentum and looks to be consolidating here awaiting its next move. Caution should be used when putting on a trade here until there is more confirmation.\n\nIchimoku\n\nThe one-year Ichimoku (cloud chart) shows price remaining well above the cloud (the trend is bullish) and in bullish territory. However, price has crossed below the Tanken Sen and Kijun Sen, indicating that momentum has begun to wane. The Chikou San (Lagging Line) has also followed the price lower. The uptrend is on pause at the moment and the cloud below should act as support. Some areas to watch are ~US$274, US$266 and ~US$260. The cloud ahead remains bullish as well, so price action remains bullish to neutral.\n\nFor further definitions of what is being discussed, please refer to this previous post on Ichimoku cloud charts.\n\nIntermediate-Term Trend\n\nFibonacci retracements have been drawn from two price tops: the mid-November high of ~US$424 and the July 12 high of ~US$310.\n\nPrice has fallen below some key levels and is now looking for some support. Key areas are ~US$273, ~US$267 and ~US$262. Essentially that ~272 area is really big for bear term direction and possibly medium term direction as well.\n\nThe MACD is correcting as it has been since it went to an extreme condition on the large move up last week. It remains on a sell signal here.\n\nIncluded is the Directional Movement Index (DMI), which looks at buying and selling pressures. The blue line indicates buying pressure, the red line indicates selling pressure, and the orange line is the ADX, which indicates the strength or weakness of a trend.\n\nLast week’s price alert noted:\n\n“Buying pressure and the ADX line are very bullish, but are pointing to extreme levels right now. The ADX line can’t really get much higher than it is now. While the bulls are in total control right now, and buying pressure continues upward, ADX is signaling price might look to pause. The ADX line remains above both the Buying Pressure Line and the Selling Pressure Line at very high levels. This puts it on a buy signal.”\n\nThe price has come off that extreme reading after the cascading price action last week. Buying Pressure remains above Selling Pressure and the ADX is above both lines but looks to be correcting from an extreme level. The action is still bullish here, but was due for a snap back.\n\nLast week, the price was above the upper Bollinger Band and had been stretched out since the week before. Volatility and price action have returned, and the Bollinger bands continue to widen as price has been moving. Interestingly enough they have widened considerably since last week even though price has been trading in a tight range. Expect a bigger move looking to set up here or at the very least a fair amount of price volatility. Price is sitting on the middle band right now, and if it falls below price could follow. Price needs to stay above the middle band.\n\nShort Term\n\nPrice barely remains above its short term trendline, holding above ~US$272. Otherwise price is paving the way to fall to ~US$262. The RSI is beginning to move up from an oversold condition while the MFI remains oversold. MACD is below zero and on a sell signal but flat. Price is attempting to bottom here but will need a catalyst to begin a new up-trend. ~US$279, ~US$282 and ~US$288 will provide upside resistance.\n\nThe bulls had seized control and while the charts remain slightly bullish, the bears are attempting to seize the moment. The ~US$272 mark will be the battleground. Lean bullish for now and hope volume follows.\n\nDisclaimer: Articles regarding the potential movement in cryptocurrency prices are not to be treated as trading advice.

Always remember that only those in possession of the private keys are in control of the money.', 'Currently ranked fifth on the CoinATMRadar list for most Bitcoin ATM’s, Czech Republic based General Bytes has positioned itself to succeed in the Bitcoin ATM market. Some of the most stable companies, for sure, have received the least amount of press. General Bytes appears to be one of those. The company stepped up amid the Robocoin crisis to bail out some of the embattled company’s operators and has been reputable.\n\nGeneral Bytes (GB) develops Android and Bitcoin technologies, focusing on Android because it is the leading platform for phones and tablets. The firm strives to bring Android technology to other devices and machines due to its strengths, such as being built on Linux, being open-source, as well as benefitting from the millions of developers in its community. The first Bitcoin related technology the firm developed is the BATMOne, which the firm has discontinued to make room for its updated BATMTwo and BATMThree.\n\nThe BATMTwo is a unidirectional platform which distributes coins from a wallet or crypto-exchange, with point-of-sale integrated and a remotely manageable interface. The machine offers AML and KYC in the form of fingerprint or SMS verification. The BATMThree is the bi-directional version of GB’s Bitcoin ATM. The firm currently supports the altcoins Litecoin and Dogecoin, as well as others. Kyovsky first heard about Bitcoin from friends in the hackerspace who were mining on GFX cards. Soon he heard about the development of Bitcoin ATMs.\n\n“I saw a Lamassu machine on the internet and given my background I decided that we can do it too for a much better price and with far better features,” Karel Kyovsky told CCN. “Before starting General Bytes I had a company developing and manufacturing internet-connected slot machines.\n\n“Slot-machines share lots of the features with a Bitcoin ATM. It is dealing with cash, has to be secure including RNG, connected via the internet, reliable, easy-to-use, and a low cost of maintenance,” Kyovsky said. He first got into hardware and software development when he was 12 working on Atari130XE.\n\nGB’s ATM’s software supports approximately six altcoins. “But end customers show very little interest in purchasing altcoins,” Kyovsky told me.\n\nWhen Robocoin started having troubles in recent months, GB saw an opportunity to make software for Robocoin’s hardware, saving Robocoin ATM operators on the investment they made when they purchased the machines.\n\n“We were working on our BATMThree (2-way model) at that time when Robocoin unveiled their version 2.0,” he says.\n\nWe saw how bad the version was and we spoke to ATM operators.\n\n“What Robocoin made was a disaster. We also didn’t like the way Robocoin communicated with their ATM operators hurting the entire reputation of Bitcoin ATM manufacturers image,” Kyovsky told CCN. “It was something like the MtGox of Bitcoin ATMs.” Kyovsky saw an opportunity to fill a demand for functional ATM software useable via Robocoin’s hardware.\n\nSo we decided to port our software to their hardware. One of the reasons was also to gain market share and improve our reputation. So we made a promise to Robocoin ATM operators and delivered. We wanted to show that there are also good ATM vendors in the market. Lamassu for instance never delivered working software for Robocoin, despite it promising to do so. – The firm’s software worked.\n\n“When operators converted to our software they were astonished that our software is far better than the original Robocoin software was.” General Bytes’ product is available the world over, in the European Union, United States and even Africa. But GB is prepared to serve whoever wants their ATM products. Kyovsky is excited about GB’s future.\n\n“We plan to build slowly based on our reputation by delivering cost-effective and functional solutions. This year we will also present more products and devices,” he says. From the company’s headquarters in Prague, Czech Republic, Kyovsky sees a young tech-population excited about Bitcoin.\n\n“Czech people have Czech Crown fiat currency, so they are used to convert currencies often when they travel,” he says. “Bitcoin is just another currency for them. In the Czech Republic, the young IT community sees lots of potential in Bitcoin.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Hong Kong-based startup Bitspark has been one of the seven startups to join Accenture’s FinTech Innovation Lab Asia-Pacific 2015, a “collaboration between a number of the world’s leading banks, such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, China Citic Bank International, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and J.P.

07/21/2015,"['Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Diego Rodriguez, Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and Robert Sica, Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the United States Secret Service, announced today the unsealing of criminal complaints charging ANTHONY R. MURGIO and YURI LEBEDEV with running an unlicensed Internet Bitcoin exchange, which they operated through a phony front-company and, at times, a federal credit union that MURGIO acquired for purposes of the scheme. The defendants were arrested today at their residences in Florida, and are expected to be presented today in federal court in the Middle District of Florida.\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the criminal complaints unsealed today in Manhattan federal court1:\n\nSince at least late 2013, MURGIO, LEBEDEV, and their co-conspirators have knowingly operated Coin.mx, a Bitcoin exchange service, in violation of federal anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations, including those requiring money services businesses like Coin.mx to meet registration and reporting requirements set forth by the United States Treasury Department. Through Coin.mx, MURGIO, LEBEDEV, and their co-conspirators enabled their customers to exchange cash for Bitcoins, charging a fee for their service. In doing so, they knowingly exchanged cash for people whom they believed may be engaging in criminal activity. MURGIO and his co-conspirators have also knowingly exchanged cash for Bitcoins for victims of “ransomware” attacks, that is, cyberattacks in which criminals (here, distributors of the ransomware known as “Cryptowall”) electronically block access to a victim’s computer system until a sum of “ransom” money, typically in Bitcoins, is paid to them. In doing so, MURGIO, and his co-conspirators knowingly enabled the criminals responsible for those attacks to receive the proceeds of their crimes, yet, in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws, MURGIO never filed any suspicious activity reports regarding any of the transactions.\n\nIn total, between approximately October 2013 and January 2015, Coin.mx exchanged at least $1.8 million for Bitcoins on behalf of tens of thousands of customers. In addition, in the course of the scheme, MURGIO transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to bank accounts in Cyprus, Hong Kong, and Eastern Europe, and received hundreds of thousands of dollars from bank accounts in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands, in furtherance of the operations of his unlawful business.\n\nMURGIO, LEBEDEV, and their co-conspirators engaged in substantial efforts to evade detection of their scheme by operating through a phony front-company, “Collectables Club,” and maintaining a corresponding phony “Collectables Club” website. In doing so, they sought to trick the major financial institutions through which they operated into believing that their unlawful Bitcoin exchange business was simply a members-only association of individuals who discussed, bought, and sold collectable items, such as sports memorabilia.\n\nMore recently, in an effort to evade potential scrutiny from these institutions and others, MURGIO obtained beneficial control of a New Jersey-based federal credit union (the “Credit Union”) which served primarily low-income local residents. MURGIO then installed LEBEDEV and others on the Credit Union’s Board of Directors, and transferred Coin.mx’s banking operations to the Credit Union, which MURGIO, LEBEDEV and other co-conspirators operated, at least until early 2015, as a captive bank for their unlawful business. At that time, after discovering that substantial payment processing activity was being conducted through the Credit Union, the National Credit Union Administration forced the Credit Union to cease engaging in such activity, and MURGIO thereafter found new, overseas payment processing channels for his unlawful business.\n\n* * *\n\nMURGIO, 31, of Tampa, Florida, and LEBEDEV, 37, of Jacksonville, Florida, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. MURGIO is also charged with one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the judge.\n\nMr. Bharara praised the investigative work of the FBI and the Secret Service. He also thanked the National Credit Union Administration for their assistance with the investigation.\n\nThe prosecution of this case is being overseen by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicole Friedlander, Sarah Lai, and Eun Young Choi are in charge of the prosecution. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Wilson of the Office’s Money Laundering and Asset Forfeiture Unit is in charge of the forfeiture aspects of the case.\n\nThe charges contained in the criminal complaints are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n1 As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the complaints, and the description of the complaints set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.', 'South African media giant Naspers, has led a R50 million funding drive for local Bitcoin exchange, BitX.\n\nBitX, which was acquired by Singapore-based group Switchless in 2013, announced a US$4 million (R49.65 million) Series A funding round lead by the Naspers Group, through its payments subsidiary PayU.\n\nExisting investor, Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, also participated in the round.\n\n“We’ve been seeing very strong growth across the markets we operate in, and this investment will allow us to both accelerate this growth and extend our footprint to more markets”, said BitX co-founder and CEO, Marcus Swanepoel.\n\nBitX said that the latest funding round will allow the group to expand into other markets, launch a number of exciting new products and more generally leverage the Naspers Group’s extensive global network to help drive large-scale cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nJames Caviness, chief product officer at PayU, will join the BitX board of directors as part of the investment.\n\n“We see a bright future for cryptocurrency across a number of industry verticals, and with BitX’s strong management team and solid track record, look forward to leveraging Naspers’ global platform and local knowledge to help them capitalise on these opportunities”\n\nIn July 2014, Bitcoin experienced a strong boost in South Africa after BitX and payment gateway, PayFast entered a partnership which allowed over 30,000 online stores – including Takealot.com – to process the virtual currency.\n\nThe exchange currently values 1 Bitcoin at R3,828.\n\nMore on Bitcoin\n\nYou can now buy airtime and data using Bitcoin in SA\n\nTakealot now accepts Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is still around, but do you even care?\n\nSA law firm now accepts bitcoin', 'ItBit has launched its Global OTC Agency Trading Desk, a new, five-person over-the-counter (OTC) trading service that allows customers to complete trades outside its online order books.\n\nThe trading desk will facilitate transactions of 100 BTC (roughly $28,000 at press time) or more with no broker or trading fees. As part of a limited promotion, new users will also receive $50 in bitcoin for completing their first trade.\n\nItBit Institutional Client Group director Bobby Cho noted that the new product aims to appeal to large volume buyers who want to avoid exchange slippage, whereby their purchase moves the price of the market.\n\nA former vice president at fellow bitcoin OTC trading services provider SecondMarket, now Genesis Trading, Cho suggested that the services could compliment one another given their variances in approach.\n\nCho told CoinDesk:\n\n""They\'re a broker dealer, we don\'t take positions. They may buy or take a position. Our incentive is to drive more transactions and more trading volume, and the end goal here is to bring price discovery to the OTC market so as a trader you can see volumes, but there\'s also this separate OTC market that there is no data around.""\n\nCho specified that OTC clients will need to go through know your customer (KYC) verification, though this process will be same as for online-only clients.\n\nThe new product further comes amid a time of increasing activity in New York\'s bitcoin sector following the passage of the BitLicense and ahead of the expected launch of the Winklevoss Capital backed exchange Gemini.\n\nStill, Cho sees the services being able to coexist given what he characterized as the expanding market for bitcoin.\n\n""We haven\'t felt the competition yet, we know the bitcoin market is still young and large enough for multiple players involved, you want competitors to validate your business model,"" Cho said.

He was also charged with one count of money laundering.\n\nJoshua S.

At the time, the bank said that that the hackers had access to customer names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.\n\nNo customer money was lost. The bank also said there was no indication that account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers were compromised.\n\nThat attack was so massive though that it was even believed that the Russian government may have been behind it.\n\nMillions of penny stock emails\n\nThe US Attorney\'s Office in New York charged Gery Shalon, Joshua Samuel Aaron, and Zvi Orenstein for their roles in an alleged multi-million dollar penny stock pump-and-dump that goes back to 2011.\n\nShalon, 31, and Orenstein, 41, were arrested in Israel by the Israel Police.\n\nAaron hasn\'t been arrested .

I didn\'t care that the website\'s content was made possible by a GIF or a WAV file or even a browser.\n\nAt the time, such details weren\'t important. In nine seconds, every time I got exactly what I wanted, the same ecstatic burst of absurdity, animation and sound – and I understood.\n\nFor all its faults, Hampster Dance did something no teacher could have done, and beautifully – it distilled the complexity of an education process to its purest form, its message able to be easily replicated, digested and communicated with the click of a button.\n\nIf you look close enough, you can see the seeds of Netflix, Tumblr and a hundred other innovations, all in the magic of these endlessly dancing hamsters.\n\nClever and stupid\n\nOne of the classic lines in 1984\'s This is Spinal Tap comes when lead singer David St Hubbins responds to an album cover disagreement.\n\nHe realizes that he made a mistake, that the original cover (featuring a lewd drawing of a woman and a glove) was too offensive, but that a subtle change could have pleased the studio execs. If it had been he who was made to ""smell the glove"", it might have worked.\n\n""It\'s such a fine line between stupid and clever,"" he says, and he\'s right.\n\nSo far in the bitcoin industry, there seems to be a widespread hesitation against exploring this line. Dogecoin was derided until its joke was pronounced dead and its founders chased out of the industry. Other meme-focused altcoins came and went. The industry hasn\'t really recovered from this funny bone fracture since.\n\nThere\'s still a pull against taking stupidity seriously, despite evidence of its effectiveness. As our most recent State of Bitcoin report showcases, ""bitcoin billionaire"" was the fastest-growing search term related to bitcoin over the last 12 months.\n\nThe term doesn\'t relate to the promise of bitcoin as a speculative investment or hedge in times of currency crisis.\n\nBitcoin Billionaire is rather an online game that simulates bitcoin mining and rewards users with fake wealth. The game has a four-and-a-half star review on the Google App store and five stars on iTunes. One video guide to the game has nearly 500,000 views on YouTube.\n\nA better example is the recently launched website Eternity Wall, one of the best examples so far of a single-serving bitcoin-based website. It\'s message is simple. Write a message, it will last forever. As my fellow writer Grace Caffyn quipped, it\'s ""restroom graffiti"" for the bitcoin age.\n\nSo far the wall is littered with stupidity, with words like ""fart"", proclamations of who is ""the best DJ"" and boring statements of approval like ""cool"".\n\nThere\'s even one guy slamming the service for generating ""blockchain spam"" by using small transactions to tie the messages to bitcoin\'s distributed ledger. The message is implicit: this stupidity is getting in the way of the serious stuff.\n\nSocietal change\n\nI\'ll take a moment to digress and clarify, that the intent is not to suggest that bitcoin itself is dumb or stupid, or that the ecosystem\'s larger attempts to make the world a better place are in any way not admirable or well-intentioned.\n\nI won\'t even argue there\'s a legitimate argument against blockchain spam, that you probably wouldn\'t want a copy of Hampster Dance stored on every server in the world. At that point, let\'s be frank, you might be overpaying to secure the Hampster Dance website.\n\nI\'m sure bitcoin and the blockchain will be everything we want it to be. It will likely be greatly transformative. The Hernando de Soto, MIT vision of the blockchain will probably come to pass – land title records will be digitized, complex financial assets will trade at the speed of emails.\n\nBitcoin and the blockchain will impact the wider world in ways we can\'t imagine. Just as the Internet enabled Twitter to play a role in the Arab Spring movement, change will be inherent in our use of transaction systems that rely on participation, that lack central guiding authorities.\n\nChange will come and it will likely be slow and tangential, only observable later when we look at things at certain angles, because the nature of change is for it to be absorbed.\n\nI\'ve written in this space for two years now. I don\'t say much often. I am content to watch and listen and observe. I want the industry to get there, but I want it to remember how I came to the Internet, and for us to maybe remember a bit about ourselves.\n\nWe are human beings. Humor is how we learn, it\'s how we make sense, it\'s how we understand. Help us understand. Do it in the messiest and most annoying way possible, and if possible, don\'t be afraid of dancing hamsters.\n\nThis post was inspired by this tweet.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles. As such, the opinions expressed in this article are the author\'s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nFor more details on how you can submit an opinion or analysis article, view our Editorial Collaboration Guide or email news@coindesk.com.', ""In a July 20 interview, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke about the resurgence of the platform, and the release of new evidence proving U.S. Secret Service surveillance of the German government on an unprecedented peacetime scale.\n\n‘Drowning in Material’\n\nTalking about the increase in published material over the last few months, Assange stressed that the site never stopped posting documents, but that some of these (regarding Syria, for example) had not been of great interest to Western media. In addition, the conflict since 2010 with the U.S. government lead to a banking blockade that cut WikiLeaks off from more than 90% of its finances and required creative measures to overcome, including a (now successful) challenge in the courts.\n\nAssange has long been a fervent advocate of Bitcoin, and in particular the blockchain technology on which it is founded — although WikiLeaks did not initially accept bitcoin donations, allegedly at the behest of Satoshi Nakamoto, who believed that the level of unwanted government interest such a link would generate could destroy the fledgling community in its early stages. Nakamoto wrote in 2010:\n\n“The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin.”\n\nWikiLeaks started accepting Bitcoin donations in June 2011, however, after the currency's first major boom.\n\nDonations that were collected during the banking blockade enabled the site to implement a next-generation submission system that was just launched in beta in May. The system is cryptographically, operationally and legally secured, with national security sourcing in mind. This in turn has led to the current surge in submitted material, causing Assange to claim the organization is “drowning in material now.” He added:\n\n“Economically, the challenge for WikiLeaks is whether we can scale up our income in proportion to the amount of material we have to process.”\n\nGerman Government Surveillance\n\nThe most recent significant release of such material is the evidence that American intelligence agencies have intensively been collecting data on 125 top-level German politicians and officials for decades. Assange suggests that portions of this information, if leaked to journalists, could be used to take down the Merkel cabinet at any time.\n\nThe areas targeted in the material published so far are German political affairs, European policies and economic affairs. Assange asserts that by observing how the information (and which information) is passed up through the intelligence food chain, one can understand the political priorities of the U.S. government.\n\nThe intercepts so far published have been from the “Executive Edition” of the Global Signals Intelligence Highlights, which show, for example, the level of U.S. interest in the idea that Germany would propose a greater role for China in the International Monetary Fund. Based on this information, a decision could be made to nix the idea because the U.S. saw China’s help of Europe as a threat to its dominance. — although China buying U.S. debt to support the dollar is of course perfectly acceptable. Assange:\n\n“An executive decision can be taken: Kill that idea of Merkel's before it learns to crawl.”\n\nThai Police Denial\n\nThai police have also this week denied using surveillance software, revealed by WikiLeaks to have been purchased for 10 million THB in 2013. A police spokesman did not deny buying the software, which he accepted could be used to spy on people. However, he claimed that it could not be used to spy on citizens in Thailand because to do so would be illegal and counter to national police policy.\n\nAs previously reported by CoinTelegraph, the software, supplied by Italian firm Hacking Team, can be used to hack into Bitcoin and other private digital currency accounts.\n\nBy Barry Dolphin"", 'About a year ago, R3CEV founder David Rutter and partner Todd McDonald traveled to California to survey the growing landscape of digital currency startups for potential investment opportunities. After days of meeting with numerous companies – in addition to back-and-forth trips on the highway – Rutter says that he had a moment of deja vu.\n\n“I had seen it before where a lot of money – a lot of California-based venture money – was being thrown at PowerPoints and half-baked ideas about how this new technology was going to change finance as we know it,"" he recalled.\n\nA 30-year veteran of Wall Street and former CEO of Electronic Broking at interdealer broker ICAP Plc, Rutter said that what came out of that trip to California was a decision to eschew the ideas of radical change enabled by cryptocurrencies to instead look for problems that could potentially be solved by the use of a distributed ledger.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“The journey we decided to take was to build a knowledge base on what\'s out there so we can go talk intelligently to big banks about the potential and get their perspective and try to build a thesis around where blockchain technologies could make a mark.”\n\nIn a new interview, Rutter and McDonald outlined how R3CEV has been playing a quiet yet concerted game to bring blockchain technology to the world’s largest banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe difference between R3CEV and other distributed ledger startups, however, might lie in the strength of its team. The company boasts IBM executive architect Richard Gendal Brown, Open Mustard Seed chief architect Patrick Deegan, bitcoin industry pundit Tim Swanson and former Bank of America, Citi and Wells Fargo employee Raja Ramachandran among its advisors.\n\nSolutions for problems\n\nIn interview, both Rutter and McDonald suggested that it\'s too early to say how Wall Street institutions and financial companies might one day introduce or integrate blockchain technologies.\n\nR3\'s approach has involved hosting roundtable discussions with interested banks, seeding proof-of-concept initiatives and working directly with institutions on exploration projects.\n\nSpecific projects teased by R3 include a peer-to-peer streaming network for US Treasuries. Rutter noted during the interview that among the potential uses of the technology for banks would entail same-day settlement of trades for Treasuries and other securities.\n\nPart of this process has meant operating somewhat in the background – a strategic choice that Rutter attributed to the team\'s desire to work rather that seeking any kind of limelight.\n\n""There’s an awful lot of hoopla out there about what\'s going on in the space, and our view is that we want to make substantial progress that we can speak to,"" he said.\n\nR3 isn\'t the only firm in the space looking to capitalize on rising interest in blockchain technologies among the financial sector.\n\nDigital Asset Holdings, led by former JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters, recently unveiled a number of product initiatives that includes same-day settlement systems, and companies like Hyperledger, Ripple Labs and others have long targeted the financial sector as a key client demographic.\n\nAt stake are the millions of dollars – if not billions – worth of new business models and financial products built using the technology. As such, players in the space are moving to establish influence among the institutions that could find see big changes in the decades ahead if blockchains and distributed ledgers see broader usage.\n\nChallenging Silicon Valley\n\nWhether bitcoin or another implementation of the protocol will be utilized by one or another bank is still very much unclear.\n\nRutter and McDonald stressed that they strive for a degree of agnosticism when looking at distributed ledger tech, eschewing the bitcoin maximalist view broadly propagated by others in the industry.\n\nMcDonald characterized R3 as taking as a ""balanced approach"", one in which bitcoin as well as other iterations of the technology are equally weighed when looking at particular implementations or use cases.\n\nHe went on to suggest that this view stands in contrast with the thinking of some in Silicon Valley:\n\n“They see it as kind of a skeleton key for all the world’s problems, to be applied to everything. We think there’s a lot of interesting aspects around bitcoin and proof of work blockchain and we continue to look at different applications for it.”\n\nThe key, the two stressed, was approaching applications from the perspective of a financial institution looking to experiment and integrate, rather than with how the technology could be used to augment the institution from the outside.\n\nEducating banks\n\nThese days, it seems harder to find a bank or financial institution that hasn’t committed resources to exploring bitcoin and its underlying technology.\n\nNumerous banks have made public their experimentations, and working groups and trade organizations have weighed in on how blockchain technology, if applied, could bring about lasting change to the financial system. Even central banks like the Monetary Authority of Singapore have begun devoting financial resources to exploring the blockchain.\n\nMany banks and financial institutions, it seems, are still in an exploratory phase, wherein the risks and rewards are being weighed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nRutter explained:\n\n“The thing for us is, we try to approach this in a way where we try to understand what the pain points are the for banks and where they’d like to see help and then, look and articulate a potential strategy using distributed ledgers to bring value.”\n\nRutter noted that, for a number of those on Wall Street, the ascendence of bitcoin has sparked a broader movement to embrace cryptographic solutions in finance.\n\n""I think that it’s possible that these new technologies will provide ancillary benefits,"" he said. \'They\'re not specific to the distributed ledger, but people are thinking of applying mathematical, cryptographic solutions to existing problems.”\n\nNotable is the speed at which financial institutions worldwide have moved to understand the potential of distributed ledger usage, and the potential applications therein.\n\n“I think the education process and the interest has grown extremely rapidly in the past six months,"" McDonald said.\n\nWall Street image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

07/22/2015,"['LONDON (Reuters) - A year ago, bitcoin was widely dismissed as little more than a way for drug-dealers and terrorists to move money around anonymously. Now, some of the world’s biggest banks and companies are buying into the technology behind it.\n\nUnderlying the controversial web-based “cryptocurrency” is the blockchain - a massive ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made that is verified and shared by a global network of computers.\n\nBut the data that can be secured by the blockchain is not restricted to bitcoin transactions. Any two parties could use it to exchange other information, including stock deals, legal contracts and property records, within minutes and with no need for a third party to verify it.\n\nBackers say it could cut out the middleman and help fight corruption, as the process by which the data is secured makes it virtually impossible to tamper with. Banks reckon it could save them money by making their operations faster, more efficient and more transparent.\n\nBut these are early days - bitcoin was invented just six years ago - and the blockchain is still being experimented with. As is often the case with new technology, as when Apple released the iPad, it is not clear what problem it solves.\n\nPeter Kirby, CEO of Texas blockchain-focused start-up Factom, likened the technology’s stage of development to that of the internet in the early 1990s, when it was seen as little more than a way to send emails.\n\n“Here we are again in the email for the internet era, and everyone’s like, ‘Oh, it’s all about moving money through the world.’ No. It’s about a giant distributed ledger that you can write anything to and never unwrite it.”\n\nFactom is using the blockchain to build a permanent and secure land title record in Honduras, one of the poorest countries in Latin America, where land-grabbing and corruption are rife.\n\nSHARED LEDGER\n\nEvery 10 minutes, a “block” of bitcoin transactions is verified by thousands of computers, mainly in places where the substantial energy needed to power them is cheap, such as China and Iceland. That block of data is then layered on top of the previous one to form a “chain”.\n\nBecause the ledger thus created is shared by all of them, if anyone wants to go back and change any of the data, they would have to change every single copy of it, making the blockchain all but tamper-proof.\n\nThat also solves the problem of money being spent more than once, something that has plagued earlier attempts to create digital currencies. This is an advance that makes the blockchain a “key technological innovation”, according to the Bank of England, which has a dedicated team looking into the technology.\n\nIn June, U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) said it was exploring new ways for shares to be issued and transferred, while Reuters disclosed earlier this year that IBM was looking at creating a digital cash and payment system using the blockchain.\n\nBANKING ON THE BLOCKCHAIN\n\nIn recent months, major banks such as UBS, Barclays, ING, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have announced ventures into blockchain technology.\n\nThe potential for transactions to be settled in minutes, rather than days, with fraud or hacking almost impossible, is drawing banks in. That, and the desire not to be left behind.\n\n“We’d rather disrupt ourselves before somebody else does,” said ING’s global head of transaction services, Mark Buitenhek.\n\n“Our approach ... is just to start doing it, and in a year’s time, we’ll see,” he said. “If it takes off, it takes off, and if it doesn‘t, it doesn‘t.”\n\nWith banks under increased regulatory scrutiny, the ability to prove via an immutable record that their trillions of dollars of daily transactions have been carried out in clients’ best interests, not just their own, could prove invaluable.\n\n“The spin-offs from bitcoin are limitless,” said Adam Vaziri, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association. “Using the blockchain (will) avoid any manipulation of records.”', 'New Jersey Credit Union Tied to Illegal Bitcoin Scheme\n\nNew York federal prosecutors arrested two Florida men Tuesday who allegedly ran a phony company and controlled a New Jersey federal credit union to operate an unlicensed Internet Bitcoin exchange scheme for the purpose of laundering money for criminals.\n\nSince late 2013, Anthony R. Murgio, 31, of Tampa and Yuri Lebedev, 37, of Jacksonville, operated Coin.mx, a Bitcoin exchange service, which violated federal anti-money laundering laws. Through Coin.mx, Murgio and Lebedev enabled their customers to exchange cash for Bitcoins, charging a fee for their service.', ""Singapore and New York based bitcoin exchange itBit has introduced its itBit Global OTC Agency Trading Desk, a service that specializes in facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.\n\nOTC transactions are bulk trades for bitcoin that are made outside of an exchange's regular order book. It is an often used form of trading when large amounts of bitcoin are involved, in order to prevent bitcoin's exchange rate from either slipping or rising due to one large volume buy or sell.\n\nBobby Cho, Director of Trading at itBit, said:\n\n“Up until now, the OTC bitcoin trading market has been operating in parallel to existing exchanges. With the itBit Global OTC Agency Trading Desk, our customers will be able to access a regulated OTC market through their existing itBit exchange accounts, matching OTC buyers and sellers through itBit's global network of clients across more than 100 countries.”\n\nWhile itBit's OTC market has only just opened, the exchange indicated that it has already attracted users and liquidity.\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, Cho said:\n\n“We have users and an active market with buyers and sellers already for OTC trading. We provide OTC market participants with a two-sided market so they know exactly where they could buy and sell bitcoins in large size. Clients have been asking about this service for some time and we're excited to be able to offer it.”\n\nitBit's Global OTC Agency Trading Desk is not the first of its kind, as SecondMarket, Kraken and Binary Financial include similar services. Cho believes his service offers a unique approach, however.\n\nCho:\n\n“We are a firm focused on servicing institutions, hence, our exchange has deep liquidity at the top of the order book and our OTC desk has experience dealing with institutional capital and relationships.”\n\nTrading through itBit's Global OTC Agency Trading Desk does not charge fees on trades. To commemorate the launch of its OTC trading desk, itBit is offering US$50 in bitcoin to users that complete their first OTC trade.\n\nIn April of this year, itBit filed to become the first regulated Bitcoin bank in United States."", 'Bitcoin exchange Coinbase has published an article, uncovering the key developments and trends in the cryptocurrency market during H1 of 2015.\n\nAs the first half of 2015 has already passed, Coinbase presented an overview, which focused on the main trends within the bitcoin market this year. In general, the first six months have been quite positive for the most popular digital currency.\n\nThe bitcoin price became more stable now, following its third bubble, when the price escalated 50x in 2013. Its value surpassed $1,200 per bitcoin in late 2013, thus reaching its highest mark.\n\nAs of July 13, the price of bitcoin dropped by 9% since the start of the current year. However, its value increased by more than 213% within a two year period.\n\nSince January 2015, the volatility of bitcoin has been slowly decreasing and now totals about 60%. In comparison with the last year, the market was much more volatile, with fluctuations bouncing between 100% and 140%.\n\nThe increased stability is attributed to the launch of several bitcoin exchanges in the US, what brought more investors to the market.\n\nMeantime, the adoption of digital currency is showing steady growth all over the world. In general, there are about 5-10 million cryptocurrency wallet users worldwide. With 3.1 million registered wallets, Coinbase has about 2.4 million users globally.\n\nThe overall number of transactions in virtual currency is on an upward trend now. As of June 2014, the bitcoin network recorded 60,590 transactions per day, while in June 2015 this number rose by 56,884, reaching 117,474. That is a 94% hike in monthly transactions over the last year.\n\nCoinbase supports bitcoin wallets in more than 190 countries and allows trading digital currency in 25 countries. Besides, its web and mobile apps are available in 7 languages. Nowadays, 47% of the company’s wallet holders are located outside the US. During H1 of 2015, the largest rate of user growth was registered in such countries, as Tunisia, Romania, Hong Kong, Algeria and Philippines.\n\nWhat concerns the age of cryptocurrency users, it is considered that bitcoin is mainly adopted by young people. However, the statistics shows that nearly 34% of Coinbase wallet owners are people over 35. About 37,78% of users are between 25 and 35 years, while those aged 35-45 hold the share of 18,35%.\n\nOver the first six month of 2015, the interest of developers in virtual currency has significantly increased. Currently, there are over 7,000 applications that have been built by bitcoin developers using Coinbase API.\n\nSuch apps as Zapchain, ChangeTip and Lawnmower have already gained traction with the exchange’s users. There are also several bitcoin startups, including Blockstream, Abra, Streamium, Augur and 21, that launched beta versions of their products.\n\nIn H1 of 2015, the number of Github repositories referencing bitcoin totaled 6,109, whilst there were only 2,318 repositories mentioning Paypal.\n\nAccording to predictions for H2 of 2015, the bitcoin adoption will continue growing. Many financial institutions are examining bitcoin and some have invested in blockchain technology.\n\nTaking into account the disadvantages of closed banking systems and issues with data security, more people start using the cryptocurrency as a secure alternative currency. Besides, bitcoin venture capital investment is anticipated to grow.', ""U.S law enforcement officials have arrested five individuals who reportedly were involved in the high-profile 2014 computer hacking of JPMorgan.\n\nThree of the individuals were arrested for stock manipulation while the other two were arrested for running an illegal Bitcoin exchange, according to the FBI.\n\nGrand jury indictments unsealed Tuesday for each don't mention the JPMorgan attacks, but sources told both the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg that all five individuals are people of interest in the FBI's investigation of the JPMorgan attack.\n\nThe perpetrators of that attack stole the login credentials of a JPMorgan employee and used it to access 90 of the company's servers.\n\nThey subsequently stole details including names, email addresses and phone numbers for about 76 million households and 7 million businesses. No financial information was compromised, according to JPMorgan, though the attackers accessed multiple systems.\n\nThe attackers also penetrated the systems of other banks, according to reports.\n\nInitially, JPMorgan suspected the Russian government was involved, though subsequent investigations had ruled out the possibility.\n\nOf the arrests Tuesday, in the stock manipulation case, Israeli citizens Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein were apprehended, along with U.S. citizen Joshua Samuel Aaron, the FBI said.\n\nTheir scheme was a classic pump-and-dump operation, involving artificially raising the value of low-volume stocks and then selling them at an inflated price to unwary buyers attracted through spam e-mail, according to court documents. The operation took place in 2011 and 2012.\n\nSeparately, Yuri Lebedev and Anthony Murgio were also arrested for operating an unlicensed Bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, which traded more than $1.8 million worth of Bitcoin on behalf of tens of thousands of clients, in violation of federal anti-money-laundering laws.\n\nJoab Jackson covers enterprise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

It surfaced yesterday that two operators of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx were being charged by US prosecutors for working without a money transmission license.\n\nThis is by no means the first time characters associated to bitcoin have had a brush with the law – the space has certainly witnessed more than its fair share of scams, hacks and deception.\n\nWith this in mind, let\'s take a trip down memory lane and remind ourselves of some of the more high-profile bitcoin-related court cases.\n\n1. Charlie Shrem: bitcoin\'s \'first\' felon\n\nBack in August 2014, bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nThe former CEO of bitcoin exchange BitInstant violated anti-money laundering duties in his dealings with Robert Faiella, who supplied $1m in digital currency to people buying drugs on the now defunct Silk Road marketplace.\n\nAs part of his plea, Shrem agreed to forfeit $950,000 to the US government.\n\nHaving been sentenced in December last year, Shrem is currently serving a two-year prison term in Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp, a minimum security prison in Pennsylvania.\n\n2. Ross Ulbricht: life in prison\n\nPerhaps one of the most familiar faces in the bitcoin space, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced in May to life in prison, without the right to parole, for operating Silk Road.\n\nUlbricht was found guilty on all charges – including trafficking of narcotics, trafficking on the Internet, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and computer hacking – on the first day of jury deliberations in February this year.\n\nThe ruling, considered harsh by some, sent shock waves across the world and is perceived as the benchmark case that will set precedents in cases on online crime and privacy.\n\n3. Carl Mark Force IV and Shaun Bridges: Silk Road saga\n\nHanded down by US District Judge Katherine Forrest in New York, Ulbricht\'s life-long sentence put an end to a year and a half-long saga which saw the emergence of various bitcoin auctions as well as the surprise indictment of two former federal agents involved with the Baltimore-based Silk Road investigation.\n\nIn a twist of events worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster, Carl Mark Force IV, a former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent admitted to stealing over $700,000 worth of bitcoin whilst working on the investigation. Force, the lead undercover agent, who communicated with Ulbricht, said he had used fake online personas to steal bitcoin from both the US government and the investigated parties.\n\nUS Secret Service special agent Shaun Bridges is also expected to plead guilty to charges of money laundering and wire fraud during his time investigating the online drugs bazaar. Court documents in March indicated Bridges had diverted $800,000 in digital currency to his personal bank accounts without receiving prior authorisation from law enforcement officials.\n\n4. Mark Karpeles: the disgraced CEO\n\nThe disgraced CEO of the now defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox came under scrutiny after the exchange filed for bankruptcy following the loss of approximately 850,000 BTC (more than $450m at the time) in February last year.\n\nKarpeles filed for bankruptcy in Japan that month and in the United States in March.\n\nIn April 2014, the former CEO was subpoenaed by the United States Department of the Treasury\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. However, Karpeles declined to appear to testify.\n\nAccording to some media reports, Karpeles was allegedly found guilty of fraud when he was tried in absentia in his native France in 2010. He was sentenced to a year in jail but has not yet served his sentence.\n\nThe CEO was also implicated in the Silk Road trial, after Ulbricht claimed Karpeles was ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" – the pseudonym used by the marketplace\'s mastermind. Karpeles denied the claims publicly.\n\n5. Jed McCaleb: a legal battle\n\nJed McCaleb is currently involved in a legal battle over $1m in disputed funds.\n\nIn essence, the battle has seen Ripple Labs, its founder and ex-employee McCaleb and the Stellar Development Foundation – McCaleb\'s current employer – fight over $1,038,172 currently being held by digital currency exchange Bitstamp.\n\nBoth Ripple and Stellar have voiced their opinion on whether the court should grant Bitstamp\'s request to be discharged from the court case, after the exchange filed a complaint for interpleader on 1st April, where it requested permission from the court to transfer the funds to Stellar.\n\nThe argument put forward by Bitstamp is that it was unable to determine whether Ripple Labs or the defendant, Jacob Stephenson (McCaleb\'s cousin) was the rightful owner of the funds in dispute.\n\nIt is believed that Stephenson sold the XRP – the Ripple network\'s native currency – to Ripple through a sale on Bitstamp, an action that, according to Ripple, was done on McCaleb\'s behalf in violation of a settlement agreement.\n\n6. GAW Miners: breach of contract charges\n\nGAW Miners is facing non-payment and breach of contract charges following the filing of a suit by the Mississippi Power Company (MPC).\n\nThe company is requesting repayment of approximately $224,000 for services as well as almost $50,000 in installation costs.\n\nAdditionally, MPC is looking to collect a further $73,493.48 for breach of contract charges.\n\nA couple of months after the filing was submitted, MPC requested a default judgement in its favour against GAW, citing the firm\'s unresponsiveness.\n\n7. Bryan Micon: avoids prison\n\nHaving avoided a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, Bryan Micon, who ran the now-defunct bitcoin poker site Seals with Clubs, pleaded guilty to one count of operating an unlicensed gambling site in the state of Nevada.\n\nMicon will have to pay a $25,000 fine and serve a probation term, the duration of which is yet to be determined.\n\nAdditionally, the former operator will have to forfeit property seized during a raid carried out at his home; including $900 cash, around 3 BTC and electronic equipment.\n\nJudge image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, 2,393 felt the price would be higher than $279 on 31st December.\n\n\n\nSome 262 of the report\'s respondents said they thought the price would be over $1,000 by the end of the year, with only 43 respondents predicting the price would reach more than $11,000.\n\nThese findings come in stark contrast to the results of last year\'s survey, which showed 56% of CoinDesk readers believed the price would reach $10,000 in 2014.\n\nPrice volatility\n\nBitcoin\'s volatility does not come as a surprise to bitcoin enthusiasts, who watched it spike beyond $1,000 in late 2013, drop in price throughout the following year and saw a further 40% decrease this January.\n\nDespite its notorious instability, CoinDesk\'s latest State of Bitcoin report shows the cryptocurrency\'s price stabilised somewhat in the last quarter.\n\nPrice rationale\n\nOne survey respondent, who predicted a valuation of $180 by the end of 2015, claimed bitcoin\'s current value was unrealistic.\n\n""I think the price is still overvalued based on available and foreseeable use cases and the corresponding user base. In the next year, I think some of the pump and dump culprits will run out of money and a real correction will bring a further dip in the price below $120 with a slow resurgence from that point as the global user base grows organically,"" they said.\n\nEconomic instability, said another commentator, would help drive the digital currency\'s price as people looked to bitcoin for an alternative.\n\nThey explained: ""Contiuing global financial crisis will highlight advantages to the public, while innovation will make bitcoin easier to become involved.""\n\nThe responses to the poll proved that, generally speaking, bitcoin\'s followers were largely aware of the consequences that macro-economic changes could have on the digital currency\'s price.\n\nInfluence of the Greek crisis\n\nGiven the media\'s ongoing association between the digital currency\'s value and economic instability in Greece, it is hardly surprising that some aficionados also made the connection.\n\nSome 22.57% of the survey respondents said their outlook on the digital currency\'s price had been influenced by Greece\'s economic crisis, which has seen citizens subjected to strict capital controls since 29th June.\n\nWhen questioned, 39.87% of respondents admitted their opinion on bitcoin\'s price had been slightly influenced by the Greek crisis. However, 23.64% of those surveyed did not correlate the digital currency\'s recent price movements with events in the Southern European country.\n\nTiming of purchases\n\nWhen asked about when they made their last bitcoin purchase, 31.5% of those surveyed said they had bought bitcoin within the past week.\n\nWhile 11.7% noted their last purchase had taken place two weeks ago, 9.3% said they had bought bitcoin last month. A further 21.7% said they last bought bitcoin more than six months ago.\n\nView our CoinDesk Price Survey 2015 infographic for the key results at a glance.\n\nFeatured image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Every time users upload and share content, they will receive Perv points, which later on can be used to obtain Revenue Shares.\n\nThe Revenue Shares that the users earn are based on BitPervy’s advertising income, which is divided with Coinsplit.io, a platform that enables bitcoin profit sharing and automatic payments. This way, users earn a share of the sites’ revenue as the platform grows.\n\nBitPervy founder explained in a Reddit thread:\n\n“Currently revenues are split 50/50 between members and the site, but if you own 5% of the shares then you earn 5% of the portion of revenues distributed to members.”\n\nThe income of the site is directly sent to a Coinsplit account, and therefore the earnings of the users are perpetual. However, the value of its users’ shares may decrease overtime due to growing contributions from other users and increasing site traffic.\n\nUsers must note, however, that sharing content on BitPervy depends on whether the owner of the materials has agreed to do so. “Whether it is BitPervy, a porn forum, Sex.com, Pinterest or Twitter or Facebook, you need the content owners consent,” the founder explained. “I want to ensure the website is legal.”\n\nLike a faucet\n\nThe idea of BitPervy was introduced by its founder when he was working for a bitcoin faucet. When he realized that the faucet space was overcrowded, he decided to launch a bitcoin adult content sharing platform with a twist. Unlike other adult entertainment websites, Bitpervy wanted to refrain from creating boring web pages filled with banner ads and pop ups.\n\n“Sure, I'm left with 50% of revenues to cover a VPS and CDN and Mandrill fees, but I'm also not locked into promising payouts I might not be able to afford,” said the founder. “This means my efforts can be on cutting away wasted bandwidth and expenses instead of trying to make income appear that just isn't possible or relying on donations to keep a Faucet alive.”\n\nThis has been the second adult content related bitcoin initiative/platform since the launch of Xotika.TV’s bitcoin initiative, in which everyone pays, receives and transacts entirely in bitcoin.\n\nOver the next few weeks, BitPervy will continue to re-design and fix bugs or problems that users may encounter."", 'One of France\'s biggest banks is looking to hire a developer with a focus on bitcoin.\n\nSociété Générale (SocGen) posted a job listing on 2nd July for an ""IT developer on bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrencies"". SocGen is the third-largest French bank in terms of assets, reporting $1.3tn in assets in 2014.\n\nThe 12-month contract, according to the post, would entail research and development involving cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. Though no specifics were outlined, the post suggests that the bank is looking to develop in-house software, citing ""prototype programming"".\n\nThe listed responsibilities of the position include:\n\nDeveloping proof-of-concept in any language/protocols used in cryptocurrency protocols and blockchains 1.0-3.0\n\nProgramming in C#/C++/Python/Other against bitcoin, altcoin, blockchain different altchain APIs\n\nRunning statistics against blockchains and engineering ways to gather quantitative information on what’s really happening in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nThe position also calls for the organization of internal reports, staff presentations and training programs. The VIE – a kind of international volunteer or internship role – will be tasked with ""engaging with the FinTech community and gathering information on the crypto-currency sector in London and elsewhere.""\n\nSocGen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nResearch push\n\nAssuming the bank can find the cryptocurrency developer it seeks, SocGen would become the latest bank to begin devoting resources to bitcoin and blockchain research.\n\nSocGen stated in the post how the position is part of an effort to evolve in the face of technology-driven changes in the financial sector.\n\n""The type of position that is offered is at the forefront of SocGen’s attempt at anticipating sweeping changes in the banking sector caused by FinTech and adapt to it,"" it wrote.\n\nThe bank itself has been relatively quiet on the subject, though it made headlines in 2013 amid the financial crisis in Cyprus and a large-run up in the price of bitcoin after the island nation\'s banks received a bailout.\n\nSocGen sent a note to investors after receiving numerous requests for information on the valuation of bitcoin. At the time, analyst Sebastien Galy suggested that the price of bitcoin – which had risen from roughly $13 at the start of 2013 to more than $130 by 1st April – was in the midst of an ""aggressive"" bubble.\n\nImage credit: Kiev.Victor / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis report has been updated.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The company founder, Scott Morris, is keen to keep local money within the local community. Local currencies “generate a lot of social and economic wealth,” said Morris to CNYcentral.\n\nThe new currency has a one to one parity with the US dollar, although when an individual buys into the scheme they receive 125 Ithaca dollars for their first $100 deposit. This equates to i$100 to spend in the community and i$25, which they can donate to a cause of their choosing “as a thank you for sacrificing the liquidity that you had with those US dollars,” explains Morris.\n\nOver 100 local businesses have so far signed up to the scheme, with some already accepting payments via text message. Paper bills are also planned, although federal law prohibits the use of coins and denominations of a value less than a dollar.\n\n- Ithacash founder, Scott Morris\n\nLocal sentiment towards the initiative is positive. Tyler Kenney, a student at Ithaca College, said:\n\n“You have locals who are struggling against larger businesses and now you're willing to help out the little guy, so I think it's great.”\n\nAnother local resident Sarah Schmidlin added:\n\n“It's gonna support local businesses as opposed to people taking their money elsewhere.”\n\nIthaca HOURs\n\nIn 1991, another alternative currency called the Ithaca HOUR was introduced by a local businessman called Paul Glover. An Ithaca HOUR was valued at US$10 and was recommended as roughly equivalent to payment for one hour's work. As such, they were produced in denominations of half, quarter and even an eighth of an Ithaca HOUR.\n\nThe scheme was a glowing success, with several million dollars worth of HOURs traded between residents and over 500 local businesses in the twenty years following its inception.\n\nHowever, the shift towards electronic transactions over cash, combined with the founder of (and chief evangelist for) the currency moving out of town, led to a decline in its use. By 2011 few businesses were still accepting HOURs, and those that did couldn't sustain a healthy flow.\n\nThe good news is that residents still holding Ithaca HOURs are being invited by Ithacash to convert them into Ithaca Dollars at a rate of i$17.50 for 1 HOUR (the equivalent of US$10 in 1991) “as a way of honoring that original commitment and to thank those still holding Ithaca HOURs for their continued loyalty to Ithaca's economic well-being.”\n\n- Ithaca Hours""]"

Seventeen percent of 92 survey-takers said that they are ""currently using"" some form of implementation. Yet more could begin utilizing the technology in the near future – of 87 respondents, 47% said that they were ""reviewing"" the option.\n\nThe survey, entitled “Bitcoin, the Blockchain and Their Impact on Institutional Capital Markets”, included feedback from 102 individuals with focuses on areas like exchange, consulting, financial tech and buy-side and sell-side investments. The interviews were conducted in May and June.\n\nOf those, 84% were based in the Americas, with 11% and 5% based in Europe and Asia, respectively. Many questions included in the survey only garnered data from a portion of the field.\n\nEasing settlement pain\n\nWhen asked about the problems the technology could be used to alleviate, settlement risk and time were most cited.\n\nRespondents also indicated that counterparty risk and custodial risk could also be reduced through the use of distributed ledgers.\n\nThe data suggests that bitcoin and the blockchain are on the radar of many in financial circles. Ninety-one percent of respondents said they were aware of bitcoin, with 70% stating their familiarity with distributed ledger tech more broadly.\n\nLittle love for bitcoin\n\nIt appears that a number of respondents don\'t have much interest in bitcoin itself.\n\nFifty-six of those in the survey pool indicated more familiarity with specifics startups in the space, naming Digital Asset Holdings (27%), Ripple Labs (25%) and Coinbase (23%) over ""bitcoin"" (16%).\n\nThe report authors state that, for Wall Street, the underlying distributed ledger seems to hold the biggest draw rather than bitcoin the currency.\n\n""It is not Bitcoin itself that has the potential for changing the institutional capital markets, however.

According to Connie Chung, senior payments product manager at Expedia, the drop in bitcoin payments may have also been correlated to the decline in prices.\n\nBack when Expedia announced its decision to accept bitcoin transactions in 2014, the cryptocurrency had been valued at around $600. As of this writing, bitcoin is trading at less than $300.\n\nBitcoin Transactions Slowdown?\n\nOther factors that may have weighed on the use of bitcoin transactions even among other online merchants include the current problems being faced by the network, such as the increased time involved in verification and the occasional hacking incidents.\n\nNonetheless, Chung maintains that they will continue to accept bitcoin payments on Expedia even after the initial hype seems to have faded. “We accept bitcoin as a way of just allowing customers to pay with whatever method they want to pay. For us, bitcoin is on an even playing field with the other payment types we offer,” she explained.\n\nAt the moment, Expedia processes bitcoin transactions only for hotel bookings and not for most airfare payments just yet. Even with hotel reservations, the payments option is also limited to those who are also accepting bitcoin transactions themselves.\n\n“We accept bitcoin on hotels only where we are a merchant of record. So for some of the hotels that we sell we are the merchant, meaning that you, as a customer are the one paying on our site directly when you are trying to book,” Chung said. “Obviously at that point you are restricted to whatever the hotel can take. So if you try to pay with credit card we’ll still take it as a deposit if you are a no-show, but in those cases we would not be able to offer bitcoin because the hotel is the one that’s actually charging you.”', ""Last week, CoinDesk released the latest report in our quarterly State of Bitcoin series.\n\nJust like all our reports to date, the State of Bitcoin Q2 2015 was an all-encompassing look at the bitcoin ecosystem, clocking in at just shy of 100 slides of data.\n\nIt was the first positive quarter for bitcoin since this time last year, characterised by increased attention amidst the Greek crisis and interest from banks and governments in blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, these weren't the only takeaways from Q2. Here, we've put together a few hidden gems from the report you might have missed.\n\n1. Bitcoin is on track to outpace the Internet\n\nBitcoin, more than anything else, is often compared to the Internet back in the technology's early days. Both are rooted in fringe ideologies and, if you believe the hype, both have the ability to disrupt and empower via distributed networks of data.\n\nThe comparison is something that the State of Bitcoin has tracked since the series began. So, how is the currency fairing so far?\n\nIn investment terms, bitcoin startups are outperforming expectations – with $786m predicted to be invested in bitcoin by the end of this year (Slide 38), versus the $639 Internet companies netted in 1996.\n\nThis is taking into account BitFury's latest $20m deal, which took place in Q3, alongside inflation and other startup running costs. Last year, bitcoin exceeded investment in 1995 Internet startups by $112m.\n\n2. Bitcoin is looking more like a currency\n\nOver the course of the currency's short history, bitcoin has made a name for itself in the media as the speculators' drug of choice through its dramatic peaks and troughs. While great headline fodder, these wild swings have limited bitcoin's reliability as a day-to-day currency.\n\nHowever, as volatility has eased off over the last few months, bitcoin's trademark spikes have been smoothing out. The report shows that Q2 saw the lowest peak-to-trough percentage (20%) in recent memory. At its highest, the price was $262.48 and its lowest, $218.27 (Slide 11). This is down from 84% the same time last year.\n\nThe knock-on effect of Q2's comparative calm, as Slide 22 shows, was reflected in the amount of interest in price stories on CoinDesk, as well as headlines from the mainstream media.\n\nIt also affected the quarter's trading volume, which is continuing to dip in absence of big daily price movements (Slide 12).\n\n3. But it's still not a hit with consumers\n\nSo, could this reduced volatility signal a move away from bitcoin as an investment vehicle and towards a day-to-day currency?\n\nThe figures aren't exactly encouraging. Although they make up its prime demographic, 51% of Millenials in a recent survey from Goldman Sachs said they had no plans to ever use the currency (Slide 25).\n\nAnd while the number of bitcoin wallets continues to rise steadily, which we also witnessed in Q1, the number of merchants accepting the currency continued to slow in Q2 (Slide 57).\n\nSome, shown here, have quietly dropped it as a payment option following poor sales.\n\n4. China-based miners are now the majority\n\nChinese miners including BTC China, AntPool and F2Pool accounted for over 50% of the network's hashing power in June (Slide 75). GHash.io, which sparked a high-profile debate around the dangers of mining centralisation – namely, a 51% attack – back in mid-2014, has seen its slice diminish significantly.\n\nAs well as having a supply of cheap power and labour, miners in China have proven their ability to build large-scale operations in a short window of time – crucial in an industry that has become a hashrate arms race.\n\nIn the five weeks after the launch of BTC China's pool, the company said it had generated over $1.2m in bitcoin. Back then, it only had 5% of the network's hashing power. Today it has significantly more.\n\n5. The US is still bitcoin's biggest fan\n\nThough Silicon Valley's share of bitcoin investment dipped below 50% this quarter (Slide 42) following Xapo's relocation to Switzerland, a decision the company said was prompted by privacy concerns, stars and stripes still dominate the $834m investment poured into bitcoin startups to date.\n\nIn Q2, the total funding in the US and Canada grew by 28%, with huge rounds from Circle and Ripple, with the region now accounting for 72% of all VC money to date (Slide 39).\n\nThere are now 23 countries with VC-backed startups, yet investment from the US ($569.1m) is almost triple the rest of the world put together. For example, the UK, in second place, has attracted $42.9m in bitcoin investment to date, just 7.5% of its ally. At the bottom of the table, the Philippines makes up just 0.02% of the US total (Slide 40).\n\nIn summary, if you want to raise, raise in the USA.\n\n6. Big bucks come from thinking big\n\nWhile it helps to raise in the land of the free, the Q2 report revealed another common thread in many of the best-capitalised bitcoin startups: their ambitions.\n\n'Universal' startups (those performing multiple functions in the ecosystem) raised the most funding this quarter ($50.1m), led by Circle. They were closely followed by startups offering financial services ($45.7m).\n\nIt appears it helps to think big when raising capital (Slide 44). The category, which also includes companies such as 21 Inc and Coinbase, has surpassed wallets and mining companies to become the biggest source of VC investment – now totalling above $300m (Slide 45) – which is nearly 40% of all investment (Slide 46). The remainder are yet to exceed the $100m mark.\n\nLet us know what you found the most interesting in this latest State of Bitcoin report in the comments below.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Considering most hardware wallets are pocket-sized, they have become increasingly convenient to carry around, and require no internet connection to use properly. One of the world’s leading hardware Bitcoin wallet manufacturers, Trezor, has gained the lion’s share of the market. But there is a new Trezor spinoff that will attempt to take that crown.\n\nAlso read: Coinprism is now TREZOR Compatible\n\nKeepKey – Private Bitcoin Vault With Trezor Compatibility\n\nIt has to be said, Satoshilabs, the company behind popular hardware Bitcoin wallet Trezor, has created a fine piece of software. As a result, various companies have been working on their own hardware Bitcoin wallets with a fork of the original Trezor software. KeepKey has done exactly the same, but made some modifications on the inside and outside of their device.\n\nSimilar to how other hardware Bitcoin wallets operate, KeepKey has been designed with any Bitcoin wallet software you have installed on your computer. Rather than entrusting a desktop client with your private key management, however, KeepKey will take over that role, as well as handle all transaction signing with your public key.\n\nGeneration of Bitcoin private keys occurs through KeepKey’s hardware random number generator, combined with a randomness provided by your computer. Writing down your private key is imperative to securing your Bitcoin funds, and users are given a one-time opportunity to write the key down. Rather than using a difficult string of characters, KeepKey uses a mnemonic system which displays your private key in the form of twelve random words.\n\nThe main advantages hardware Bitcoin wallets offer are secure storage and transacting. A user’s Bitcoin private key is stored on the KeepKey device itself and never leaves the device, not even when connecting it to a computer. Additionally, every KeepKey is protected with a PIN code, which renders the device useless if too many wrong attempts have been made.\n\nWhat makes KeepKey stand out from similar hardware Bitcoin wallets is it large and clear OLED screen. Not only gives this improved visibility of transactions and balance changes , but it also improves user friendliness. On top of that, there is a confirmation on the device itself, which needs to be used every time an outgoing transaction is confirmed. Such a manual approval system prevents funds from being sent to the wrong address by mistake.\n\nLast but not last, KeepKey offers a recovery process that can be used without compromising a user’s private keys. Once again, this is where the large screen on the device comes into play, as it does not require connectivity to a computer to be used. A recovery sentence is provided to the user when the KeepKey is initialized for the very first time. With the recovery sentence, a KeepKey device can be restored successfully, or a user could move their private keys onto a new device.\n\nAltcoin Support, Open Source And Upgradable Firmware\n\nIn this day and age, it is important for hardware Bitcoin wallet manufacturers to listen to community feedback and implement additional features. In the case of KeepKey, the most requested feature is supported for multiple digital currencies. At the time of publication, the list of supported coins includes Bitcoin, Testnet, Litecoin, Dash, Dogecoin and Namecoin.\n\nKeepKey is compatible with Trezor because the development of the operating environment is a fork of Trezor’s code. Certain features found in the Trezor device show up in KeepKey as well – albeit some implications may differ in usage – and more features will be added as more time progresses. Plus, KeepKey’s fork is 100% open source, and can be found on GitHub.\n\nUsers will be able to upgrade the firmware on their KeepKey, and every time a firmware change is detected, all private keys will be deleted from the device’s flash memory. Private keys are restored only if the new firmware is official and correctly signed by KeepKey, LLC. Any unofficial or modified firmware that has not been approved by KeepKey will still work, yet the device will show a warning message during the boot process regarding unofficial firmware.\n\nNote from the Author: At the time of publication, there was no official sale price listed for the KeepKey hardware Bitcoin wallet.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the KeepKey, and will you purchase one when they are available? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nSource: KeepKey website\n\nImages courtesy of KeepKey\n\nOriginally posted on: KeepKey – A Hardware Bitcoin Wallet With OLED Screen and Trezor Compatibility', 'The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) has penned an informal advisory note to community banks highlighting the potential challenges of working with bitcoin industry firms and consumers.\n\nWritten by FRBSF director Wallace Young and published in Community Banking Connections, the note suggested blockchain-based digital currencies are ""likely here to stay"". As such, Young argued that community bank professionals should make themselves aware of the potential risks.\n\nAccording to the FRBSF, these include the compliance risk, reputational risk, credit risk and operational risk of servicing both businesses that provide digital currency services and consumers who want to use such assets as collateral for other financial services.\n\nThe last scenario was perhaps the most novel of those listed, with the FRBSF advising caution, but suggesting that community banks should make case-by-case judgements.\n\nYoung wrote:\n\n""Caution is appropriate. Bankers should carefully weigh the pros and cons of extending any loan secured by bitcoins or other virtual currencies (in whole or in part), or where the source of loan repayment is in some way dependent on the virtual currency.""\n\nThe FRBSF went on to suggest that given the sometimes extreme fluctuations in the value of digital currencies against the US dollar, banks should strategize ways to supervise any holdings used as collateral.\n\n""In the event of a loan default, the bank would need to take control of the virtual currency. This will require access to the borrower’s virtual wallet and private key. All of this suggests that the loan agreement needs to be carefully crafted and that additional steps need to be taken to ensure the bank has a perfected lien on the virtual currency,"" Young continued.\n\nDefined as banks with a maximize asset size of $1bn by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), community banks account for 95% of US banking operations. Community banks serve as the main financial services provider for rural communities in the US, serving one in five counties.\n\nCommunity Banking Connections is a publication providing perspectives of the Federal Reserve staff providing supervisory guidance on challenges and concerns for these institutions.\n\nReputational risk\n\nThe FRBSF suggested that on the business side, community banks that provide services to digital currency firms should be aware of past incidents where such businesses have been the subject of legal scrutiny.\n\nNamed specifically was the 2014 insolvency of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, which is estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in consumer funds.\n\n""Since then, multiple lawsuits have been filed against Mt Gox, with several also naming Mt Gox’s bank as a defendant,"" the note continued. ""Although the bank never held the bitcoins, it did handle Mt. Gox’s transactional banking needs. At least one of the lawsuits claims that the bank should have known about the fraud and that the bank profited from the fraud.""\n\nAs such, the note suggested that community banks weigh the risks of such customers, as well as the potential legal and financial concerns. As for the compliance risks, the FRBSF stated that digital currency firms may present risks similar to traditional money transmitters.\n\nHere, the FRBSF addressed the perceived anonymity of digital currencies, suggesting that higher levels of due diligence and monitoring may be necessary for such firms.\n\n""The less-than-transparent nature of the transactions may make it more difficult for a financial institution to truly know and understand the activities of its customer and whether the customer’s activities are legal,"" the note read.\n\nOperational risk\n\nAlso discussed was how a community bank should respond to situations where it finds itself the owner of digital currency as a result of the need to collect on debt.\n\n""The most likely scenario in which this could occur is when a bank makes a business loan secured by the borrower’s business assets, which at default include virtual currency. At the moment, such a scenario is unlikely, but its plausibility increases as virtual currency becomes more mainstream,"" the article read.\n\nGiven the risk of volatility, the FRBSF recommends institutions liquidate these funds ""in an orderly fashion"", suggesting internal controls would be needed to mitigate loss.\n\n""Management should establish dual control and access processes, as well as think about how this asset will be valued and accounted for on its financial statements,"" it continued.\n\nFurther consideration, the report suggested, would need to be given to how the digital currency is held and how it could be kept secure prior to sale.\n\nBank image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While the $100,000 isn\'t a seal of approval per se, it does indicate the foundation is willing to give bitcoin a try, Bloch said.\n\n""I know that the Gates Foundation has had some events and internal debates around bitcoin, so I think because of that timing they\'ve said \'Lets give them a grant for 18 months and see, does it work? Is it increasing the ability for merchants to accept mobile money payments, or is Bill right?\'""\n\nWith the money, Bitsoko is running a year-long research study on whether its three-pronged service – a consumer wallet, a merchant processor and an API – can spur mobile money adoption in the east and west of the continent.\n\nCurrently in beta with a select number of users, it will launch officially on 25th September this year.\n\nPayPal for mobile money\n\nDespite the mobile money boom, and the success of projects such as Kenya\'s MPesa, there is one problem that persists: interoperability.\n\nIn 2013, 52 of the world\'s countries had more than one mobile money source – a term used to describe each telecom\'s \'brand\' of cash. In Ghana, for example, where Bitsoko is running half of its trial, there are five main telecoms.\n\nThis variety of payment methods creates friction on both sides of the till. Due to the fees and set up costs involved, Bloch said, local merchants will typically accept only one type of mobile cash. However, consumers will still need to convert their funds from, say, AirTel to MTN, to accommodate for this when they shop, and face high fees when doing so.\n\nEnter Bitsoko, a way to accept many currencies and cash out in just one, which Bloch described as a kind of PayPal for mobile money.\n\nUsers top-up their online wallet, they pay in the money of their choice, and – via the blockchain – the merchant receives payment in the form of currency they prefer, allowing them to leapfrog the hassle and fees involved in changing between currencies.\n\n""As mobile money grows, we see Bitsoko as a solution that can really help merchants lower their costs to either be equivalent or lower than existing systems and not have additional fees by having to accept more than one and go back and forth.""\n\nWhile there are plans to support non-smartphone models in the future – Bitsoko is ""exploring opportunities"" with SMS wallets, Bloch said – currently the target market is the young, vibrant tech community in Nairobi, aka the Silicon Savannah.\n\nFor this reason, and for the purposes of the grant, Bitsoko will be focusing solely on bitcoin top-ups for now, though it will allow users to top-up via cash, bank transfer or mobile money in the future.\n\nPhase two\n\nBut what does any of this have to do with health? Well, if the project can produce hard evidence that it has been successful in its mission to save merchants time and money with bitcoin, the team\'s plan for phase two of the grant (which can be up to $1m) will be an expansion into industry-specific payment processing for institutions such as hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe hard evidence it needs comes in the form of customer acquisition, retention and cost savings for the 40 merchants – 20 in Kenya\'s capital, Nairobi, and the other 20 in Accra, Ghana – taking part in the trial. All data will be tracked via Bitsoko\'s merchant analytics and customer loyalty platforms.\n\n""We want to offer merchants data on their store they didn\'t know,"" Bloch said. Bitsoko is hoping that, by using this information, companies will be able to adapt their stores to suit the needs of their customers and their business, for example optimising a menu or providing better loyalty cards.\n\nCurrently, this comes for free. However, the company is weighing the merits of a monthly payment model, versus a 0.1% transaction fee once the trial is over. If merchants choose to stick with the platform, and pay, this could improve Bitsoko\'s chances of receiving more funds from the foundation.\n\nAbout Bitsoko\n\nBloch first met Bitsoko\'s two other founders, brothers Allan and Gibson Juma, through the Crypto College Network (CCN) which he started in January 2014 as a way to meet other students into bitcoin.\n\nThe Jumas, though not students, were working out of Kenyatta University’s incubator at the time. After discovering CCN online, they got in touch with Bloch, who helped them plan Nairobi\'s first bitcoin meetup last September. Bloch decided to join Bitsoko full time after his graduation.\n\nThe team has since expanded, bringing on Africa\'s only bitcoin core developer, Tawanda Kembo; Emmanuel Noah, who heads up business development in Ghana and Jessica Colaco, Bitsoko\'s head of research.\n\nBitsoko\'s home in the tech hub of Nairobi means the team have witnessed the scene\'s ""amazing energy"" and daily events for investors, NGOs and international corporations.\n\nFor this reason, Bloch is confident the region will see more companies like Bitsoko and remittance platform BitPesa, which raised £1.1m from US-centric investors back in February, springing up.\n\nHowever, there is still some way to go: ""The main part holding back investors ... I think the scene will increase as education and collaboration increases.""\n\nBitsoko hopes to play a part in this, starting with a series of educational events. Its first workshop this month, which took place in the city’s iHub centre, saw over 60 developers attend. This, Bloch said, speaks to the level of interest from those looking for a way in to the industry.\n\nAdditionally, the startup has also been pleasantly surprised about the enthusiasm for the currency itself. ""We\'ve noticed that a lot of people want bitcoin currently, and in Kenya and in Ghana there is a population that does want bitcoin and who is going to, we think, enjoy the volatility aspect,"" Bloch said.\n\nThis speaks to the fact the population has had to adjust to radical changes in payments since the rise of systems like MPesa, but not just this:\n\n""You have others like those we work with in Zimbabwe who in their lifetime have seen their currency collapse to valueless and so ... people see the fragility of fiat money and the need to innovate and have stronger systems.""\n\nFeatured image: JStone / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Remember back in the 1980’s when you had to deposit US$0.25 to make a call on the payphone?\n\nYou had to share a phone, and its germs, with who-knows-who, if you could find a public phone that wasn’t broken. Common pay phones didn’t take dollars, pennies, or debit cards. Imagine making a public phone call with a credit card?\n\nImagine trying to do any basic phone call with your credit card?\n\nThe processing fees are too high, and even Skype makes you deposit US$10 into an account balance. What if you could use bitcoin and its innovative low-cost fee infrastructure to be perfect payment mechanism for a simple-to-use payphone.\n\nDon’t most people have cell phones now? Sure do! Out of the 7.2 billion people on Earth, about 6 billion have access to mobile phones. Only 4.5 billion have access to working toilets. The big question is how do those 6 billion people pay for their cell phones?\n\nThe most common answer, worldwide, is through pre-paid programs. In the US, 25 percent of American mobile phone customers use a pre-paid plan, but this pales in comparison to most other parts of the world. In Western Europe, 70 percent use prepaid. In the world’s largest markets, i.e. China, India, and Africa, pre-paid phone usage reaches 70, 95, and 99 percent, respectively.\n\nLet’s say you have a smartphone. Most carriers will tell you that they offer “Unlimited talk and text” but it’s not true. If you have a current plan, you know that all the major carriers have dropped the idea of “unlimited data.” Even plans that claimed to offer unlimited minutes actually have a fair usage policy which is, in effect, a limit. By charging for usage, they can limit usage and/or bring in the money that they feel is required to support it.\n\nSince the Rockin’ 80’s, phone companies have come a long way in the technology department. When the internet provided a high enough bandwidth level to support voice, many companies began switching from traditional PSTN phone lines to using VoIP (Voice over IP) which allows for cheaper calls because the calls are handled by the internet’s infrastructure instead of the carrier.\n\nIn the early days of VoIP this lead to bad voice quality as the internet didn’t allow for packet prioritization and voice packets could get lost or delayed in route, leading to a less than ideal call quality. The sound technology has improved, but VoIP still requires a phone.\n\nSkype Changes Everything\n\nIf you have a “Softphone” like Skype, a Mic and Speakers is needed and you have to install software. With the 2003 advent of Skype, users can call and talk to other Skype users without a phone number. They are both registered with Skype, so you no longer need a phone number to connect.\n\nSkype handles the peer-to-peer negotiation via its network and you use a Skype handle to connect. Skype can also call phone numbers, but you need Skype credit because the carriers still charge money when you are using their network to call a phone number. Credits on Skype begin at US$10.\n\nSkype has downsides besides needing credit to call normal phone numbers and the need to download programs. Your information and calls are centralized and being poured over by third parties and state-run agencies. Privacy and Skype just don’t mix, as CoinTelegraph has recently chronicled regarding the new, safer alternatives available on the market.\n\nThe next-generation in digital phone calling is known as WebRTC, or “Web Real-Time Communications.” WebRTC turns your browser itself into a Skype-like application. It’s built into the latest versions of Chrome & Firefox, and rumors have it being included in Internet Explorer 12. No more software like the softphone or Skype needed, you can just use your browser!\n\nOf course if you want to talk to your friends with WebRTC, you’ll still need some way to “connect” since there is no phone number and no Skype directory; how will your browser find your friend?\n\nThis will be beneficial for Web customer support. Imagine just clicking a “Click here to speak with customer service” link on your favorite web-site without needing Skype, or even a phone. Your browser will just ask to use your mic and speakers and connect you. At this point, WebRTC cannot dial a PSTN phone number by itself, so the beat goes on for a perfect phone that offers privacy, convenience, and versatility.\n\nWhat is BitPhone?\n\nBitphone, from Solid Cloud, is designed to take the best parts out of all of the above and fuse them into one web-based application, currently in beta. It’s a Web RTC based phone that can call SIP addresses, PSTN Phones and provide Peer-to-Peer communications. It works as an anonymous payphone. You don’t even need to register for its use. You can just go to the website from your phone, Internet Cafe, or local library, deposit some bitcoin, and simply place a call anywhere in the world. Bitcoin and its superior ability to utilize cost-efficient micro-payments takes care of the rest.\n\n“Skype is great for Peer-to-Peer communications and talking with your friends and family,” Gavin Stevens, founder of Solid Cloud LLC and Bitphone told CoinTelegraph. “Skype does need to be installed however which can't be done on many corporate or public computers. When calling phones, Skype's rates are quite high and the US$10 Skype credit minimum which you'll never get back is frustrating.”\n\nHe continued:\n\n“Bitphone is ideal due to its portable nature ‘No install required’ We also offer cheaper rates than Skype for registered users. Plus you only deposit what you need and can get your change back when you're done.”\n\nFor those who do register at BitPhone.net, they’ll be able to get a dedicated SIP address, phone number, and a WebRTC URL to give to others to place free calls and conference calls. Bitphone.net is the first new technology phone service that combines WebRTC/Bitcoin/PSTN/SIP/Peer-Peer/SMS all in one service. You’ll be able to place calls to/from any device that has an internet connection and mic/speakers. Bitphone turns any web browser into a payphone where you can place global, encrypted calls.\n\n“Bitphone uses 2048 bit RSA protection for all usage of the site, registered or not,” added Stevens. “To break a 2048-bit SSL certificate would take a little over 6.4 quadrillion years of computer processing time. The WebRTC protocol also includes DTLS encryption. DTLS is a derivative of SSL, meaning your data will be as secure as using any standard SSL-based connection.” He added:\n\n“WebRTC media streams are encrypted with SRTP, the SRTP key exchange is performed end-to-end with DTLS-SRTP. This ensures that any kind of man-in-the-middle attack can be detected and the two WebRTC endpoints can be sure that nobody can spy on their conversation. DTLS is standardized and built into all browsers that support WebRTC. We plan to include a video portal feature in a future version of Bitphone, utilizing more of the capabilities that WebRTC provides.”\n\nUsers can change “Caller ID” to anything they desire. Users can “pay-as-you-go,” with no commitment or contracts. Anonymous calls can be made hiding your Caller ID. It works on most devices and smartphones. Plus, refund your bitcoin balance whenever you'd like, and no credit card payments, since only digital currencies are accepted by Bitphone. Bitphone accepts bitcoin, dash, litecoin, dogecoin, startcoin, ripple, mastercoin, namecoin, and many others. You can use the website without registering, but registered users save 15-25% on rates.\n\nFirst trial\n\nBear in mind that it is in beta, so there may still be some operational bugs to be worked out. I tried it personally and loaded an account with bitcoins easily, but the call feature did not appear on my first try with the service. The problem was that I was using a Mac with Chrome, and this combination requires certain Flash installations. I switched to the Safari browser, and not only did it work, but I spoke to someone I hadn’t been able to reach by phone in over six months!\n\nI’m impressed with the concept and the simple, user-friendly nature of Bitphone. After using it, I feel this new service has the potential to be a bulls-eye hit with a target market that is clearly looking for a more secure P2P option in telecommunications than Skype currently offers.\n\nThe best part is it is custom-built to work directly with the growing global Bitcoin community, not as a secondary revenue stream for one of the legacy providers. This was made by a Bitcoin enthusiast for the community and what Bitcoin user wouldn’t support that?"", ""Thanks to some proposed tweaks, we could be seeing the Lightning Network a lot sooner than expected.\n\nBitcoin scalability is a hot topic—one manifestation being the blocksize debate—and Bitcoin engineers are working on fixes. In its current form, Bitcoin supports 7 transactions per second, while Visa supports roughly 45,000 per second.\n\nThe Lightning Network, co-authored by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, proposes a system that supports instant transactions and greatly boosts the number of possible transactions per block. Two parties can transact through trustless payment channels that are “off” the blockchain. These bi-directional channels enable instant, reliable transactions, with a final transaction settling on the blockchain. The system relies on hashed time-locked contracts (HTLCs), which expire if not completed by the recipient in an allotted amount of time.\n\nIn a paper titled “Reaching The Ground With Lightning,” developer Rusty Russell offered tweaks that simplify the Lightning Network, like removing additional opcodes that would take additional time to win approval among developers. The proposal already requires three soft forks—for transaction malleability, OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY—but these changes are widely accepted. The first-version whitepaper explains:\n\n“Adding a new signature opcode would allow many other improvements but that is precisely why it's a matter for longer term research and unlikely to be deployed in Bitcoin in the immediate future.”\n\nRussel is Core Tech Engineer at Blockstream, the startup known for pioneering pegged sidechains. He explained on Reddit, “It's not a fundamental advance, but it is a practical advance.”\n\nThe Lightning Network is still not off the ground, but one of the developers thinks it could mean faster deployment. Poon commented enthusiastically on the Lightning-dev mailing list:\n\n“The proposed construction with OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY may make lightning be deployed *much* sooner. Rusty's idea is fantastic and goes very far in creating a usable way to really try out lightning on Bitcoin.”\n\n“I'll have an update of my paper incorporating these changes, they're really significant,” he added.\n\n- Joseph Poon at SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar""]"
07/24/2015,"['NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss earlier this week filed paperwork to operate a bitcoin exchange called Gemini for both individual and institutional investors in New York state, a spokeswoman said on Friday.\n\nThe twins, best known for accusing Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea, want to make the digital currency mainstream in the United States.\n\nUnlike conventional money, bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Bitcoin is not backed by a government or central bank and its value fluctuates according to demand by users.\n\nThe Winklevoss brothers filed an application on July 21 with the New York State Department of Financial Services to operate as a trust company.\n\nItBit also filed a trust application in New York in February. In May, it became the first virtual currency company to receive a charter in the state.\n\nCameron Winklevoss (L) speaks in front of a New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) virtual currency hearing in front of his brother Tyler in the Manhattan borough of New York January 28, 2014. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nA trust company is a type of financial institution technically different from a bank, according to a blog by Houman Shadab, an expert on bitcoin regulations and a professor at the New York Law School.\n\nUnder New York state’s banking law, a trust company has all the powers of a bank to take deposits and make loans, alongside certain fiduciary powers such as acting as an agent for governmental bodies, he wrote.\n\nExamples of trust companies in New York include securities custodian the Depository Trust Company, the wealth and asset manager Northern Trust, and the Bank of New York Mellon.\n\nLast year Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, was forced to file for bankruptcy after hackers stole an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin’s value has been highly volatile, having peaked at over $1,200 in late 2013 before crashing after the Mt. Gox attack. One bitcoin is currently worth around $289 on the BitStamp platform.', ""The MIT Media Lab has unveiled that it is working on a Bitcoin-based encryption system that lets users securely share data over a decentralized computational network. The system, called Enigma, could offer drastically improved privacy features on the Internet.\n\nEnigma, which is still in its prototype phase, is set to solve a classic problem in data security. Similar to a process known as “homomorphic encryption,” the system would allow data to be shared and used for computation while remaining undecipherable. Interestingly, this could potentially enable the recreation of all sorts of Internet services – be it search engines, data bases or web shops – without the need to share any personal information with these services.\n\nThe way Enigma works is that it cuts data in pieces, encrypts is, and randomly distributes it over the Enigma network in little chunks. None of the nodes on the network can read the data. But each node is able to process its own piece of information despite it being encrypted, and can send the results of these computations back to the original user. The user then decrypts and recombines all of the individual pieces to derive the final result.\n\nSpeaking to Wired, MIT Media Lab graduate researcher and one of Enigma’s creators, Guy Zyskind explained:\n\n“You can see it as a black box. […] You send whatever data you want, and it runs in the black box and only returns the result. The actual data is never revealed, neither to the outside nor to the computers running the computations inside.”\n\n- Enigma creators Guy Zyskind and Oz Nathan\n\nIn order to keep track of all of the different pieces of information on the Enigma network without needing to rely on a trusted entity, the system makes use of blockchain technology to embed data. While the system itself is largely platform agnostic, and could work with other blockchains as well, the team is currently working to build Enigma on top of Bitcoin.\n\nZyskind told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“We're not specifically designing for the Bitcoin blockchain – any blockchain with a digital currency would do. Since currently Bitcoin is the most widely used, and therefore the most secure, we're interfacing with that first.”\n\nMuch like Bitcoin itself, the Enigma system is not completely free to use, but requires a small fee – to be paid in bitcoin. Users pay a fee to the nodes on the Enigma network as a an incentive to store and process the data. On top of that, of course, a mining fee needs to be paid to embed data in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nFor more information on the specifics of Enigma, see MIT's full white paper."", 'Australian cryptocurrency firm DigitalBTC bought $10.1m worth of bitcoin in Q2 of this year, the company\'s latest quarterly report reveals.\n\nThis brings the amount of bitcoin the company has purchased over the past 12 months to almost $29.7m.\n\nThe report also shows DigitalBTC – the first crypto firm to list on Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), under Digital CC Limited – closed the quarter with an inventory of $1m in bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, the company reported a negative operating cashflow of $1.2m in Q2 of 2015 having received around $10.8m for operating activities, but spending close to $12m.\n\nExpansion\n\nInitially a bitcoin mining company, DigitalBTC has so far expanded into bitcoin trading as well as developing both retail and consumer applications.\n\nThe company\'s private liquidity platform digitalX Direct achieved unaudited revenues of $5.5m in the quarter, which is a 45% increase on the revenue generated in the first quarter of the year.\n\nOver the past three months, the company has been exploring an additional venture into the global remittances market with a soon-to-launch peer-to-peer solution called AirPocket.\n\n""This enables value and cash transfers from anyone to anywhere in the world, and for the value to be easily exchanged across mobile messaging platforms,"" the report states.\n\nThe company aims to initially roll out AirPocket in Latin America and the Caribbean using $3.5m raised through a share placement.\n\nBack in February, Digital CC Limited announced it had suffered a net loss of $2.3m after tax in the six-month period leading up to 31st December 2014.\n\nThis article was co-authored by Emily Spaven.\n\nBalance sheet image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Its headquarters are in Singapore and it has offices South Africa, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia and Nigeria. The Series A funding round was led by South Africa’s Naspers Group.\n\n“There’s a lot of talk in finance of ‘the next billion’ and a big part of this next billion will come out of Africa,” Werner said via email. “Bitcoin is particularly great when you have low-value payments since there isn’t a fixed minimum fee that gets charged to send it.”\n\nAnother advantage for bitcoin in Africa is the high level of mobile phone penetration, Werner said. “Soon anyone will be able to download a bitcoin wallet on their Android device, transfer some bitcoin in and make payments, be it to the person sitting next to them or sitting on the other side of the world.”\n\nEarlier this month, BitX launched a bitcoin exchange and services in Nigeria. It joins ICE3x in that market, which launched the country’s first bitcoin exchange in January.\n\nMeanwhile, startup Bitsoko recently won a $100,000 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which it will use to expand its bitcoin services from Kenya, where it’s now in beta, to other countries in the region.\n\n“Bitsoko is building a user Bitcoin wallet and merchant payment processor that will allow people to spend Bitcoin at any merchant that currently accepts mobile money. We offer the merchants extended tools such as analytics, customer loyalty program, payroll software, and more to make their payment system easier,” said Daniel Bloch, head of business development.\n\nOne such merchant is Basaka, a backpack company in Sierra Leone, Bloch said. “They are our first Bitsoko powered company as we will be assisting them in accepting payments and converting their funds into Splash mobile money.”\n\nBitsoko is also among the 30 startups selected from 600 applicants for this year’s DEMO Africa pitching event slated for Nigeria in September.\n\nBitcoin’s success in Africa requires three things, according to BitX’s Werner: companies like BitX that continue to engage with government regulators, developers building more innovative products and uses for the cryptocurrency, and simply getting more people to start using it as a means of transacting business.\n\nBitsoko’s Bloch believes that in five years, there will be Bitcoin companies in every country in Africa. Key to that growth is building platforms for other developers to use, he added, and Bitsoko aims to be the platform for others to create innovative applications.', ""The Federal Reserve published a brief paper highlighting the growth of virtual currencies; NASDAQ is expected to be the first major exchange operator to use blockchain technology, and more top stories for July 24.\n\nFederal Reserve Publishes Study on Virtual Currencies\n\nThe Federal Reserve published a brief paper named “What Community Bankers Should Know About Virtual Currencies.”\n\nThe publication highlights the growth of virtual currencies and the fact that they still only represent a fraction of all US dollars in circulation.

While Bitreserve users could already store, send, receive, buy and sell nine different currencies, it has now added the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, New Zealand dollar, Singapore dollar, Kenyan shillings, and the Israeli shekel.\n\nBitreserve’s Vice President of Product Byrne Reese said:"", 'It seems like every time bitcoin takes a step forward in shaking off its somewhat nefarious roots, someone pops up to ruin it.\n\nIn this case, there’s actually two someones.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department announced earlier this week (July 21) that it had charged two Florida men, Anthony Murgio and Yuri Lebedev, for illegally operating an underground bitcoin exchange. The unlicensed online bitcoin exchange allegedly was used to help “tens of thousands of clients” misdirect roughly $2 million worth of the digital currency.\n\nThe federal complaint alleges that Murgio and Lebedev aided cybercriminals in conducting illegal activity in connection with the illegally-ran bitcoin exchange Coin.mx.\n\nHere’s how the case went down, according to the Feds:\n\nThe co-conspirators, as they are being referenced, have operated the exchange since at least late 2013. The service operated in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws and enabled their customers to exchange cash for bitcoins.\n\n“In doing so, they knowingly exchanged cash for people whom they believed may be engaging in criminal activity. Murgio and his co-conspirators have also knowingly exchanged cash for bitcoins for victims of ‘ransomware’ attacks,” the complaint reads. “In doing so, Murgio, and his co-conspirators knowingly enabled the criminals responsible for those attacks to receive the proceeds of their crimes, yet, in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws, Murgio never filed any suspicious activity reports regarding any of the transactions.”\n\nWhat this means is that Murgio and Lebedev are accused of enabling the transactions for hackers that would prey on people to pay ransom to gain access back to those devices. Those hackers allegedly received payments in bitcoin, which was converted into cash through the bitcoin exchange.\n\nWhile Murgio and Lebedev didn’t conduct the crimes themselves, the Fed’s complaint asserts that, by not notifying the authorities of the suspicious activity, they were guilty by association. And it didn’t help that the bitcoin exchange they were running was unlicensed.\n\nBut the plot doesn’t stop there. The complaint alleges that Murgio and Lebedev attempted to hit the transaction activity by creating a company called the “Collectables Club” — a business that presented itself as an organization to collect sports memorabilia, etc.\n\nMeanwhile, while that fake organization operated as a front, the duo was sending thousands of dollars to banks in Cyprus, Hong Kong, and Eastern Europe. They also received hundreds of thousands of dollars from bank accounts in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nBetter than anything on cable these days.\n\nBitcoin Tracker Week 83\n\nThe Good, The Bad — The Top Bitcoin Stories Of The Week\n\nBitcoin A No-Go For eBay Merchant\n\neBay has cracked down on one seller who tried to accept bitcoin as a form of payment. Reports indicated that Andy Shroder, a solar energy researcher and panel manufacturer, had listed that the cryptocurrency was a payment method he accepted. But eBay said no way.\n\nThe auction site sent him an email stating that bitcoin does not currency for two “key factors” – namely, security and ease of use. Shroder subsequently posted on Reddit that his merchant listing had been removed.\n\nThe email to him reads: “Please understand that you mentioned you accept ‘Bitcoin’ as a method of payment. Some online payment companies are fairly new and inexperienced and they do not provide sufficient fraud protection to members. When we review payment methods to determine whether they are allowed on eBay, two key factors that we consider are ‘Security and Safety’ and ‘Ease of use.’ Please do not offer this payment method.”\n\nIs Bitcoin The “Ebola” Of Banking?\n\nComparing bitcoin to ebola might be a bit harsh, but that’s what one bitcoin startup founder said the banking community has compared the digital currency to.\n\n“Bitcoin is synonymous with Ebola to the banking community – it has been tainted by scams and hacks,” Frank Schuil, founder of Safello, a bitcoin startup.\n\nBut luckily for Safello, one major U.K. bank is willing to take a chance on the digital currency. Barclays has signed on as the first U.K. high street bank to explore bitcoin and the blockchain technology. The bank has reportedly signed a “proof of concept” with the bitcoin startup to explore the tech.\n\nBitcoin Price Settles Back Below $300\n\nWell, the hype over bitcoin and the Greek Debt Crisis seems it may have come to an end. Bitcoin will likely have its day in the sun and jump back above $300 someday, but for now, it’s settled back to the mid $270s.\n\nThe trend for most of the year has been closer to the mid $200s. Only time will tell if the Greek crisis and all of the PR that went along with it for bitcoin will get more people to buy in.\n\nIt’s likely to be a LOOOOOONG time before it sees its all-time high of $1,242.\n\nNASDAQ Leads The Bitcoin Exchange Race\n\nReports had surfaced earlier in the year about how NASDAQ had shown interest in bitcoin’s technology, and now it appears it is getting closer to showing its bitcoin cards.\n\nThe stock market exchange said it’s partnering with infrastructure provider Chain to determine how it can use the blockchain as part of a way to both issue and transfer shares of privately held companies.\n\nNasdaq Chief Executive Officer Bob Greifeld told Bloomberg that the blockchain will be “of fundamental importance to Wall Street,” later noting that “the benefits to the industry are immense and cannot be ignored.”\n\n“We also plan to announce further blockchain initiatives in the future,” Greifeld said. “The application of blockchain technology within Nasdaq’s private market aims to modernize, streamline and really secure cumbersome administrative functions.”\n\nWhat Will Be Bitcoin’s “Killer App?”\n\nWhat does bitcoin need next? A killer app, says Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. That’s what might help push the currency toward the mainstream, educating the segment of the population who still doesn’t know what a bitcoin is.\n\nHe suggests that a bitcoin app to end spam might just be the next big thing.\n\n“In 10 years I think we are going to be sitting here and the Internet will look a lot prettier because bitcoin came into existence,” he said in an interview.\n\nYes, Another Bitcoin Ransom Scam\n\nAnother day, another bitcoin scam. This time, it’s in the U.K., where a cybersecurity watchdog official has released warnings about scams that are being sent out appearing to be from government agencies.\n\nThese scams involve bitcoin ransomware attacks that are gaining access to user’s computer files until a bitcoin ransom is paid out. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau said that the hackers are sending emails that appear to be from the U.K. Home Office or the Ministry of Justice to gain access to those user’s computers.\n\nWhere SMBs Are Embracing Bitcoin\n\nIf you travel to Argentina, you might find that some businesses are pretty bitcoin friendly. In fact, more small business owners have caught the bitcoin bug and are willing to test it out, one report suggests.\n\nIn an interview with The Financial Times, a local hotel owner in Buenos Aires shares her story about how she learned about bitcoin and decided to use the digital currency to avoid Argentina’s strict regulations around capital.\n\nTurns out, taking bitcoin has been a great business decision since she can make more money without having to deal with the exchange rates from foreign tourist payments. Capital controls in Argentina have been especially difficult on small businesses in the region, but bitcoin has been a way around that.\n\n“I was suspicious at first,” Soledad Rodríguez Pons said in the interview. “But I took the risk, and it was well worth it.', 'This week, the first documented Bitcoin transaction in Cuba was put in the history books. Although people have been visiting Cuba since the advent of Bitcoin, this is the first public transaction, considered significant in large part because of recent changes that swept the tiny island nation off the U.S. coast.\n\nWashington D.C. and Cuba have opened up relations in recent months after the formal restoration of diplomacy. Five decades long the United States and Cuba spent devoid of the benefits of working together. The Obama Administration liberalized economic life for Cubans on the island, and Cuban-Americans, with many recent reforms, and Congress will likely be asked to lift the trade embargo and end its travel restrictions for the island.\n\n“It’s about showing Cubans and the Bitcoin community that it is now possible to receive Bitcoin through Nauta, the Cuban state-run public Wi-Fi,” Fernando Villar, BitcoinCuba founder, told CCN. “This will hopefully open everyone’s eyes on the possibilities and finally put Cuba on the Bitcoin map.” The idea came about spontaneously.\n\n“I was taking a personal trip to Cuba to visit family and friends on the island,” Villar told CCN. “I asked [CoinStructive CEO] Chris Groshong a few days before my trip, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if you could send me some Bitcoin from the U.S. to Cuba through the new public Wi-Fi networks?’”. The rest is history.\n\nI didn’t know if it would truly work, but I had my camera handy when it did. I was not only able to receive the Bitcoin but also send some back.\n\nBitcoinCuba believes there is big potential for Bitcoin in Cuba, but Villar remains cautious of the historical hurdles the island nation will have to overcome.\n\n“The future for Bitcoin in Cuba is promising, but it’s going to take some time and effort,” Villar said. “Cubans are only now being connected through public Wi-Fi, which is somewhat cost prohibitive at $2 an hour, with the average Cuban salary about $20 a month.” To be certain, the Wi-Fi parks are incredible to see, Villar says.\n\n“Cubans bring their smartphones, laptops and tablets to these parks to get connected to friends and family, as well as to learn about the world outside the island,” Villar tells CCN. “It’s only a matter of time before they also start receiving money through those networks.” Of all the things the Castro regime suppresses, technology and innovation are not among them, according to Villar. Due to capital controls in the nation, Bitcoin could make life easier for many people.\n\n“Right now Cubans deal with a dual currency system that makes it prohibitive for Cubans to compete in a global market. There aren’t many currency exchanges in which people are buying up Cuban pesos or convertible pesos, so their currency is essentially worthless outside of the island,” informs Villar.\n\n“We strongly feel that even a minimal adoption to Bitcoin will start to help Cuban entrepreneurs sell their goods or service globally in a simple and efficient way,” he says. “These entrepreneurs are going to be the ones that are going to elevate the economy in the near future.”\n\nVillar used the Airbitz wallet, as seen in the video, for the transaction. The wallet won first place in the start-up competition this year in New York City at the Inside Bitcoins Conference. Known for it’s easy-to-use design, Airbitz also integrates a detailed Bitcoin merchant directory, so mobile users can locate a store and spend bitcoins on the same application. Airbitz’s decentralized infrastructure has made it one of the most popular Bitcoin wallets on the market.\n\n“The beauty of this occurrence is that as a company, Airbitz had nothing to do with it!” Paul Puey, CEO of Airbitz, told CCN. “We simply build the best product we can, and both the sender and recipient in Cuba felt that the best option was Airbitz.”\n\nI’d like to think we did some cool, creative PR stunt, but it was the organic growth of people deciding to use Airbitz.\n\nThe Airbitz team understands the importance of BitcoinCuba’s work on the island.\n\n“From what we have heard, Bitcoin is still barely understood or heard of in Cuba. Knowledge is the biggest issue and we’re happy to see organizations such as bitcoincuba.org make a strong effort to empower their citizens with knowledge about Bitcoin,” Puey said.\n\nFor now, Cuba remains an outwardly centrally planned economy. Many anticipate it will take a long time for the country to promote private enterprise and allow political reforms. Some believe Cuban authorities could tighten state controls in the short-term. Cubans remain divided on the issues. Does the island encourage foreign investment and private enterprises or does it stick to its socialist paradigm, which offers – as some experts believe – better education and health care than is available to most Latin Americans? Whatever the path they choose, Bitcoin has not waited.\n\n“With a country so steeped in the chains of capital controls, restricted trade, and even limited access to digital information, Cuban citizens will quickly find amazing benefits from the financial freedom that Bitcoin can,” Puey said. “The possibility to bring them free trade, easily purchased Internet access, and the ability to send and receive money globally will be greatly appreciated by Cubans.”\n\nFor once we have a currency that knows no boundaries and it turns the borders we draw between countries from imaginary to non-existent.\n\nVillar became involved in Bitcoin in late 2013 after reading articles about the currency on Reddit. In February 2015, he founded BitcoinCuba.org because he believed Bitcoin and the block chain could massively help the lives of Cubans. Being of Cuban descent, Villar has friends and family that send remittances to Cuba. “There isn’t a better, cheaper and faster way to send remittances than through Bitcoin,” he told CCN.\n\nAccording to Villar, there isn’t quite yet a Bitcoin scene, per se, in Cuba – namely, in Havana. And so, CoinStructive, where Villar is a senior consultant, and BitcoinCuba, have partnered to circulate Bitcoin and Blockchain educational materials including videos in Spanish to create awareness about the digital currency.\n\n“We hope that sometime soon we will be able to run a Bitcoin and Blockchain workshop in Havana to promote the currency and technology,” he says.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article."", 'It\'s perhaps best explained by a car crash.\n\nAs veteran entrepreneur Armin Ebrahimi tells it in interview, his car was hit by a truck two nights ago. The driver had no insurance, and he had little reason to trust him because of the poor quality of his government-issued driver\'s license.\n\n""The picture didn\'t really match him. It was difficult to know it\'s him, the picture was a little more clean cut. It\'s got a PO box address on it, so I took the information I could,"" Ebrahimi explained.\n\nEbrahimi isn\'t just any driver. He\'s also the CEO of ShoCard, a blockchain technology startup that\'s seeking to harness the power of bitcoin\'s distributed ledger to solve pain points with authentication such as those in this process. Whether it\'s a true story or a convenient anecdote is unclear. Either way, the story cuts to the core of how ShoCard and blockchain technology can intercede and solve problems inherent in such an incident.\n\nShoCard, Ebrahimi asserts, aims to function as a mobile ID that can be verified in real time using a combination of cryptography and the immutability of bitcoin\'s ledger. Perhaps most importantly, the company asserts identifying information could be verifiable without requiring users to give up control of their data.\n\nInvestors are already convinced the company has found a powerful use case for the technology. ShoCard recently raised $1.5m in funding from investors including AME Cloud Ventures and Digital Currency Group.\n\nIn interview, Ebrahimi provided a deeper dive into the underlying tech of the product he hopes will transform identity on the web, mobile and real world.\n\nEbrahimi told CoinDesk:\n\n""We create a private and public key pair that allows you to access the blockchain and create separate key pairs for each of the fields that you\'re going to be storing [on your ShoCard]. So you have a master private key and private keys for individual data fields.""\n\nWhile top of mind given his recent experience, Ebrahimi sees ShoCard as effective beyond insurance incidents, impacting how people verify themselves to e-commerce providers, banks or any third party to whom they must prove their identity to.\n\nShoCard in practice\n\nThough still in the pre-launch phase, ShoCard\'s digital ID provides details such as the full name, address, signature, date of birth and physical details of each user. While it looks like a mobile driver\'s license and contains the same information, the difference, according to Ebrahimi, is each field on the ShoCard is protected with cryptography.\n\n""We create signatures for each field. We create a hash that encrypts the data that\'s on there, then we create a digital signature of it, then put it on the blockchain,"" he explains.\n\nShoCard doesn\'t put the user\'s data on the blockchain, rather just its own cryptographic proof that the data is correct.\n\n""All you can do is validate that later,"" he added. ""I would give you my public key and name and say here\'s my entry on the blockchain with a signature. You can use that data to go in and validate it, but I have to provide you my name to validate it.""\n\nIf both parties in the car crash were using the ShoCard system, Ebrahimi said, the app could be made to produce a QR code that when scanned could allow the users to pass the blockchain record of their identities to each other securely.\n\n""My ShoCard would go in, pull the data out of it to verify that it is on the blockchain. Let\'s say [the truck driver] was certified by the DMV and his bank. I could look at those [certifications] and say that these are ones that I can trust.""\n\nAdditionally, users could have control over what they share. In the instance of a car crash, a user might need to take another party\'s name and address before submitting it to a third party like an insurance provider.\n\n""I don\'t have to see everything else,"" he continued. ""I don\'t need to ask for his weight and eye color.""\n\nA similar exchange, he said, could also take place without QR codes using a Wi-Fi transfer protocol such as Apple\'s AirDrop. Either way, digital data is validated securely using bitcoin\'s secure digital ledger.\n\nBeating Facebook\n\nStill, Ebrahimi believes ShoCard will perhaps be most immediately useful online, where online authentication is increasingly handled by Internet giants such as Google and Facebook.\n\nPart of the current problem, Ebrahimi argues, is that these companies earn revenue from reselling data, and further, they have the ability to update their policies often, and in ways that might not always be friendly to users.\n\nShoCard, Ebrahimi believes, could compete against these systems if it could achieve a similar scale because the blockchain would help return control to users.\n\n""Until the blockchain there was no way to build the best infrastructure, keep it as secure as you can and make sure no one can compromise what\'s inside. There are so many public cases where credit card data is breached, we see that happen publicly over and over.""\n\nA former CEO of Buysight and Advertising.com, Ebrahimi was also a platform engineer at Yahoo until 2008. There, he managed Yahoo\'s user ID and login strategy, insight which he says allowed him to see the benefits of bitcoin.\n\n""I was very fascinated with bitcoin and the infrastructure beneath it,"" he said. ""What I found is it provides a dramatically different approach to solving the problem and that the solution could be uniquely different than what was possible.""\n\nHe argued the blockchain provides compelling benefits even when compared to two-factor authentication, which he said has recently proven susceptible to hacking and interference.\n\n""Two factor is a great step forward in terms of providing security, but we\'re looking at two years from now, how does that landscape change and how do we do we focus on identity.""\n\nQuestion of scale\n\nThe most pressing challenge for ShoCard isn\'t technology, Ebrahimi acknowledges, it\'s a question of scale. As the car crash analogy illustrates, ShoCard can only be as useful as the number of people and third-party institutions using it.\n\nIdentifying this ""chicken-and-egg problem"", Ebrahimi said, was a key factor in ShoCard choosing to adopt a business-to-business (B2B) marketing strategy.\n\n""The way we see this gaining traction is not us having end users download the product,"" he said. ""That\'s much more challenging because the use cases will be limited. What we\'re looking at is working with enterprises and having them be the ones who roll this out to their user base.""\n\nEbrahimi suggested ShoCard is already talking to banks interested in the technology, but declined to name potential partners. Presentations for the company suggest ShoCard believes its solution could be a compelling alternative to services like Verified by Visa, which while allowing major financial institutions to leverage access to user data, require them to store it in centralized databases.\n\nMore immediately, Ebrahimi sees the service as potentially appealing to bitcoin companies that currently rely on two-factor authentication services or other tools.\n\n""Identity has become significantly more important for bitcoin companies as they start expanding beyond early adopters,"" he said.\n\nUntil those partnerships are secure, however, the ShoCard product, will be kept under wraps. ""That\'s how we can get a larger user base and those users will have a use case,"" Ebrahimi said.\n\nElement of trust\n\nStill, the irony is that, while the blockchain is effectively a trustless system, ShoCard\'s partners still have to trust the system, something that has been difficult for institutions given the negative publicity surrounding bitcoin as a currency.\n\nEbrahimi aims to overcome this with a two-pronged strategy. First, convince enterprise businesses that using the blockchain is more secure and efficient; second, use trusted brands as distribution partners to consumers.\n\nThe first case, Ebrahimi suggested, will be easier given that enterprise companies are already trusting authentication providers with their data. If ShoCard was a traditional authentication company, he said, it would have its own database, meaning partners would have to trust that information therein is properly maintained and that it\'s not improperly modified or changed.\n\n""The people we have to convince, most of them are interested in blockchain,"" he said. ""A bank would have a hard time trusting another database, but you don\'t need to trust us in storing or maintaining the integrity of the data, making sure it doesn\'t get hacked into. I can independently validate the data and insist on its accuracy with an open database.""\n\nIt\'s still too early, he said, for consumers to comprehend the blockchain. But, Ebrahimi believes consumers don\'t need to necessarily understand it as long as they can use the technology conveniently.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""One of the things we\'ve done is hidden away a lot of that complexity from the users. You understand looking at your ID, because it\'s pushed out by a trusted enterprise.""\n\nPhoto by Noam Galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Great, because you can use this QR code to support TYT. Remember, every little bitcoin helps.”\n\nDavid Koller of the Young Turks network confirmed to CoinTelegraph that the network will indeed continue to accept bitcoin.\n\nThe effect of the TYT coverage on bitcoin is significant as videos and news reports of the TYT network generate around 100,000 views on average. However, out of the last 20 videos posted on YouTube, this was the only video mentioning their bitcoin donation campaign, for now.\n\nThe Young Turks Network products, services and reports are entirely in digital format so a bitcoin option makes sense compared other centralized payment options like PayPal, which have the tendency to freeze and hold payments.\n\nSince the display of their bitcoin wallet’s QR code 5 days ago, in one of their videos which generated around 80,000 views, the TYT network has received over 30 donations. Although the total amount is fairly moderate (~US$116), 30 donations over the last 5 days is a pretty good start, especially since the campaign was largely unannounced.\n\nResponse\n\nThe bitcoin community has responded positively to the TYT’s campaign so far. Some stated that they would donate for the sake of displaying the bitcoin donation message at the end of each video.\n\nOne reddit comment read, “Accepting bitcoin would be a logical move for these guys though, considering their product is entirely digital content. I almost want to donate just so they keep that message up.”\n\nThis is the first major bitcoin acceptance in the news industry since the partnership between Time, Inc. and Coinbase in December of last year which resulted in not only Time but also Fortune, Health, This Old House, and Travel + Leisure to accepting bitcoin for the last seven months.\n\nAt the time, Coinbase noted the potential of fusing cryptocurrency and online publishing, saying:""]"
07/25/2015,"['Mike Tyson, the former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, wants to get into the Bitcoin space, according to a Tweet he made Saturday. The tweet signaled that a “Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM” would be coming by August.\n\nAs the website says, “Mike Tyson’s fastest knockout in the ring was 30 seconds. The Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM turns your cash into bitcoin in under 20 seconds.” Tyson is best known for his marquee fights in Las Vegas, where, at the D Hotel, a Genesis Coin Bitcoin ATM has been in service for months now.\n\nWith nicknames like “The Baddest Man on the Planet”, “Kid Dynamite”, and “Iron Mike,” it is no wonder Tyson is considered one of the best heavyweights of all time. As some bitcoiners have mentioned, this could change the meaning of “Bit” coin. The tweet hints that the motto of the Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM will be, “Changing the way we get change.” Pretty catchy.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The biggest opportunities for bitcoin and the blockchain lie in their ability to disrupt emerging economies, according to FuturePerfect Ventures founding partner Jalak Jobanputra.\n\nThe New York-based firm has emerged as an active investor in companies in the sector, so far participating in funding rounds for Abra, BitPesa, Blockchain, Blockstream and Case, two of which are among the largest so far in the industry\'s history.\n\nGoing forward, Jobanputra says FuturePerfect is actively looking to invest in post-seed companies raising rounds of $1m–$5m in a bid to scale their efforts. However, it\'s a global focus that is compelling the $50m fund, launched in 2014 by Jobanputra following stints at RTP Ventures and the Omidyar Network, that shapes the firm\'s thesis on bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nHer interest in the technology, she explained, came early in 2013 following time spent in Africa analyzing the growth of mobile money services platform M-Pesa.\n\n""That was the perspective I was bringing to learning more about the space,"" she told CoinDesk. ""Large data, decentralization and analytics, [bitcoin and the blockchain] fit in nicely with where technology in general is headed. It\'s not only in the FinTech space, we\'re witnessing more decentralization as more machines and devices come online around the world.""\n\nJobanputra said:\n\n""If you look at the efficiencies, a digital ledger just starts to look like a global opportunity. It\'s just such a huge technology with huge potential that I wouldn\'t want to even categorize it.""\n\nOf course, while those opportunities may exist, the teams that can turn these big ideas into products that thrive in the marketplace are more scarce.\n\n""Venture is not really about funding science projects,"" she continued. ""It\'s looking at applications that can serve a purpose and address pain points in the current market in the near term.""\n\nImmediate opportunities\n\nIn particular, Jobanputra cited FuturePerfect portfolio company Abra as a ""great example"" of a company that has provided a convincing case it can create a more efficient cross-border payments system today.\n\n“There is a huge opportunity to do something in the sector and do well, but it\'s important to know who else is working on what.”\n\nHelmed by entrepreneur Bill Barhydt, Abra offers a mobile app that facilitates remittances via the blockchain, effectively outsourcing money transmission requirements to end users. Heralded as an ""Uber for remittances"", Jobanputra suggests that rising smartphone penetration provides a compelling case that the as-yet-unlaunched service can take off.\n\n""The tellers are mobile and they\'re not fixed kiosks. That\'s an immediate pain point, wrapping in other elements of technology and mobile is one of them,"" she explained. ""Smartphones are much more prevalent than they were five or six years ago.""\n\nBecause of the broad applications for technology, Jobanputra says it\'s too early to tell if it will take off as a consumer or business-focused solution even given the increasing interest from major mainstream banks in the technology.\n\n""We\'re just in the very early stages and even thinking about the use cases,"" Jobanputra said.\n\nHer advice to those who want to get involved in the ecosystem? Observe the competition. ""We\'re seeing a lot of new companies startup because there is a huge opportunity to do something in the sector and do well, but it\'s important to know who else is working on what.""\n\nKeeping score\n\nJobanputra also spoke out about the tendencies of the tech press to view startup funding as a measure of success, noting that some companies are simply able to operate leaner and more efficiently.\n\n""We\'re in a very nascent market and we\'re accustomed to seeing high fundraise amounts just because the money is out there,"" Jobanputra said. ""The smartest companies are figuring out their business model and not raising just because they can.""\n\nShe further rebutted attempts to compare current investment levels in the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem with funding from the 1990s, calling this analogy potentially ""dangerous"".\n\n""There are lots of things that have changed in tech and capital,"" she continued. ""Capital has become a lot more global and consumer and enterprise focused.""\n\nStill, Jobanputra indicated that were some trends in the sector that she currently supports, including the tendencies for VCs to focus on strong technology teams as a hedge against uncertainty regarding how the industry may evolve.\n\nAs for her prediction for the technology\'s killer app, she asserted her belief that the developing world will perhaps provide the answer.\n\nHowever, she hinted at the many components are needed to realize it, concluding:\n\n""This whole idea in the longer term of having an identity that you have different assets associated with and can transact with, that is very attractive as we get to a more global and cross-border world. There\'s so much more movement of people and assets across borders and I think this is where the blockchain can excel.""\n\nJalak Jobanputra is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.

Even though there are alternatives, such as using Tor, for example, there is no way of guaranteeing your information is private at all times. That being said, researchers have created HORNET, a better and faster implementation of what Tor has been trying to achieve for many years.\n\nAlso read: Trestor Foundation Provides A Solution For Greece Capital Controls\n\nHORNET – Onion Routing Anonymization With Direct Integration\n\nTor has been the frontrunner when it comes to [partially] anonymizing details from Internet users. As a result, Tor has managed to gain a lot of popularity over the years, especially in oppressed nations and has even become a powerful medium for journalists and dissidents. But as good as Tor is, it lacks the speed Internet users have grown accustomed to over the years, which could ultimately be its downfall.\n\nInternet users around the world who wanted to remain semi-anonymous when transferring large chunks of data over the Internet, could not use Tor to do so in an efficient manner. Instead, they had to rely on VPN connections, which are less protected compared to Tor, plus logs of every VPN connection are stored on centralized servers.\n\nA new solution has to be found, and that solution comes in the form of HORNET. Or to be more precise, the HORNET whitepaper released earlier this week shows there is room to find a good balance between Internet speed and user privacy. HORNET stands for High-speed Onion Routing at the NETwork layer, and has the potential to become the improved version of Tor.\n\nThe researchers behind HORNET claim that their implementation of onion routing can move data at a speed of up to 93 gigabits per second. Additionally, HORNET should – in theory at least – be capable of servicing a multitude of users without creating huge overhead, something Tor has been struggling with as the protocol became more popular.\n\nOne of the main distinctions between Tor and HORNET is the fact that HORNET uses two different onion protocols to protect user anonymity when making a request to the open internet. Connecting to a site not protected by the HORNET network results in a “Sphinx” onion protocol connection.\n\nHORNET researchers explained the “Sphinx” onion protocol as follows:\n\n“Each Sphinx packet allows a source node to establish a set of symmetric keys, one for each node on the path through which packets are routed. This allows its creating node to dynamically retrieve the embedded information (i.e., next hop, shared key, session expiration time), while hiding this information from unauthorized third parties.”\n\nPotential Use Cases for Bitcoin\n\nAssuming HORNET will work as explained in the whitepaper, this protocol could have huge implications for Bitcoin adoption all around the world. Oppresses regions and even some of the world’s largest nations route internet in their own way and restrict certain websites from being accessed. Just recently, Russia restricted website access to various Bitcoin websites, a ban that could be bypassed by using a protocol such as HORNET.\n\nAdditionally, not all countries are too keen on free speech regarding Bitcoin either. Some governments see this is an attack on the regime, and will censor any mention on Bitcoin and digital currency. Using HORNET, these blockades could be bypassed as well, without giving up Internet speed and still protecting user privacy.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the HORNET whitepaper?

Darüber hinaus eröffnete Papiergeld aber auch die Möglichkeit zur zusätzlichen Geldschöpfung, indem die Banken mehr davon ausgaben als durch die Einlage von Münzgeld gedeckt war. Alle verbleibenden Grenzen der Geldschöpfung wurden aufgehoben, als das Papiergeld von jedweder materiellen Deckung entkoppelt und durch von Banken geschaffenes Buchgeld ergänzt wurde. Der Preis für die Entgrenzung der Geldschöpfung war Inflation und wirtschaftliche Instabilität. Von der breiten Öffentlichkeit wenig bemerkt, hat sich nun eine verschworene Gruppe von Computerspezialisten daran gemacht, das bestehende Geldsystem zu revolutionieren. Papier- und Buchgeld soll durch kryptografisches Computergeld ersetzt werden.\n\nGeld wird zum Mittel für Tausch und Wertaufbewahrung durch das Vertrauen, dass es bei Bedarf in ein gewünschtes Gut getauscht werden kann. Ursprünglich war dieses Vertrauen an Waren wie Gold und Silber gebunden, die sich durch Haltbarkeit, Homogenität und Knappheit auszeichneten. Doch das Vertrauen in die Tauschbarkeit eines Mediums muss nicht notwendigerweise materiell unterlegt sein. Denkbar ist auch ein virtuelles Tauschmittel, das nachweislich in einer Kette von Transaktionen akzeptiert wurde. In Reaktion auf die Finanzkrise wurde im Jahr 2008 ein solches Medium mittels Computerkryptografie geschaffen. Wir kennen es als Bitcoin.\n\nPizza für Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin wurde als Geld geboren, als im Jahr 2010 eine Pizza für die elektronische Buchung einer Zahlung vom Konto des Kunden an das des Bäckers geliefert wurde. Diese Transaktion bildete den Anfang einer lückenlosen, verschlüsselten Kette aller Transaktionen, die bisher stattgefunden haben und je stattfinden werden. Die Kette, Blockchain genannt, kann von jedem mit entsprechender Rechnerkapazität ausgestattetem Teilnehmer an dem Geldsystem nachgeprüft werden. Wer sich die Mühe macht, die Transaktionen zu verifizieren, wird mit einem neu geschaffenen Geldbetrag entschädigt. Auf diese Weise wird nicht nur das Vertrauen in die Akzeptanz des Kryptogeldes als Tauschmittel mit jeder Transaktion erneuert, sondern es wird auch die Kryptogeldmenge nach einem festen und nachvollziehbaren Algorithmus ausgeweitet. Kryptogeld ist die Antithese des Papier- und Bankenbuchgelds: Es wird dezentral statt zentral erzeugt, es wird nach einer festen Regel statt nach Belieben geschaffen, und es wird zu Geld durch das Vertrauen der Nutzer statt durch staatliches Gesetz.\n\nMit der Blockchaintechnologie kann aber nicht nur das staatlich organisierte Papier- und Bankenbuchgeldsystem aus den Angeln gehoben, sondern auch der Zahlungsverkehr und die Geldverwahrung revolutioniert werden. Elektronische Zahlungen werden dort von Computer zu Computer – sprich von Smartphone zu Smartphone – direkt abgewickelt. Geldguthaben werden dezentral elektronisch gespeichert. Banken sind daher weder für den Zahlungsverkehr noch zur Geldverwahrung nötig. Die Kosten für diese Dienstleistungen können weitgehend eingespart werden. Entsprechend können mit der Blockchaintechnologie auch alle anderen Transaktionen, vom Wertpapierhandel bis zu Immobiliengeschäften, erfasst und die damit verbundenen Veränderungen der Eigentumsverhältnisse dokumentiert werden.\n\nKryptogeld entspricht dem, was ich als Alternative zu unserem staatlich organisierten Papier- und Bankenbuchgeld „Aktivgeld“ genannt habe: ein auf dem Vertrauen der Nutzer fußendes Mittel zum Tausch und zur Wertaufbewahrung. Mit der Blockchaintechnologie wäre die „Aktivgeldordnung“ zu verwirklichen, von der ich mir eine stabilere Wirtschaft und stabileres Geld verspreche. Für die Zukunft von Kryptogeld spricht die zunehmende Bedeutung des Internethandels und der sozialen Netzwerke. Was hindert eigentlich global agierende Technologiefirmen daran, eine eigene, global gültige Kryptowährung zur besseren Bindung ihrer Kunden an ihre Dienstleistungen und Produkte herauszugeben? Was hält das Publikum von der Nachfrage nach Kryptowährungen ab, wenn durch diese das Vertrauen in die Kaufkraft des Geldes maximiert und die Kosten des Zahlungsverkehrs minimiert werden?\n\nFeindschaft der Banken\n\nNoch stehen das Misstrauen der Politik und die Feindschaft der Banken Kryptogeld im Weg. Für die Politik ist das Papier- und Bankenbuchgeld ein wichtiges Gestaltungsinstrument. Die Zentralbank bestimmt die Geldpolitik, die von den Geschäftsbanken umgesetzt wird. Dafür erhalten diese einen Anteil am Gewinn der Geldschöpfung. Beide, Politik und Banken, würden durch Kryptogeld entmachtet. Wenn es das Publikum denn will.', 'Undisputed pound-for-pound boxing king Floyd Mayweather Jr. has sent the boxing world into a frenzy after TMZ Sports reported the undefeated welterweight champion plans to fight Andre Berto September 12 in what will likely be the last fight of Mayweather\'s career.\n\nBerto is a former title-holder, but is just 3-3 in his past six fights and is not considered a serious threat to defeat Mayweather. The fact that Mayweather would even consider fighting an opponent such as Berto has fueled speculation he\'s only willing to consider opponents he knows he\'d easily defeat — that way he doesn\'t risk losing his undefeated record.\n\nOne Twitter user emphasized the disparity between the fighters by posting a picture showing how each undergo cryotherapy:\n\n@FloydMayweather uses a 40k machine for cryotheraphy. @AndreBerto uses a trashcan in bathroom w/ice #MayweatherBerto pic.twitter.com/J1rVFS83qH — Romney for the HOF (@R_Munny) July 20, 2015\n\nWhen Mayweather first dropped Berto\'s name, along with Karim Mayfield\'s, at a press conference he was met with widespread disbelief. Reporters were so taken back that Mayweather would even consider fighting Berto that ESPN\'s boxing expert Dan Rafael originally thought he was joking.\n\nFloyd said he\'ll fight Berto or Mayfield next. I asked if he was kidding. He seemed to be serious. Said Pacquiao fought Algieri so why not? — Dan Rafael (@danrafaelespn) June 21, 2015\n\nAs a result of the presumed fight, Mayweather seems to have lost the respect of many of his fellow boxers. Former welterweight title-holder Shane Mosley reacted with pure disgust when an ESNews reporter mentioned the possible Mayweather – Berto fight:\n\n""Oh my god. I don\'t even want to break that fight down. I\'m not even going to talk about that fight. It\'s not, that\'s, that\'s not a fight. I don\'t know if it\'s going to be worse than the Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather fight, I\'m not sure. But, I\'m not talking about it.""\n\nVictor Ortiz , who lost to Mayweather in 2011, described the potential fight as ""embarrassing"" when speaking with TMZ Sports. Ortiz implied that if Mayweather is going to choose to fight such a low-level fighter than he should simply retire now, instead of waiting until September:\n\n""That\'s embarrassing, bro. That\'s not even a fight. If anything dude, they both need to retire, or at least Floyd needs to give me some kind of a chance to redeem myself. I have no respect for that, I have no respectful reply for that. I don’t know. If we keep going I’ll say a lot of bad things.""\n\nActive boxers aren\'t the only ones criticizing Mayweather. Former four-division title-holder Erik Morlaes also criticized Mayweather\'s decision to fight Berto, calling it a fight ""almost nobody wants to see"" when speaking with ESPN Deportes, Boxing Scene\'s Edward Chaykovsky translated the interview:\n\n""I don\'t think it\'s a very competitive bout. It\'s two fighters who, without being racist, almost nobody wants to see. Perhaps the fight is interesting for them, but not for us. Berto was defeated by Víctor Ortiz, Ortiz was knocked out by Maidana, and Maidana was dominated by Mayweather...[The fight with Berto is something] I do not understand. He does not want to take a risk, he has never wanted to take a risk, and he doesn\'t want to take a risk now.""\n\nThe good news is the fight hasn\'t officially been confirmed yet by Mayweather\'s camp. The bad news, if the rumored fight does in fact happen, it doesn\'t appear like boxing fans should expect much.', 'Writing anything against the price rise in bitcoin is like keeping your head in a guillotine and expecting it to be unhurt. However, at times, one’s got to do what one’s got to do. So, at the risk of ruffling a few feathers among the bitcoin enthusiasts and staunch supporters, I will put forth my two cents on why the latest rally in bitcoin is looking bubbly. Only time will tell whether my argument proves to be correct or falls flat on its face, similar to the ones proclaimed by the legendary investors.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nKey points\n\nBitcoin’s rally is looking like a bubble Futures trading will pit the bulls and the short sellers against one another Introduction of Nikkei futures trading turned out to be bearish for the Japanese stock market Sell 50% bitcoin holdings at the current levels and stay in cash\n\nWe had recently warned that bitcoin is topping out in the short-term. While bitcoin fell after our article, the dip was more of a buying opportunity rather than the indication of a top that we were referring to. Whoa, there goes my forecasting capability out of the window.\n\nHowever, does the rise above $16000 and a market capitalization of above $300 billion make us change our view? Not really. I now believe that we are about to make an intermediate top.\n\nThe common gripe among the cryptocurrency enthusiasts is that being a new asset class, bitcoin is not understood by many traditional investors (include me also in this list) who keep questioning its incessant rally. On the other hand, the traditional investors point that the price has gone well ahead of its fundamentals.\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace. Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nThere is going to be a big clash between these two school of thoughts with the launch of bitcoin futures.\n\nWhat can happen after the launch of bitcoin futures trading?\n\nI will try to explain how things will play out according to my opinion.\n\nThe launch of bitcoin futures trading will provide an opportunity to the institutional investors to diversify their investments into a new asset class. Nevertheless, it is difficult to fathom how many will buy, especially when the cryptocurrency has risen more than 16 times this year.\n\nUntil now, most of the money used to be on the long side of the trade. Some of the sharp falls were a result of profit booking or due to investors not stepping in to buy at lower levels due to the negative news flow. There was never an overhang of short sellers on bitcoin prices, which is going to change from December 10 and December 18.\n\nSo, with every part of the rally, there will be an equally bearish short seller who will see an opportunity to benefit from the fall in bitcoin prices. Money will be made both on the way up and the way down.\n\nWill the short sellers jump into the fray at once?\n\nDifficult to say, but my anticipation is that the short sellers are unlikely to jump in to sell bitcoin futures aggressively, especially since bitcoin is backed by a strong upward momentum. Large short sellers are likely to dip their feet with small short positions and watch.\n\nAs now we have traders willing to take both sides of the trade, we expect the pace of the ascent to slow down and short positions to start accumulating on every rise. Volatility is also likely to increase in the short-term.\n\nIntroduction of futures trading is not always bullish\n\nThough we don’t have an apples to apples comparison for cryptocurrencies, we can look at how the Japanese stock markets were affected by the introduction of Nikkei futures trading in Osaka Securities Exchange.\n\nThe Japanese stock market was riding high on the back of a bubble in asset prices, which also boosted the prices of Nikkei stock exchange. The index rose 10 times from 1975 to 1990.\n\nNikkei futures trading started in Osaka Securities Exchange in 1988 and the Nikkei stock average peaked in end-1989. The descent was equally sharp as the ascent.\n\nSome may point that the crash in Nikkei happened only two years after the futures trading started. However, one must keep in mind that it took 15 years for the Nikkei to rise 10 times while bitcoin has risen 16 times this year itself. Therefore, the fall is also going to be equally vicious.\n\nSigns of excesses in bitcoin\n\nAlmost every cryptocurrency trader(other than hacked.com subscribers) believes that this time it is different and one can make tons of money within a short span of trading in cryptocurrencies. After all, the Winklevoss twins have become billionaires by starting with just $11 million four years back. There is a firm belief that bitcoin is the future, hence, every fall will only rally higher than the previous one. See, all the analysts’ targets. Analysts are beating one another in announcing targets on bitcoin. I believe the maximum is $1 million by 2020, by John McAfee. Let’s see if there is any analyst brave enough to top this one, especially in the medium-term time frame of 2-3 years. A vertical rally. 16 times increase in value within a year is evidence enough that the rally is overheated. Expecting the same pace of rally in the future is like asking Usain Bolt to complete the marathon with the same speed that he runs the 100 metres race. The institutional investors will be eager to jump in to buy bitcoins and once those billions start pouring in, there is no end to the rally. This is not true because the large institutional investors are hugely risk averse. Their money is made in compounding about 15%-25% consistently over the years. It is unlikely that most will enter the fray until bitcoin’s volatility reduces considerably. Consider the world’s population of 6 billion and the fact that there will only be 21 million bitcoins mined. Additionally, out of that, millions are either lost or are locked away with only a few millions in circulation. So, the price rise is justified. Well, if Leonardo da Vinci had a few hundred thousand paintings in the market place, his paintings wouldn’t have fetched millions. So, this argument of only 21 million bitcoins that will ever be mined doesn’t hold ground.\n\nOK, so if bitcoin is in a bubble, what should one do with it?\n\nFor people who don’t own bitcoin currently, please stay away from it, until you see a large correction.\n\nFor the others who own bitcoins, 50% of the positions should be closed right away, above $16,000 levels before the futures trading starts. The other 50% of the position should be held. This can be sold when bearish patterns develop on bitcoin because no one can point the top in a bubble.\n\nLikely scenarios to play out if bitcoin falls\n\nThere are two possible scenarios that I believe can happen.\n\nBitcoin falls and drags the sentiment down for the whole cryptocurrency universe. It doesn’t take a long time for the sentiment to get sour. In such a case, people who have been hoping that altcoins will rally when bitcoin falls will be in for a rude shock. The second scenario is that the current investors in bitcoin will face a stiff resistance from the short sellers. When the existing whales are unable to influence bitcoin prices like before, they are likely to jump to the altcoins because they don’t have to counter short sellers there. In this case, the altcoins recover sharply.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe best way is to cash your bitcoins into dollars and sit out. Once the dust settles down, there will be many opportunities to earn money because cryptocurrencies, as an asset class is here to stay.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of Shutterstock.', 'There are so many camera apps out there that sometimes I think it prevents me from taking pictures. I always ask myself “what filter do I use?” and end up just going #filterless, as the kids call it these days. After using Polamatic, it hasn’t really changed my mind on the subject.\n\nThe general gist is that you can take pictures directly from the app, and import your old photos from your camera roll and iCloud. Yes, it’s another picture-taking app, and it doesn’t really get a whole lot more interesting from there. You’ll have access to the studio, which can adjust the brightness of a photo, crop it, apply filters, and add in borders or text. That’s…basically all you’re going to get here.\n\nThe main gimmick is found within the picture-taking process, where an animation will play reminiscent of the classic “Polaroid,” which instantly developed before your eyes. It’s nostalgic, but not very functional, outside of the ability to make the picture look like it’s mounted on different types of “film,” if you wish. The nostalgic filters aren’t bad, but they aren’t anything you can’t find on plenty of other apps.\n\nAs mentioned, the app also lets you do things like add text in a “handwritten”-type font that your mother may have done in her scrapbook to enhance the analogue look even further. The whole Polaroid-type framing might be cool for a photo or two—but the appeal wears thin pretty fast. In other words, if your Instagram feed was full of these, consider yourself unfollowed by all but your best friends.\n\nOddly enough you can link it to Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, all of which have better camera tech than Polamatic. The former is probably the oddest inclusion of the bunch, as one click will probably inform you that it does everything Polamatic does, but better.\n\nPolamatic is a bare-bones app that you really shouldn’t be paying money for. If it were free that’d be one thing, but for an app this limited, even a dollar feels like too much. If you really like the idea of seeing a little Polaroid animation it may be a way to relive your glory days, but for everyone else, just stick with your favorite premium app, or even just Instagram.\n\nPolamatic is an iOS and Android app that can be downloaded in the iTunes App Store or Google Play Store.']"
07/26/2015,"[""OneBit, a bitcoin wallet app that enables its users to pay with bitcoin at any credit card accepting store, has entered the alpha stage of development. OneBit announced that users are testing the application worldwide, and that it will go into closed beta very soon.\n\nOneBit began as an NFC payment tool for MasterCard’s PayPass, which would have been used to pay with bitcoin at any MasterCard accepting stores. The application was developed at a Mastercard Hackathon by entrepreneur and OneBit CEO Toby Hoenisch, who received positive feedback from the credit card processor. Hoenisch said:\n\n“I have been fascinated by Bitcoin for the last three years, but never quite found the right idea to form a company around until now. [...] We managed to get MasterCard and DBS bank interested in OneBit and with their help, I am confident that we can build OneBit without getting burned like Charlie Shrem did.”\n\nMastercard helped OneBit secure a partnership with a card issuer and to raise funding rounds for the development of its application.\n\nOneBit made clear, however, that they haven’t partnered with Mastercard. Hoenisch said:\n\n“To be clear: We don't have [an] official partnership with Visa or Mastercard. But we also don't need one. The risk would be that they force all of their thousands of issuing banks to stop doing business with bitcoin companies. The issuing banks are quite independent, so I don't see this [happening].”\n\nTo raise funding for its application and worldwide launching of their app, the OneBit team joined the Startupbootcamp FinTech accelerator in Singapore in April.\n\nOn July 23, OneBit launched a trial video of an alpha user paying for coffee at Starbucks with OneBit wallet. In the video, the user requests an NFC payment option. Then he opens the OneBit app, pays and instantly sees a change in the balance of the app. Unlike credit cards, OneBit app is prepaid, similar to all bitcoin wallets. Therefore, users will be able to check if their OneBit wallet has sufficient funds to make a purchase.\n\nHoenisch further explained on Reddit that the OneBit app could be described as both a prepaid MasterCard and a Visa debit. Therefore, “If you don't have enough funds you can't pay. The app will catch most of this, but if you manage to get the transaction started then the terminal will display: transaction declined.”"", 'Former heavyweight world boxing title holder Mike Tyson may be biting off more than a rival’s ear in August with news over the weekend that he is apparently getting into the Bitcoin ATM ring. But an investigation by SiliconANGLE has revealed that Tyson may have been scammed.\n\n“Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM” is said to offer a revolution in offering cash to Bitcoin services in 20 seconds, which is 10 seconds faster that Iron Mike’s quickest knockout in a professional bout, which clocked in at 30 seconds.\n\nConfirmation that Tyson was involved in the offering came by Tyson’s Twitter account, with the retired fighter claiming the service will “change the way we get change.”\n\nComing soon… http://t.co/Blf592VtUW… Changing the way we get change. — Mike Tyson (@MikeTyson) July 25, 2015\n\nIf it looks like a scam …\n\nPrecious little is known about the service other than what we’ve written above, and various Bitcoin forums are full of speculation as to whether this is a legitimate business enterprise or not. While Tyson is reported to actually be a smart operator by some, he certainly doesn’t always present himself that way in public.\n\nThe biggest lead comes via the registration of the domain name miketysonbitcoin.com, which is registered to one Peter Klamka.\n\nA search finds that Klamka is the Chief Executive Officer of Bitcoin Brands, Inc., which offers a site called Bitcoin for Miles (a site to buy airline frequent flyer miles) and something called the “Bitcoin Vending Network,” which makes a mish-mash of claims, talking about offering ATM services on one hand, then vending machines (not sure if these are meant to be different) on the other.\n\nThe other service the company alleges to provide is BitMD, claimed to provide Bitcoin payment services to the medical marijuana industry.\n\nDoesn’t sound too bad in theory, and if it was providing those services it would be, but there’s only one serious problem: We can’t find any solid evidence, outside of the company’s own press releases, that they are.\n\nThere are a number of press releases pertaining to alleged establishments of Bitcoin ATMs and Bitcoin payment services, and a few sites that simply repeat the claims in the press releases, but there appears to be no legitimate press; that is say a local news report on an ATM opening complete with pictures of people, which you’d expect with a Bitcoin ATM opening, or a promo piece about the medical marijuana seller now taking Bitcoins; they’re either extraordinarily bad at on-the-ground local PR or the press releases are pure fantasy.\n\nBut it gets worse: Bitcoin Brands is listed as an Over-The-Counter (OTC) stock, so if it actually was providing these services you’d expect that to reflect in its share price and market cap.\n\nTheir current share price is $0.0001 per share with a market cap of $6,780. That’s not millions, that’s six thousand, seven hundred and eighty dollars.\n\nSo, a company worth $6,870 has done a legitimate deal with Mike Tyson to provide Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM’s?\n\nExcuse the language, but bullshit it has.\n\nThe best guess here is that Mike Tyson has been suckered into a deal by a fast talker who has promised him millions if he gets involved and lends his name to the enterprise, despite the company behind the enterprise having a market cap that is probably about half the value of one bottle of the champagne Tyson prefers to drink.\n\nThe other alternative theory is that Tyson himself has invested money into the service and Klamka is a business partner. But if that’s the case, it throws Tyson’s business judgement into serious doubt as any basic due diligence via a simple Google search would have found that not everything is as it seems when it comes to Bitcoin Brands and its alleged provision of various services.\n\nIf we find out more, we’ll update the post.\n\nImage via MikeTysonBitcoin.com', 'FMR LLC, which is the parent company of Fidelity Investments, has filed with the US Patent Office and Trademark Office to trademark “FIDELITYCOIN.” Application number 86699431 concerns “financial services, namely, financial exchange services for virtual currency; electronic wallets; charitable services in the nature of virtual currency.”\n\nThe trademark application was not made known to CCN until the weekend, thus reaching anyone at Fidelity for comment proved difficult. However, in December 2013, Fidelity stopped allowing clients to invest in the Bitcoin Investment Trust and gave little indication as to why. Could this be representative of a new interest in cryptocurrency?\n\nCCN contacted Fidelity about the trademark filing, and while they wouldn’t confirm or deny that they are experimenting with their own cryptocurrency, press representative Stephen Austin told us the following:\n\nI can confirm the filing, we are always experimenting with emerging technologies.\n\nBankCoins?\n\nThe revelation follows on the heels of news that Citi is working on a cryptocurrency, Citicoin. It seems that over the years financial institutions have evolved from dismissing Bitcoin outright to embracing it to developing their own cryptocurrencies, as we see now.\n\nNews of these new “bankcoins” might be disappointing to Ripple Labs, who from the beginning have aimed to become a settlement protocol for large institutions among other uses. Recently Ripple’s Ryan Zagone joined a team investigating the use of cryptocurrencies for the Federal Reserve, called the “Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee.” Banks would have no need of Ripple’s offerings if they simply implemented their own cryptographically secure protocols.\n\nFeatured image from Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.

With long lines in front of ATM machines reminiscent of the Cyprus bail-in, once again bitcoin appears to offer a safe haven.\n\nWhile many people focus on bitcoin’s price fluctuations and potential increase in adoption, currency is just the first application of this game-changing technology. The core of the blockchain provides an alternative governance model to the current oligarchic control shown in the harsh austerity forced against the will of the Greek people.\n\nIn the six years of its existence, public awareness of this technology has grown by leaps and bounds. Now, most who are aware of this groundbreaking innovation know the blockchain is a ledger. Yet, this ledger is not simply for accounting monetary transactions.\n\nAt its core, it is a platform that allows people to come to agreement on virtually anything without intermediaries. It provides a foundation to make social contracts based on the principle of consensus. Foremost, it enables a larger function of accounting; performing checks and balance on the self interests and the corruptible tendencies that exist in society.\n\nIn his white paper published in 2008, anonymous creator of this technology Satoshi Nakamoto noted it was invented as a solution to the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model. Roger Ver, aka \'Bitcoin Jesus\', an angel investor in bitcoin startups, recently remarked on the Greek financial crisis, pointing out the fallible nature of the existing forms of governance that create one-way contracts:\n\nGovernments don\'t have the consent of the governed. They have forcible control of the governed, with the ""consent"" of a third party. #grexit — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) July 14, 2015\n\nBitcoin self-regulates through algorithm, eliminating counter-party risk and the need for traditional legal and regulatory tools that have shown to be ineffective in events such as HSBC money laundering and the giant banking industry’s currency printing and market rigging. The core of this invention is distributed trust and is enabled through a mechanism called proof of work.\n\nProof of work\n\nIn his presentation Consensus Algorithms, Blockchain Technology and Bitcoin, security expert and author Andreas Antonopoulos described how proof of work is composed of specific cryptographic hash functions and sets of game theoretical equilibrium systems that dynamically adjust and create economics of scale.\n\nProof of work plays a vital role in securing the system. Adam Back, inventor of Hashcash, which contributed to the fundamentals of bitcoin, noted how it “constructs a computational irrevocability from proof-of-work and consensus”.\n\nThis means no one can undo the work one has done. No one can fake the work or go around it. Miners at the heart of the bitcoin ecosystem have to perform hash operations by using precious resources and if they play by the rules they receive value, and if not, they lose value. In other words, all are held directly accountable by being required to spend their resources and show the presentation of their work.\n\nThis makes the blockchain bulletproof and resistant to manipulation. It also guards against the hyperinflation created as a result of government intervention through measures such as quantitative easing. When looked at as a larger governance model, this accounts for potential selfish attempts that try to benefit from the good will of people.\n\nGenius of economic incentive\n\nWhat gives the impulse for this self-organizing system and, most of all, where does this force of accountability come from? There is no central planner in bitcoin. In a sense, Satoshi’s anonymity embodies the technology’s essence. There are effectively no fingerprints on this technology. At the center of this mathematical invention is a vital economic incentive that spontaneously organizes miners to make the ledger decentralized and immutable.\n\nThis incentive structure manifested in its built-in digital scarcity is an underlying current behind the bitcoin network. This was built with a realistic and honest assessment of man’s self-interests.\n\nHistory is filled with evidence of what happens when we fail to account for our selfish tendencies within. Dark memories of atomic bombs, slavery, Holocaust and genocide remind us of the cruel and violent parts inherent in humanity and the mass destruction we are capable of committing.\n\n“The blockchain creates incentive for participants to work honestly, where rules are applied to all equally.”\n\nWhen self-interests are not acknowledged, they quickly escape consciousness. Lower aspects of our humanity that are denied can then easily gain the upper hand. They become a kind of insatiable hunger that drives people to the pursuit of power, creating fraudulent systems where anti-social forces attack networks, take over economies and undermine the sovereignty and will of the people.\n\nThrough accounting for selfish motives and greed and using rewards to encourage good behavior in a transparent open network, the blockchain creates incentive for participants to work honestly, where rules are applied to all equally.\n\nThis way, the system can more effectively mitigate the risk of humanity’s destructive potential.\n\n\n\nDistributed accountability\n\nThe bitcoin network fosters a true consent of the governed through voluntary participation and enables self-regulation taken up by each choosing to abide by the rule of consensus.\n\nWhat emerges in this innovation is a new form of social accountability. Unlike traditional representative models of governance, where systems of checks and balance are exercised through third parties, under bitcoin’s consensus model, accountability is distributed directly and exercised by all in the network.\n\nThis removes single points of failure and provides far better security than existing systems. With the blockchain\'s transparency, those who prefer profit without work will have no place to run and no place to hide.\n\nThere are already creative initiatives to strengthen political accountability through the use of this technology. London mayoral candidate George Galloway is calling for the city to adopt blockchain-based accounting in order to provide full transparency for the public of the city’s financial activities.\n\nAlong with the host of the RT’s financial report Max Keiser, Galloway created The Mayor\'s Chain Project that would put the city’s annual budget on a blockchain to foster collective auditing by citizens.\n\nEnshrined in the bitcoin protocol is a blueprint for decentralized forms of governance. This is a real invention and can’t be uninvented. As the global crisis of legitimacy deepens, austerity will continue, with insolvent banks bailing themselves out and hedge funds getting away with cooking the books.\n\nBitcoin might not be able to save Greece in this moment, but its core technology offers tools for those who want to innovate a truly viable alternative to the centralized institutions of mandated trust and move into a society based on networks of distributed democracy.\n\nNetwork image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Our sources told us Snapchat was going after Twitter salespeople particularly hard.\n\nThe organization is hoping to make a big-name hire as it tries to fill the gaps left by former chief operating officer Emily White and former VP of partnerships Mike Randall, who both moved away from the company early this year.\n\nIt\'s by no means unusual for a digital media startup — especially one that is currently very much flavor of the month with both the press and investors — to look to recruit from other, larger digital media companies. (White joined from Instagram, for example.) But Snapchat isn\'t like those other digital media companies. Those companies are relatively mature in terms of commercializing their product, while Snapchat is only just getting started.\n\nWe spoke to over half a dozen senior sources across the advertising industry about what it has been like to work with Snapchat so far. The people we spoke to are pretty much all desperate to work with Snapchat (and some have worked directly with the company — others have simply done their own marketing on the app on their own,) but many were frustrated at the level of service they have received from the sales team. Demand seems to be outweighing supply.\n\nIn some respects, that\'s a good position for Snapchat to be in. But advertisers are a demanding bunch and they want more contact, and more proof that the app isn\'t just a shiny new toy, but something that can actually add value to their businesses.\n\n""Hitting reset""\n\nBack in March, The Information reported that Snapchat was having to hit ""reset"" on its ad sales progress to date, following the departures of White and Randall, who had spent the previous summer meeting with and presenting to brand marketers and ad agencies. Those on the lower tiers of the sales team reportedly requested another round of meetings with advertisers as Spiegel was the only person left from the group who had held the initial face-to-face meetings with Snapchat and agency bosses.\n\nThat wasn\'t the only rejig. Snapchat appears to have taken a while to find its feet when it comes to pricing.\n\nWhen Snapchat first went out to market, it was asking brands to shell out a minimum of $750,000 per day for a ""Stories"" ad, which some marketers thought was too expensive for such a young and untested app, according to Adweek. An agency source told Business Insider in March that the rates were later brought down to a ""much more realistic pricing structure.""\n\nThen in May, Snapchat rolled out a new ad format: 10-second video ads, costing 2 cents per view, that will run between the article and videos on the Discover section, which displays content from partner publishers including The Daily Mail, ESPN, and Vice. That marks a significant discount from the reported 15 cents a view Snapchat had been charging for Discover ads.\n\nLast month Snapchat made its first high-profile sales hire since the departures of White and Randall: Vevo sales head Luke Kallis was appointed as the company\'s west coast sales chief. He reports into Imran Khan, the former Credit Suisse banker who was hired by Snapchat to become its chief strategy officer late last year.\n\nSnapchat still hasn\'t announced a direct VP of partnerships replacement for Randall, and it doesn\'t plan to fill the COO role left behind by White.\n\n""They definitely do not have their house in order""\n\nMany of our sources described the sales team they had contact with as being composed of ""young 20-somethings."" That\'s to be expected: It\'s a young app, it appeals to young people, and its CEO (who is involved in many of the top agency CEO and top brand marketer meetings) is 25-years-old.\n\nSnapchat told Business Insider the average seller has 10+ years experience, coming from places like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Hulu, and Vevo. The company has also tripled the size of the sales organization over the last quarter.\n\nBut the impression we got from our conversations is that the relative small size of its sales team to date means Snapchat isn\'t yet meeting its true potential from an advertising perspective — advertisers are throwing themselves at Snapchat, but the company just doesn\'t have the resources yet to give them all what they want, our sources suggested.\n\nSnapchat tells Business Insider it is taking a methodical, disciplined approach to building out its business. That starts with the biggest brands and largest advertisers in the world. Advertisers to date have included Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Verizon, Universal, L\'Oreal, Samsung, and Warner Bros.\n\nIt takes time to build a sales organization that can meet the needs of all the world\'s biggest advertisers. One of our advertising agency sources said someone internally at Snapchat had admitted to them that ""they don\'t know where they are yet as a sales organization.""\n\nThat agency source, who is director-level at an agency in the US, said: ""When they speak to us, it feels very ad-hoc. We wanted to do something with them [for a major brand] that would make headlines — like McDonald\'s did with its geofilters [campaign in June] — but they were not equipped to do that and respond to our pitch and think of ideas. It seems to me like the McDonald\'s geo-filter came from the brand and agency, who asked them: \'Can you do this?\' And the sales side says: \'Yes, we can, if it\'s not too hard for us to do.\' It feels like they\'re saying [to other pitches]: \'We don\'t have time to do that now.\'""\n\nMeanwhile, many of the director-level agency sources we spoke to outside of the US said they had only had initial meetings with Snapchat — and many had received no contact at all.\n\nA director-level marketer at a major consumer brand in the US said Snapchat was only ""gingerly"" talking to his company. He added that while he saw the value of the app as a platform to reach younger consumers, he had yet to be convinced that any of the paid-for Snapchat ads from other brands had been successful.\n\nThe lack of hard numbers or case studies was a recurrent theme in our conversations with advertisers and agency execs. Marketers love numbers. They need to be able to prove to their chief financial officers that the $750,000 they plan to splash out on Snapchat is likely to generate a return for the business.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider in Cannes last month, WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell recalled his clients saying ""where\'s the data?"" when six months ago Snapchat was asking advertisers to pay upfront commitments of $750,000. ""It was quite difficult to do that,"" Sorrell added. But Sorrell has clearly been impressed by Snapchat since — at Cannes, he announced WPP was forming a new content marketing agency called Truffle Pig in partnership with Snapchat and The Daily Mail.\n\nSnapchat\'s latest pitch deck to advertisers has a couple of numbers on ad performance:\n\nBut adland wants more.\n\nOne Europe-based agency exec told us: ""There\'s not a raft of case studies from an advertising point of view. And those that are there feel very limited — it\'s like the early stages of Facebook and Twitter, mostly talking about engagement and likes. We\'re at the start of a shiny new toy. From a brand perspective, Snapchat offers great access to a young audience and it\'s getting to the point where it feels unparalleled, like a deeper version of Instagram. What they need to do now is demonstrate they are a relevant and a credible advertising player.""\n\nSnapchat told Business Insider that we only needed to look at its repeat customers to see that marketers are happy with advertising on the app. Repeat customers include Universal, Coca-Cola, and Samsung. Snapchat also says it has run third-party measurement for nearly every campaign on its platform, reporting on metrics like campaign reach and composition, and campaign resonance and lift. In terms of first-party metrics, Snapchat provides data such as views and view duration.\n\nThe CEO of a social media marketing company said he also wanted more geographic granularity into the ""100 million"" users Snapchat says use the app each month. He told us: ""100 million users is a big success, but I have no idea what to do with it. We have all this hype, but they\'re not jumping on the opportunity. The press around them has created a curiosity amongst people — good for them — but they\'re not capitalizing on it properly.""\n\nFor visionary start-ups, numbers don\'t always fuel decision-making — Apple\'s Steve Jobs was legendary for eschewing market research and relying on his own intuition with some products. An advertising agency chief executive who has had a direct relationship with Evan Spiegel described how, on some occasions, Snapchat\'s content partnership strategy was based more on executives\' (including Spiegel\'s) personal tastes rather than quantitative research and data on what might prove the best return for the app.\n\nIt\'s worth pointing out that many partners are clearly happy with Snapchat. The Daily Mail\'s US CEO Jon Steinberg (a partner on the Discover platform) recently compared Spiegel\'s leadership style to a young Sir Martin Sorrell. At Cannes last month Mondelez\'s CMO Dana Anderson told Business Insider: ""I love the fact that they\'re getting into the space and becoming an avid marketing partner."" Universal Pictures, which ran the first ad on Snapchat (a trailer for the movie \'Ouija\') said it was viewed by millions, with its executive vice president of digital marketing Doug Neil telling the LA Times: ""We were very satisfied with the experience."" Here are 12 more case studies from happy Snapchat customers, via Fast Co.\n\nRemember: This is exactly what happened with Facebook!\n\nSnapchat\'s initial release was in 2011. Snapchat hasn\'t even been selling ads for a year: The first ad hit Snapchat in October 2014. It\'s a mere baby on the commercial front.\n\nFacebook first started selling very rudimentary ads back in 2005. It took a long, long time to start convincing marketers to start spending significant amounts of their budgets there. And, like Snapchat, Facebook first began working with the top global advertising spenders on its big-money News Feed ads, before offering out the format to smaller marketers.\n\nIn the months following Facebook\'s IPO in 2012, shares in the company plummeted more than 50%. It took a year for the stock to trade above its initial $38 listing price. Why? Investors were spooked, thinking Facebook would not be able to make money from mobile. But Facebook moved swiftly and went from not having a mobile business, to mobile now representing 73% of its $3.3 billion in advertising revenue in the first quarter of this year.\n\nBack in 2012, Sir Martin Sorrell said: ""I believe Facebook is the best or one of the best branding mechanisms in the world but I don\'t think it is necessarily an advertising medium."" That year WPP was spending around $200 million with Facebook. In 2014 WPP spent $640 million on Facebook. EMarketer ranks Facebook ahead of Google as the biggest seller of digital display advertising in the US.\n\nAnd another 2012 classic: Remember when General Motors pulled its entire $10 million Facebook advertising budget because it didn\'t think ads on the social network worked? The brand sheepishly returned a year later.\n\nTwitter, too, took a while before it started building out a substantial advertising offer. Marketers were initially dissatisfied there too, according to a 2013 Forrester survey. Fast-forward to 2015, and Madison Avenue is calling for Twitter\'s ad sales boss to be the company\'s new CEO.\n\nAnother good comparison is Pinterest. It has only recently started offering advertising products, and last year was when it first started really ramping up its sales organization, making a series of high-profile hires to its sales team from the likes of Unilever and Google. Like Snapchat, it has taken a softly-softly approach to advertising, and created its own native ad formats that are congruent with the normal, organic experience of using the service.\n\nAnd remember: Snapchat doesn\'t want to be Facebook\n\nThere\'s another perspective with which to view the Snapchat ad sales story to date. Perhaps Snapchat doesn\'t want to act like advertisers\' other partners.\n\nAs one of our director-level agency sources told us: ""I guarantee Evan Spiegel laughs when [the ad industry moans Snapchat hasn\'t published enough case studies.] He\'s building out a product for consumers. Agencies might be frustrated because they want to be in front of that audience now. But it\'s a multi-billion dollar company, the CEO is under no pressure ... In some ways, the ad industry backs ourselves into a corner by thinking we need metrics for everything. Maybe Evan Spiegel is calling people\'s bluff and saying \'we\'re not going to [provide them.]\'""\n\nSnapchat was the talk of this year\'s Cannes, the ad industry\'s annual festival on the French Riviera. An interview with Spiegel was the top-billed event on the main stage on the Monday.\n\nIn his on-stage interview, he talked about a grander vision for advertising: That it should be content people actively want to watch — referencing a recent P&G Father\'s Day Snapchat Story — not just content that simply serves to keep the stuff people actually want to view free of charge. He also emphasized, as Snapchat has done in the past, about how it deliberately doesn\'t allow advertisers to target ads to specific subsets of users, like they can on the rest of the web. Snapchat thinks this is type of ad targeting can be ""creepy.""\n\nHe also referred to other social networks that tried to ""build products for people, then try to jam brands in there."" Spiegel noted how brands then sometimes take it too far when they attempt to interact with consumers on social networks through marketing: ""We think it\'s weird when brands try to act like your pal. I think that there\'s some nuance. I think it\'s very important to be friendly — but not a buddy.""\n\nIn essence, Snapchat doesn\'t want advertising on its app to be like advertising on the rest of the internet. So it follows that its sales approach might be a little different from other internet companies too.', 'Emma De Vita JULY 26, 2015 0 While most office bosses need not concern themselves with their colleagues’ knife skills, food hygiene habits or whether they know their fendu from their tordu bread-shaping techniques, there is much the busy, multitasking manager can learn from a professional kitchen. Chefs know a great deal about managing a team under high pressure. Ben Spalding is the executive chef of one of London’s busiest restaurants, Aqua Shard, on the 31st floor of the capital’s landmark skyscraper. But if you thought a top flight kitchen should be frantic and noisy, think again. “I love it calm,” he says. “The best kitchens are quiet.” The 28-year-old works from 7am to 1am five days a week, manages a team of 41 chefs and oversees 700 meals a day. Mr Spalding says the secret to a successful kitchen, like any workplace that demands high-performing teamwork, is its positive energy. He will not allow any disrespect. “The morale of the chefs is extremely important,” he says. “You’ve got to have an upbeat attitude.” He organises football games and regular parties for his team. He describes his leadership style as one informed by “respect, humility and integrity”. Although his team of chefs must work together seamlessly, Mr Spalding has come to appreciate that they must also be given the autonomy to do things their own way. “It is extremely important for us to manage chefs individually. You can’t do it collectively.” And although he finds it difficult, to give his chefs a sense of freedom, he allows them to make small mistakes. In order to have some kind of order, Mr Spalding creates spreadsheets that cover everything from upcoming chef holidays to work placements, sticking them on his office walls. “If I didn’t do this, I’d lose my marbles.” He says using them saves him 45 minutes a day. Because about half of his chefs are not in the kitchen at any one time, he has given each a clipboard for printed updates. He says it helps eliminate problems and shows clear responsibility should something go wrong. For example, a recent note reminded them to use Maldon salt, not table salt, when preparing fish. Anne Loehr, a former US chef and hotelier turned leadership consultant says there are lessons executives can learn from chefs. The most important is clear communication. Although a chef needs to give concise direction to their team to ensure orders are met on time and to the standard required, Ms Loehr says the common five-minute stand-up meeting before a service, where everyone in the restaurant quickly gives an update on their work, is invaluable for the smooth running of operations. A daily meeting like this could benefit any busy office team, she says. It also pays to respect the camaraderie created among a team that works hard together all day. It is no good just to slog it out, you need to celebrate too, recommends Ms Loehr. But according to Mr Spalding, most importantly, “you need a lot of self discipline for this job”. workingsmarter@ft.com', 'La opción se activa para Telegram al instalar un bot creado por el equipo de GetGems llamado ‘Julia’ , el cual está desarrollado en la API de Coinbase y por ende accede a las carteras de los usuarios en dicha empresa bitcoin.

Since there was no candy store there, Crail, now 73, borrowed $50,000 to start the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory—and then stumbled into making his signature product. Despite being undercapitalized—and at one point unable to pay suppliers—he built the company into an international brand. Last year it had $41.5 million in annual revenue, and 341 franchises in the U.S., Canada, Asia, and the Middle East. Crail’s story:\n\nI have a sweet tooth, but I never intended to go into the confectionery business. Most of my childhood was spent in San Diego, where my mother worked in retail and my father was a parts buyer for an aerospace company.\n\nAfter two years of college I joined the U.S. Army during the start of the Vietnam War. I ended up in Okinawa, in an Army intelligence unit. A few years later I went to work in the CIA’s computer department in Washington, D.C. Then in 1972 a partner and I launched CNI Data Processing, which specialized in billing systems for the cable-TV industry.\n\nMy wife and I were living in San Diego when we came across Durango, which had a population of 12,000. We liked the idea of raising a family in a small town, and I thought it’d be nice to start a business to get to know people. The local consensus was that Durango needed a car wash, which didn’t appeal to me. Then one guy said we could use a candy store. I did some research and thought if I could do five months of good business with tourists and three months with the locals over the winter holidays, maybe candy would work.\n\nI was not rich from selling my interest in CNI. I was taking out $6,000 a month from the company, which gave me time to feed the family and start the candy store. Two of my friends, Jim Hilton and Mark Lipinski, decided to go in with me. I put a second mortgage on my house and borrowed $50,000 to start the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF).\n\nDurango is famous for the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, and I wanted the store to be close to the train station. I found a place and paid $30,000 to buy the lease. It paid for itself many times over, but spending $30,000 of our $50,000 capital put a lot of pressure on us right away.\n\nI wanted to make fudge on a marble table to entertain and keep people in the store. So we ended up finding marble slabs in junkyards, cleaned them up, and used them for our tables. We got antique scales for ambiance. We then arranged to buy chocolate from a candymaker in San Diego named Everett Seeley.\n\nIt was 1981 when my wife and I moved to Durango. Jim was going to drive the marble and chocolate up in time to open on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. He showed up at 9:30 p.m. Friday night, after getting a flat tire. We got everything set up that night, but the next morning we overslept. By the time we got to the store, it was 9 a.m. We were in such a hurry, we forgot the chocolate. Jim, who came up with all the recipes for the fudge we originally sold, had never cooked more than six pounds of fudge at a time, and never at a high altitude, which affects the outcome. So he went to work making 22 pounds of fudge on a gas stove while I tried to figure out how to work the cash register.\n\nWe had a good time that day talking and laughing with people. They’d ask if we did mail orders, and we said, “Yes, of course.” That first day we got 20 fudge orders for cappuccino, black forest, rum raisin, and other flavors. Jim figured out how to make them all.\n\nAt the end of the day we sold out of fudge and made $850. The next day was pretty much the same, and we had the chocolate to sell too. That was our start.\n\nWithout refrigerated delivery to Durango, I knew we would eventually have to start making the chocolate ourselves. When Everett retired, I talked him into coming out to teach us how to do it.\n\nWe needed a cool place to work, and one of our employees lived in an apartment with a basement. So one day I went there to melt chocolate to make turtles. We had mixed the caramel and pecans in the store, and the size was accidentally five to six times larger than a normal chocolate turtle. We dipped them in chocolate anyway. Minding every penny, I said, “We’re not going to throw them out or eat them. We’re going to sell them.” We sold out in a couple of hours. So I decided to make all the chocolate oversize. That mistake turned into our brand. At the end of the first year the store did $180,000 in sales.\n\nWe had spent more than the remaining $20,000 initial capital on equipment and inventory, so we were always behind. I didn’t know enough to be afraid.\n\nWe opened three other stores and decided to franchise. We knew nothing about franchising and had no money for the infrastructure, but decided to do it anyway. In 1982, Jim went back to teaching, so I bought his interest. Mark and his wife didn’t want to live in Durango, so I bought his interest too.\n\nWe were always undercapitalized, and there were times I’d wake up at 2 a.m. wondering how I was going to make payroll. At one point I had to call every supplier to tell them we didn’t have the money to pay their invoices. People understood, and no one asked to be repaid right away.\n\nAs long as you’re in business for another day, you don’t give up. You have to continue to fight. From a financial standpoint, it took almost 20 years before we were on solid ground. We went public in 1986, and in 2013, I added U-Swirl Frozen Yogurt to the company.\n\nIt takes a little luck, a lot of perseverance, and a great team to sustain and grow a business. I’ve been very fortunate to see this business go from one store to an international brand.\n\nMy advice\n\nFrank Crail, CEO, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory\n\nMake the hardest calls first thing in the morning. That way you don’t keep putting them off.\n\nThat way you don’t keep putting them off. Never sacrifice family time for your business. You can work as many hours as you want in business, but you can’t earn back the time lost with your spouse and kids.\n\nYou can work as many hours as you want in business, but you can’t earn back the time lost with your spouse and kids. Pray for the wisdom to do the right things, not for a successful business. If you do the right things for the right reasons, it might work out. And if not, you’ll find your success somewhere else. But always do the right thing.\n\nA version of this article appears in the August 1, 2015 issue of Fortune magazine with the headline “Taking Fudge to a New Peak.”', 'How do birds communicate? By singing. And now it’s the turn of the machines. A new crop of businesses are now creating what’s referred to as the Internet of Sound.\n\nA Brief History\n\nLet’s rewind. The history of sound-as-signal is deep. In the beginning, horns, drums and bells rang the alarm, roused the congregation and directed military troops and urban workers: city-sized ringtones guided our lives. These sounds were primarily communicative, musicality was a secondary concern.\n\nAnalog sonic codes can be found in unlikely places: composers from Mozart to Schumann hid private audio-numerological jokes in their music, underwater modems guided naval vessels, telephone networks babbled dial-tone enharmonics.\n\nFor many (including me), the first experience of the Internet was the grackle squawk of a modem, of PCM-encoded games on cassette — sound not as data per se but as a by-product of data transmission, designed neither for the air nor the ear, but for the wire.\n\nWe arrive at the digital age in modern systems encoding URLs as sequences of notes for over-the-air transmission as tiny audio clips that can now be decoded in real-time on mobile devices. In the weightless world of digital, it’s easy to forget that information is a thing, it’s stuff — so why not sound? Now in the modern era, the machines can sing. And they can sing anything, from pictures to payments.\n\nThe Internet Of Sound Is Here\n\nThis is what is called the Internet of Sound, the speakernet. Using sound to send links to remote networks is one thing, but local lookup tables on-device obviate the need for another network: the sound is the network. Today’s technology is sufficient at present only to send tiny amounts of data through or above audible ranges, but good enough to encode every URL ever created as audio lasting a few seconds or less.\n\nWhy Is This A Powerful Idea?\n\nConsider this: There are more tiny, cheap speakers on the planet than there are people. Why not leverage this ubiquitous, commodity technology? We see a huge opportunity to connect a very large number of devices simply and intuitively.\n\nSound is in many ways the first, and yet the most neglected, network.\n\nSound can go where other networks do not, and sound can be a valuable part of the network ecosystem alongside existing protocols. We can trivially repurpose ATMs, TVs, toys, radios and tablets already — if it carries sound, it can send data.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nThere are a number of techniques for building the Internet of Sound, loosely comprising three categories:\n\nDescriptive: Selected pre-existing features of the signal uniquely disambiguate one signal from another, aka ‘audio fingerprinting.’ Examples include music-recognition services, like Shazam or Soundhound. Network geeks, forgive me: While it’s a stretch to call these true speakernet technologies, even music can be repurposed for point-to-point communication.\n\nAdditive: Retrievable but human-indetectable features (aka ‘audio watermarking’) are added to an arbitrary audio signal. Examples include codes used for audience-tracking in broadcast radio. One method uses tiny, imperceptibly fast echoes, normally suppressed by human hearing, used by companies like Infrasonics, mufin and Civolution. These give roughly equivalent bitrates to fingerprinting.\n\nCoded: Instead of plucking a sound from a large online library of known sounds, or adding watermarks on the fly, the entire audio signal (pitch, tone-color, phase or amplitude) is itself the code. Modern examples designed to be robust to noise, distortion and compression include multi-pitch systems like Chirp and LISNR. Latterly, Google Tone, another form of multiple frequency encoding, has entered the market. Pure-code signals ‘in plain hearing’ have the advantage of being much faster than the first two techniques.\n\nBut…\n\nAll methods have relative strengths and weaknesses. Often these are strongly orthogonal from usability and engineering perspectives. The signal can be rich in data, but hideous to hear. The signal can be embedded imperceptibly in a string quartet, but encode miniscule amounts of data. The signal may be hopelessly fragile to real-world noise or reverberation, and so on. The signal may be both unlovely and unreliable at the same time.\n\nData over audio is necessarily slow. Data over pleasant-sounding audio is slower still — thus, the trick is to send pointers instead of files. Sonic data raises issues of security: One-to-many data sharing is hugely useful, but insecure (by design); but what if you want to share to just one person? This is an interesting challenge — novel solutions are being worked on as we speak.\n\nLastly, most importantly, do we really need the Internet of Sound? I believe so. Sound is in many ways the first, and yet the most neglected, network — a bridge over the last few feet, a medium that goes where other networks cannot.\n\nTake Care\n\nThe sound itself matters. It is vital that sound is used respectfully, with care for the sonic environment. We have enough casual and arrogant noise pollution as it is, from headphone spill to street noise, to sonic UIs as a tedious afterthought: mere keypress beeps.\n\nAs audio geeks and sound designers, we take great care when designing the sounds we send, and we explicitly model our audio on sound from nature, specifically from the language of birds. The Internet of Sound needs to be a humane form of communication: that is, one that respects users by putting the human ear first and foremost.\n\nSound Is Everywhere\n\nIt’s time to get excited. The opportunities for the Internet of Sound are frankly mind-(if not ear-) boggling, from the range of applications available to the ease of deployment. The potential now exists to re-engineer speech, music and sound design for data sharing, and my company is active here.\n\nNew hardware will accelerate uptake: Ever-cheaper dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processing) chips in mobiles and connected devices for always-on listening and hands-free UIs increase the reach and efficiency of Internet of Sound products. We have already seen audio used in payments to send bitcoin over the radio, in classrooms to share pictures and on web pages to pass maps to mobiles. And we’re only just getting started. Bottom line — wherever there is sound, there is data — from dumb phones to doorbells.\n\nThe Internet of Sound is coming, and one thing is for sure — you ain’t heard nothing yet.\n\nFeatured Image: agsandrew/Shutterstock', 'The Week of the Altcoins\n\nThis graph show how prices have changed since the midnight December 7th with prices at that point being rebased to 100\n\nPrices as of 11:59 PM UTC 13/12/17 (Source: coinmarketcap)\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen another week of volatility. Litecoin’s market cap has increased by over 200% as it becomes a popular alternative to bitcoin, as the latter has faced fears of increased regulation. XRP has also been riding the wave, seeing a 50% price hike from last week.\n\n1. Bitcoin Futures Live on Cboe\n\nThe Story\n\nPlans to launch bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange have gone ahead as contracts began trading at 23:00 GMT on Sunday. The contracts will allow investors to bet on the future value of bitcoin. On the news bitcoin’s price rose significantly.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThe contract allows individuals to bet on bitcoin’s price at a specified time in the future. Given bitcoin’s rise of over 1,000% this year, many investors are keen to get in on the action; CBOE’s Bitcoin futures contract will enable investors to do so without actually owning the cryptocurrency. Additionally, it will be possible to short sell the digital asset for the first time, allowing investors to profit from price falls.\n\nThe move suggests the cryptocurrency is now becoming a mainstream investment, however, Bitcoin remains to be traded on unregulated markets. Consequently, its price is likely to remain volatile.\n\nHigh Volatility\n\nIn an effort to ease volatility, the CBOE decided it would suspend trading for two minutes for price fluctuations of more than 10% and five minutes for more than 20%. In the contract’s first session, trading was stopped twice: once for two minutes and once for five minutes. While bitcoin remains traded on largely unregulated markets, it is questionable whether this policy will have any effect on the underlying cryptocurrency’s volatility.\n\nThe Future\n\nBloomberg’s Adam Haigh said the futures contracts was “an incremental step that allows Wall Street and indeed the professional finance community to make a bet either way on bitcoin.” The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is expected to list a similar contract next week, and Nasdaq has announced plans to host such trading too.\n\nLast week Revolut’s decision to facilitate the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could increase demand for the underlying asset.\n\nAllegations that 1,000 people own 40% of all bitcoins in circulation suggest its price could be manipulated by a relatively small number of individuals.\n\n2. 1,000 People Apparently Own 40% of Bitcoin\n\nThe Winklevoss twins invest $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. (Attribution: By cellanr [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Story\n\nRoughly 40% of the cryptocurrency is owned by 1,000 people, claims Aaron Brown, head of financial markets research at AQR Capital Management. In such an unregulated market, Brown said large holders of bitcoin could potentially be working together to orchestrate price changes. Given bitcoin’s recent spike, now could be a great opportunity for these users to part with a portion of their bitcoins, locking in the near 1600% price increase since the start of the year.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nBitcoin appears to be making its way into mainstream investing. Last Friday the US regulator gave the CME group and CBOE Global Markets the green light to launch bitcoin futures. Just yesterday, London-based digital banking company Revolut launched Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether trading for their users.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency becomes a more mainstream investment and demand for it rises, these bitcoin ‘whales’ will be able to part with their bitcoins for a hefty profit. This could leave new investors with an asset in the midst of a bubble.\n\nRoger Ver, a well known early adopter of bitcoin said, regarding ‘whales’ working together, “I suspect that is likely true, and people should be able to do whatever they want with their own money.”\n\nWhile the question of whether Brown’s allegation is true must be approached with scepticism, there is evidence of some very large investors in the space. Bloomberg recently reported that on November 12th, “someone moved almost 25,000 bitcoins, worth about $159 million at the time, to an online exchange.” Bitcoin’s market cap is roughly $270bn at the time of writing, but if this investor was to sell on a single exchange, it could potentially crash the market.\n\nLarge Bitcoin Investors\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who gained fame for attempting to take control of Facebook, invested $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. This amount has many times over.\n\nTim Draper, a billionaire venture capitalist best known for his investment in Skype – during the companies early days – bought 30,000 bitcoins back in 2014. He has since invested in Tezos’ ICO.\n\nBarry Silbert, the founder of the Digital Currency Group, picked up 48,000 bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was worth $350 a piece.\n\n3. Ethereum Wallet Scam Closed Down\n\nThe Story\n\nDigital wallet provider myetherwallet.com announced yesterday that it had no affiliation with an iOS-based cryptocurrency wallet app using its name. The app, which became the third most popular on the finance section of the App Store, allows users to import and open a digital wallet to store ether. Fake digital wallets could lose investors their cryptocurrencies permanently, so it is important investors (and app stores) keep an eye out for scams.\n\nSecurity and Ethereum\n\nIn July, a developer error on the ethereum network meant a hacker pocket $31m worth of ether. While the technology is still in its infancy mistakes are bound to be made. However, several digital wallet hacks have emerged since cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed and users need to take security seriously while safeguards are not in place.\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies security, the owness is with the users. Sending ether from a digital wallet means I am responsible for my transfers. If I make a mistake when typing in the amount, or address of the receiver, I cannot call my bank and ask them to void the transaction. Consequently, user’s wallets are being targeted by scammers.\n\nSo far there have been no reports that the fake wallet stole from anyone. The company may have simply used the name for its familiarity in the ethereum community.\n\nMyetherwallet.com have since announced the removal of the app from the iOS store.\n\n4. San Francisco ICO Closed Down by SEC\n\nThe Story\n\nSan Francisco-based restaurant reviewing app Munchee has been forced to stop its initial coin offering (ICO) and reimburse investors after regulators raised concerns over the company’s tokens not meeting securities regulations. Munchee was looking to obtain $15m to “improve an existing iPhone app centred on restaurant meal reviews and create an “ecosystem” in which Munchee and others would buy and sell goods and services using the tokens,” according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nHowever, “in the course of the offering, the company and other promoters emphasized that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in value of the tokens,” they added. The regulator felt investors were led to believe they would gain a return on their tokens, however, the tokens did not meet the authority’s standards. The company was not fined due to its quick response to the SEC’s requests.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nLast week PlexCoin’s founders were charged with defrauding investors. This was the first time the SEC’s newly established Cyber Unit filed charges. The regulator issued a statement back in July saying ICOs will be subject to US security laws.\n\nBoth cases suggest a serious commitment to ensuring investors are not mis-sold securities, particularly in the ICO space.\n\n5. Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Not A Substitute for Gold\n\nSource: Tradingeconomics.com\n\nThe Story\n\nThe simultaneous rise of bitcoin and relatively poor performance of gold has provoked many to ask whether the two assets are in competition. The short answer is no, they are not.\n\n“Bitcoin has real potential, if it were to become digital gold it might have tremendous space to grow,” said Gabor Gurbacs, Vaneck Securities Director of Digital Asset Strategy. It is this sentiment which has put the two in contest. However, the investor pool for each is “vastly different”, according to Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.\n\nGold based exchange-traded funds are currently at close to their highest since May 2013, suggesting the metal remains part of investor’s portfolios, and not that investors have not cashed out and moved over to bitcoin. The reason this is not the case lies in comparing the function each asset serves and the investors it attracts.\n\nComparing Bitcoin and Gold\n\nBitcoin attracts more speculative investors looking for quick returns, while gold is often held as a portion of investment portfolios to spread risk. In times of economic downturn gold tends to go up in price, balancing any losses from stocks and bonds. The two assets currently serve distinct purposes. Consequently, bitcoin’s price rise is unlikely to have turned investors away from gold.\n\n6. Jamie Dimon Eases Hostility Towards Bitcoin After Futures Contracts Go Live\n\nSource: By Steve Jurvetson (Flickr: Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Story\n\nSource: CNBC\n\n“I remain highly skeptical of it,” said JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon, when recently asked about bitcoin. “I’m open-minded to uses of cryptocurrency if properly controlled and regulated,” Dimon added. The executive, who famously called bitcoin a “fraud” appears to have softened his opinion just days after the bitcoin-based futures derivative began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThis is the first time Dimon has spoken about bitcoin for two months. The timing of Dimon’s comments might suggest JPMorgan will offer the bitcoin derivative to its clients. The contract would allow clients to take long or short positions on bitcoin’s price.\n\nSimilar contracts will trade on the CME and Nasdaq exchanges in the near future.\n\n7. Cryptocurrency as Collateral for Loans\n\nThe Story\n\nA growing number of early cryptocurrency adopters, who have seen astronomical gains, will now be able to use their cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans. London-based Nebeus is helping third-party lenders create loans guaranteed by cryptocurrency collateral. The company created 100 of these loans on its first day and has made 1,000 more since says Nebeus’ Managing Director Konstantin Zaripov.\n\nGiven bitcoin’s market cap of almost $300bn, and a total cryptocurrency market cap of over $500bn, the market for these loans could be colossal. However, some worry that these assets are in a bubble, and their collapse makes these loans hugely risky for lenders.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nAround 40% of all bitcoins are held by 1,000 people, Bloomberg reported last week. Prior to this innovation, these users would only be able to cash in on their gains by selling their cryptocurrencies. “I can see a lending industry in the tens of billions of dollars,” said Aaron Brown, former managing director at AQR Capital Management.\n\nThe loans could attract attention from cryptocurrency miners, who earn tokens for processing blockchain network transactions. This group are typically ideologically attached to the idea of decentralised currencies, and such loans could allow them to hold on to their cryptocurrencies while they cover their overheads.\n\nHowever, bitcoin’s 1700% rise since the start of the year has caused many to stay clear. A collapse of these digital assets would leave lenders in a tough position.\n\nMust Read Articles\n\nBitcoin, Ripple and Cryptocurrencies: Here to Stay and Prosper\n\nIt is nigh on impossible to observe financial news without hearing about the rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which recently surpassed the $15,000 mark and is continuously setting new all-time highs. ..

07/27/2015,"['UPDATE (27th July 16:31 BST): Updated with statements from Peter Klamka, managing partner of Bitcoin Direct.\n\nThe man behind a Mike Tyson-branded bitcoin ATM in Las Vegas has defended the initiative after accusations it was a scam surfaced today.\n\nThis weekend, the ex-heavyweight champion of the world tweeted to his 4.89 million followers that the ATM would be ""Changing the way we get change"".\n\nWith a launch date of 30th August, the machine promised to offer cash-to-bitcoin services in under 20 seconds, 10 seconds faster than Iron Mike\'s knockout record.\n\nComing soon... http://t.co/Blf592VtUW... Changing the way we get change. — Mike Tyson (@MikeTyson) July 25, 2015\n\nWhile some hailed the news as good PR for bitcoin, questions about the legitimacy of the project soon surfaced following a closer look at the site\'s domain owner, Peter Klamka, and the project\'s partner, Bitcoin Direct LLC.\n\nSiliconANGLE reporter Duncan Riley noted the patchy internet trail of Klamka\'s firm Bitcoin Brands Inc, an over-the-counter (OTC) stock with a market cap of just $6,780 and no visible product offerings.\n\nUnlike stocks which appear on NASDAQ or the NYSE, OTC stocks – which involve small companies – are unlisted, which can make it difficult to find details about them.\n\nFor Riley, this suggested the ATM had the potential to be a scam at Tyson\'s expense.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Klamka strongly refuted these statements. Under the condition they would not be shared, he supplied three images of the branded ATMs, one showing the Vegas skyline, which he maintained were ready to be launched at any time. Additionally, he told CoinDesk that Tyson has an ""even split"" of equity due to the way the license is structured.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Brands – which Klamka maintains is not affiliated with his work with Tyson – currently operates two ATMs, one in New York and another in Montreal.\n\n""Nothing happened yet other than we announced the product. We\'re not trying to raise any money, he\'s telling them \'I have an ATM coming\' in the same way he says \'I have t-shirts coming\', except nobody asks all these questions about the t-shirt maker.""\n\n""We are not seeking anything other than to get the word out about the coolest way to buy bitcoin,"" he added.\n\nCelebrity connection\n\nAccording to Nevada records, Bitcoin Direct LLC filed only four months ago, in April 2015. The company, which bills itself as a ""bitcoin transaction solutions provider"" in its press materials, owns two General Bytes ATMs in the Vegas area, Tyson\'s home, one in a mixed martial arts centre and another in a cigar shop.\n\nThe company has links to another OTC traded company, beef supplier Conexus Cattle Corp, who bought a controlling stake in May. However, Klamka maintains that is where the relationship ends. ""They are a financing partner ... maybe tomorrow it will be a different entity, maybe not,"" he said.\n\nThe reason why the company has no online presence, Klamka said, was due to the fact it had been set up purely for ""celebrity bitcoin licensing"" opportunities. He pointed to various celebrity deals he had made in the past, including a KISS-branded visa card and a Hello Kitty pre-paid debit and credit card. The Tyson ATM, he said, would be the ex-champion\'s ""George Foreman grill"".\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

BNP Paribas\n\nFrench bank BNP Paribas is reportedly looking into the possibility of adding bitcoin to one of its currency funds, according to International Business Times.\n\nThe bank\'s possible involvement in the crypto space follows on from the publication of an article by one of its analysts, Johann Palychata. Writing for Quintessence, the bank\'s magazine, Palychata noted that the blockchain could either create ""total disruption"" or improve world trading.\n\nCoinDesk reached out to the bank for comment but no reply had been received at the time of press.\n\n2. Société Générale (SocGen)\n\nAnother one of France’s banks – the third largest in terms of assets – is looking to hire a bitcoin-focused developer.\n\nSociété Générale (SocGen) posted a job listing on 2nd July for an ""IT developer on bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrencies"".\n\nAccording to the advertisement, the role would entail research and development involving both cryptocurrencies and blockchain.\n\nAlthough the advert failed to detail specifics and the bank did not immediately reply to a comment request from CoinDesk, it is believed to be looking to develop in-house software.\n\n3. Citi Bank\n\nCoinDesk first learned that Citi had told the UK government to consider creating its own digital currency through a Freedom of Information Request (FOI).\n\nKen Moore, head of Citi Innovation Labs, later told International Business Times that the bank – the world\'s eight largest – had been exploring distributed ledger technology for the last few years.\n\nMoore also revealed that the bank had built three blockchains and was testing its own cryptocurrency – Citicoin – across them.\n\nA sponsor of Consensus, CoinDesk\'s first conference, Citi will be revealing additional information about its plans with regards to blockchain tech and digital currencies at the event in New York in September.\n\n4. UBS\n\nSwiss investment bank UBS announced it was opening a blockchain technology research lab in one of London\'s major financial districts earlier this year.\n\nAt the time, UBS said the work carried out at the innovation lab would seek to lessen the gap between banking and FinTech so as to determine how traditional banking could grow through innovation.\n\nOliver Bussmann, group CIO at UBS, said in a statement:\n\n“Our innovation Lab at Level39 will provide a unique platform to explore emerging technologies such as blockchain and crypto-currencies, and to understand the potential impact for the industry.”\n\nThe news followed the publication of of UBS’ extensive report in March 2014, which outlined the widespread benefits the adoption of bitcoin’s technology could achieve.\n\n5. Barclays\n\nJust last month, Barclays, the British multinational bank revealed plans to trial bitcoin technology.\n\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, the bank signed off on a proof-of-concept following an agreement with Safello, a Sweden-based bitcoin exchange.\n\nThe aim of the exercise, the bank said, was to investigate how blockchain tech could strengthen the financial services sector.\n\nBarclays has also supported crypto companies in the past. In March this year, the bank accepted three startups working on blockchain-related projects on to its Accelerator.\n\nA month later, Usama Fayyad, chief data officer at Barclays publicly praised blockchain tech, noting its “transformative” potential at SWIFT Business Forum in London.\n\nHe stated:\n\n“Underneath [bitcoin] lies the technology of the blockchain and I think that will be transformative.""\n\n6. Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs published a report on digital currencies last year which highlighted the potential of blockchain technology.\n\nAlthough this report initially dismissed the idea of bitcoin as a currency and labelled it a commodity, a report produced by equity research analysts the following year noted that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were part of a ""megatrend"" which could transform the way in which transactions were carried out.\n\nMore recently, the American multinational investment banking firm, participated in Circle Inc\'s $50m investment round – its involvement in the funding sent the media into a reporting frenzy.\n\n7. Banco Santander\n\nThe Spanish banking giant has been experimenting with blockchain technology.\n\nAlthough its head of research and development is due to reveal more details about its application of the technology at Consensus, we already have some insight into the bank\'s opinion on blockchain technology.\n\nA report produced by Santander InnoVentures – the bank\'s venture capital fund – Oliver Wyman and Anthemis Group said blockchain technologies could decrease infrastructure costs $15-20bn a year by 2022.\n\nIn interview with CoinDesk, Mariano Belinky, managing director at Santander InnoVentures, said:\n\n""We shouldn\'t be focused on the adoption of a digital currency. The underlying technology is a powerful one and I think that we will see adoption of that technology much sooner.""\n\n8. Standard Chartered\n\nAnju Patwardhan, chief innovation officer at Standard Chartered, recently took to LinkedIn to share her opinion on the bitcoin blockchain, noting how it could help reduce credit card, money transfers and remittance costs.\n\nLike others before her, Patwardhan said bitcoin was a distraction from the distributed ledger\'s benefits and it will never become a viable alternative to fiat currencies.\n\nSkyline image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The idea that bitcoin\'s underlying distributed ledger technology can somehow be divorced from bitcoin\'s digital currency has been the subject of debate for some time, and was again the focus of a new article written by directors at technology consulting firm Accenture.\n\nIn a new post for CIO Journal, Accenture managing directors Owen Jeff and Sigrid Seibold offered their thoughts on how institutions can begin leveraging the technology in ""corporate environments"" and ""financial marketplaces"".\n\nJeff and Sigrid asserted that, due to the high cost of paying for transactions that require anonymous consensus, blockchains need to evolve beyond the need for a native token. The critique is notable in its similarity to arguments popularized by the industry\'s more critical thought leaders like Tim Swanson and Robert Sams that center on the cost of distributed mining.\n\nJeff and Sigrid wrote:\n\n""To be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus.""\n\nThe Accenture representatives suggested one solution could be permissioned distributed blockchains, of which Ripple may be the most notable example.\n\nThe piece goes on to ask a number of other questions that all hit upon a growing divide in the industry. Bitcoin proponents have long argued that bitcoin – or some cryptocurrency – is essential to the design of a blockchain, as blockchains require a mechanism to incentivize distributed recordkeeping, a process that on the bitcoin network is facilitated by largely anonymous miners.\n\nFinancial institutions, however, seem interested in exploring alternative private networks for such functionality, or solutions that allow for transaction validators to be known.\n\nAccenture has previously made its interest in the technology public, most recently in its appeal for the UK government to more strongly regulate digital currency wallet providers.\n\nMigrating to blockchain\n\nObstructing the growth of the technology, the writers said, will also be key decisions by people outside the technology ecosystem. This includes overcoming what they called the lack of regulation surrounding the industry and a lack of clarity as to whether smart contracts would be enforceable by law.\n\nOf note given the recent interest by groups like Nasdaq is that the Accenture employees go on to raise the question of how traditional asset classes might be migrated to a blockchain-based network. Jeff and Sigrid, for example, asked how such assets could be given a clear title and when such a blockchain would begin its recordkeeping.\n\nStill, the authors were, on the whole, optimistic about the idea of distributed ledgers, concluding that the technology presents an ""enormous opportunity"" for the world\'s banks and financial institutions should it overcome these challenges.\n\nUltimately, the writers went so far as to predict a future where those who did not investigate the technology early were ultimately unable to compete, concluding:\n\n""As seats at the table become fewer, only the companies and banks who embraced blockchain’s potential early will remain. Blockchains will bring disruption and displacement, but for the early movers, it will also bring opportunity and growth.""\n\nImage via Flickr\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It could be replaced 3 years from now, or 5 years, or 10 years from now. It will happen, in my opinion, the only question is when, not if, it does.\n\nI could be wrong, but don’t just take my word for it. Peter Schiff, Robert Kiyosaki, Bill O’Reilly, and other noted experts read the handwriting on the wall as well and have come to the same conclusion. The only issue is when it will come to pass.\n\nIt looks like Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, agrees with this assessment as well, but the outcome is very different in his eyes. Not only will the U.S. Dollar days as the world’s economic sledgehammer end sooner rather than later, but it will fall at the hands of the digital currency bitcoin. Not only that, but he says his company, Coinbase, has a plan to make it so, within the next 15 years.\n\nMany will find this crazy, but I think bitcoin could surpass the dollar as reserve currency within 10-15 years. — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) July 24, 2015\n\nThose that see the end of the dollar’s influence ending in the near future see many issues. Among the many reasons for this sentiment are “Quantitative Easing” creating too much liquidity and debasing its value; a lack of demand outside of the United States, where more than half the dollars worldwide reside; bilateral trade agreements increasing at an increasing rate; moving goods and services around the dollar to escape its influence on trade.\n\nBut the real problem has been finding a global alternative. There is nothing that is ready to replace it alone, so “a basket of currencies” may be a short-term answer in the coming years until a permanent solution is found. After over seventy years of unlimited economic power, the world is putting the U.S. Dollar on the clock.\n\nI could write a separate article about the geo-economic dynamics of it all, but the short answer is the U.S. Dollar is dying, and the world is working on a suitable replacement along with Armstrong and Coinbase, who “have a rough plan to get there.”\n\nBitcoin, a global reserve currency?\n\nIn theory, does bitcoin have the downward mobility to potentially make it a global reserve currency? Technically, yes, but it was never intended for that purpose but as an alternative to fiat currencies. The primary problem for bitcoin becoming a global reserve currency, besides its decentralized nature, is price/value volatility. U.S. Dollars lose value every year, like clockwork, but so slowly that people don’t notice it on a daily basis. Until the volatility has leveled off recently, bitcoin’s value has been a major source of uncertainty.\n\n""Volatility is a self-correcting problem, and we\'ve seen that as it\'s dropped in the last three years, year-on-year,"" Armstrong told IBTimes UK. ""I foresee it continuing to do that over the next few years.""\n\nDo I believe bitcoin as a global reserve currency is a realistic goal? No, but with bitcoin, anything is possible. People will not give up their bank accounts for bitcoin wallets, en masse, anytime soon. The chances of a decentralized global currency run by bitcoin miners, not central banks, are beyond slim.\n\nThe world’s centralized banking interests will do anything to continue to control the world’s monetary system. There’s a lot of money in it. Therefore, the prospect of bitcoin supplanting the US dollar as a global reserve currency is an altruistic, but unrealistic outcome.\n\nBut is Armstrong onto something? We’ll learn a lot about the world’s economy, Bitcoin, and Coinbase, in the coming years. However, what is almost certain is that Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere and its part in an ever-increasing digital future is all but assured.', 'Henry Sanderson JULY 27, 2015 16 When Daniel Masters walked into a bitcoin conference in Amsterdam last year, he had spent more than a decade riding the boom in commodities markets. Held at the city’s sleek Passenger Terminal venue, it was far from the typical gathering of oil traders he was used to attending. The chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the controversial virtual currency, wore a shirt emblazoned with the word “geek”. Patrick Byrne, chief executive of Overstock, a retailer, who had spent years railing against Wall Street and short-sellers, gave the keynote speech dressed in a Chinese suit from Shanghai Tang and quoted Marx, Hegel and Kant. The informality did not tip over into triviality, though. “I didn’t know what I was going to find. But the minute I walked in, I realised it was a very serious proposition,” says 51-year-old Mr Masters, who started trading oil in the 1980s at Shell, decades before bitcoin’s creation in 2009 and its subsequent adoption by the libertarian tech community. “You got a sense of the body corpus of the bitcoin industry, and it’s solid. This had just the most spectacular energy around it, and that’s when I said ‘this is absolutely for real,’” he recalls. The conference was a turning point for Mr Masters, giving him confidence in his instinct that this was a career change worth pursuing. A few months later, in July, authorities in Jersey approved the Global Advisors bitcoin fund he runs with his business partner. The fund buys and sells bitcoin in a bid to take advantage of its price movements. Other funds set up in the US are yet to receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Having suffered bouts of hair-raising volatility, frauds, and the high-profile collapse of an online marketplace that sold illegal drugs for bitcoin, the sector is now attracting a more mainstream crowd. While early enthusiasts saw the virtual currency as enabling anonymity, the collapse of borders and freedom from traditional banks and middlemen, many of the new entrants have worked for the world’s largest financial institutions. Larry Summers, former treasury secretary, and John Reed, former Citibank chief executive, have joined the advisory board of Silicon Valley bitcoin start-up Xapo, it announced in May. Still, in the investment business, Mr Masters is somewhat of an outlier, betting on the future value appreciation for bitcoin. For regulators, there are still concerns. The SEC issued a warning last May to investors about the risks of fraudulent bitcoin and virtual currencies products. Last year, HSBC cut its ties with Mr Masters’ companies after 15 years, when he approached them about acting as banker for the bitcoin fund, because of fears about the risk of money laundering, he says. Mr Masters says the fund went through a stringent approval process with the Jersey Financial Services Commission. Backlash Why buy a bitcoin fund Bitcoin attracts its fair share of supporters and detractors, who argue over fees paid to exchanges, the interest by banks in its technology, and the utility of using it for purchases. Jeffrey Robinson, an expert on organised crime, is the author of the book BitCon: the Naked Truth About Bitcoin. He says investors should be aware that the market is very shallow and controlled by a few players. “Why would you buy into a bitcoin investment fund when, if you want to ‘invest’ — make that, gamble — on bitcoins, just buy them\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009My advice to anyone thinking about ‘investing’ in this kind of nonsense is, what you’re really doing is playing roulette. So take your money instead to Las Vegas where you know for sure the wheel isn’t loaded.” Those pursuing similar projects to Mr Masters’ are few. In 2013, Barry Silbert launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which this year allowed investors to trade its shares on an over-the-counter marketplace. The fund is not registered with the SEC. And a bitcoin exchange-traded fund set up by the twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who achieved fame through their involvement with Facebook, is still waiting to be approved. But interest in the sector is growing. Mr Master’s ex-wife Blythe Masters, a JPMorgan veteran who played a key role behind the development of credit- default swaps, this year became chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings, a virtual currency start-up that aims to settle digital and financial assets using the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin that records its digital transactions. That technology is expanding bitcoin’s reach into the boardrooms on Wall Street as banks and exchanges assess how they might make use of it. But as a means of payment, it is still nowhere near to being widely used. The market capitalisation of all bitcoins hovers at about $4.16bn, a fraction of the global currency market. Consumers are more likely to use a Starbucks app on their phone to buy coffee and PayPal to send money to a friend than bitcoin. For Mr Masters, it is an investment opportunity. It has all the characteristics of the oil market when he first started at Shell in London in 1985, he says, being volatile, periodically illiquid and sparsely regulated. It was at Shell in 1986 where he first met Russell Newton, his business partner. In 1999, after Mr Masters had gone on to hone his skills as a trader at Phibro Energy, one of the biggest oil traders of the time, and run the energy business at JPMorgan in New York, the pair set up a commodities fund, Global Advisors. His fund started buying oil at $15 and $16 a barrel for delivery years later, probably buying more than $1bn, he says. His best year was 2000, when the fund returned 40 per cent and had average assets of $180m. The commodity fund was closed in 2013, as investors withdrew their money and commodity prices peaked due to China’s slowing growth. A year later, Mr Masters dived into bitcoin, where he advocates a similar buy and hold strategy overall. Demand for bitcoins is likely to increase as it is used for small quick payments through social media such as Facebook for reading news or renting out your WiFi, he believes. It will coexist with digital platforms such as Apple Pay and PayPal, which transfer conventional currency, but it will be used more in cross-border exchange. Bitcoin and its technology can better integrate with our digital lives than current payment settlement systems, which are already decades old, he says. “It’s not about ‘we’re trying to screw the banks’, or hackers taking over finance — it’s nothing to do with that. This is a technology which offers opportunity and utility that simply doesn’t exist in the current system.” But riding the volatility of bitcoin through Mr Masters’ fund will require investors to place a large amount of trust in him, rather than buying bitcoin directly. Trust is a problem that has bedevilled the digital currency’s development, especially since an ever- expanding number of companies have sprung up to offer services for buying, holding, and selling bitcoin, at a fee. Similar to oil in the late 1990s, when investing directly was rare, he wants to bring more investors into bitcoin. His fund has attracted 10 investors including wealthy individuals, family offices, and two global money management firms. The invested amount ranges from the $100,000 minimum to $600,000 per investor, he says. It is up more than 20 per cent this month because of the turmoil over Greece. Unlike many who attend bitcoin conferences, Mr Masters believes the digital currency can flourish only in partnership with legacy financial institutions, such as the large banks. There has been a clear change since he started the fund among banks and governments, he says. “The lesson of the last year or two is the more transparent, the more embracing of regulation, and the less libertarian and confrontational you are, the better your bitcoin business does.”', 'Investment in bitcoin is outpacing that of the early Internet by almost 25%, according to a report today by the International Business Times, a London, U.K.-based newspaper.\n\nVenture capitalist investment in bitcoin startups is projected to be $786 million in 2015, compared with $639 million in Internet companies in 1996, the report noted.\n\nThe venture capital investing includes the $116 million raised by the San Francisco-based 21 Inc. in March, the most ever for a cryptocurrency sector startup.\n\n‘A Fringe Technology’\n\nMarc Andreessen from Andreessen Horowitz, the lead investor, said that bitcoin was similar to the Internet in its early years. He called it a “fringe technology” with “fringe characters” and “fringe politics.”\n\n“In 1994, as a venture capital firm, it would have been a good idea to take the Internet seriously and it would have been a good idea to invest in a cross-section of (Internet) companies,” Andreessen said at the time.\n\nOther bitcoin startup funding in 2015 included $50 million in Circle, $28 million in Ripple Labs and $75 million in Coinbase.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Startup 21 Inc.

As seen in the following screenshot, a zero fee transaction can currently be delayed by up to five blocks, or roughly an hour (though sometimes longer).\n\nCointape Could Alleviate User Confusion\n\nThe topic of fees has been huge in the Bitcoin community as of late, centering around the size of default maximum size of blocks (how many transactions can be fit into a block) and the minimum fees users should pay. The current minimum to broadcast a transaction is zero. A pull request was made by Core Developer Luke-Jr to “restore minimum feerate to 10,000 satoshis,” but the request was not merged into mainline code.\n\nMore recently, as a result of the ongoing discussion amongst core developers and the larger Bitcoin sphere, Bitcoin.org maintainer David Harding felt it was necessary to remove all references to “low fees” and “instant” transactions from Bitcoin.org. As happens perhaps too often, the pull request sparked a minor controversy around the purpose and nature of Bitcoin.\n\nOn top of all this, mainstream financial outlets have decided to take a new tone in regards to Bitcoin, pushing a narrative that illustrates the open source development process as more of a liability than a plus. CNBC ran an article describing the block size debate as a “war,” and as is typical, showed a fundamental misunderstanding for how the currency works.\n\nCointape.com will be a useful tool regardless of what the outcome of the block size argument is, in that those who want quick transactions will always be able to figure out what fee to pay. To use the tool, simply take the size of your transaction and multiply it by the optimum Satoshi rate. The site says the current optimum rate is 40 Satoshis per byte, so a typical transaction of 619 bytes would be best to include a total fee of 0.00024760. As you can see, the author got away with less than half of that on Friday.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Peter Randall resurfaces with post-trade blockchain startup\n\nPeter Randall, the former CEO and founder of Chi-X, is once again looking to upset established market mechanisms with the launch of an institutional payment and settlement system based on blockchain technology.\n\nRandall has partnered with Anthony Culligan, an experienced hedge fund investor and CEO and founder of peer-to-peer bitcoin trading venue Roolo, to launch the SETL system, with a view to streamlining post-trade infrastructures.\n\n\n\nHe says the SETL system will enable market participants to move cash and assets directly between each other, facilitating the immediate and final settlement of market transactions. SETL maintains a permissioned distributed ledger of ownership and transaction records, simplifying the process of matching, settlement, custody, registration and transaction reporting.\n\n\n\nSays Randall: ‘With SETL, we aim to do to the post-trade environment, what we did to exchange trading with Chi-X. Clearing and settlement processes are fragmented, cumbersome, costly and in need of technological innovation and simplification. Our aim is to be platform, exchange, currency and asset agnostic. When you have agreed a transaction, SETL will be the way to simultaneously move the consideration and the asset as well as provide a ‘golden record’ of the transaction.""\n\n\n\nOther members of the SETL team include Nicholas Pennington - formerly of Robert Fleming Securities, JP Morgan, Powe Capital and F&C Partners - as CTO, and Francois Barthelemy - an alumni of Robert Fleming Securities, Morgan Stanley and F&C Partners - as head of corporate strategy.\n\n\n\nCulligan says SETL has been designed from ground up to meet the needs of the finance industry and eliminate some of the concerns raised about the use of blockchain technology for financial markets, particularly around issues of anonymity and robustness.\n\n\n\nHe says: ""Understanding how financial markets work has been key to the design process so far. Solutions in the world of finance need to address practical issues such as capital usage, bank liquidity and regulatory permissions. SETL is the product of the decades of financial markets expertise of its founders as well as genuine technical innovation.""\n\n\n\nThe SETL infrastructure has demonstrated speeds of up to 5000 transactions per second in tests, says Culligan, and is expected to reach speeds of 100,000 transactions per second in an enterprise environment.\n\n\n\nCulligan and Randall insist that the business case shows solid revenue flows and say that the company is in talks with a number of first tier institutions who are looking to commercialise blockchain technology.', 'Last month, a Bitcoin development project won a Grand Challenges Explorations grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a $100,000 grant to work on Bitcoin development in Kenya. It\'s a big milestone for the Bitcoin movement that a major foundation with so much influence and clout in development work is taking an interest in the movement to cryptocurrency.\n\nThis phase one grant will go to Daniel Bloch, who will work in Kenya to develop a money platform called Bitsoko, which uses ""Blockchain technology for low-cost transactions mediated by bitcoins."" Bloch will also create ""simplified options for paying household bills and payrolls"" and use the project to evaluate the security of the platform.\n\nThe Gates Foundation opened itself up to working with Bitcoin when it issued a Grand Challenge Exploration in September of 2014 to ""Enable Universal Acceptance of Mobile Money Payments."" Daniel Bloch is perhaps just the first of many Bitcoin developers who will be reaching out to Gates and other funders interested in financial inclusion. The bigger picture here is that there\'s a huge amount of interest right now in finding low-cost ways to enable the world\'s poor to access the kinds of financial services that people in developed countries take for granted.\n\nA major obstacle to serving the unbanked, who have very little money, is that it\'s not profitable to do for financial companies. Bitcoin could conceivably be a game changer in this regard. In an interview with CoinDesk, Kosta Peric, deputy director of the Financial Services for the Poor initiative at Gates, said:\n\nThe very powerful thing about Bitcoin in general and especially the technologies behind it, is they are essentially leapfrogging all the technology and providing a new system for processing these huge amounts of transactions for very small costs.\n\nThere\'s nothing to match support from the Gates Foundation when it comes to mainstream respectability. But another foundation specifically devoted to Bitcoin development, the Bitgive Foundation, has been working this ground for a while, and is pushing hard to change the way business is done in philanthropy as well as all other sectors of the global economy.\n\nAt a recent conference in Chicago called Inside Bitcoin, Connie Gallippi, founder of the BitGive Foundation, presented a video demonstrating the impact of the bitcoin charity’s efforts in Kenya. The presentation was the inauguration of a new phase of BitGive’s philanthropic mission and fundraising called Bitcoin Charity 2.0.', 'It\'s certainly not unusual in the bitcoin and blockchain industry to see several companies coalesce around a new use case for the technology. However, what may be novel about the sudden focus on Wi-Fi is the size and ubiquity of the consumer pain point.\n\nTo date, startups such as the Boost VC-backed BitMesh and Wi-Fi services provider WIFI Metropolis are both developing concepts around the idea. The consensus? The popularity yet inaccessibility of Wi-Fi networks offers a compelling use case for bitcoin today, one that is more promising when compared to the costs consumers currently bear for data access at home and on-the-go.\n\n""Wi-Fi is virtually everywhere,"" explained WIFI Metropolis chief Wi-Fi explorer Reilly Smith. ""If you walk around a dense area there\'s going to be signals, none of which you can really connect to. I pay for data out of convenience because it\'s such a hassle to deal with Wi-Fi.""\n\nAt the heart of both the BitMesh and WIFI Metropolis initiatives is the idea that it could become profitable for businesses and consumers to begin opening their Wi-Fi networks to the public.\n\nAs Smith told CoinDesk:\n\n""For Wi-Fi, there\'s free and expensive. There\'s no micropayments middle ground.""\n\nAdding merit to the idea is research from firms like Cisco, which has found that Wi-Fi is the ""predominant access technology for mobile devices"". Due to its cost, paid-for options such as 4G remain unpopular with consumers, Deloitte concurred. Its research found 30% of consumers feel that paid data options like 4G are too expensive.\n\nThe case for bitcoin, more specifically, is that it enables low-cost micropayments, which proponents argue are too expensive via traditional payment services. Chris Smith, co-founder of BitMesh, for example, noted that his company has created micropayments channel tech to allow for transactions of a fraction of a cent for Wi-Fi use.\n\nWhen implemented, Chris Smith foresees a future where a coffee shop may offer its service as a way to better monetize its Internet offerings without forcing people to purchase food or drink.\n\n""A coffee shop sets up BitMesh, you try to connect to their Wi-Fi and they redirect you to BitMesh,"" he said. ""It turns on, asks you if the price is fair and you can pay by unit of time or per data unit, say 1¢ per megabyte. We create a micropayments channel so you can pay per megabyte, and you set the maximum amount you want to pay.""\n\nFirst experiments\n\nAt present, both services are in the initial stages of rolling out the concepts.\n\nWIFI Metropolis, which currently offers Wi-Fi services to enterprise partners such as St Pancras International station, recently added bitcoin to an app designed to serve as a crowdsourced resource for travelers looking for free Wi-Fi hotspots globally.\n\nWith the latter feature, it embarked on a campaign to incentivize new additions to the app while improving the quality of submissions. The success, Smith said, far outpaced a rewards initiative that leveraged Amazon rewards:\n\n""When we integrated bitcoin, we added 60,000 hotspots and gave away about $7,000 worth of bitcoin.""\n\nBitcoin allowed WiFi Metropolis users to earn points by adding new hotspots to the map or otherwise integrating them to its network. The tech provided the promise of a universal reward, one that Smith argues eliminated the need to deal with country-specific differences in Amazon rewards, such as striking deals with local Amazon affiliates and integrating the APIs.\n\nStill, bitcoin wasn\'t a magic bullet solution. ""There was a small pool of hackers trying to find every which way to ... exploit and litter the app,"" he said.\n\nHe suggested the problem was so bad the team discovered that one user was simply tagging any hotspot he could find while on a bus trip to Sacramento.\n\n""About 30% of the hotspots that were being redeemed were just crap,"" he added.\n\nBuilding a network\n\nThough WIFI Metropolis is arguably looking at more enterprise use cases, BitMesh is pursuing a more grassroots version of the concept.\n\nAs Chris Smith explained, BitMesh is built on wireless mesh networking, a type of self-contained computer network that has gained popularity in times when traditional Internet services have failed or proved prone to outages.\n\n“We can sell a Raspberry Pi with a special image on it and now you\'re collecting bitcoin from your neighbors in exchange for Internet.”\n\n""It was a technology developed by the military to make more robust, harder to take down computer networks,"" he said. ""In mesh networks, no one node is more important than the others, so if you take out a few nodes, you can\'t destroy the network.""\n\nSmith\'s original idea was to create a network of local Internet users who would share the costs of service in an effort to be more economical. Still, he had trouble determining how he could incentivize the users in such a system. ""In retrospect, it\'s very obvious, you can incentivize it with it bitcoin,"" he recalled.\n\nBitMesh remains focused on the peer-to-peer nature of the currency. In its current, pre-release version, BitMesh doesn\'t hold customer funds, but rather provides the technology that they can use to pay others in bitcoin for Wi-Fi services.\n\n""We\'re looking at it as a way to democratize Internet and get bitcoin in more people\'s hands. We can sell a Raspberry Pi with a special image on it and now you\'re collecting bitcoin from your neighbors in exchange for Internet,"" he continued.\n\nTo appeal to users who have bitcoin today, BitMesh said it remains focused on being as open-source as it can be, though he suggested the company is considering offering licensing to larger institutions as it develops a revenue model.\n\nBitMesh soon plans to open a private alpha that will allow a limited number of Internet users to begin opening their service to other users with the goal of honing the offering for the public.\n\nAn Airbnb solution\n\nDespite the rocky start, Reilly Smith believes it won\'t be difficult to get consumers to pay for Internet in smaller, known increments, thereby potentially removing the fear of a large unforeseen charge. This factor, he said, is leading WIFI Metropolis to continue to explore the idea of using bitcoin in its services.\n\n""People sometimes just buy coffee to get Internet,"" Smith explained. ""Businesses are already using captive portals, buy something and you get a code that gets you on the Internet.""\n\nSmith suggested that the blockchain could facilitate an Airbnb or Uber-like marketplace that serves as a clearinghouse between Wi-Fi owners and smartphone users who want to similarly gain access to shared services. Right now, however, he suggests two barriers exist to this kind of service.\n\nFirst, the tech is still being developed – he projects six-to-eight months before it can be applied to a marketplace. Though, more importantly, he argues it\'s currently not clear what consumers will want to pay for Wi-Fi, a service that has historically been expected for free.\n\nSmith concluded:\n\n""Wi-Fi is treated like a cheapest-to-deliver amenity. It\'s just, can you connect or not? There\'s no incentive structure to improve your experience at Starbucks. First, we have to derive value and make it user driven.""\n\nWiFi visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

07/28/2015,"['NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former New York financial regulator Benjamin Lawsky on Tuesday countered criticism from the bitcoin community that he may have generated consulting work for himself by issuing controversial regulations for virtual currency firms before he left his post.\n\nLawsky, who departed last month as superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, started his own firm to advise companies on regulation and other matters.\n\nIn his first public appearance since his transition, the outspoken former regulator was interviewed at a digital currency conference in Manhattan.\n\nMarc Hochstein, editor-in-chief of the American Banker, asked Lawsky about the possible conflict of interest in his issuing regulations governing bitcoin on June 3. New York was the first state to do so.\n\n“To clear the air,” Hochstein asked, “what would you say to someone who would think that maybe you built yourself a revolving door?”\n\nLawsky responded that he was not allowed to do any work before the department for two years, including behind-the-scenes work. He also said he is banned for life from working on any matter he worked on at the department.\n\n“The rules are very clear,” Lawsky said. ”If anyone... said ‘I want to hire you to help get a BitLicense from DFS,’ no can do.”\n\nStill, Lawsky did not rule out taking on virtual currency clients.\n\nLawsky left the department on June 16, after four years of running the agency and overseeing landmark settlements with global banks accused of misconduct.\n\nHe began to make a name for himself in 2012 when he threatened to revoke British bank Standard Chartered Plc’s license to operate in New York over violations related to U.S. sanctions.\n\nHe registered The Lawsky Group in Delaware on June 17, according to the state’s website. His new company’s address is 27 East 62nd Street in Manhattan, according to the company website, a domain name registered in early May.\n\nHowever, the 62nd Street building is under construction, according to a spokeswoman for billionaire Ronald Perelman’s MacAndrews & Forbes, which owns it. Lawsky told Reuters he would move into the building in the fall.\n\nMacAndrews & Forbes’ general counsel Steve Cohen offered to loan Lawsky temporary space, a Perelman company spokeswoman said.\n\nCohen is a former top aide to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who chose Lawsky as superintendent. The pair also worked together under Cuomo when he was New York Attorney General.', 'Mike Tyson is either getting into the Bitcoin game or is getting scammed out of a bunch of money.\n\nTyson, a former heavyweight boxing world champion, tweeted a link this weekend to a website with the best URL you’ll see all year:\n\nComing soon… http://t.co/Blf592VtUW… Changing the way we get change. — Mike Tyson (@MikeTyson) July 25, 2015\n\nThe man who once squandered $400 million wants to change the way we get change.\n\nIt almost makes sense: nobody wants to tell Mike Tyson he can’t do something. A stint on Dancing With the Stars? A documentary about your passion for pigeons? A feature on Madonna’s new album? Now Bitcoin?\n\nWhatever you say, Mike.\n\nThe Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM website gets straight to it: this machine will turn your cash to Bitcoin in 20 seconds. Mike Tyson’s shortest fight ever was 30 seconds. Coming to Las Vegas in August.\n\nA spokesperson gave CNBC this comment from Tyson that he definitely did not write:\n\n“I’m very proud to be a part of the Bitcoin revolution. Digital currency is the future and the more I learn about it the more intrigued I become. Digital currency is going to level the playing ground for those that want alternatives for financial freedom. No one knows better than I how uncertain the economy can be and at this juncture in my life it is imperative that I am proactive about my financial planning and for me it includes Bitcoin.”\n\nWhatever you say, Mike.\n\nBut this wouldn’t be a Mike Tyson story without some kind of bizarre hiccup.\n\nSilicon Angle points out that this whole thing could easily be a scam: Mike Tyson Bitcoin’s URL is registered to a Peter Klamka, who owns Bitcoin Brands Inc and Bitcoin Direct LLC.\n\nBitcoin Brands Inc is an OTC stock with a market cap of less than $7,000. Unlike the NYSE or NASDQ, these are unlisted stocks, so details are scant.\n\nNevada state records show that Bitcoin Direct LLC filed opening paperwork just four months ago. A press release soon followed in which the company describes itself as providing “bitcoin transaction solutions.” That same release notes that the company is financed by the Conex Cattle Corporation, a beef provider that purchased a majority stake in Bitcoin Direct just after it opened.\n\nGoogling Klamka’s name yields equally shady results: the first is a bizarre website with equally bizarre comments that appear to be written by someone very defensive of Peter Klamka. The second result is a court brief stemming from his failure to pay child support.\n\nIn all likelihood, a huckster has convinced Tyson, a professional head trauma survivor, that Bitcoin will be his Foreman Grill. Or maybe Tyson actually is passionate about “proactive financial planning.”\n\nWhatever you say, Mike.', 'American Banker\'s second annual digital currencies conference was also its first to put an equal emphasis on the emerging opportunities posed by bitcoin\'s distributed ledger, the blockchain.\n\nThe idea that conversation around the technology has altered drastically in the last year was first noted by American Banker editor in chief Marc Hochstein in the event\'s opening address. The talk proved forward-thinking in its praise for the promise of more expansive and experimental use cases for the blockchain while acknowledging that bitcoin, as its first application, had kickstarted a new wave of innovation.\n\n""I\'m not going to opine on the price, I\'m going to talk about bitcoin, because the idea of it has made me a better editor at American Banker,"" Hochstein said. ""Bitcoin has cast everything that came before it in a new light.""\n\nThis tug-of-war between ideologies shaping the technology\'s development was on display most prominently in the event\'s early offerings, including a solo speaking slot by Eris Industries co-founder Preston Byrne and a panel featuring Symbiont\'s Adam Krellenstein, Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert and author Tim Swanson.\n\nThe most interesting talks centered around the still evolving question of whether private blockchains pose a threat to public ledgers like bitcoin, or if they are simply another evolution of the technology specialized for more specific use cases. Still, most panels sought to showcase the technology\'s place in conversation surrounding larger concepts affecting the financial industry, such as digital identity, data security regulation and recordkeeping.\n\nRepresenting incumbent banks in this conversation was BNY Mellon managing director Cheryl Gurz, who spoke on a panel meant to highlight future use cases for blockchains. Gurz shed light on the difficulty of mediating a conversation between enthusiastic technologists and sometimes critical economists while trying to uncover whether the technology can offer solutions.\n\nGruz said:\n\n""We shouldn\'t just be listening, we should be challenging. We should be in the conversations with the regulators. So much is being assumed that we\'re going to do, so much is driven by others.""\n\nStill prominent was conversation about bitcoin as a currency and its price against the dollar, though some panels and speakers touched on its potential use case in areas where financial services have yet to permeate.\n\nMasters takes the stage\n\nPerhaps the day\'s most anticipated session was the opening keynote by Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters, the former JP Morgan executive.\n\nMasters began her talk by addressing the opportunity she saw in distributed ledger technology as well as the personal journey that led her to get involved in its development.\n\nWhile she said not every ""cool technology"" could be a catalyst for change and that real barriers toward wider adoption would prohibit short-term adoption, Masters was effusive in voicing her belief that the blockchain and distributed ledgers pose a significant opportunity.\n\nMasters said:\n\n""It should be fairly obvious that the addressable market for this technology is absolutely gigantic. We\'re talking markets that are measured in the trillions, not the billions. However, there are real frictions that exist, like the cash that we use is fiat cash and resides in bank accounts and not on digital ledgers.\n\nEchoing comments raised in a recent article penned by executives at technology consulting firm Accenture, Masters also went on to note some of the more specific questions that she feels need to be addressed, such as how the industry should move toward standardization and deal with property titling issues.\n\nOverall, Masters seemed keen to present a unifying message to the audience, suggesting that the best course of action for the industry is to work to understand the issues faced in the traditional financial industry.\n\n""We need to be communicating with the existing legacy of financial infrastructure. It\'s important that we\'re respectful of that existing infrastructure, it works today and it has to work,"" she said.\n\nElsewhere, Masters addressed questions from the crowd, with one attendee posing a hypothetical situation designed to test the limits of permissioned or private ledgers. In this case, Masters was asked how a Venezuelan bank might interact with a permissioned ledger.\n\nIn response, she issued one of her first public comments on the bitcoin blockchain as a subset of the larger innovation, stating:\n\n""I\'m not making claims that the bitcoin blockchain has no useful purpose.""\n\nSeparating bitcoin from blockchain\n\nThis friction surrounding the idea that certain parties in the industry are attempting to separate bitcoin\'s speculative currency from its digital ledger again created sparks in the panel including Krellenstein; Silbert; Swanson; and New York Law School\'s Houman Shadab.\n\nIt was perhaps Swanson and Silbert that served as the polar opposites around which the conversation pivoted, with Silbert emphasizing the expected high future price of bitcoin and Swanson revisiting his published work critiquing the cost efficiency of the bitcoin network when compared to tokenless blockchains.\n\n""If you\'re doing a public network, maybe the only way to do that is a token. But if you\'re working with known entities on a private network, you can have contractual obligations to secure this network,"" Swanson explained.\n\nHe went on to relay an anecdote in which he suggested a bank had asked him whether it would be liable if it was involved in a transaction where the validating miner was perhaps operating in a country sanctioned under US law. Swanson suggested that, with the bitcoin network, answers to questions like this still remain too unclear.\n\nSilbert took the opposite approach attempting to galvanize audience interest in bitcoin by appealing to the speculative value associated with its tokens. His remarks suggested he sees a potential outcome where bitcoin is propelled past alternative blockchains as the use of its network could create new wealth for users.\n\n""You didn\'t buy bitcoin because you were trying solve issues with loans, you bought it out of greedy speculation,"" Silbert said. ""You have a financial incentive to see bitcoin succeed.""\n\nIn the midst of these disparate voices was Shadab, who successfully translated the debate into a moderate stance. Shadab argued that blockchains should be seen as transaction platforms that can be designed to offer certain advantages and disadvantages.\n\nShadab was also agnostic in his view on the bitcoin network, adding:\n\n""These problems can be solved, but there are technological issues that you all will need to deal with it. Is it a token-based blockchain or a permissioned blockchain? As bitcoin grows in size and as transactions grow over time, some of the benefits of bitcoin, low-to-marginal transaction fees, may disappear over time. So there\'s trust tradeoffs.""\n\nElsewhere, Swanson raised eyebrows with his typically confrontational approach to the panel session, suggesting that industry firm ShapeShift was perhaps providing a ""money laundering service"" due to its approach to regulation.\n\nThe blockchain as software\n\nPerhaps best known for its colorful public messaging, distributed ledger startup Eris Industries made a splash with a confident presentation by co-founder Preston Byrne.\n\nByrne offered what may be some of the first public details on the project, revealing it intends to focus on smart contracts that use code to move and manage digital assets on a blockchain, thereby eliminating the need for a token.\n\nByrne claimed Eris is already working with ""several tier-one banks"", all of whom he says are interested in its centralized approach to the technology. ""Decentralization doesn\'t work within existing legal paradigms. It causes more commercial problems than it solves,"" he argued.\n\nInstead, Byrne sought to assert that the true innovation behind bitcoin was that it had created new database efficiencies, effectively merging a database with its log. ""Bitcoin is a very successful piece of software, but it\'s just software,"" he said.\n\nByrne also gave insight into the trajectory of the company, which he said built a decentralized Reddit and YouTube in 2014 to prove the data processing capabilities of blockchains.\n\nStill, he stressed that centralized alternatives to public blockchains like bitcoin could possibly be faster today while solving problems for enterprise clients.\n\n""There are no network effects for a database, you\'re serving a market,"" he said. ""Blockchain technology is better now than it was six years ago. You can get confirmations in a block in two seconds. They work in private segments, not necessarily decentralized ones.""\n\nNasdaq\n\nThe clearest insight into the evolving debate over the technology\'s development was perhaps provided by the day\'s final panel, which focused on its impact in financial markets.\n\nDominick Paniscotti, associate vice president of enterprise architecture at Nasdaq, provided the session\'s highlights, discussing how bitcoin only ""scratched the surface"" of the potential of bitcoin as a technology.\n\nHe told the crowd:\n\n""You start off with this, \'Oh it\'s a digital currency, should we put up a bitcoin exchange? Could we trade spot bitcoin? We can set up an exchange any time we want to trade bitcoin, the power is to identify this person. I can identify that I sent something to someone and then everyone can look at it and say yeah that occurred.""\n\nPaniscotti went on to suggest he sees bitcoin as being one of a number of competing blockchains, ones that are better optimized for other needs.\n\nSymbiont co-founder Mark Smith and Digital Asset Holdings CMO Dan O\'Prey also provided insight in the difficulty of delivering technology to institutions such as Nasdaq, speaking about the ""long sales cycle"" and lack of education that is holding back efforts.\n\n""When you\'re walking into the door and explaining what is bitcoin, you have maybe a year, a year and half sales cycle,"" moderator Brendan O\'Connor, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, said. ""When you walk in there and you\'re talking about utilizing bitcoin with this wallet provider, and you start having these kinds of questions, you know they\'re giving it more serious thought.""\n\nSmith went on to talk about how the emphasis on the blockchain as a technology had opened more doors to enterprise institutions, concluding:\n\n""The naming of this conference tells you a lot.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'This is a guest post by Eric Lombrozo, the Co-CEO and CTO of Ciphrex Corp., a software company pioneering decentralized consensus network technology. Lombrozo is also a founding member of the CryptoCurrency Security Standards Steering Committee and has been a longtime contributor to the open source Bitcoin core development effort.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the last few months, a contentious debate has arisen surrounding the issue of a hardcoded constant in the consensus rules of the Bitcoin network. While on the surface it appears to be a simple enough change, this single issue has opened up a veritable Pandora’s box.\n\nWhat is the block-size limit and why is it there?\n\nWhen the Bitcoin network was in infancy, several assumptions had to be made regarding what kind of computational resources a typical Bitcoin node would have. Among these resources were network bandwidth, storage space and processor speed. If blocks were allowed to grow too big they would swamp these resources, making it easy to attack the network or discourage people from running a node. On the other hand, if blocks were too small, network resources would be underutilized unnecessarily, keeping the number of transactions too low. Despite the fact that available computational resources vary widely between devices and computer technology continues to evolve, for the sake of simplicity, a size was chosen: one megabyte.\n\nIt all comes down to economics\n\nThe block size limit is, at its core, an economic decision. It balances transaction load with availability of computational resources to handle the load. Block space is subject to the same economic principles of supply and demand as any other scarce resource.\n\nIn the early days of the Bitcoin network, it was expected the transaction load would remain well below the proscribed limit for some time. However, it was anticipated that eventually blocks would fill up as more and more nodes joined the network.\n\nIn order to deal with resource scarcity, a transaction fee had already been introduced into the protocol design. The idea was that a fee market would naturally develop, with those wanting their transactions to get more highly prioritized for processing offering to pay higher fees. Until fees could sustain the network, an inflationary block reward subsidy which halves every 210,000 blocks (about once every four years) would provide incentive for miners to continue building blocks.\n\nThe problem is that there’s sort of a chicken-and-egg situation inherent in this. As long as block space is abundant, there’s little incentive to develop the proper infrastructure to accommodate a fee market. Until recently, most of this infrastructure has assumed abundance. Block space scarcity requires a significant change to how we propagate transactions. However, these problems are only now starting to get addressed as we start having to deal with scarcity.\n\nAs the block reward subsidy continues to decrease over time, fees will become more and more important as a means for paying for the network. Blockchains are expensive to maintain – and block space isn’t free. Someone needs to foot the bill. Removing scarcity by increasing block size shifts the costs from transaction senders to validator nodes – the very nodes upon which we vitally depend for the continued secure operation of the network.\n\nBut isn’t the block size limit about scalability?\n\nA major misconception that has arisen around this issue is that this is all about being able to scale up the network. Scalability is indeed a serious concern – recently there’s been some significant progress in addressing this via noncustodial offchain payment channels, but it is tangential to this discussion and beyond the scope of this article. The block-size limit is about economics, not about scalability. Hopefully, we can clear up this misconception once and for all.\n\nIn computer systems, scalability is the property of a system to be able to continue to operate within design specifications as we increase the amount or size of data it must process. Since computational resources are finite, any real-world computer system has limits beyond which it will no longer behave desirably.\n\nA maximum block size was imposed on the Bitcoin network to make sure we never surpass this limit. Undesirable behavior isn’t merely a matter of annoyance here – the security of the network itself is at stake. Surpassing the operational limit means the security model upon which the network was built can no longer be relied upon.\n\nOne of the assumptions in this security model is that it is reasonably cheap to validate transactions. Beyond a certain block size, the cost of transaction validation grows beyond what the honest nodes in the network can bear or are willing to bear. Without proper validation, no transaction can be considered secure.\n\nRaising the block size limit can only securely increase the number of transactions the network processes as long as the limit still remains below the point where validation starts to fail.\n\nCan’t we make optimizations to the software to reduce validation cost?\n\nYes, we can. There are a number of areas that could still be improved; among them are block propagation mechanisms, compression or pruning of data, more efficient signature schemes, and stronger limits on operation counts. Many of these things are indeed good ideas and should be pursued. Everything else remaining equal, reducing the cost of validation can only improve the network’s health. However, barring a major algorithmic breakthrough along with a substantial protocol redesign and/or a sudden acceleration of Moore’s Law and Nielsen’s Law, there’s a hard theoretical limit to how much we can really do to reduce costs.\n\nEven given these optimizations, the computational cost of validation grows at a greater-than-linear rate with block size. Roughly, this means that multiplying the block size by X raises the cost of validating the block by a factor larger than X. We’d still be many orders of magnitude shy of being able to satisfy global demand if we expect to include each of everyone’s transactions in the blockchain and also expect the network to continue to function properly. Block space is inherently scarce.\n\nAt what point does validation start to fail?\n\nThere is strong evidence we’re quickly nearing this point if we haven’t already passed it. The computational cost of validation is increasing at a far faster rate right now than the cost of computational resources is decreasing. In addition to the superlinear complexity inherent in the protocol, the protocol design has two fateful errors that further compound the problem: It assumes miners will properly validate blocks and that clients will be able to easily obtain reasonably secure, short proofs for their transactions that they can check for themselves.\n\nBut don’t miners validate blocks?\n\nSometimes. That’s the first error. They have at least some incentive to do so. However, miners don’t get paid to validate blocks. They get paid for finding nonces that make blocks hash within a target, aka proof-of-work. It doesn’t really matter who validates the blocks they build upon. They do lose their rewards if their own block is invalid or they mine atop an invalid block, but as long as those who are feeding them blocks almost always feed them valid blocks, it can actually be rational to cut corners on validation to save costs. The occasional invalid block might statistically be more than offset by the cuts in nominal operational expenses. This scenario has something of a tragedy of the commons element to it.\n\nParticularly costly for miners is propagation latency. The longer it takes them to receive, validate, and propagate a new block, the higher the chance someone else will beat them to it. Also costly for miners are maintenance and support for validation nodes to make sure they correctly adhere to the consensus rules. Then there’s the actual cost of the computational resources required to run the node. And even if the miner is willing to incur all these costs, a software bug could still cause them to mine an invalid block. And all the above would be true even without adding mining pools to the picture, which greatly amplify validation errors.\n\nThese concerns are not merely hypothetical musings. This scenario has already come to pass. Around July 4, 2015, a network fork occurred exactly for these reasons, which caused many clients, websites and online services to accept invalid blocks. Rather than putting up with the costs of validation themselves, they were relying on the miners to validate for them…and the miners themselves were not validating. The costlier validation is, the more likely such scenarios become.\n\nUnfortunately, the protocol currently lacks a means to directly compensate validators securely. If we could do this it would likely lead to a much more robust and secure economic model.\n\nWhy can’t clients validate the blocks themselves?\n\nWhile the resource requirements to run a full validation node are still within the capabilities of modern servers, they have greatly surpassed the capabilities of smaller devices, particularly mobile devices with intermittent or restricted network connections. Even most desktop and laptop systems are already heavily taxed by having to validate one megabyte blocks – and the need to run one’s own validation node greatly degrades the end-user experience.\n\nThe second fateful error in the protocol design is the assumption that despite it not being practical for most users to run a full validation node, they’d still be able to request from other nodes reasonably secure, short proofs that the blocks and transactions they’ve received are valid. But a satisfactory mechanism for this has so far failed to materialize. This issue is greatly exacerbated when miners also fail to do proper validation. Instead, most clients are currently relying on centralized services to perform the validation for them – and sadly, the July 4, 2015 fork demonstrated that even with good intentions, these centralized services cannot be counted upon to always properly validate either.\n\nWhat can we do about all this?\n\nLike it or not, the era of block space abundance is coming to an end. Even if after addressing all the above concerns we agreed it was safe to raise the size limit, sooner or later we’ll bump up against the new limit…probably sooner rather than later. And if we raise it without carefully addressing the above concerns as well as the enormous risk associated with incompatible changes to consensus rules, we risk nothing short of a collapse of the network security model, making the issue of block size moot.\n\nRegardless of whether – and when – we ultimately end up increasing the block size limit, we are already dealing with scarcity. Nodes that relay transactions on the network are already being forced to prioritize them to reduce memory load and avoid denial-of-service attacks. Spam attacks are already causing some blocks to fill up. A fee market is already starting to develop. I trust human ingenuity to find a good way forward presented with these challenges.\n\nRegarding validation costs, I’m hopeful that eventually we’ll be able to make it cheap and efficient for everyone to properly validate – or at worst, develop mechanisms for securely outsourcing and enforcing validation. This will require substantial reengineering of the protocol – and perhaps of the Internet itself. Even if this is still a few years off, given all the major developments occurring in this space I believe it will eventually happen. For now, I would strongly urge caution when doing anything that further increases validation costs.\n\nPhoto Tiger Pixel / Flickr', 'According to a recent account by a member of the BitcoinTalk community, it appears that certain members of the Federal government have a much deeper understanding of Bitcoin than previously thought. The poster says that during a raid, the government knew to seize unused Trezor wallets and transfer seized bitcoins to their own bitcoin wallets.\n\nHardware wallets, when used correctly, are a highly recommended way to store bitcoins. Understanding how to keep bitcoins secure is a fundamental problem that any new user will face. To quote the poster directly:\n\nWhen “homeland security” raided our house they took several Trezors still in the original packages that I had planned to give away for Christmas presents. […] BTW: Homeland Security was storing all the seized Bitcoins on a Trezor that they either purchased or seized from someone else!\n\nThe knowledge does beg the question as to whether the Trezor wallets were acquired in a raid or if they were chosen instead of Ledger wallets. That is, if a government official had decided on the brand of hardware wallet the agency would use.\n\nThere are many strategies to keeping bitcoins safe, and using hardware wallets for long-term storage has time and again been recommended. Keeping long-term storage bitcoins encrypted and difficult to access is also important. In the event of a seizure, an encrypted wallet cannot be compromised. The same advice could be given for any file that one did not want to be shared easily with snooping government agents: encrypt it and do not share the private key.\n\nImage from Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'by\n\nOn March 11, 2013, Bitcoin experienced a technical crisis. Versions 0.7 and 0.8 of the software diverged from each other in behavior due to a bug, causing the block chain to “fork” into two. Considering how catastrophic a hard fork can be, the crisis was resolved quickly with remarkably little damage owing to the exemplary competence of the developers in charge. The event gives us a never-before-never-again look into Bitcoin’s inner workings. In this post, I’ll do a play-by-play analysis of the dramatic minutes, and draw many surprising lessons. For a summary of the event, see here.\n\nFirst of all, the incident shows the necessity of an effective consensus process for the human actors in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The chronology of events was like this: it took about an hour after the fork started for enough evidence to accumulate that a fork was afoot. Once that was understood, things unfolded with remarkable speed and efficiency. The optimal course of action (and, in retrospect, the only one that avoided serious risks to the system) was first proposed and justified 16 minutes later, and the developers reached consensus on it a mere 20–25 minutes after that. Shortly thereafter — barely an hour after the discovery of the fork — the crisis response had effectively and successfully concluded. It took a few hours more for the fork to heal based on the course of action the developers initiated, but the outcome wasn’t in doubt.\n\nMore surprisingly, it also shows the effectiveness of strong central leadership. That’s because the commonsense solution to the fork — as well as the one programmed into the software itself — was to encourage miners running old versions to upgrade. As it turns out, the correct response was exactly the opposite. Even a delay of a few hours in adopting the downgrade solution would have been very risky, as I’ll argue, with potentially devastating consequences. Without the central co-ordination of the Bitcoin Core developers and the strong trust that the community places in them, it is inconceivable that adopting this counterintuitive solution could have been successfully accomplished.\n\nFurther, two more aspects of centralization proved very useful, although perhaps not as essential. The first is the ability of a few developers who possess a cryptographic key to broadcast alert messages to every client, which in this case was used to urge them to downgrade. The second is the fact that the operator of BTC Guild, a large mining pool at the time, was able to singlehandedly shift the balance of mining power to the old branch by downgrading. If it weren’t for this, it would have resulted in a messy “coordination problem” among miners, and we can imagine each one hesitating, waiting for someone else to take the leap.\n\nSince most of the discussion and decision-making happened on the #bitcoin-dev IRC channel, it remains publicly archived and offers a remarkable window into the Core developers’ leadership and consensus process. Consensus operated at remarkable speed, in this instance faster than consensus happens in the Bitcoin network itself. The two levels of consensus are intricately connected.\n\nLet’s now dive into the play-by-play analysis of the fork and the reaction to it. I’ve annotated the transcript of selected, key events from the IRC log of that fateful night. I’ve made minor edits to make the log easier to read — mainly replacing the nicknames of prominent community members with their real names, since their identities are salient to the discussion.\n\nSigns of trouble\n\nThe first signs that something is wrong come from a miner with nickname thermoman, as well as Jouke Hofman, a Dutch exchange operator, who report strange behavior from their Bitcoin clients. Bitcoin core developer Pieter Wuille helps them debug these problems, but at this point everyone assumes these are problems local to the two users, rather than something on the network. But around 23:00, a variety of other services showing strange behavior are noticed (blockchain.info, blockexplorer.com, and the IRC bot that reports the status of the network), making it obvious that something’s wrong on the network. Luke Dashjr, a prominent developer, spells out the unthinkable:\n\n23:06 Luke Dashjr so??? yay accidental hardfork? :x 23:06 Jouke Hofman Holy crap\n\nOver the next few minutes people convince themselves that there’s a fork and that nodes running the 0.8 and the 0.7 versions are on different sides of it. Things progress rapidly from here. A mere five minutes later the first measure to mitigate the damage is taken by Mark Karpeles, founder of Mt. Gox:\n\n23:11 Mark Karpeles I\'ve disabled the import of bitcoin blocks for now until this is sorted out 23:13 Luke Dashjr I\'m trying to contact poolops [mining pool operators]\n\nIt’s pretty obvious at this point that the best short-term fix is to get everyone on one side of the fork. But which one?\n\nUp or down? The critical decision\n\nAt 23:18, Pieter Wuille sends a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, informing them of the problem. But he hasn’t fully grasped the nature of the fork yet, stating “We risk having (several) forked chains with smaller blocks” and suggests upgrading as the solution. This is unfortunate, but it’s the correct thing to do given his understanding of the fork. This email will stay uncorrected for 45 minutes, and is arguably the only slight misstep in the developer response.\n\n23:21 Luke Dashjr at least 38% [of hashpower] is on 0.8 right now otoh, that 38% is actively reachable\n\nDashjr seems to suggest that the 0.8 ? 0.7 downgrade is better because the operators of newly upgraded nodes are more likely to be reachable by the developers to convince them to downgrade. This is a tempting argument. Indeed, when I describe the fork in class and ask my students why the developers picked the downgrade rather than the upgrade, this is the explanation they always come up with. When I push them to think harder, a few figure out the right answer, which Dashjr points out right afterward:\n\n23:22 Gavin Andresen the 0.8 fork is longer, yes? So majority hashpower is 0.8.... 23:22 Luke Dashjr Gavin Andresen: but 0.8 fork is not compatible earlier will be accepted by all versions\n\nIndeed! The behavior of the two versions is not symmetric. Upgrading will mean that the fork will persist essentially indefinitely, while downgrading will end it relatively quickly.\n\n(Lead developer) Gavin Andresen still protests, but Wuille also accepts Dashjr’s explanation:\n\n23:23 Gavin Andresen first rule of bitcoin: majority hashpower wins 23:23 Luke Dashjr if we go with 0.8, we are hardforking 23:23 Pieter Wuille the forking action is a too large block if we ask miners to switch temporarily to smaller blocks again, we should get to a single chain soon with a majority of miners on small blocks, there is no risk 23:24 Luke Dashjr so it\'s either 1) lose 6 blocks, or 2) hardfork for no benefit 23:25 BTC Guild We\'ll lose more than 6\n\nBTC Guild was a large pool at the time, and its operator happened to be online. They are correct — the 0.8 branch had 6 blocks at the time, but was growing much faster than the 0.7 branch and would continue to grow until the latter gradually caught up. Eventually 24 blocks would be lost. BTC Guild will turn out to be a key player, as we will soon see.\n\nMore explanation for why downgrade is the right approach:\n\n23:25 Pieter Wuille all old miners will stick to their own chain regardless of the mining power behind the other 23:25 Luke Dashjr and the sooner we decide on #1, the fewer it loses 23:26 Pieter Wuille even with 90% of mining power on 0.8 all merchants on an old client will be vulnerable 23:26 Luke Dashjr if we hardfork, all Bitcoin service providers have an emergency situation 23:30 Pieter Wuille and we _cannot_ get every bitcoin user in the world to now instantly switch to 0.8 so no, we need to rollback to the 0.7 chain\n\nAchtung!\n\nMany Bitcoin users are not aware of the centralized ability in Bitcoin for a few developers to send out alert messages. Not only does it exist, it becomes crucial here, as Core developer Jeff Garzik and another user point out:\n\n23:31 Jeff Garzik alert is definitely needed 23:31 jrmithdobbs also, if this isn\'t an alert message scenario I don\'t know what is, where\'s that at? :)\n\nA bit of a comic interlude from the operator of ozcoin, another mining pool:\n\n23:31 Graet ozcoin wont even get looked at for an hour or so 23:31 Graet no-one is avalable and i need to take kids to school\n\nThe situation is urgent (the more clients upgrade, the harder it will be to convince everyone to downgrade):\n\n23:32 phantomcircuit 0.7 clients are already displaying a big scary warning Warning: Displayed transactions may not be correct! You may need to upgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade. unfortunately i suspect that warning will get people to upgrade\n\nOther complications due to custom behavior of some miners’ software:\n\n23:35 lianj oh, damn. anyhow please keep us guys updated which code change is made to solve the problem. our custom node does .8 behavior\n\nGavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik still aren’t convinced (they seem to be thinking about getting 0.8 nodes to switch to the other branch, rather than the more blunt solution of asking miners to downgrade the client)\n\n23:34 Jeff Garzik and how to tell bitcoind ""mine on $this old fork"" 23:35 Gavin Andresen exactly. Even if we want to roll back to the 0.7-compatible chain, I don\'t see an easy way to do that.\n\nThis shows the usefulness of the developers having direct channels to the pool operators, another benefit of central co-ordination:\n\n23:38 Luke Dashjr FWIW, Josh (EclipseMC) has to be on a plane in 20 minutes, so he needs this decided before then :/\n\nAs time goes on the solution only gets harder, as illustrated by a new user wading into the channel.\n\n23:39 senseless So whats the issue? I got the warning you need to upgrade. So I upgraded.\n\nGavin Andresen, notable for his cautious approach, brings up a potential problem:\n\n23:40 Gavin Andresen If we go back to 0.7, then we risk some other block triggering the same condition.\n\nHappily, as others pointed out, there’s nothing to worry about — once majority hashpower is on 0.7, other blocks that have the same condition will be harmless one-block forks instead of a hard fork.\n\nThe BTC guild operator offers to basically end the fork:\n\n23:43 BTC Guild I can single handedly put 0.7 back to the majority hash power I just need confirmation that thats what should be done 23:44 Pieter Wuille BTC Guild: imho, that is was you should do, but we should have consensus first\n\nSo much for decentralization! The fact that BTC Guild can tip the scales here is crucial. (The hash power distribution at that time appears to be roughly 2/3 vs 1/3 in favor of the 0.8 branch, and BTC Guild controlled somewhere between 20% and 30% of total hash power.) By switching, BTC Guild loses the work they’ve done on 0.8 since the fork started. On the other hand, they are more or less assured that the 0.7 branch will win and the fork will end, so at least their post-downgrade mining power won’t be wasted.\n\nIf mining power were instead distributed among thousands of small independent miners, it’s far from clear that coordinating them would be possible at all. More likely, each miner on the 0.8 branch would wait for the 0.7 branch to gain the majority hash power, or at least for things to start heading clearly in that direction, before deciding to downgrade. Meanwhile, some miners in the 0.7 branch, seeing the warning in their clients and unaware of the developer recommendation, would in fact upgrade. The 0.8 branch would pull ahead faster and faster, and pretty soon the window of opportunity would be lost. In fact, if the developers had delayed their decision by even a few hours, it’s possible that enough miners would have upgraded from 0.7 to 0.8 that no single miner or pool operator would be able to reverse it singlehandedly, and then it’s anybody’s guess as to whether the downgrade solution would have worked at all.\n\nBack to our story: we’re nearing the critical moment.\n\n23:44 Jeff Garzik ACK on preferring 0.7 chain, for the moment 23:45 Gavin Andresen BTC Guild: if you can cleanly get us back on the 0.7 chain, ACK from here, too\n\nConsensus is reached!\n\nTime for action\n\nRight away, developers start giving out advice to downgrade:\n\n23:49 Luke Dashjr surge_: downgrade to 0.7 if you mine, or just wait 23:50 Pieter Wuille doublec: do you operate a pool? 23:50 doublec yes 23:50 Pieter Wuille doublec: then please downgrade now\n\nBTC Guild gets going immediately…\n\n23:51 BTC Guild BTC Guild is going back to full default block settings and 0.7 soon. 00:01 BTC Guild Almost got one stratum node moved\n\n… even at significant monetary cost.\n\n23:57 BTC Guild I\'ve lost way too much money in the last 24 hours from 0.8\n\nOne way to look at this is that BTC Guild sacrificed revenues for the good of the network. But these actions can also be justified from a revenue-maximizing perspective. If the BTC Guild operator believed that the 0.7 branch would win anyway (perhaps the developers would be able to convince another large pool operator), then moving first is relatively best, since delaying would only take BTC Guild further down the doomed branch. Either way, the key factor enabling BTC Guild to confidently downgrade is that by doing so, they can ensure that the 0.7 branch will win.\n\nNow that the decision has been taken, it’s time to broadcast an alert to all nodes:\n\n00:07 Gavin Andresen alert params set to relay for 15 minutes, expire after 4 hours\n\nThe alert in question is a model of brevity: “URGENT: chain fork, stop mining on version 0.8”\n\nAt this point people start flooding the channel and chaos reigns. However, the work is done, and only one final step remains.\n\nAt 00:29, Pieter Wuille posts to bitcointalk. This essentially concludes the crisis response. The post said, in its entirety:\n\nHello everyone, there is an emergency right now: the block chain has split between 0.7+earlier and 0.8 nodes. I’ll explain the reasons in a minute, but this is what you need to know now: After a discussion on #bitcoin-dev, it seems trying to get everyone on the old chain again is the least risky solution.\n\nIf you’re a miner, please do not mine on 0.8 code. Stop, or switch back to 0.7. BTCGuild is switching to 0.7, so the old chain will get a majority hash rate soon.\n\nIf you’re a merchant: please stop processing transactions until the chains converge.\n\nIf you’re on 0.7 or older, the client will likely tell you that you need to upgrade. Do not follow this advise – the warning should go away as soon as the old chain catches up\n\nIf you are not a merchant or a miner, don’t worry.\n\nCrucially, note that he was able to declare that the 0.7 branch was going to win due to BTC Guild switching to it. This made the downgrade decision the only rational one for everyone else, and from here things were only a matter of time.\n\nWhat would have happened if the developers had done nothing?\n\nThroughout the text I’ve emphasized that the downgrade option was the correct one and that speed of developer response was of the essence. Let’s examine this claim further by thinking about what would have happened if the developers had simply let things take their course. Vitalik Buterin thinks everything would have been just fine: “if the developers had done nothing, then Bitcoin would have carried on nonetheless, only causing inconvenience to those bitcoind and BitcoinQt users who were on 0.7 and would have had to upgrade.”\n\nObviously, I disagree. We can’t know for sure what would have happened, but we can make informed guesses. First of all, the fork would have gone on for far longer — essentially until every last miner running version 0.7 or lower either shut down or upgraded their software. Given that many miners leave their setups unattended and others have custom setups that aren’t easy to upgrade quickly, the fork would have lasted days. This would have several effects. Most obviously, the psychological impact of an ongoing fork would have been serious. In contrast, as events actually turned out, the event happened overnight in the US and had been resolved the next morning, and media coverage praised the developers for their effective action. The price of Bitcoin dropped by 25% during the incident but recovered immediately to almost its previous value.\n\nAnother adverse impact is that exchanges or payment services that took too long to upgrade their clients (or disable transactions) might find themselves victims of large double-spend attacks. As it happened, OKPay suffered a $10,000 double spend. This was done by a user trying to prove a point and who revealed the details publicly; they got lucky in that their payment to OKPay was confirmed by the 0.8 branch but not 0.7. A longer-running fork would likely have exacerbated the problem and allowed malicious attackers to figure out a systematic way to create double-spend transactions. [1]\n\nWorse, it is possible, even if not likely, that the 0.7 branch might have continued indefinitely. Obviously, if this did happen, it would be devastating for Bitcoin, resulting in a fork of the currency itself. One reason the fork might keep going is because of a “Goldfinger attacker” interested in de-stabilizing Bitcoin: they might not have the resources to execute a 51% attack, but the fork might give them just the opportunity they need: they could simply invest resources into keeping the 0.7 fork alive instead of launching an attack from scratch.\n\nThere’s another reason why the fork might have never ended. Miners who postponed their decision to switch from 0.7 to 0.8 by, say, a week would face the distasteful prospect of forgoing a week’s worth of mining revenue. They might instead gamble and continue to operate on the 0.7 branch as a big fish in a small pond. If the 0.7 branch had, say, 10% of the mining power of the 0.8 branch, the miner’s revenue would be multiplied tenfold by mining on the 0.7 branch. Of course, the currency they’d earn would be “Bitcoin v0.7”, which would fork into a different currency from “Bitcoin v0.8”, and would be worth much less, the latter being considered the legitimate Bitcoin. We analyze this type of situation in Chapter 7, “Community, Politics, and Regulation” of our Bitcoin textbook-in-progress or the corresponding sections of the video lecture.\n\nWhile the exact course of events that would have resulted from inaction is debatable, it is clear that the downgrade solution is by far the less risky one, and the speed and clearheadedness of the developers’ response is commendable.\n\nAll this is in stark contrast to the dysfunctional state of the consensus process on the block size issue. Why is consensus on that issue failing? The main reason is that unlike the fork, there is no correct solution to the block size issue; instead there are various parties with differing goals that aren’t mutually aligned. Further, in the case of the fork, the developers had a well-honed process for coming to consensus on technical questions including bugs. For example, it was obvious to everyone that the discussion of the fork should take place on the #bitcoin-dev IRC channel; this didn’t even need to be said. On the other hand, there is no clear process for debating the block size issue, and the discussion is highly fragmented between different channels. Finally, once the developers had reached consensus about the fork, the community went with that decision because they trusted the developers’ technical competence. On the other hand, there is no single entity that the Bitcoin community trusts to make decisions that have economic implications.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, we have a lot to learn from looking back at the fork. Bitcoin had a really close call, and another bug might well lead to a different outcome. Contrary to the view of the consensus protocol as fixed in stone by Satoshi, it is under active human stewardship, and the quality of that stewardship is essential to its security. [2] Centralized decision-making saved the day here, and for the most part it’s not in conflict with the decentralized nature of the network itself. The human element becomes crucial when the code fails or needs to adapt over time (e.g., the block size debate). We should accept and embrace the need for a strong leadership and governance structure instead of treating decentralization as a magic bullet.\n\n[1] This gets into a subtle technical point: it’s not obvious how to get a transaction to get into one branch but not the other. By default any transaction that’s broadcast will just get included in both branches, but there are several ways to try to subvert this. But given access to even one transaction that’s been successfully double-spent, an attacker can amplify it to gradually cause an arbitrary amount of divergence between the two branches.\n\n[2] To underscore how far the protocol is from being fixed for all time by a specification, the source code of the reference implementation is the only correct documentation of the protocol. Even creating and maintaining a compatible implementation has proved to be near-infeasible.\n\nThanks to Andrew Miller for comments on a draft.', 'When it comes to estate planning, very little has been mentioned about bitcoin. While bitcoin is subject to wills and revocable living trusts like any other asset, there are some special considerations.\n\nJeff Vandrew is a licensed attorney, a Certified Public Accountant and a Certified Financial Planner. Based in New Jersey, he restricts his practice to two areas: estate planning and tax planning. Here he explains the steps bitcoin holders should take when planning their estates.\n\nMost seasoned holders of bitcoin are aware of IRS Notice 2014-21. For those unaware, the notice holds that for US tax purposes, bitcoin is to be treated as property rather than currency. The notice is wrongheaded, foolish and probably was issued with intent to slow down bitcoin adoption. Nonetheless, we’re stuck with it until bitcoin adoption increases to the point where the IRS recognizes it as a currency.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled about the more obvious consequences of bitcoin’s classification as property, namely:\n\nWhenever bitcoin is spent on goods or services, the spender must recognize taxable income or loss on the difference between tax basis (usually the price at which he acquired the bitcoin) and the fair market value of the bitcoin at the time spent. Bitcoin miners must recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the bitcoin mined at the time of mining. If your employer pays you in bitcoin, such payments must be reported on your W2 and are subject to tax withholding in US dollars.\n\nBeyond these more obvious consequences, however, there are some hidden estate planning traps when it comes to the death or incapacity of a bitcoin account holder. To avoid these problems, here are five steps you need to take now in your estate plan.\n\n1. Get your step-up in your estate plan, and watch your step-down\n\nBecause bitcoin is property, when a bitcoin holder dies, the beneficiaries of his will or living trust receive his bitcoin with tax basis at the fair market value on the date of death. For example, assume I inherit 100 BTC from my mother, and on her date of death 1 BTC is worth $250. If 1 BTC is worth $260 at the time I later spend 1 BTC in that scenario, I have a taxable gain of $10 on my bitcoin use. The fact that my mother only paid $150 for that bitcoin when she acquired it isn’t relevant for tax purposes once she has passed.\n\nThis is a double-edged sword. For highly appreciated bitcoin, this may be a boon. For bitcoin that has depreciated since purchase, this could be a disaster. For example, in the hypothetical above, if my mother had paid $1,000 for 1 BTC, upon spending I would still have a taxable gain of $10, because the only relevant factor is the fair market value on my mother’s date of death.\n\nIf you’re older and have appreciated bitcoin, it makes sense to hold onto it as long as you can so that your heirs can take advantage of the step-up. The step up may be able to eliminate all taxation of the gains on your investment.\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re older and have depreciated bitcoin, it may make sense to spend it as quickly as possible and preserve your cash. Upon spending, you’ll recognize taxable losses (which may possibly result in a reduced overall tax bill) and you’ll avoid your tax basis being stepped down at death.\n\n2. Make sure your executor or trustee is aware that your bitcoin exists\n\nIf you tend to be private, your loved ones may never even know that you have bitcoin. Due to the anonymous nature of bitcoin, if they aren’t aware of it, your bitcoin will die with you. To avoid this result, set up some method of informing your loved ones that you’re a bitcoin holder. If you’re uncomfortable telling them now, check out a service like Deathswitch which will automatically inform them when you’re gone.\n\n3. Make sure your executor or trustee can get your private key\n\nBitcoin isn’t like a bank account where your loved ones can simply contact the institution once your will has been probated. Without your private key (or in the case of a hosted walled like Coinbase or Circle, your username/password), your executor will be totally powerless to distribute your bitcoin under the terms of your will.\n\nSince most of us don’t like passing our private keys or login info around, consider using the Deathswitch option. You can always encrypt your bitcoin key or Coinbase/Circle login before uploading to Deathswitch. [Just make sure your recipient is given the decryption key for the message ahead of time!]\n\n4. Make sure power of attorney allows your agent to access your bitcoin\n\nMany of us have a power of attorney document in place. This allows someone to handle our legal and financial affairs if we’re alive, but incapacitated. This person may need to handle your bitcoin. To make sure this happens, make sure that your power of attorney document explicitly allows your agent to access either your bitcoin specifically, or your digital assets broadly. And like your executor, your agent under your power of attorney is going to need access to your private key or login info.\n\n5. Beware of the Prudent Investor Act\n\nMost states have enacted some version of the Prudent Investor Act, which requires that executors and trustees diversify investments. If someone is to die holding a large amount of bitcoin, there is a argument that under the Act the bitcoin wuld be considered an “investment” rather than cash, and a volatile one at that. Such a classification may mean that an executor or trustee may be required under the Act to sell bitcoin and diversify into traditional securities. This may not be what the deceased party intended.\n\nThe good news is that the Prudent Investor Act generally allows itself to be explicitly overridden. Should you desire your executor or trustee to have the power to hold your bitcoin long-term, consider a specific provision in your will or trust absolving him from any liability for failure to diversify bitcoin.\n\nDon’t procrastinate!\n\nLike everything else involving estate planning, we never know when something when incapacity will come. By then, it’s too late to plan. If you’re a bitcoin holder, that means there is no excuse to procrastinate on these five points.\n\nOriginally posted on vandrew.com. Republished here with permission.', ""A new service is offering bitcoin users an answer to the common question: what is the optimum transaction fee?\n\nUsing network data from the past three hours, CoinTape lets users compare the current waiting times associated with various fee tiers, calculated in satoshis per byte.\n\nIt claims to predict delays with 90% confidence.\n\nThe default fee used by many bitcoin wallets is 10 satoshis (0.0000001) per byte. However, according to CoinTape, paying 20 satoshis (0.0000002 BTC) per byte will get you the fastest and cheapest transaction on the network.\n\nFor the average-sized bitcoin transaction, 645 bytes, this equates to a fee of 129 bits (0.000129 BTC) (note that this is calculated on a transaction's size, not its dollar value).\n\nThe most popular fee ratio CoinTape lists, 41–50 satoshis per byte, used in more than 30,000 transactions today alone, is double this.\n\nNetwork competition\n\nAs the number of bitcoin transactions rise, competition for space in each block is heating up. Miners prioritise transactions with the highest fees, working down the list until the block reaches its limit, commonly 750,000 bytes.\n\nTransactions that don't make the cut remain in the miner's 'memory pool', a kind of bitcoin limbo. They may be included in future blocks depending on their priority or fee.\n\nCurrently, you can opt out of the fee altogether. However, there has been debate as to whether this should be raised, with a recent pull request to make a 10,000 satoshi minimum to reduce spam on the network.\n\nCoinTape indicates that avoiding a fee is more likely to result in delays to your payment. It could take up to six blocks, or around one hour (blocks are created roughly every 10 minutes).\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This ancient system of informal money transfer through a network of brokers is ubiquitous in areas where migrant workers have a duty to send money back to families in their homeland.\n\nRemittances to Burma\n\nYou may recall that Koh Tao is the stunning Thai island where two British backpackers were murdered last year, allegedly by two Burmese migrants. The fact that the accused are Burmese is no surprise given the large population of migrant Burmese workers on the island, mainly providing cheap labor to the bloated tourism industry.\n\nUnsurprisingly, my Hundi educator was an intelligent young Burmese hotel waiter, whose daily mission was to sell us the standard, around the island long-tail boat trip. Given that we were persistently ambivalent to his poorly veiled sales patter, he tried a different tack and sought to get to know us and vice versa.\n\nThroughout our typically breakfast time conversations (the waiter spoke very good English), I learned several things. He told me that he earned 150 baht per day, around US$5 - the Thai minimum wage is 300 baht (around US$10).\n\nOn Koh Tao, migrants have to pay certain levies in order to work on the island. These levies include 1000 baht (US$30) on arrival, and 500 baht per month for the right to work. Immigrants also face fees for the right to ride a scooter, along with curfews prohibiting them to be out after 8pm.\n\nThese levies are unavoidable as they are collected by police visiting the resorts and restaurants where the migrants work, and usually live. I learned that most Burmese have a fundamental distrust of banks, presumably due to the history of state corruption and the 2003 banking crisis. In any case, in order to get a bank account many migrants do not possess the necessary paperwork to open an account.\n\nThe young man had an absolute responsibility to return money back to his poverty-stricken family in southern Burma, or Myanmar as he referred to his home country. Every mention of his parents brought a flicker of a smile, tinged with sadness to his eager, young face.\n\nHundi system\n\nDespite the arrival of Western Union and other money transfer agencies, most of the workers still rely on the Hundi system to deliver funds back home. The migrant deposits his money with a local Hundi agent, and then through the agent network money is paid out at the other end of the chain without physically moving any money. This is a system based entirely on trust and IOU's.\n\nThe workers depositing their cash with the local Hundi agent pay commission, anything from around 5%, to the agents for guaranteeing a sum of money for the would-be recipient at the other end. The agents also take advantage of exchange rate fluctuations by the time the money is in the hands of the intended recipient.\n\nCan bitcoin help?\n\nBeing a crypto enthusiast, I immediately introduced bitcoin into this scenario. I wondered -Could bitcoin genuinely improve this situation and permit the workers to keep hold of more of their hard-earned and diminished wages?\n\nUndoubtedly, the need for blind trust in a network of unknown and unregulated money brokers issue is resolved - tick. The sticking point here is how could the workers convert cash to bitcoin, and vice versa for the recipient?\n\nGiven that most of the young Burmese migrants are mobile tech-savvy, could hundi agents simply become exchanges, converting cash to bitcoin? If so, the agents would still charge commissions, and still probably try to make money on the exchange rates. Then there's the other barrier, instability of the bitcoin price.\n\nIn return for his candidness, I decided to introduce the young waiter to bitcoin, scribbling the word on a napkin for him to Google on his next day off. He looked thrilled at the prospect of discovering something that could potentially save him a few baht, and justify using his phone credits in doing so.\n\nIf anyone can make a system like bitcoin work, this enterprising underclass of young exiles can.\n\nBy Marc Edwards"", 'It took a year, but Wences Casares, CEO of bitcoin wallet provider Xapo, is fighting back in court against a claim LifeLock brought against him in August 2014.\n\nLifeLock is a $1.5 billion, publicly-traded online-identity protection company that acquired Casares’s digital wallet company Lemon in 2013 for $42.6 million. Casares eventually left LifeLock and founded Xapo, a digital wallet company focused on bitcoin (Lemon was not). LifeLock’s lawsuit, which went unreported until Fortune wrote about it earlier this summer, claimed that Xapo was developed “by Lemon employees, in Lemon’s facilities, on Lemon’s computers, and on Lemon’s dime.”\n\nLifeLock has asked the California Superior Court in Santa Clara, Calif. to force Casares and his co-defendants (former Lemon employees) to “disgorge the value of the Xapo product attributable to Defendants’ misrepresentations, omissions, breaches of duty, and other wrongful conduct.”\n\nNow Casares has fired back. Initially, he had filed a “demurrer,” which amounts to a motion to dismiss, but California Superior Court Judge Peter Kirwan rejected it and gave Casares until July 24 to formally reply to LifeLock’s complaint.\n\nCasares’s cross-complaint, filed on July 24, accuses LifeLock of: breach of contract; breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; conversion (an act by one party that violates ownership rights of another party); unjust enrichment; and declaratory relief.\n\nIn layperson’s terms, Casares is claiming that LifeLock initially blessed the idea of a new product, to be called LifeLock Wallet, that Casares was working on. At some point, though, the company’s “dysfunctional management” left him and his Lemon team “hamstrung,” forcing him to leave the company. From the cross-complaint, emphasis ours:\n\nLifeLock assured Casares that it would not interfere with his management of Lemon’s operations, and agreed to automatically accelerate the vesting of certain stock options if the company materially diminished his responsibilities as Lemon’s General Manager … Casares lived up to his contractual promises and, in the weeks leading up to the closing of the LifeLock/Lemon deal, worked with his team to prepare and launch the “LifeLock Wallet,” a new and rebranded version of the Lemon Wallet app that represented the first step in integrating the LifeLock and Lemon products. The Lemon team working under Casares had previously developed new versions of the Wallet app quickly, and finished the all-new LifeLock Wallet in just over a month. Contrary to their agreement, however, immediately following the Lemon acquisition, LifeLock repeatedly and consistently obstructed Casares’s management of the Lemon team and directly obstructed his development of the next generation LifeLock Wallet. LifeLock’s highly dysfunctional management proved itself to be adept at corporate infighting and bureaucracy, and ultimately unwilling to support the innovative Lemon team that it had acquired, or to permit that team to be led by Casares without interference. LifeLock’s dysfunctional management—and its willful and intentional post-acquisition breaches of its agreements with Casares and his team—squandered the success of its acquired company, and then sought to blame everyone but themselves for their mistakes. By torpedoing the LifeLock Wallet app, and preventing Casares from doing his job, LifeLock not only willfully breached its contract with Casares, but virtually guaranteed the failure of its acquisition, Lemon… by mid-2014, LifeLock had decimated post-acquisition Lemon’s entire team, and Casares was hamstrung and left unable to salvage the Wallet product.\n\nIn addition, in a February 2014 letter posted in June by Bitcoin Magazine, LifeLock president Hilary Schneider told Casares the company was aware he was working on bitcoin pursuits and was okay with it: “LifeLock acknowledges and agrees that your past and continuing work on the Bitcoin business and development of Bitcoin IP is unrelated to LifeLock’s business and is not covered by and does not violate the terms of the Proprietary Rights and Restrictive Covenants Agreement between you and Lemon, Inc.”\n\nCasares is now seeking a jury trial, and his cross-complaint, which is against both LifeLock and Lemon, asks for “a monetary award” as well as “punitive damages” from Lemon and LifeLock “in an amount to be determined at trial.” In other words, unless there is a surprise settlement, this fight is just beginning, and is only going to get more vicious.\n\n(Separately, LifeLock is dealing with another P.R. nightmare: the FTC, for the second time, is taking action against the company for allegedly lying about its identity protection services and failing to protect customer data.)\n\nAs Fortune wrote in June, a LifeLock win in this suit could embolden the company to go after Xapo directly. In addition, a LifeLock win would mean that Casares, CEO of a financial services company, would be convicted of fraud. That result could be ruinous to the success of Xapo, which has raised $40 million in funding and is arguably one of the hottest bitcoin startups.']"
07/29/2015,"['(Ferenstein Wire) - Bitcoin, the digital currency infamous for wild swings in value and black market transactions, could have profound implications for the future of public services. Tech optimists at the highest levels of government are exploring how the same technology that makes bitcoin anonymous could make government services less bureaucratic and more secure from hackers.\n\nBrian Forde is a former Senior Advisor at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and recently became MIT Media Labs new director of digital currency. He sat down with the Ferenstein Wire at the Atlantic Aspen Ideas Festival and revealed how bitcoin technology could eventually become a cornerstone of modern governance.\n\nJust to give this conversation some contextual significance, over the last few years, Bitcoin has slowly gained mainstream acceptance, expanding from the hobby of libertarian digital activists to the portfolios of billionaire silicon valley investors. But, Bitcoin and it\'s associated cryptographic technology has largely been viewed by government as a dangerous technology in need of regulation.\n\nNoted investor and Twitter philosopher King, Marc Andreessen, has championed the idea that bitcoin\'s ""blockchain"" technology, a sophisticated public ledger of transactions, could prove much more useful than the currency itself. Yet, there\'s been little, if any, indication that senior members of American government are taking this optimistic view seriously.\n\nForde is our best indication yet that Bitcoin technology could, in fact, be adopted. Here\'s his answers in 5 big quotes with context underneath.\n\n1. Bitcoin\'s Tech Could Have Big Impact On The Most In Need\n\n""Digital currencies have immense potential to improve human welfare by strengthening the capacity of governments to deliver more responsive services and secure the rights of their citizens to property, identity and increase financial inclusion...And because it is an open-source protocol for innovation, a wide range of services and products can be built by entrepreneurs and non-profits on top of it.""\n\nIn other words, the major benefactors of Bitcoin technology are the folks who need government the most: financially beleaguered citizens, public officials targeted by foreign hackers, or entrepreneurs who need agencies to get their business paperwork approved.\n\nBasically, any piece of official documentation, from liquor licenses to medical transcripts could be made portable and secure.\n\n2. Why Is Bitcoin More Than Currency?\n\n""Digital currencies like bitcoin are the network of transactions. If you think bitcoin is just for money transfer, that\'s like thinking the internet was only built for email - today we know that internet is used for so many more applications. The true innovation that bitcoin solved was the elimination of the ""double-spend.""\n\nForde is talking about the Blockchain, the principal technology underlying bitcoin, which allows users to verify whether a digital piece of content is authentic. The Blockchain acts as a public ledger of all transactions.', ""Veteran Wall Street executive Blythe Masters has spoken out in support of the “gigantic potential” of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nSpeaking at Convene, a conference hosted by SourceMedia in New York Tuesday, Masters admitted that while it was early days for the industry, this should not dampen enthusiasm.\n\n“The potential addressable markets for these types of technologies are gigantic,” Business Insider quotes Masters as saying.\n\nShe added nonetheless that “in reality, the world is not there yet” in terms of mass adoption. Regulatory, security and authentication hurdles would all need to be overcome in the next few years on a global scale in order for habits to change.\n\nMasters is a former executive at JP Morgan and is credited for creating the bank's derivative products while becoming a managing director at 28, the youngest woman to achieve that status in the firm's history.\n\nHowever, she has since transitioned from traditional finance and the speech comes as Masters continues a prevalent year in the Bitcoin sphere. Having become CEO of Digital Asset Holdings in March, a move in itself unusual for a senior Wall Street executive, she then announced her appointment as an advisor to the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC) at the start of July.\n\nThe role sees her attempt to strike up dialog and cooperation with traditional finance institutions, under the auspices of founder and president Perianne Boring, along with fellow Wall Street banker Matthew Mellon, who joined the CDC’s committee last November.\n\nDigital Asset Holdings meanwhile under Masters announced in June that it had acquired two blockchain startups, Hyperledger and Bits of Proof. Now incorporated into its parent company, Hyperledger, a permissioned intrabank network, will form one product separate from so-called ‘permissionless’ distributed infrastructure, i.e. the blockchain."", ""A new survey has found that consumers believe bitcoin to be more inconvenient than traditional payment methods such as credit cards and checks.\n\nConducted by prepaid and gift card product provider Blackhawk Network in April, the poll canvassed 1,000 US consumers, questioning them about their sentiment toward both traditional and emerging payment methods.\n\nIn total, 18% of respondents reported using alternative payment methods such as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and bitcoin within the last year. Sixty-eight percent of these consumers indicated they used the products more than they did in 2014.\n\nHowever, Blackhawk found that the consumer attitude toward bitcoin is still largely negative, revealing that 38% ranked bitcoin as the most inconvenient of surveyed payment methods including cash, credit cards, PayPal and checks.\n\nChecks were ranked as the second most inconvenient payment method by consumers, with 35% reporting they viewed the payment method with dissatisfaction.\n\nCash, by comparison, was viewed as the most popular payment method, with 93% of consumers reporting a satisfaction with paper currency.\n\nEvolving consumer sentiment\n\nThe survey joins an increasing body of research that suggests more consumers are now willing to at least try bitcoin and other digital currencies for use in commerce.\n\nFor example, a recent Goldman Sachs report found that 22% of US millennials have used bitcoin and intend to use the payment method again. Still, research also suggested many consumers remain unconvinced in the technology's utility for payments.\n\nMore than half of its 752 respondents suggested they have never used bitcoin and that they had no plans to do so in the future.\n\nSurvey image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A trader purchases an option and if the trader predicted the move correctly at the end of the option period, it generates approximately 70-80% return on the trader's investment. If the trader was wrong, the investor loses most of the money they had paid for the option. Binary options expiry times vary from 30 seconds up to more than 1 year.\n\nBinary options trading enables trading stocks, commodities, currencies and indices without requiring intricate analysis, and for this reason it is one of the most popular trading methods available. They are very simple to trade, even for inexperienced investors, and binary options trading requires very little starting capital – usually no more than a few hundred dollars.\n\n“Bitcoin […] is going to decentralize bank services and change the world of money as we know it.” - Damian Cišek\n\nCT: What made you create your BitPlutos platform?\n\nDamian Cišek: Well, I used to be a trader back in the days when binary options were first introduced. I believe it had happened around 2008, three years before Bitcoin came into being. I had no previous experience and was a bit uncertain about it. It quickly turned out that I my worries were exaggerated. I was pretty much successful with binary options and definitely would have continued trading but then something happened.\n\nBitcoin happened. I immediately got absorbed by it and forgot about binary options. I started crypto-trading as it emerged, using my trading expertise to my advantage. That was great, a plethora of possibilities that Bitcoin brings along, a breather.\n\n“The opportunities binary options bring are immense.”\n\nBut soon I started missing binary options trading. Yet, there was nothing to make me abandon Bitcoin. Last year, while I was visiting Amsterdam Expo, I decided to make contact with Spot Option, the leading binary options technology provider. What you see is the fruit of our labor.\n\nBy delivering a binary options platform for bitcoins, we wanted to create new ways for Bitcoin users to grow their coins. The opportunities binary options bring are immense. Just imagine 75% profit every trade. Obviously, nobody is perfect and you shouldn't expect to be either, but I just wanted to give you an idea. And the volatility of bitcoin? Assets like bitcoin/Euro or any other bitcoin-based ones are way more predictable than the regular forex currency pairs. That's why we brought BitPlutos into being.\n\nCT: What role will Bitcoin play when it hits the world's financial markets?\n\nDC: Bitcoin, and the virtual currency in general, is going to decentralize bank services and change the world of money as we know it. Stephen Pair, the CEO of BitPay, said that “Bitcoin's integrity is guaranteed by the rules of math and the laws of physics” while Tyler Winklevoss praises Bitcoin by calling it “Gold 2.0.”\n\nIt is difficult to argue with that - Bitcoin is supported by no government/bank; it is distributed across the entire network of users; its roots in complex digital mathematics. I think that this makes the currency invulnerable to speculation by politicians or banksters trying to move its value up or down for politics or profit. And financial markets are already affected by it – there are investors who trade crypto-currencies exclusively, because they know that such trading is more profitable and less vulnerable to manipulation.\n\n“Generally, the worse the real currencies get, the better for bitcoin.”\n\nYou never know what is going to happen with EUR/USD for instance. There are financial analyses, market research data, introducing brokers who are supposed to help you make profit – but in the end, it all fails when some speculative actions performed by the sly devils happen. Obviously, with bitcoin some speculation may be present but it’s incomparable to the real currencies.\n\nGenerally, the worse the real currencies get, the better for bitcoin. Just observe what happened during the last Greek crisis – we all knew which direction the bitcoin rate would go. And many used this knowledge to make fortunes with binary options.\n\nCT: Why binary Options instead of Forex trading?\n\nDC: Binary options are simpler, more user-friendly and profound financial expertise and experience is not required. For example, in binary options trading, the payouts are predefined, the price you pay for the option is clearly set, the expiration times are known in advance. That is non-existent in Forex.\n\nAlso, Forex features leverage and spread, which you will not find in BO trading. All they have in common is that you have to predict the direction the asset price is going to follow. Some might say that in Forex you are free to control your trading by using STOP LOSS/TAKE PROFIT tools and in BO trading you are not. That is completely untrue since you are allowed to sell your option at almost any time or prolong your expiry time to your advantage. All in all, binary options trading has a clear edge here.\n\nCT: What do Binary Options offer to the Bitcoin world?\n\nDC: An alternative to trade bitcoin with much higher profits and a clear chance to take advantage of bitcoin-based assets volatility and predictability.\n\nCT: Are there any risks in binary options?\n\nDC: Of course there are risks. Binary options trading might not be applicable for all investors so they must ensure that they fully understand the risks before trading and seek counsel from an independent and suitably licensed individual or financial institution such as BitPlutos.\n\nCT: What makes BitPlutos unique among other binary options platforms?\n\nDC: It is the very first binary options platform to trade exclusively in bitcoin. You will find many bitcoin-based assets with us, which is a great advantage for Bitcoin users. Other platforms usually do not render them available for investors as they are way more predictable and volatile, thus useful for binary trading. We do not restrict that.\n\nWe are owned by Exclusive Limited, a financial tycoon in the binary options world that owns also of couple of other brands like eXbino, eXbinoG and eXbinoL. Our company is registered and licensed by the laws of Montenegro.\n\nOur users are completely or partially anonymous (depending on their choice) and prefer us due to our payment and withdrawal methods as well as the trading education they receive.\n\n“[T]he SPOT follow feature … is a tool that makes binary signals obsolete.”\n\nWhen it comes to education, we suggest providing contact details (phone/skype) as it will improve our communication with investors. Anonymous traders are contacted only via email. We are offering an outstanding VIP Program and a special VIP treatment regarding deposit and withdrawal procedure. However, we do need to verify Wire transfers and Skrill/Neteller as we strictly comply with the international AML procedures.\n\nWe also introduced an innovative method of boosting binary options trading efficiency for regular traders. Ever heard of binary signals? Forget about it – they are capricious and unreliable most of the times. Instead, we provide the Strategy Advisor: a unique trading tool that analyzes the most important data: Bollinger bands, Moving Averages and RSI.\n\nOur withdrawals are instant, free of charge and unlimited, which is a rare thing in the binary options world where some platforms transfer money once a week and charge you for it.\n\nThen there is the SPOT follow feature, which is a tool that makes binary signals obsolete. You will now be able to monitor best traders moves in the real time. Yes: ability to learn from the best out there without delay and on-the-fly. That’s a lot I reckon.\n\n“Even some banks are developing their own crypto-currencies already. But they will be controlled and manipulated.”\n\nCT: Final thoughts on Bitcoin?\n\nDC: It’s money 2.0. There is no turning back now, the wheels are already turning. It will change the world of finance as we know it. Even some banks are developing their own crypto-currencies already. But they will be controlled and manipulated. Hopefully, Bitcoin and other cryptos will hold its position and status to turn out the real victor here."", ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article.\n\nIs Fidelity getting into the bitcoin game?\n\n– Law and Money Reporter, Boston Business Journal By Greg Ryan Law and Money Reporter, Boston Business Journal Jul 29, 2015, 4:06pm EDT\n\n– Law and Money Reporter, Boston Business Journal By Greg Ryan Law and Money Reporter, Boston Business Journal Jul 29, 2015, 4:06pm EDT"", ""In what is probably the institution’s broadest effort in the Bitcoin space to date, the American National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded a three year grant worth US$3 million for research on the science and applications of cryptocurrency.\n\nNew wave of disruption\n\nThe research project is led by Cornell University's Elaine Shi, and includes faculty members from Cornell, the University of Maryland, and UC Berkeley, hence combining crypto researchers with programming languages researchers and system builders.\n\nAs can be read in the abstract of the project, the NSF believes that Bitcoin and blockchain technology will severely impact and shape the future of money. The foundation considers cryptocurrencies a new wave of disruption, and as such believes the topic demands more research and understanding than is currently available.\n\nThe abstract reads:\n\n“Unfortunately, usage of crypto-currencies outstrips our understanding. […] This work aims to establish a rigorous scientific foundation for crypto-currencies. To achieve this, this work blends cryptography, game theory, programming languages, and systems security techniques.”\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, the projects co-PI (Principal Investigator), Cornell's Emin Sirer, further explained:\n\n“We plan to investigate the fundamental principles of cryptocurrency protocols, develop programming language support for smart contracts, and open-source secure systems infrastructure for cryptocurrency services, such as exchanges.”\n\nIn particular, Sirer explained that the project sets out to solve real-world problems Bitcoin is facing today. One of the research topics, for instance, is Bitcoin's scalability, a subject that has as of late attracted a lot of heated debate, in particular regarding the block size limit.\n\nSirer:\n\n“My group has been hard at work looking into how to make Bitcoin scale better, how to simulate the Bitcoin network realistically, and how to build databases and web servers that can securely handle valuable assets, like cryptocurrencies.”\n\n- Emin Sirer\n\nThe project will not be limited to Bitcoin, however. Notably, the NSF indicates to expect that improved cryptocurrency designs could emerge from the research.\n\nThe abstract reads:\n\n“Expected outcomes include new crypto-currency designs with provable security properties, financially enforceable cryptographic protocols whose security properties are backed by enforceable payments in case of a breach, smart contract systems that are easy to program and formally verifiable, as well as high-assurance systems for storing and handling high-value crypto-currencies and transactions.”\n\nThe NSF is a Unites States government research agency whose goal it is to promote the progress of science. With an annual budget of US$7.3 billion, the NSF funds some 24 percent of all federally supported basic research conducted by American colleges and universities. The cryptocurrency research will take place under the NSF division Computer and Network Systems (CNS).\n\nCornell University has published several papers on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency so far. The best known of these is probably a 2013 paper by Ittay Eyal, which argued that less than a majority of Bitcoin miners could in theory successfully attack the network. Last week, Eyal published a new paper under Cornell University's wings, in which he claims that mining pools will probably shrink in size over time.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to the NSF, but received no response at time of publication."", 'Bitcoin’s volatility is well documented. Prices have ranged from the infamous 10,000 BTC pizza purchase of 2010 (equivalent to around $25 at the time), to its all-time high of $1,242 for a single Bitcoin in December 2013. At the time of writing, 1 BTC was valued at just a shade under $270.\n\nThis tutorial by Randall Degges on the Stormpath Blog guides followers through building a publically available API service that sends users the current Bitcoin price at each API call. This service could be useful for independent retailers that accept BTC for goods or services, or anybody looking to buy or sell Bitcoins.\n\nThe service involves a fairly simple process of requesting the BTC price and delivering that data to the user via SMS. However, the process is complicated slightly by the inclusion of a payment feature that charges third-party developers 2c per successful API call. The application is built in Node and the tutorial begins with setting up Twilio to send the SMS messages, including buying a phone number to send messages from (this typically costs around $1 per month + 1c per SMS you send).\n\nThe author then sets up a Stripe account to handle credit/debit card or Bitcoin payments. Followers are then guided through setting up a Stormpath account for Authentication and API Key management, which removes the need to run a database for user data.\n\nOnce you have created a new API key, set up a new Stormpath Application with a suggested name of BTC SMS. Now the coding begins, starting with a minimalist Express.js application for structure and using Node template engine Jade for the View. The rest of the tutorial covers creating the static assets, setting up the application and defining the routes.\n\nAll the code is provided in the tutorial, as is a link to a screencast video covering the same content. This post is a fantastic example of how simple it can be to use API services to speed up development time and launch a legitimate API company.', 'It wasn’t just regular consumers who were able to benefit from the much-anticipated Amazon Prime Day. Purse.io, the escrow service that connects users with bitcoin to users with Amazon gift cards, saw a significant amount of growth leading up to the big day.\n\n“We had the highest number of new users in a single week,” Andrew Lee, CEO of Purse, said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. There were a total of 2,145 new users during the week.\n\nHowever, the people weren’t just signing up and then forgetting about the website. Instead, they were actively participating on the site, purchasing goods. What surprised the team, though, was that it wasn’t just prime purchases that people were making.\n\n“There was a lot of hype around the Prime Day event, but when we look at the specific orders, users didn’t just order necessarily prime deals but whatever they needed to buy,” Lee told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nAll told, Prime Day was a success for Purse. During the week, there were a total of 1,050 total transactions made on the site. On Prime Day itself, approximately $24,000 was spent on the site.\n\nHow Purse.io Works\n\nOne of the benefits of bitcoin is that it is money for the Internet. The problem for many users is that Amazon does not yet accept it. Purse enables a trusted exchange where a user with gift cards is able to exchange the value on those cards for bitcoin.\n\nAnd there is a lot of available money on gift cards. According to a New York Post article, $44 billion has been left unused on gift cards since 2008. And that number is continuing to grow. There are billions of dollars of unused Amazon gift cards.\n\nPurse enables the user to sell their gift cards for bitcoin, usually at a discount anywhere from 5 percent to 50 percent. These gift-card holders buy an item for the bitcoin holder. The bitcoin is then held in escrow, and when the purchase is completed and the item is delivered, the bitcoin is released to the gift-card holder.\n\nPurse has become quite a success among bitcoin users. According to Lee, more than $500,000 is transacted on the website each month, with more than 45,000 users spending more than $2 million through the site over the past year.\n\nPurse Going Forward\n\nPurse announced Tuesday a series of changes to its platform, including a complete redesign and a new shopping cart to enable the easy addition and removal of items. These moves are an effort to increase the likelihood that people will use bitcoin to make purchases.\n\n“Bitcoin commerce needs to make economic sense for everyone involved in a transaction. It’s only a matter of time before we see large retailers, such as Expedia or Overstock, exit Bitcoin. They have already cited low usage,” said Lee in a blog post titled Bitcoin Commerce is Broken. “We’ll be introducing solutions [that] will allow consumers to spend bitcoins at any merchant with a discount, and a whole lot more.”', ""Funderbeam, an Estonian company that offers data-intelligence on startups for angel investors, has announced it will launch a blockchain based trading platform for startup-investment.

Next, the company is planning to add two new layers to its product: automated investment syndication and a cross-trading platform.\n\nThrough the syndication layer, investors can create an investment syndicate for one or several startups listed on Funderbeam. If a certain startup requires, for instance, €100,000 in funding, this money can be put up by a syndicate of one lead investor and 99 backers all putting up €1,000, or a syndicate of one lead investor and one backer both putting up €50,000, or any other combination adding up to €100,000. Diminishing the current threshold to invest in startup companies, digital verification and regulatory compliance are offered by Funderbeam.\n\nOnce a syndicate is complete, and the startup (or startups) is funded, Funderbeam will establish a blockchain based aftermarket. Using colored coins, all members of a syndicate will own a digital representation of their stake in that syndicate. These stakes are then immediately tradable on Funderbeam's blockchain based market platform. As such, backers can for instance sell their share once they have made a decent return - or if they want to cut their losses.\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, Funderbeam CEO Kaidi Ruusalepp explained:\n\n“The main problem we are trying to solve is that startup investments are very illiquid right now. If you want to be an investor, you need to start with at least €10,000 to €30,000, and you will be stuck in that investment for at least five, maybe even six, seven or eight years. Our required minimum to invest, on the other hand, will be closer to €1,000, and you can immediately start trading the shares in these startup syndicates once they are funded.”\n\nFunderbeam believes that by utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain, it can cut out a lot bureaucracy and needless intermediaries that are usually associated with stock markets and trading platforms. Furthermore, it expects to be able to deliver speed, transparency, and liquidity to early-stage investing.\n\nRuusalepp:\n\n“Blockchains are going to do for the financial sector what the internet did for daily live as we know it. Stock exchanges have very many intermediaries between the money and the company. Securities depositories, central banks, central counterparties, brokers, dealers, account operators [...]. The blockchain is taking the role of some of these intermediaries. So it's making the process easier, cheaper and cross-border.”\n\nFunderbeam's announcement is another indication that the financial markets are warming up to blockchain technology. Greenwich Associates published a report last week in which the financial industry consulting firm predicted that blockchain technology would be embraced by capital markets. The NASDAQ stock exchange, moreover, expects integrate blockchain technology before the end of this year, while the former CEO of the Chi-X stock exchange launched a blockchain startup earlier this week."", 'Have you ever imagined what it would be like if the Internet allowed you to use it in total security? If you are a person who loves things like freedom and liberty, or if you are a political activist looking to avoid persecution for expressing your beliefs, it might be more desirable than ever today. It seems the list of entities looking to spy on you, usually illegally, is growing on a daily basis.\n\nWhat if Internet spies were no longer a problem because the Internet itself were encrypted to protect user’s privacy? You’re not alone in wondering how to make that happen, and it may now come to pass in the not-too-distant future under the name of HORNET.\n\nTor’s Faster, Younger Brother\n\nMany people are familiar with the “Onion browser” called Tor. Used by over two million people daily, Tor has been helping people use the Internet in a more secure and less compromised fashion since 2002. If you want maximum security for your surfing activities and information, Tor is your best play, to this point.\n\nHowever, the problem with Tor is its speed, or the lack of it. It is generally slower than the going rate in Internet performance, and it\'s slow enough to dissuade many from using it as their primary browser.\n\nBut what if Tor were as fast, or faster, than any other browser you could use? HORNET looks to become Tor 2.0 and get security-minded users up to speed. Instead of a cadre of new technologies, HORNET represents an evolution of current technologies, while upgrading browsing to the current levels of the rest of the Internet.\n\nHORNET stands for High-speed Onion Routing at the NETwork layer. It is the creation of lead researcher Chen Chen of Carnegie Mellon University, along with Daniele Enrico Asoni, David Barrera, and Adrian Perrig of the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, and George Danezis of University College at London.\n\nThe goal is for the browser’s performance to easily surpass anything Tor can manage network-wide by many magnitudes of scale while being just as secure. The 15-page white paper for HORNET, released on July 21, can be viewed in its entirety here.\n\nThe white paper explains.:\n\n“[HORNET is] a system that enables high-speed end-to-end anonymous channels by leveraging next generation network architectures. HORNET is designed as a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network layer thus enabling a wide range of applications. Our system uses only symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state on intermediate nodes. This design enables HORNET nodes to process anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s. HORNET can also scale as required, adding minimal processing overhead per additional anonymous channel.”\n\nEnabling privacy, freedom\n\nThis level of cryptography built into the future of Internet browsing can have wide-reaching global ramifications for both the freedom of Internet users and the so-called security of nation-states. Nations approach communications and security based upon the lowest-common-denominator, wanting everyone to not operate above that when it comes to user privacy.\n\nNow, nations have restricted the use of websites of subjects considered taboo by the government, like Bitcoin in Russia. Such petty local restrictions, again, many times illegal in nature, can be circumvented by the user anonymously. With an upgraded Hornet browser, in theory, these national issues can be worked around effectively to allow freedom to information for users that may not otherwise be available.\n\nAlso, sharing information about crimes, illegal activity, or corruption, a la Edward Snowden versus the NSA, via WikiLeaks, becomes less of an issue of access and dissemination. Fear of retribution for sharing information may become a thing of the past.\n\n""Recent revelations about global-scale pervasive surveillance programs have demonstrated that the privacy of internet users worldwide is at risk,"" the group at HORNET reveal in their findings. ""To protect against these and other surveillance threats, several anonymity protocols, tools, and architectures have been proposed. Tor is the system of choice for over 2 million daily users, but its design as an overlay network suffers from performance and scalability issues: as more clients use Tor, more relays must be added to the network.”\n\nThe next step could be peer review to substantiate the group’s claims and testing, though the amount of time needed to complete this is unknown. Remember, Bitcoin was also just a 9-page white paper back on November 1, 2008 and “went live” on January 3, 2009, just as a point of reference. Suffice to say a new standard in Internet security and user protection is in the works, and as this story progresses we’ll keep you informed.']"
07/30/2015,"[""UPDATE (31st July 20:30 BST): Local news sources are reporting that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police will arrest Mark Karpeles on 1st August in connection with its investigation. A representative for the Tokyo police was not available for comment.\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Police is reportedly pursuing criminal charges against Mark Karpeles, CEO of the now-defunct, Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.\n\nDomestic news service Nikkei reported on 31st July that, according to an official with the city's police force, Karpeles is being investigated for allegedly using dummy exchange accounts with fictitious bitcoin balances to meet customer orders.\n\nAccording to a rough translation of the Nikkei report, speculation is now rising that some of the 650,000 BTC reported stolen last year could have been fraudulently accounted for on the exchange. This suggests some users may have never owned bitcoin lost in Mt Gox's collapse.\n\nA report from April suggested that many of the reportedly stolen bitcoins were gone by mid-May 2013.\n\nPolice also suspect that Karpeles may have misappropriated actual bitcoins deposited by users, allegations that could lead to embezzlement charges. Local authorities formally opened their investigation into Mt Gox last year.\n\nThe report comes soon after the completion of a bankruptcy claims process that ended on 29th July. The exchange first announced that it would seek bankruptcy protection in February 2014.\n\nA representative from US law firm Baker & Mackenzie, which had previously represented the embattled exchange, told CoinDesk it is no longer representing the company.\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""What bitcoin does for payments, Ethereum does for anything that can be programmed,"" the site reads.\n\nThis Monday, Stephan Tual, Ethereum\'s CCO, confirmed in a company blog post that the platform\'s code had now been \'frozen\' for two weeks, with all technical features prepped.\n\nThe launch of the Ethereum mining network and the ability to execute contracts happened earlier today, following eight proof-of-concepts and a barrage of stress tests in the last release, Olympic. The formal launch had been pushed back multiple times.\n\nThough it\'s publicly available, Frontier – which comes in a ""bare bones"" command line format – is aimed squarely at developers as a live testing environment. Only this time, real funds are at stake.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, release co-ordinator Vinay Gupta warned potential users that Frontier will be a complex technical release, not for the faint of heart:\n\n""Don\'t put a lot of value at risk unless you really, really are sure you know what you are doing, and you\'re confident about your risk assessment of the network.""\n\nNon-developers will have to wait for a UI in Ethereum\'s next release, Homestead, which is expected in two to four months. Serenity, the final version of the platform, may be up to 12 months away.\n\nTimeline of events\n\nFollowing the creation of the Ethereum genesis block, which contains all transactions from its $18m crowdsale, users are now able to mine and trade the platform\'s native token, ether (ETH).\n\nUnlike bitcoin, ether is not intended to be used as a global digital currency. Rather, to perform any action on the network, users need to pay an amount of ether. Those who validate transactions on the network, as with bitcoin, will be rewarded in ether for any resources they contribute via mining.\n\nIn essence, its a large pay-as-you-go computer, with ether – computational power – the currency that brings these computerised functions to life. The more you need the computer to do, the higher the fee.\n\nIn the first tentative days of the platform – known as the \'thawing phase\' – the supply of ether will be normal, 5 ETH per block, which are created roughly every 12 seconds. Transactions will not be available in the thawing phase, while the network ramps up.\n\nTechnically, anyone with a GPU will be able to act as one of Ethereum\'s mining nodes as it employs an ASIC-resistant mining algorithm to help prevent a single miner monopolising the network. However, should something go awry, the development team will still have a degree of control over the network, in the form of so-called \'kill switches\', or canary contracts that signal to miners there is a problem with the fork they are working on.\n\nTrue decentralisation comes later, Gupta said:\n\n""We\'d originally thought about running Frontier with a huge range of intervention points in case something spun out technically. But for a variety of reasons we\'ve pulled back to the kill switches only ... Those switches are what make Frontier the \'live test\' that it is. Once we\'re confident it\'s all solid, we pull them out.""\n\nOnce the platform is deemed stable enough by Ethereum’s developers and auditors it will migrate to ‘Homestead’. Previously, all smart contracts would be wiped during this process, but the team say this is no longer the case.\n\nDevelopment milestone\n\nThe brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, a 21-year-old college dropout and Peter Thiel fellow, Ethereum first surfaced as a white paper in 2013 and was announced at the Miami\'s North American Bitcoin Conference the following January.\n\nThe glut of 2.0 platforms – such as Factom and Counterparty – often function by running abstratction layers on top of the bitcoin blockchain. However, Ethereum made the decision to create a purpose-built platform for these functions from scratch, building its own programming languages (Serpent and Solidity), comms system (Whisper), peer-to-peer file sharing network (Swarm) and a browser for Ethereum-built apps (Mist).\n\nWhereas bitcoin aimed to take the central processor out of payments, Ethereum is seeking to decentralize all manner of Internet services, making them cheaper, faster and more accessible by moving power away from a central server and placing it into the hands of users.\n\nThe platform intends its primary user base to be developers who want to create and distribute peer-to-peer apps.\n\nIn the future, Ethereum aims to govern itself using its own system, if it can be mathematically represented it can be modelled, secured and traded.\n\nMuch to prove\n\nGiven the project\'s grand scope, it has drawn some criticism from the bitcoin community and beyond.\n\nSome of the more common complaints center on the fact that the bitcoin network has continued to improve and develop since Ethereum was first conceived. For example, the Tim Draper-backed startup Mirror is reportedly working on bringing native smart contracts to the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nRudimentary versions of Ethereum smart contracts – one of the project\'s principal selling points – are already available on the bitcoin network today to users of Counterparty, which made a point of porting this functionality from the project to its own testnet in November.\n\nBitcoin developers like Mike Hearn, for example, have sought to frame the project as overambitious given that bitcoin has a scripting language, that while rudimentary, has yet to be fully explored.\n\nA recent white paper from the National University of Singapore also raised questions about how the Ethereum network incentivizes its users to achieve consensus, finding that honest miners may prove vulnerable to attacks given the Turing-complete nature of its programming.\n\nAt issue was the idea that transaction validators on the Ethereum network have arguably more control over operations than in bitcoin, a criticism members of the project addressed.\n\n""The bottom line is that clients have a ton of liberty about what they store, and if people start to feel real pain about blockchain size, clients will adapt to reduce what they store in a variety of ways,"" Gupta told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""The initial clients aren\'t particularly optimized for storage efficiency because, frankly, £100 buys you two terabytes in Maplin - disk is nearly free today. Over time it will be more of an issue, and I expect we\'ll sort it out then.""\n\nCornell professor Emin Gun Sirer told CoinDesk that while he believes smart contracts open up a level of expressivity in payment systems, the project\'s broader goals of decentralization are perhaps naive.\n\nSirer said:\n\n""The killer apps for smart contracts have not been designed yet ... I\'m a big proponent of Ethereum and smart contracts, though I believe in this case the hype and the fantasy-borne use cases overstep the capabilities of the platform.""\n\nPete Rizzo contributed reporting.\n\nFor more on the project, watch its latest promotional video below:\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He advises on corporate compliance and represents companies in their interactions with government investigatory, enforcement, and prosecutorial authorities.\n\nWhat compliance expectations does the Department of Justice have for businesses entering the virtual currency space? How can a company meet those expectations to stay out of trouble with DOJ, or at least mitigate the effects of any criminal inquiry on it as well as its executives, employees and investors? A recent speech by the Criminal Division head, Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, provides critical guidance on DOJ’s “approach to the emerging virtual currency landscape” and expands on its view that “compliance and cooperation from exchanges, companies and other market actors can ensure that emerging technologies are not misused to fund and facilitate illicit activities.”[1]\n\nDOJ’s View of How Virtual Currencies Are Used\n\nDOJ is skeptical. While it knows virtual currency has “many legitimate actual and potential uses,” its enforcement stance is informed by the observation that “the inherent features of virtual currencies are exactly what make them attractive to criminals.”[2] For instance, virtual currency systems “conduct transfers quickly, securely and with a perceived level of anonymity,” have an “irreversibility of payments made in virtual currency and lack of oversight by a central financial authority” and have the “ability to conduct international peer-to-peer transactions that lack immediately available personally identifiable information.”\n\nVirtual currency thus “facilitates a wide range of traditional criminal activities as well as sophisticated cybercrime schemes.”[3] For instance, “online black markets” on the dark web offer a “wide selection of illicit goods and services” paid for in virtual currency, including “more traditional crimes such as narcotics trafficking, stolen credit card information, and hit-men for hire.” But there has also been “a significant evolution in criminal activity.” Virtual currency has funded “the production of child exploitation material through online crowd-sourcing.” It has been used to “buy and sell lethal toxins over the Internet,” to make payments in “virtual kidnapping and extortion” and to allow “near-instantaneous transactions across the globe between perpetrators of phishing and hacking schemes and their victims.”\n\nVirtual Currency Businesses as Financial System Gatekeepers\n\nDOJ views these issues as a relatively small-scale problem now, because “[f]ew virtual systems currently can accommodate” the sort of “large-scale money laundering schemes involving government-issued currency.” But “as virtual currencies become more mature and better understood by criminals,” DOJ expects “an increase in both individualized criminal activity and large-scale money laundering enterprises.”[4]\n\nThis means “companies and individuals operating in the virtual currency ecosystem are at a crossroads.” This is their chance “to help virtual currency emerge from its association with criminal activities.” But in order to “ensure the integrity of this ecosystem and prevent its penetration by crime, the industry must raise the level of its game on the compliance front.”\n\nThe government is thus enlisting this emerging business community as financial system gatekeepers. DOJ often notes that the country’s banks “are our first line of defense against fraud, money laundering, terrorism financing and violations of sanctions laws.”[5] It expects nothing less here: “Virtual currency exchangers and other marketplace actors comprise the front line of defense against money laundering and financial crime.”[6]\n\nAnd DOJ is not kidding. AAG Caldwell bluntly says, “industry participants are now on notice that criminals … make regular use of” virtual currencies. Robust compliance programs in virtual currency businesses are thus “essential to keeping crime out of our financial system.” At a minimum, raising “the level of its game” will require the industry to exhibit “strict compliance with money services business regulations and anti-money laundering statutes.”\n\nThe Costs of Compliance—and of Noncompliance\n\nDOJ expects virtual currency businesses “to take compliance risk as seriously as they take other business risk.” And they must think about compliance broadly. On other occasions, AAG Caldwell has noted that compliance efforts “are too often behind the curve” and fail to “prevent tomorrow’s scandals” because they “target the risk of regulatory or law enforcement exposure of institutional and employee misconduct, rather than the risk of the misconduct itself.”[7] DOJ wants the focus to be on the broader “compliance risk” and not the narrower regulatory risk.\n\nWhat about the cost? DOJ “recognize[s] that new entrants in emerging fields may find that compliance requires a significant expenditure of resources” and promises to be “context?specific” in analyzing the adequacy of compliance frameworks.[8]Nevertheless, “a real commitment to compliance is a must, particularly given the significant risks in the virtual currency market.” The bottom line: “In the long run, investment in effective compliance programs will be well worth it, especially in the event a company has to interact with law enforcement.”\n\nThat “interaction” with law enforcement may well involve DOJ deciding whether to indict a company (and individuals) or give it some kind of break. As AAG Caldwell says, “[i]f a money services business finds itself subject to a criminal investigation,” DOJ will look to the so-called Filip factors in its Principles of Prosecution of Business Organizations. In particular, it will examine “the existence of an effective and well-designed compliance program” (Filip factor 5) and “a company’s remedial actions, including steps to improve upon an existing compliance program” (Filip factor 6).\n\nAs for Filip factor 5, “effective anti-money laundering and other compliance programs must be tailored to meet the circumstances, size, structure and risks encountered” by the business. For instance, “virtual currencies, with their perceived anonymity, pose risks that money transmitters such as Western Union do not face.” The risks in the virtual currency arena may be difficult to deal with, but DOJ’s view is simple: “Industry participants must address those risks, even when it may be costly to do so.” Filip factor 6 requires that a company fix a problem if one occurs. That means not only that it must patch any hole in the compliance program, but also “replace responsible management,” “discipline or terminate wrongdoers,” “pay restitution,” and “cooperate with the relevant government agencies.”[9]\n\nRecommendations\n\nHere are some specific steps for emerging virtual currency businesses to consider when ensuring their compliance efforts align with DOJ’s guidance and expectations:\n\nIt’s Never Too Early. Anticipate compliance issues as soon as possible in the company’s lifecycle. Develop a compliance system at the same time that you are refining your product or service (and well before you interact with customers).\n\nPeople, People, People. It’s hard to understand cryptocurrencies, and even harder to explain them well to skeptical law enforcement personnel. Make excellent compliance people part of your initial team and include them in important decision-making.\n\nMoney, Money, Money. There must be the financial commitment to compliance that is required in this industry space. While DOJ seems sympathetic to the “significant expenditure of resources,” it will not likely go easy on those whom it concludes have skimped.\n\nThink About the Technology’s Regulatory Future. The technology of, and related to, your virtual currency will shape the government’s expectations. Take bitcoin for example. Unlike dollar bills, say, every bitcoin carries its own transaction history. The blockchain is a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. And new products are being refined that can analyze that blockchain and seek to determine every place a bitcoin has been and perhaps even who transferred or held it. It may become possible to give bitcoin a risk score, since those of suspicious provenance (for instance, those having once been through a mixer or in a dark wallet) could be separated from those that are squeaky clean.\n\nInstill a High-Integrity Culture Now for the Company You Will Become. The government has high expectations for those it views as running “gatekeeper” businesses. The regulatory bar is bound to get even higher as large banks and financial institutions — with their established and highly professional compliance staffs — develop their own virtual currencies. As “gatekeeper” businesses grow, they face pressures to be “ethical” and not simply to meet legal and regulatory minimums. Adopt a broad view of compliance risk that focuses on the risk of misconduct and on reputational risk and then communicate that view clearly and compellingly in the onboarding process.\n\nConclusion\n\nEmerging virtual currency businesses will face progressively higher compliance expectations from DOJ. They can maximize their potential market value by acting early in their lifecycles to install compliance systems and instill a high-integrity culture that will enable them to meet those expectations.\n\n[1] Assistant Attorney General Leslie R.

Day explained:\n\n""Their account got verified by providing legitimate documents. Problem is, it was not that person\'s ID. We\'ve seen this many times and enforce video calls for many of our users to prove they are who they say they are. By the time we got to that point with this account, it was too late. The bank had already restricted the account and funds frozen.""\n\nTo overcome this issue, Day said, igot will require users making deposits over a certain amount to engage in mandatory video calls in the future.\n\nThe founder said progress had been made and he expected account restrictions to be removed by mid-August. “We’re certain that we will be able to resolve all the withdrawal issues in the next one to two weeks. Banks have so far been very cooperative and we’ve assisted them with their investigations.""\n\nIn order to prevent these kind of issues from happening again, Day noted his company was looking to procure additional banking partners.\n\n""We\'ve established a more solid relationship with other banks internationally ... We\'ve opened multiple accounts in multiple countries so we do not depend on any one bank and be in this situation again.""\n\nAlthough, CoinDesk has not seen evidence of these relationships.\n\nDDoS attacks\n\nIn addition to its strained banking relationship, Day claimed igot had also been subjected to a series of “very sophisticated” DDoS attacks in the past weeks.\n\nThe attacks, Day said, were not targeting the site itself, but the wallet addresses by sending \'dust\' transactions.\n\nThis, he said, has been mostly contained. ""We have started rerouting such transactions, removing such addresses and suspending such accounts. We\'ve made some good progress here and are going to resume normal services soon.""\n\nOne Reddit user, who goes by the name of fernetbreakfast, voiced his dissatisfaction with the company:\n\n""Excuse after excuse, now 30 days missing $12,000USD.

Small businessman like me can\'t afford this type of delay. — Prafulla Shinde (@microsysimpex) July 24, 2015\n\nDamage control\n\nDay sympathised with users, but calling igot untrustworthy or feeling that they have been robbed was not, he said, a fair assessment.\n\n“Were withdrawals delayed? Absolutely. At the same time, we were able to make many payments.”\n\nThe intention of the business was not to rob people, he said. “Our business model works great. We have some really big potential and are not one bit interested in robbing users.”\n\nOne user, who is owed $400, told CoinDesk: ""I am not sure it is a scam, however, what is ridiculous is the support shown to every customer who is as nervous as I am about the status of my money.""\n\nPrevious issues\n\nThe recent events aren\'t the first to cause people to criticise igot\'s services. In May this year, users also complained of delayed withdrawals. At the time, igot assured its customers the issues were due to a ""major upgrade"" to its system.\n\nNevertheless, Day said people should not ""write off"" his company, stating that it has been running for 18 months and has many satisfied customers.\n\n“We provided great customer service to our customers and will continue to do so,” he concluded.\n\nIn the meantime, many igot customers are still awaiting access to their funds. A user who is owed over $15,000 told CoinDesk:\n\n""Rick ... constantly promises payment \'shortly\', but never delivers. I have learnt the painful lesson of never trusting him with my money.

Bronx Delis in Pontiac and Farmington Hills, Mich. have served as gathering spots for local bitcoin enthusiasts. While restaurant patrons enjoy food and beverages as they discuss bitcoin, they can pay for their meals with bitcoin using smartphones and a QR code.\n\nAnd if they want to add to their bitcoin wallets, they can buy bitcoin from a recently installed bitcoin ATM at the Farmington Hills restaurant, which reportedly is the first bitcoin ATM in the “Motor City.”\n\nTapping A New Market\n\nOwner Marc Zuccato believes that by accepting bitcoin, he has tapped into a new market of younger, tech-savvy customers.\n\n“I realized that this would be a new customer base,” said Zuccato, who learned about bitcoin from his brother-in-law, a stock broker. “Plus, we also knew we would get some free publicity. We have been on Fox 2 news talking about bitcoin.”\n\n“These ‘bitcoiners’ that eat in the deli would have never dined here if we didn’t take bitcoin,” Zuccato told CCN. “We have a sign in the front window and the bitcoin logo is also on some of the menus. I also have the logo on my email signature block.” He has also promoted bitcoin on his Facebook page, which is one of the restaurant’s main marketing tools.\n\nPatrons who pay with bitcoin can also tip their servers in bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Acceptance Grows\n\nOnly a minority of patrons pay using bitcoin, but Zuccato said the number is growing, albeit slowly.\n\nZuccato does not use bitcoin to pay for his business purchases. Nor has he offered to accept bitcoin for Bronx Deli’s online takeout orders.\n\nZuccato’s personal interest in bitcoin is primarily as an investment.\n\nAlso read: Consumers warming to bitcoin ATMs\n\nMeetups Lead To A Bitcoin ATM Installation\n\nMichael Woon, an automotive engineer, began attending the biweekly bitcoin “meetups” at the Bronx Deli in Farmington Hills in mid-2013. Woon had also learned about bitcoin from a relative and was interested in making more people aware of it.\n\nWhen he found out about dedicated bitcoin ATMs, Woon thought it would be a good way to introduce more people to bitcoin. Being a Bronx Deli patron, he had no problem getting permission to place a bitcoin ATM in the restaurant.\n\nAfter educating himself about bitcoin ATMs, Woon purchased a Lamassu bitcoin ATM and installed it in the Bronx Deli about one year ago.

It is what has made Spain, a former crisis country in which unemployment is still eye-wateringly high, Europe's star performer.\n\nIts growth rate is better even than the United Kingdom's.\n\nHere's a chart from Capital Economics showing just how the country has bounced back:\n\nUnlike other countries in Southern Europe, Spain is credited with bringing in a solid reform programme, especially in liberalising its labour market.\n\nBut that's not the only cause of the country's revival — the French investment bank Natixis has pointed out how much of the eurozone's recent (but modest) growth spurt is due to the effect of oil prices and the weaker euro.\n\nIn fact, the bank's analysts say Italy would still be in recession, France would still be stagnant, and even Germany would barely have grown at all without those dual stimulants."", 'The National Science Foundation has awarded research grants on the science and applications of crypto-currency, with approximately $1 million awarded to date. The NSF initiative is part of the “Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace” program for cybersecurity research and development to minimize the dangers of cyber technology, promote education and training in cybersecurity, establish a science of cybersecurity and convert promising cybersecurity research into practice.\n\nThe NSF grant has been awarded to Emin Sirer at Cornell University (grant information here), Elaine Shi, Michael Hicks, Jonathan Katz and David Van Horn at the University of Maryland (grant information here), and Dawn Song at the University of California-Berkeley (grant information here).\n\nEmin Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University, researches operating systems, networking and distributed systems. His current projects involve a novel secure operating system and system infrastructure for high-performance cloud computing applications.\n\n“We plan to investigate the fundamental principles of cryptocurrency protocols, develop programming language support for smart contracts, and open-source secure systems infrastructure for cryptocurrency services, such as exchanges,”Sirer told CoinTelegraph in reference to the NSF grant.\n\nElaine Shi, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies and the Maryland Cybersecurity Center, and the principal investigator for the largest NSF grant at the University of Maryland, launched the world’s first undergraduate laboratory course that combines “smart” contracts – computer programs that can automatically execute the terms of a contract – and cryptocurrency.\n\n“Smart contracts will shape the future of our financial transactions and e-commerce,” Shi said after the laboratory course. “They carry out high-value financial transactions, so their security is particularly important. We learned many lessons from this lab, including it is very tricky to write a safe cryptocurrency contract.”\n\n“We believe that our research can help establish cryptocurrency as a prominent research area, and make a big impact in shaping the future of financial transactions and e-commerce,” Shi told CoinDesk referring to the NSF grant.\n\nDawn Song, a professor of computer science at U.C.

Expected outcomes include new cryptocurrency designs with provable security properties, financially enforceable cryptographic protocols whose security properties are backed by enforceable payments in case of a breach, smart contract systems that are easy to program and formally verifiable, as well as high-assurance systems for storing and handling high-value cryptocurrencies and transactions.\n\nThis is one of the first large research grants on digital currencies awarded by a government. Earlier this year, the U.K. government launched a new research initiative to bring together the Research Councils, Alan Turing Institute and Digital Catapult with industry in order to address the research opportunities and challenges for digital currency technology, and decided to increase research funding in this area by £10 million ($14.6 million USD).', 'Two weeks ago, the US Government made an important breakthrough in the ongoing war against cyber crime when intelligence agencies managed to shut down Darkode. This forum, which acts as a marketplace for malware, spyware, and hacking tools, has been a thorn in the eye of government officials for quite some time. But despite best efforts, Darkode has returned to the scene, and allegedly tightened their security.\n\nAlso read: The Reasoning Behind Massive Backing for Darktrace\n\nThe Demise of Darkode and Arrests Around the World — or Not?\n\nOn July 15 2015, Darkode was officially taken offline, thanks to the combined efforts of various intelligence agencies around the world. An online marketplace where illegal malware could be bought and sold without consequences could not go by unnoticed for long. After all, there is no place in this world for such illegal activities, even though Darkode had over 250 active members at the time of its demise.\n\nAfter an intensive 18-month operation, which involved infiltrating the Darkode forum as a member interested in purchasing illegal malware, intelligence agencies managed to put a name and location to the people responsible for running the marketplace. In total, 28 people were arrested in the US and Europe, which should have put the entire operation to bed once and for all.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell stated:\n\n“This is a milestone in our efforts to shut down criminals’ ability to buy, sell, and trade malware, botnets and personally identifiable information used to steal from US citizens and individuals around the world… This operation is a great example of what international law enforcement can accomplish when we work closely together to neutralise a global cybercrime marketplace.”\n\nThe Fun Lasted For 14 Days\n\nJust two weeks after the fact, Darkode has risen from the ashes and is once open for business. Moreover, the main post on the website claims that the people who ran Darkode previously are all accounted for and not behind bars. Additionally, most of the senior members of the previous Darkode forum are all enjoying their freedom to this very day.\n\nMalwareTech, a Darkode forum member living in the UK, explained it as follows:\n\n“Originally the main admin known as ‘Sp3cial1st’ had posted a statement on pastebin declaring that he wanted to wait and see who all of the 70 users arrested were before bringing the forums back online. Sp3cial1st launched darkcode.cc as a holding page a few hours after that statement, though. The new format, with all members having their own onion address would allow the Darkode admins greater control over who gets access, preventing people from accessing a hacked account without the owner’s onion url. It would also allow them to better monitor who views what by creating an individual log file for each onion, meaning they could quickly weed out leakers.”\n\nTightening Security and Accepting Bitcoin\n\nDarkcode.cc is learning from the mistakes that were made while operating the original marketplace. As a result, several security changes have been made, including using Tor-only access to visit the site. On top of that, Darkcode.cc will now be an invite-only platform, meaning that not just anyone can register an account on the site.\n\nIn fact, Darkcode.cc will only allow previous members back once they go through a verification processed based on the Blockchain API. But that is not the only Bitcoin reference, as Darkcode.cc operators referenced to storing a hash of users’ Bitcoin Wallet addresses as only link to their registration. Allowing authentication through a Bitcoin wallet address should prevent scammers from accessing the new forums, as they would need to know the private key tied to someone’s Bitcoin wallet address.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the new DarkCode.cc marketplace will be tackled by government officials and intelligence agencies. The tactics used to shut down Darkode previously were clearly insufficient, and may have only bolstered the ring leaders in their quest to reign havoc on Internet-connected devices we have all grown accustomed to using.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the rebirth of Darkode?

They did so after receiving letters from Illinois’ Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, who said Backpage\'s popular “adult” ad section facilitated sex trafficking.\n\nDart said in a statement at the time that Backpage “lowered the barrier to entry” for sex traffickers. “Raising that barrier,” he said, would lead to fewer traffickers and fewer victims.\n\nPeople who work in the sex industry are condemning the moves as misguided and dangerous. Backpage last month filed a lawsuit against Dart’s office, contending that his requests to credit card companies violate the free speech rights of Backpage and its users. A judge on Friday ordered Dart to cease campaigning against Backpage\'s revenue sources, Consumerist reported.\n\n“It’s the more marginalized and poorer workers who are hit hardest by this,” said Caty Simon, an escort and co-editor of Tits and Sass, a blog by and for sex workers.\n\n“Backpage is one of the cheapest options for sex workers to work independently while also having access to a large pool of clients,” she told HuffPost.\n\nWithout that option, Simon said, sex workers who lack the resources to advertise on more expensive websites -- or learn to use alternative payments like bitcoin -- may have to work on the streets, which carries a higher risk of violence or arrest. Backpage is temporarily allowing ads in its “adult” section to be posted for free.\n\nThe new credit card policies, which also affect Backpage users in countries like the U.K. and Australia, where selling sex is legal, will likely increase some escorts’ dependency on the very people it’s meant to protect them from, according to Maggie McNeill, who\'s worked on and off as an escort since 1997 and writes about the industry on her blog ""The Honest Courtesan.""\n\nWithout easy and affordable access to a client base, “what are you going to do?” McNeill asked. “Hitting the streets is what you’ve got to do. Or you might run into some guy who says, ‘I can get you work if you give me a cut.’”\n\n“Backpage is one of the easiest ways for low-income sex workers to avoid being exploited by third parties,” Simon said.\n\nSex worker advocacy groups had similar concerns.\n\n“This policy effectively disenfranchises thousands of sex workers across the country who do not have access to any other means of online advertising,” Lindsay Roth, board chair of the Sex Workers Outreach Project, told nonprofit group Project Safe Philly.\n\nThe Sex Workers Project issued a statement earlier this month criticizing credit card companies for the decision:\n\n“Access to online advertising can be a basic safety mechanism for many people in the sex industry,” said Crystal DeBoise, Director of the Sex Workers Project. “The ability to advertise online gives sex workers the ability to screen clients, to negotiate for services and condoms use, and to have more control over the interactions and environment in a sex work exchange. These are all safety strategies people in the sex trade need to survive. Visa and MasterCard trying to end this avenue will only cause harm to those in the sex trade, and will not stop trafficking.”\n\nThe Sex Workers Project said the moves make it harder for law enforcement to prosecute sex traffickers, because credit card information collected by Backpage had in the past been used as evidence.\n\n“Any pimp or trafficker using bitcoin or [online payment service] paysafe is impossible to trace,” a U.K.-based sensual masseuse who wished to be identified only as “Pauline” told HuffPost.\n\nIf cutting off Backpage\'s access to credit cards isn’t the answer to curbing exploitation, what is? Simon and McNeill said decriminalization of sex work is the most important step.\n\n“Criminalization, marginalization, isolation and poverty -- all things sex workers suffer from under current policy -- are all factors that make us more vulnerable to exploitation,” said Simon. “Decriminalizing sex work would not only help voluntary sex workers, it would also help those of us who are coerced.”\n\nA woman in an abusive situation, Simon said, may be afraid to leave for fear of being “outed” as a sex worker. “Criminalizing sex work is what makes trafficking survivors unable to seek support,” she said.\n\nCriminalization and stigma also make it harder for websites to root out trafficking. Pauline said her advertising site of choice screens sex workers by asking them to provide ID and contacting them to determine whether they can hold a conversation in English.\n\nMcNeill noted that a screening process is a major barrier to entry for women in the U.S., who fear they will be recorded as sex workers in a database that can later be used against them.\n\nMcNeill emphasized that “decriminalization” should mean decriminalization for both sex workers and their clients, a stance supported by Amnesty International and Open Society Foundations.\n\n“Independent sexual behavior of humans is not an appropriate subject for criminal law,” she said, referring to consensual acts. Laws against rape, assault and abduction, she said, should stand -- but not those outlawing the acts of selling or paying for sex.\n\nMcNeill added that minors who have run away from abusive homes -- one of the biggest demographics of minors who wind up selling sex -- would benefit greatly from widespread 24-hour “drop-in” shelters, where any young person could receive a meal, shelter and a bed “with no questions asked.” Much of the money spent on police and prisons, she said, would be far better spent on that.\n\nShe also said many underaged people who sold sex might not do so if minor emancipation were made easier for older teens. In that case, minors who otherwise might feel like they had no options other than selling sex could more easily obtain other jobs without parental permission.\n\nLiz McDougall, general counsel for Backpage.com, told HuffPost, ""Speaking for myself, I believe humanity and civil rights should be priorities in society\'s treatment of all persons.""\n\nThe Cook County Sheriff’s Department was unable to comment due to pending litigation from Backpage.\n\nVisa, MasterCard and American Express did not immediately return a request for comment.', 'CoinMate Partners with MoneyPolo to Enable Cash Deposit in 150 Countries\n\nJuly 30, 2015 By: Asif Imtiaz\n\nEarlier this week, the UK based Bitcoin startup CoinMate announced that its customers can now use the service to make cash purchases in over 150 countries worldwide.\n\nCoinMate has been looking for a way to eliminate the need for using traditional banking channels to buy or sell Bitcoins. “Most Bitcoin markets work with bank deposits and bank withdrawals, however, it is estimated that 40% of the world’s adult population have no bank account and an even greater share is limited to local transfers,” said Roman Valihrach, the CEO of CoinMate’s parent company Confirmo Ltd, while speaking to the CoinTelegraph.\n\nAs CoinMate was looking for a way to accept direct cash deposits, it later found an international money and a cash transfer provider, MoneyPolo. MoneyPolo is based in London and has a wide ranging financial network of more than 400,000 partner outlets in the world.\n\nOn July 23, CoinMate revealed on their official blog that it has partnered with one of most renowned cash transfer service providers in the United Kingdom, MoneyPolo. MoneyPolo is a UK regulated payment provider that allows cash deposit service in around 150 countries. It is the partnership with MoneyPolo enabled CoinMate to accept cash deposit from its users.\n\nCommenting on the partnership with MoneyPolo, Roman Valihrach mentioned that “MoneyPolo account allows cost effective cash deposits and cash withdrawals in more than 100 countries of the world through their partnership networks. That’s why we decided to integrate MoneyPolo into CoinMate.”\n\nCoinMate users can now open a MoneyPolo account, load the funds into their virtual account via any of the 400,000 partner outlets and can make instant deposit to their CoinMate Bitcoin wallet, without incurring any additional charges. CoinMate Users can also make an instant withdrawal via MoneyPolo, which makes using Bitcoin as convenient as cash.\n\nAs opposed to using a credit or debit card, which usually incurs a small fee, direct cash deposit with MoneyPolo will be cost effective to CoinMate customers.

07/31/2015,"['TOKYO (Reuters) - Mark Karpeles, the former head of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, was arrested on Saturday in connection with the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the virtual currency, Japanese media reports said.\n\nThe French-born Karpeles, 30, is suspected of falsifying data on the outstanding balance of the exchange, at one point the world’s largest hub for trading the digital currency, they added.\n\nPolice were unable to immediately confirm the reports.\n\nWhen it filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, Mt. Gox said 750,000 customer bitcoins and another 100,000 belonging to the exchange were stolen due to a software security flaw.\n\nThe lost funds represented the equivalent of $480 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing. Mt. Gox also said more than $27 million was missing from its Japanese bank accounts.\n\nKarpeles, who had blamed hackers for the loss, later said he had recovered 200,000 of the lost bitcoins.\n\nKnown as a self-proclaimed geek who said he was uncomfortable in his native France and hadn’t been back in years, Karpeles became interested in bitcoin when a customer of his web-hosting services wanted to pay in the virtual currency.\n\nMt. Gox subsequently shot from obscurity to dominate global trade in bitcoin, but as early as 2012 employees at the Tokyo-based exchange challenged Karpeles on issues such as whether client money was being used to cover costs.', 'In many countries, when it comes to regulating bitcoin companies, it’s still mostly a work in progress. Some governments want to restrict bitcoin quite a lot, while others are adopting a more favorable stance. The U.K. has been the financial hub of Europe for decades now, and it looks like it plans to do the same thing with bitcoin.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron is currently wrapping up his first trade mission since re-election in South East Asia, and he brought the usual suspects (Lloyd’s of London, Rolls-Royce…), as well as a bitcoin company, Blockchain.\n\nThis is a good sign for the bitcoin industry in the U.K. as the British Government has yet to adopt a strong stance on the subject. On the one hand, bitcoin companies should expect anti-money laundering regulation; on the other hand, the Bank of England has issued multiple favorable statements toward the cryptocurrency as Coindesk noticed.\n\n“While existing private digital currencies have economic flaws which make them volatile, the distributed ledger technology that their payment systems rely on may have considerable promise,” the Bank of England wrote in February.\n\nAnd bringing a bitcoin company to a trade mission is yet another sign that the U.K. wants to play an important role when it comes to welcoming bitcoin startups and becoming a bitcoin hub. This is not the kind of company that you would expect on an official trip to Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia.\n\n“There are a couple of peer-to-peer loan companies and then there’s an e-commerce company and a bank software-as-a-service provider,” Blockchain co-founder and CEO Peter Smith told me. “Other big companies on the delegation are massive infrastructure companies.”\n\nLondon-based startup Blockchain has been growing quite a lot lately. The number of transactions using Blockchain’s wallets and API has doubled over the past six months, and the company now has 4 million users. The team also raised $30 million in October 2014.\n\nWhen asked about bitcoin regulation in the U.K., Smith was optimistic. “We’ve been working pretty closely with Number 10 and the policy makers in the U.K. generally. I think the invitation is a reflection of the positive relationship and the Prime Minister’s dedication to fintech, and especially fintech 2.0,” he said. “Recently they committed £10 million in budget to study this stuff. [Chancellor of the Exchequer] Osborne has made a lot of public comments supporting bitcoin publicly — we expect a regulatory framework soon.” Let’s just hope it is more permissive than the New York Department of Financial Services’ BitLicense.', 'A company near San Francisco has come up with a novel way to deliver bitcoin-purchased marijuana, via drone.\n\nTrees, which claims to sell the ""highest quality"" medicinal cannabis to people holding a medical recommendation, accepts payments in bitcoin alongside traditional payment methods such as cash, online bank transfer and credit cards.\n\nA spokesperson for the company confirmed that drone deliveries were not currently available, due to local regulations. The drone delivery option, the spokesperson said, would be rolled-out in the future if and when the regulation around the flying devices settled. Currently users will get their packages delivered by ""old fashioned in-house drivers"".\n\nFor now, users are required to provide their Californian driving license and medical cannabis recommendation when ordering online. To get medical approval, consumers must have a short evaluation with a doctor, either online or at a clinic.\n\nUsers must give the medical reason for their use of cannabis, declare any pre-existing health conditions, confirm whether they\'ve used cannabis before and state their preferred method of ingestion.\n\nCustomers can then choose from six different cannabis boxes, ranging in price from $59 to $149, all of which come with a certificate of authenticity.\n\nCurrently, Trees only delivers to customers in the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nAlthough its proposed delivery method is nothing short of creative, Trees is not the first company to accept bitcoin payments for legal marijuana.\n\nIn April last year, the first marijuana vending machine in the US, was unveiled in the sate of Colorado.\n\nState regulation\n\nCalifornia was the first state to set a medical marijuana program, enacted by Proposition 215 in 1996 and Senate Bill 420 seven years later.\n\nThe Proposition, otherwise known as the Compassionate Use Act, approved by a majority vote, enabled cancer, AIDS and patients suffering from other chronic diseases to grow or obtain marijuana following recommendation by a licensed physician.\n\nAside from California and Colorado, medicinal cannabis is also legal in 21 other US states.\n\nMarijuana image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A person unfamiliar to bitcoin may have heard of it through a news channel in regards to drug trafficking, fraud, weapon sales. These are the things that must be avoided when speaking on Bitcoin. An unregulated currency has many benefits that should be discussed instead of the uses it has had by criminals. The benefits of Bitcoin — rather than the illegal activities it has been associated with — is what will be discussed in the ZapChain summit.

Yet, it continues to strive forward to be seen as an actual currency rather than a commodity by legal entities. Bitcoin has had to leave behind its largest exchange and drug marketplace to find a route to being considered a legal alternative to currency. However, we cannot eliminate the use of bitcoin in any of these situations — it is crucial to the bitcoin economy that they exist, just as with all other currencies.\n\nThis isn’t to say that bitcoin’s use for drugs and fraud is a good thing. However, one can’t deny that they helping bitcoin’s market cap to continue growing. A currency without a way to distribute it is no longer a currency, and darknet marketplaces have paved the way for a redistribution of bitcoin. Finally, we arrive a stage where we can leave all of the illicit uses of bitcoin behind us to concentrate on its legal uses and the financial implications it could have on an international scale. From financial institutions to state laws, Bitcoin is having a massive effect on the way we live our lives, and ZapChain is trying to demonstrate this through its live discussion.

In fact, the Bitcoin blockchain represents the first solid, working implementation of distributed consensus – for the first time, everyone can agree on what transactions took place, and who owns what, because everything is recorded on a tamper-proof public ledger that doesn’t need a central server and can’t be controlled by any central authority.\n\nOf course, that is precisely the reason why the authorities and the banks don’t like Bitcoin. Today, governments and financial institutions recognize that the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin can offer huge cost savings, efficiency, and operational benefits to financial systems – distributed ledger technology could save banks $15 billion-$20 billion per annum by 2022 according to a recent Santander Innoventures report – but it’s in the nature of power to oppose what it can’t control.\n\nThe two Accenture representatives offer their solution: “To be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus.”\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin should disappear and be replaced by a closed blockchain. The new blockchain proposed by the Accenture writers is not “permissionless” like the Bitcoin blockchain, where everyone can download the software and participate without asking anyone’s permission, but a “permissioned” blockchain restricted to vetted participants.\n\nNew York Times technology and finance reporter Nathaniel Popper, author of “Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money,” noted that a permissioned blockchain could be jointly run by the computers of the largest banks and serve as the backbone for a new, instant payment system without a single point of failure. The new blockchain, decentralized but closed, would offer the benefits of the current Bitcoin network without relying on end-users for its operations.\n\nOf course, the governments and the banks tend to enthusiastically support the idea of a permissioned blockchain without the troublesome bitcoin. But the Bitcoin system works, and the features that the Accenture writers propose to eliminate could be the very features that make it work. Other solutions to the issues mentioned by the Accenture writers, for example Lightning Networks, could be more effective.\n\nPhoto Michael Gray / Flickr', 'George Galloway wants to use the blockchain software that underpins bitcoin to keep track of the Mayor of London\'s spending.\n\nGalloway, who is famous for his far-left views as well as pretending to be a cat on Celebrity Big Brother, is running for Mayor of London next year. The former MP, who lost his seat for the Respect Party in May\'s election, is running as an independent.\n\nOne of his key pledges is to run the capital\'s £17 billion ($26.4 billion) budget on a software known as MayorsChain, Finextra reports.\n\nThe software will keep track of public spending and let anyone see what\'s being spent where.\n\nIt will be built on the blockchain, the software that underpins bitcoin. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records and enables bitcoin transactions to take place. It is completely transparent, prevents money being over-spent or double-spent, and is much quicker than traditional finance.\n\nBlockchain technology also has the potential to be cheaper than traditional methods and Galloway reckons he can save 5% of the budget, or £9 million ($14 million), using this technology.\n\nThe MayorsChain website says: ""Each London resident can then propose cost savings per item, again in a publicly visible manner. There will be a process for the Council to consider these suggestions and, if adopted, the changes will be recorded on the Mayor’s Chain.""\n\nGalloway is also running a crowdfunding campaign for his Mayoral bid and on the funding page he is quoted as saying: ""Now, for the first time, the radically disruptive technology of block chains can provide a technological backbone for true, 100 percent transparency. Political accountability, it seems, is about to take on a whole new meaning.""\n\nGalloway has developed MayorsChan with Max Keiser, an American entrepreneur-turned-broadcaster who hosts a financial TV programme on Russian state broadcaster RT. Keiser is an economic advisor to Galloway and a long-time supporter of cyrptocurrencies — last year he launched his own digital currency, MaxCoin.\n\nAs revolutionary as all this sounds, the chances of us getting MayorsChain aren\'t great. Galloway\'s odds of being elected next year range from 20 to 40/1, according to OddsChecker.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', '2015 is a Shemitah year leading many analysts to claim the remainder of the year could hold great volatility in the political and economic arenas. Shemitah predictions entail major implications for the future Bitcoin price, with some claiming $2 million Bitcoin due to the dislocations.\n\nIn a recent video, “SHEMITAH EXPOSED: Financial Crisis Planned For September 2015” (see video below), Dollar Vigilante Editor-in-Chief Jeff Berwick predicts major dislocations as early as this fall. These, according to the founder of Canadian financial website Stockhouse, could have major implications for the Bitcoin price.\n\nThe video has more than 300,000 views on YouTube, one of his most popular video to date. Author of the Austrian Economics newsletter providing insight into the global economic crisis and expatriation, Berwick recommended in 2011 to look into bitcoin as a means of diversifying an investment portfolio.\n\n“I predicted at that time that we had five and no more than ten years until a complete collapse of the financial and monetary systems,” Berwick tells CCN.\n\n“We began talking about bitcoin at $3 in 2011 and still to this day, 99% of financial newsletters don’t even mention it or if they do it is to be negative about it,” Berwick says. “We’ve always been ahead of the curve and I think our prediction for some market or political calamity this fall will again show we are ahead of the curve and unafraid to say it.” Berwick is confident because of his research into the Shemitah Calendar, something many online personalities, from various niches, cite as a historically accurate indicator of major change.\n\n“Off the top of my head, the most noticeable Shemitah year took place in 1973,” Berwick says. “In March 1973, the G–10 approved an arrangement wherein six members of the European Community tied their currencies together and jointly floated against the US dollar.” The changes laid the groundwork for coming economic crises, according to Berwick.\n\n“The decision effectively signaled the abandonment of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in favor of the current system of floating exchange rates. It also delinked gold completely from backing the US dollar,” Berwick says. He thinks there is a pattern to be studied.\n\nThe evidence I’ve uncovered seems to point to major market crises on many of the past Shemitahs for the last century. And most interestingly, the two biggest market crashes in history on the exact date of the last day of the Shemitah in 2001 and 2008.\n\nAccording to Berwick, the Shemitah cycle has been vaguely known by many on Wall Street as the “seven-year cycle.” Berwick believes he recently uncovered exact Shemitah dates which uncover something more about the theory.\n\n“It’s more than just a cycle,” he says.\n\nIn some Shemitah circles, every 49 years (7X7) the biggest dislocations come due, similar to Kondratiev economic cycle of 53-54 year cycles. These, also known as supercycles, great surges, long waves or the long economic cycle, are essentially a cycle-like pattern in the modern world economy. Statistical evidence from academia on the phenomenon is scant.\n\n“1917 was a Shemitah year and also the year that the US entered World War I, ending with the destruction of numerous empires,” Berwick says. “1938 was a Shemitah year and also the first year that Germany began foreign aggression and seized Austria and Czechoslovakia and that World War ended almost on the exact final day of the Shemitah in 1945.” Due to Shemitah fallout, Christian radio host Jim Paris has predicted $2 million Bitcoin.\n\n“Those people have one-upped me on my largest prediction. I said that it was totally possible for bitcoin to be worth $1 million, in today’s dollars, within this decade if everything that I suspect to happen happens,” Berwick says.\n\n“Of course, there are plenty of caveats on that, and I am not suggesting it will happen, only that it is possible,” adds Berwick.\n\nOf course if Bitcoin goes to a level worth $1 million in today’s dollars we’ll be living in a completely different world than we live in today.\n\nEven if Bitcoin remained outside of the dominant financial system, would it be affected by Shemitah? What’s most important for Berwick is what happened during the Cyprus and Greek financial crises.\n\n“In both cases a country in the Eurozone was essentially bankrupt, the banks closed, and there was a lot of fear,” Berwick says. “This should have spiked gold and silver higher but in both cases gold and silver either stayed flat (Cyprus) or went down (Greece).” Bitcoin reacted differently.\n\n“During the Cyprus crisis, Bitcoin rose from $35 to $150. And during the Greece crisis, still ongoing, it rose from $220 to over $300,” Berwick notes. “This shows me that Bitcoin is an excellent speculative store of value outside of even gold and silver and cannot be manipulated so easily.”\n\nNumerous countries worldwide currently endure economic and political stability. China – the second largest stock market in the world – experienced mini-crashes to the downside, Greece was unable to pay lenders, Puerto Rico has postured towards the same, and shelves are empty in the grocery stores of Venezuela. Berwick sees this as symptomatic of the changes his recent Shemitah video highlights.\n\n“I can barely keep track of all the black swans that pop up in the sky everyday now,” Berwick says. “There are so many the sky has gone pitch black. This smells, looks and feels just like 2007… and everyday more-so.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
