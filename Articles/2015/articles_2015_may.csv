05/01/2015,"[""Leading a US$50 million investment round, Goldman Sachs has shown that it finds Boston-based Circle Internet Financial, Inc.'s global vision promising. Managing Director Tom Jessop — who heads the firm’s Principal Strategic Investments Group to focus on strategic investments within the financial technology (FinTech) industry — stated:\n\n“We think that Circle’s product vision and exceptional management team present a compelling opportunity in the digital payments space.”\n\nTo support its vision of expansion, Circle has introduced a feature that allows its users to “hold, send, and receive US dollars as well as bitcoin — instantly, securely and with no fees.” In an attempt to rid users from the risk of price volatility, the feature allows them to pay bitcoin merchants without holding any bitcoins. The users can now convert bitcoins to US dollars that are FDIC insured, and use them to pay merchants.\n\nThe new feature is very similar to that of OKLink, a new wallet product of the largest bitcoin exchange in China, OKCoin. Currently a beta version, the new platform of the Chinese bitcoin exchange allows its users to spend Chinese yuan, U.S. Dollars and bitcoins to pay bitcoin merchants by converting the fiat currencies to bitcoin at point of sale.\n\nCircle explained their similar feature, saying:\n\n“This way, customers can choose to view Bitcoin not as a new currency to replace the dollar, but as an Internet payment network that enables secure, instant, global and nearly free payments.”\n\nOKCoin described OKLink, in an official statement released on April 22, as “the first Superwallet utilizing the Bitcoin protocol” and they believe that “it will have a positive impact on today’s financial landscape.”\n\nChinese mobile payments service Alipay has been overtaking global payment processing platforms like Paypal. According to a report from Business Insider, Alipay processed nearly US$150 billion in mobile transactions in 2013.\n\nAllaire described China as “an extremely attractive market in terms of consumer behavior and in terms of scale,” highlighting the Chinese government’s desire to develop an economy that is led by consumers who spend their money globally.\n\nJeremy Allaire, the founder of Circle, Inc., explained in the company’s official blog that the strategic investment of the aforementioned investors will help Circle to “continue building a new kind of global consumer finance company.”\n\nIn accordance with the funding round, Circle plans to bring its services and products to China, with the help of China-based IDG Capital Partners. Circle will add Chinese yuan to the platform in order to allow users to “transact both locally and across the globe more freely and more securely than has ever before been possible.”\n\nCircle, a bitcoin-focused consumer finance company that raised US$26 million in its previous rounds, completed the new funding round that was co-led by Goldman Sachs and IDG Capital Partners, who are joined by their previous investors, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Accel Partners, Oak Investment Partners, Fenway Summer, Digital Currency Group, Pantera Capital and strategic individuals.\n\nAlthough the funding round is the first bitcoin-related strategic investment from Goldman Sachs, the multinational firm has shown hints of interests for bitcoin since late 2013, after one director, M. Michele Burns, joined Circle’s board.\n\nWith its investment in Circle, Goldman Sachs shows that it sees a promising future in the company, and in the digital currency space overall, and that it feels confident in “transforming global markets through technical innovation.”"", 'At the recent Inside Bitcoins conference in New York, Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX:GBTC) Creator Barry Silbert sat down with American Banker Editor-in-chief Marc Hochstein to discuss the ongoing debate between bitcoin (the currency) and blockchain technology. Silbert is behind the first publicly-traded bitcoin fund in existence, so it’s clear that he sees potential in bitcoin as an investment. There has been a lot of discussion around the idea of taking certain aspects of bitcoin and using it to improve the legacy financial system without creating an entirely new currency; however, Silbert — and many others in the bitcoin community — believe that you can’t have the full benefits of bitcoin without also using the underlying token in the system.\n\nAlso Read: Barry Silbert Plans to Have Bitcoin Fund Traded on NASDAQ or NYSE\n\nBlockchain good, bitcoin bad?\n\nAfter Silbert provided a quick update on the status of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, Hochstein decided to ask the bitcoin investor about the idea of using blockchain technology without the underlying bitcoin currency. Do we really need a new currency for the technology to work? Hochstein noted that Silbert seems to be more interested in the currency aspect of bitcoin, and Silbert responded:\n\n“For all of the reasons why the blockchain is exciting and has the potential to change the world, it’s really only possible because it’s secure — it has the capacity to process large amounts of transactions. The only reason it’s secure and has that capacity is because there’s a bunch of miners around the world that are dedicating energy, money, and time to mine bitcoin. The reason why they’re doing it is not because they’re good citizens; they’re doing it because they want to make money. And they make money by receiving bitcoin through rewards and transaction fees, so if you eliminate the money making opportunity from mining you’re [not going to have the proper incentives to secure the blockchain].”\n\nIt should be noted that Silbert’s argument may not apply to all use cases of a blockchain. As the Bitcoin 2.0 panel noted the previous day at the same conference, “the blockchain isn’t for everything.” Companies and organizations that are not worried about complete decentralization and censorship resistance may decide to opt for more-centralized approaches such as the offerings from Hyperledger and Eris Industries.\n\n.@barrysilbert says big banks will be promoting themselves as digital currency friendly banks in the future at @InsideBitcoins #BitcoinConf — Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) April 29, 2015\n\nThe narrative is changing from blockchain to bitcoin\n\nSilbert also addressed bitcoin’s evolving narrative. His explanation of how the ways people view bitcoin and blockchain technology will change is quite similar to the path that many individuals go down when getting hooked on researching bitcoin in the first place:\n\n“If I was going to guess, we’re probably six to twelve months away from the narrative going from — well again, before it was tulip bubble, crazy cryptoanarchists, and silicon valley types. [Today, it’s] interesting technology, who needs the currency. Six or twelve months [from now] it will be great technology, really interesting currency. And then the debate is going to be, ‘Is it bitcoin or something else?’”\n\nThe banks will figure out that they need bitcoin\n\nA final point that Silbert made on the use of bitcoin or blockchain technology by large financial institutions was that it may take some time for banks to figure out that bitcoin is the right solution. This is no different from companies and organizations from other industries that are looking at how they can take advantage of blockchain technology; some are sticking with bitcoin, while others have decided to create their own altcoin or a completely new blockchain. Silbert explained:\n\n“The more time you spend with the banks — which is quite a bit of time — they’ve all come to the conclusion that this is the future. They’ve all come to the conclusion that the future of clearing and settlement, the future of trading is something — whether it’s bitcoin or something else, that’s the way the future is going to process transactions. And my opinion is that it’s going to be bitcoin. They may try to do their own thing, [and] there’s lots of [those kinds of] efforts [already] underway. It’s going to take them awhile to figure that out, but from a narrative perspective, I’d much rather have it where it is today rather than where it was two or three months ago.”\n\nIt’s clear that Silbert sees bitcoin as the correct option for banks who are interested in blockchain technology, but there are plenty of other thinkers and researchers in the space, such as Hyperledger’s Tim Swanson, who would disagree with that premise. Swanson recently wrote a report (PDF warning) on “permissioned distributed ledgers”, and he feels that many banks could move away from bitcoin due to the simple fact that they may not have a need for complete decentralization.\n\nYou can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.', 'Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at global bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.\n\nEver-hungry for product launches and splashy funding rounds, the mainstream media was sent into a frenzy this week as Circle announced the closure of its $50m round and Coinbase confirmed it was expanding across the pond to the UK.\n\nDespite seemingly good news for the bitcoin ecosystem, misreporting – and inaccuracies – featured across outlets. Meanwhile, some journalists also questioned the need for substantial funding rounds, given that some startups were not highly concerned with return of investment (ROI).\n\nCoinDesk takes a look at this week\'s top bitcoin-related headlines.\n\nMisreporting on the money\n\nAn investment bank like Goldman Sachs pouring money into a bitcoin company was always going to capture the media\'s attention, as such investments legitimise the currency in the eyes of naysayers.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that a quick Google news search featuring the words \'bitcoin\' and \'Goldman Sachs\' brought up over 90 news articles since the announcement was published yesterday.\n\nThe New York Observer\'s Jack Smith IV wrote a piece titled It\'s Happening: Goldman Sachs Just Dropped $50 Million Into a Bitcoin Startup, with \'Bitcoin fanatics always knew this day would come\' as a somewhat sensationalist sub-heading.\n\nSmith began his article noting:\n\n""It was only last year that Goldman Sachs was telling investors that bitcoin wasn\'t safe store of value. Looks like they\'ve come around.""\n\nWell, the mega investment bank published a report that claimed that bitcoin could shape the future of finance just last month.\n\nWith regards to the $50m claim, no one can deny Sachs\' involvement but, as reported by CoinDesk, Boston-based Circle also drew support from investors such as China-based IDG Capital Partners, as well as an existing pool, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners and Accel Partners.\n\nIn this instance, it seems that the Observer\'s headline is somewhat misleading.\n\nWall Street piqued by bitcoin\n\nShelly Banjo\'s Quartz piece is a more elaborate – and accurate – exposé.\n\nWith the headline Goldman Sachs is parking millions in a bitcoin business with no pressing plans to make money, Banjo nods to the sentiment that some companies in the bitcoin ecosystem are conducting large funding rounds without launching revolutionary – or profitable – products.\n\nBanjo noted:\n\n""Allaire [Jeremy] would not disclose any details of its business model with Quartz, explaining that the company is not concerned with making money.""\n\nAccording to the piece, serial entrepreneur Allaire is planning on monetising in the future, but at the moment his main concern is building ""a big enough social network"".\n\nAs for Goldman Sach\'s involvement, Banjo quite rightly pointed out that this ""seems to be in keeping with the threat that fast-growing mobile payment companies pose to traditional banks"".\n\nBanks are increasingly paying attention to blockchain technology, but remaining exceedingly tight lipped – some may say cautious – about bitcoin.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\'s Paul Vigna frames Wall Street\'s growing interest in the technology rather poetically with his piece Goldman Sachs, Like Others on the Street, Dips a Toe in Bitcoin.\n\nHe said:\n\n""If you haven\'t heard it yet, Wall Street\'s interest has been piqued by bitcoin.""\n\nBitcoin \'anarchy\'\n\nDeprived from relatively exciting announcements or product launches for most of last week, media outlets also jumped at the chance to cover Coinbase\'s expansion to the UK.\n\nThe move by the San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange follows the UK Treasury\'s announcement that it plans to regulate the digital currency following the election.\n\nWriting for The Guardian, Alex Hern, noted:\n\n""But while the cryptocurrency, with its pseudonymous aspects and anti-state roots, is popular amongst the darker side of the finance world, there are many players who want to bring it into the light. Coinbase is the biggest.""\n\nAnother example of how reporters are still talking about bitcoin as something that is continuously embroiled with the darker, less desirable, more illicit spectrum of finance.\n\nDespite this, just this week we saw how bitcoin was being used to rally funds for Nepal\'s Earthquake appeal, testament to the currency\'s use-case in the aftermath of a natural disaster, but also an example of how it can revolutionise the world of micropayments.\n\nNewspaper image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Dubbed AB-1326 Virtual Currency, the legislation is now headed to the appropriations committee before reaching a vote on the assembly floor.\n\nAlso Read: California Bitcoin Bill May Pose Problems For Startups\n\nThe bill would make it a crime in California to operate a virtual currency business without first registering with the commissioner of business oversight, satisfying all requirements, and paying an application fee of $5,000. Businesses must also file audits and reports to the commissioner multiple times a year in order to prove solvency and know-your-customer records.\n\nAB-1326 was first submitted to the California legislature on February 27 by assemblymember Matt Dababneh, a democrat from the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. On March 23 the bill was referred to the committee on banking and finance, where Dababneh also serves as chair. It was amended and re-referred to the same committee again on April 21.\n\nThe bill was approved this past Tuesday with a vote of 8-2, and now it’s headed to the appropriations committee for another review. This extra step is common for “all bills with any fiscal impact,” according to the committee website. If they approve the bill, it will reach an official vote on the California assembly floor. After that, it will also need to be passed by the state senate and signed by Governor Brown before becoming law.\n\nExtensive Regulations on Cryptocurrency Business in California\n\nAB-1326 is a comprehensive piece of legislation that would place strict requirements on businesses in the digital currency space, not unlike the BitLicense being crafted by New York’s department of financial services. But in contrast to that regulatory effort, the California law is moving through the traditional legislature by attempting to modify the state’s Money Transmission Act.\n\nIt broadly defines a “virtual currency business” as any activity involving the storage of digital currency on behalf of others; the exchange of fiat money for digital currency and vice versa; and even the exchange of one type of digital currency for another. It applies to all businesses and organizations who perform these activities in relation to a California resident.\n\nAmong the various rules contained in the bill, businesses must:\n\nPay a non-refundable $5,000 application fee to the department of business oversight (DBO)\n\nMaintain capital reserves of an arbitrary amount determined by the DBO commissioner\n\nVerify that all representatives and employees are of “good character and sound financial standing,” and keep records of these reviews for three years\n\nNot allow representatives or employees to conduct virtual currency business for outside, unlicensed parties\n\nBe aware that the DBO commissioner can examine the business or any branch office, even if outside California, at any time\n\nProvide any accounts, books, correspondence, memoranda, papers, and other records at the DBO commissioner’s request\n\nNotify the DBO within five days in the case of bankruptcy filing; felony charges against a manager, director or executive officer; or other major legal developments related to the business\n\nRetain all records relating to compliance with this license for at least three years\n\nFile an annual audit report to the commissioner within 90 days of the fiscal year-end\n\nFile quarterly reports detailing balance sheets, income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’ equity\n\nThe DBO commissioner can take punitive action — including a $1,000 fine per day — against any virtual currency business deemed to be in violation of these rules, even if that business has not applied for a license. This gives California a large amount of regulatory authority over such organizations, regardless of whether they have the ability or desire to comply with AB-1326.\n\nThere is no planned comment period for California residents or businesses to offer their thoughts on the bill. This stands in contrast to the situation in New York, where superintendent Ben Lawsky has offered multiple comment periods after various versions of the BitLicense. If the California legislature approves AB-1326 and Governor Brown signs it, the bill would become law overnight in America’s most populous state.\n\nCalifornia residents and businesses who would be affected by the bill, such as Coinbase in San Francisco, can contact their state assembly members in order to voice their thoughts before it reaches a vote.\n\nWould this law affect your decision to provide digital currency services in the state of California? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nPhoto Sources: Sacramento Bee, Twitter, Wired', '""If you would have explained Uber or Lyft five years ago, you would have had to explain it as digital hitchhiking, because that\'s what it was.""\n\nThat analogy, according to newly appointed MIT Digital Currency Initiative director Brian Forde, illustrates where bitcoin and the blockchain are today – struggling for a more colloquial definition that may only come when the technology delivers a consumer experience that communicates its societal value.\n\nUber and Lyft, he noted, have since gone on to build a trusted system of background checks, ratings and payments that mainstreamed their services into culturally acceptable modes of transportation.\n\nThe Digital Currency Initiative finds the Massachusetts Institute of Technology seeking an active role in this transition process for digital currencies. As laid out in the group\'s introductory blog post, the program has three goals: to engage students in research around key issues, convene stakeholders in discussions regarding the technology and provide a catalyst for unbiased research.\n\nIn a new interview, Forde sought to expand on these efforts, unpacking some of the perhaps denser terminology in the group\'s launch messaging. For example, Forde elaborated on how he sees the Digital Currency Initiative addressing areas of high social impact under his leadership.\n\nPut more simply, Forde suggested that bitcoin is likely to have use cases that, while potentially beneficial to millions globally, won\'t or shouldn\'t generate the investment return to attract venture capital.\n\nForde went on to indicate that MIT, through its own work and collaboration with international universities, would be able to leverage such connections to foster an environment where stakeholders can come together to discuss and expand these solutions.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""It\'s hard today for a cryptocurrency startup to approach a federal, state or local government or international organization and say \'Do I have a solution for you\', and for them to say \'Yes, I fully understand cryptocurrency, think it will solve all of my transaction-based problems and I will buy your solution tomorrow.\'""\n\nMIT, Forde explained, will aim to facilitate the research that can identify opportunities and provide a meeting place where stakeholders can engage in talks that pave the way for development.\n\n""This is an emerging technology and our focus at MIT is to help mainstream it in a way that it will have the impact that\'s projected onto it,"" Forde said.\n\nEmerging technology\n\nThough arguably the first step from the academic community to play a serious role in the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem, Forde sought to stress that digital currencies are not the first emerging technology to receive support from MIT.\n\nIn particular, Forde cited the Center for Bits and Atoms and its role in helping mature the conversation surrounding 3-D printing by pioneering the concept of a makerspace, an interactive environment where newcomers can create with the technology.\n\nForde\'s own background includes other emerging technologies that were successfully mainstreamed.\n\nAs the president and co-founder of early voice over IP (VoIP) startup Llamadas S.A., Forde helped turn what was then an emerging technology unknown to the public into a thriving business in what he called ""the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere"".\n\n""It wasn\'t legal and it wasn\'t illegal, it was just new,"" Forde says, inferring a sentiment often expressed about bitcoin.\n\nThis experience led to a position at the White House, where he specialized in helping the Obama administration identify new beneficial technologies. It was there, Forde said, where he was first asked to conduct research on bitcoin and the blockchain, and where he gained a new toolset that he believes will allow him to help conversation around digital currency mature.\n\nForde said he has been interested in bitcoin for a few years, first encountering the technology at Singularity University, a Silicon Valley think tank and incubator.\n\nFalse narratives\n\nDuring the interview, Forde spoke out about what he characterized as an unhealthy culture that pervades the digital currency community whereby individuals will be judged based on the length of time in which they\'ve been involved.\n\n""I think we\'re at a point where we need to get beyond asking the question \'When did you start using bitcoin?\' because you don\'t ask people when they started using the Internet as a proxy for their capacity to make an impact, and I think that creates a culture of exclusion that\'s the opposite of what we want to do,"" he said.\n\nForde went on to suggest that bitcoin stakeholders should be more welcoming to newcomers who might be able to add new value and perspective that can help move the technology forward.\n\n""I think bitcoin needs more diversity, not less, and when we frame questions that way, it gives the impression to people who are curious about it and have significant value to add that you aren\'t going to be as welcome as if you were in it from the beginning, and I don\'t think that\'s true,"" he continued.\n\nOverall, he called for a culture of positivity that can help the technology move past issues such as the collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox and online black market Silk Road.\n\nSerious questions\n\nSuch a future will require more than dialogue, however. On that front, Forde suggests the best way for MIT to be involved is engage its faculty and students about the technology.\n\nForde suggested that he would encourage exploration that would explore bitcoin\'s scalability, security, stability and privacy, but cautioned that, by nature of the initiative, he wasn\'t able to offer any specifics.\n\n""I think specifically saying the exact research topics we\'re going to focus on would be premature and irresponsible. What we are doing is conducting a comprehensive review of the research that has been done to see where there are opportunities for us to make a valuable contribution to the community,"" he said.\n\nSo far, Forde reports that MIT has received ""hundreds of emails"" and that the university is indexing these comments so that data can be presented to core developers, faculty and students about the state of bitcoin research.\n\n\'Neutral\' approach\n\nThough MIT\'s goal will be to help ""mainstream"" the technology, Forde also discussed how the university will strive to take a neutral approach to this goal, defining what he believes maintaining neutrality would mean.\n\n""The academic setting allows for professors and students, who don\'t have necessarily a financial interest in cryptocurrency startups, to look it from as neutral a perspective as they may, from as honest as a perspective as they can,"" he remarked.\n\nForde acknowledged that this doesn\'t mean that private companies and venture capitalists wouldn\'t continue research, but that MIT\'s work would perhaps have ""less of an angle"", and by extension, provide perhaps more factual guideposts for those looking to learn or engage with bitcoin.\n\nForde added:\n\n""I think that, in collaboration with other universities, our faculty and our grad students can provide the necessary research that helps mainstream the technology because of the neutrality and the credibility that those respected professionals bring to the table.""\n\nGovernment impact\n\nThough he stressed the Digital Currency Initiative would be driven by those who engage with it, Forde demonstrated a personal interest in how bitcoin and the blockchain could be used to improve governments, perhaps owing to his background as a White House advisor.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that it will be some time before governments are comfortable using bitcoin or similar implementations, noting how many are still in the process of shifting toward cloud computing, for example.\n\n""To think they\'ll be on cryptocurrencies tomorrow is a bit of a misnomer,"" he stated. ""Having said that, there is an opportunity to collaborate with them early on and help them become part of that process. You can do that at a university where you can incubate that idea to think about how this plays out and get everyone comfortable with the technology.""\n\nIn particular, Forde evoked the idea of what he called ""the rubber stamp authentication protocol"", the idea that governments still use ink-and-paper solutions to make important decisions.\n\n""The rubber stamp authentication protocol is, \'Did you get that stamped? Did you make a copy of your driver\'s license to prove your identity? All of these things are forgeable,"" he explained.\n\nHe added that he sees opportunities for the blockchain and bitcoin to help underscore solutions to these longstanding issues.\n\nHowever, the actual development will be driven by students, who will come to MIT Media Lab for ideas that will become theses, some of which will then be commercialized by nonprofits or interested stakeholders.\n\nOverall, he sought to dispel the idea that governments are slow to adapt to technology or are unable to comprehend compelling new solutions. Rather, he said he hopes that digital currencies might help governments upgrade for the 21st century, a development he framed as beneficial for constituents as well.\n\nForde concluded:\n\n""I think cryptocurrency can help play a role in that technology stack.""\n\nImage credit: EQRoy / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

With this initiative, Tsinghua University joins MIT and technology giants IBM and Samsung as one of the world’s major institutions conducting research and development of blockchain technology, decentralized systems and digital assets.\n\nFounded in 1911, Tsinghua University is one of the nine elite Chinese universities, and it is considered the top institution of higher learning in mainland China alongside Peking University. It describes itself as being dedicated to academic excellence, the wellbeing of Chinese society and global development. Often described as “the MIT of China,” Tsinghua was regarded as the top Chinese university by the 2015 Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, where it was ranked 26th globally.\n\nThe PBC School of Finance at Tsinghua University was founded in 2012, as a joint venture between the University and the People’s Bank of China (PBC), with the mission of promoting excellence in the finance industry and financial regulation through top-notch education and cutting-edge research. In partnership with the central bank and national financial regulators, the PBC School of Finance established the National Institute of Financial Research (NIFR), with the mission of doing top-class research on financial reform and development, and providing policy analysis and advice for financial policymakers and regulators.\n\nHuobi is China’s leading Bitcoin company. With financial backing from Silicon Valley investment firm Sequoia Capital, Huobi operates a Bitcoin exchange and provides services to individual and institutional clients. With a 16.34 market share, the Huobi Bitcoin exchange is one of the most active in the world.\n\nPBC School of Finance Dean Liao Li, PBC School of Finance Vice President and Deputy Party Secretary Zhao Cen, Huobi founder and CEO Li Lin, and other leaders attended the Digital Assets Research Initiative launch event. Li Lin and Liao Li each gave a speech, and Vice President Zhao Cen signed an agreement formalizing the university’s long-term cooperation with Huobi.\n\nThe work of the Digital Assets Research Initiative will be jointly conducted by finance and technology experts from Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance and Huobi. It will be hosted at the Tsinghua PBC School’s Internet Finance Research Lab and Huobi will be the official sponsor of the program.\n\nThere are evident parallels between Tsinghua University’s Digital Assets Research Initiative and the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, recently launched by the MIT Media Lab to address some of the most critical challenges to creating a safe, stable and secure digital currency and directed by former White House senior adviser for mobile and data innovation Brian Forde. In both cases, a prestigious university with strong ties with the nation’s technical, financial and political establishments takes the lead in the digital currency space, with funding coming partly from the private sector.\n\nIt’s important to note that, as revealed by Goldman Sachs’ recent report about the future of money, 80 percent of bitcoin volume is exchanged into and out of Chinese yuan. Therefore, the Digital Assets Research Initiative could influence the positions of the Chinese government on bitcoin and digital currencies.\n\n“Contrary to commonly held belief, the regulatory environment for operating a Bitcoin business in China is actually more accommodating than the United States,” said Huobi product manager Robert Kuhne in a recent interview on CoinReport. “It can’t be said with absolute certainty what the Chinese government policy will be in the future. It is likely that the government will not do anything until Bitcoin grows significantly. Today, Bitcoin’s total global value is a $4 billion U.S. dollars. This does not appear on the radar of Beijing bureaucrats who are responsible for managing the world’s second-largest economy.”', 'Imagine yourself as a first-time homebuyer. You’re about to write the biggest check of your life for the down payment, not to mention taking on a monster loan. You have no idea who you can trust—from agent to lawyer to inspector—or what the process should be. And the list of—let’s face it—crappy experiences on the road to homeownership goes on. Must this meaningful life event be riddled with stress and anxiety from the get-go? It doesn’t have to be.\n\nadvertisement\n\nReal estate tops the list of industries that block chain could disrupt. Insert block chains: a relatively new and promising technology that could transform the way we digitally exchange value, similarly to how Internet protocols, like TCP/IP, transformed the way we exchanged information. For example, to transfer ownership of a home today, there are countless checks of authenticity and intermediaries involved to insure the transfer is legitimate. By using a distributed database (a.k.a. “a block chain,” the same technology behind Bitcoin) to prove authenticity, we could legitimately transfer ownership immediately without the need of a middleman. In fact, when we think about block-chain technology and the industries it could disrupt, real estate tops the list. While Trulia, Redfin, Angie’s List and others have brought some transparency to the opaque world of home buying and home ownership, most of our experiences in this industry are fraught with incomplete, inaccurate, and asymmetric information. Let’s play out one fundamental difference between today’s environment and a future with block chains: Houses in the future could not only have physical addresses but also digital ones. Why? Because we live in a connected world of smart things, and it’s inevitable that houses will collect and store a tremendous amount of information about themselves and their relationships. For example, imagine the house being able to answer: •Who is my owner?\n\n•Who are my inhabitants?\n\n•Who are my caretakers (eg. housecleaner, landscaper, plumber) and what is their reputation with me?\n\n•When was my HVAC system last serviced? When is the next service?\n\n•How much electricity am I using? What’s my billing history? Am I late?\n\n•Am I currently owner-occupied, rented, for sale, or vacant? With this fundamental shift in mind, let’s see how it might feel to buy and own a house with a digital address on the block chain. 1. Searching for your perfect home.\n\nIt’s Sunday afternoon, and you’re at your fifth open house of the day. Turns out that the house is amazing! It’s exactly what you want and the location is dead centered in your search area. Before you get too excited, you dig in to learn more.\n\nToday, the sources for this information are disparate and incomplete, so you’d have to make lots of assumptions. But with block chains, houses could have their own digital identities, so could can easily look up their complete history including the chain of ownership, laundry list of repairs, and projected costs associated with owning and running the home.\n\nadvertisement\n\n2. Making the offer to purchase.\n\nSatisfied that there are no skeletons in the closets and the finances are within your reach, you and your partner decide to go ahead and submit an offer to buy the house. You’ve been pre-approved for a loan based on your reputational credit score, which instead of using centralized credit bureaus, uses your block chain–based identity and proven financial history to instantly demonstrate your financial health. Time to put the wheels in motion.\n\nThe offer experience is entirely digital in contrast to today’s experience of endless paper documents and signatures. As part of your offer, you’ve included conditional payments to avoid the awkwardness and hassle of negotiation based on inspection results. For example, you will pay for half of any repairs needed to bring the HVAC or plumbing systems into good working order; the other half will be due from the seller.\n\n\n\n3. Getting an inspection and moving through the timeline.\n\nGreat news: your offer has been accepted! Now the experience begins to unfold. The buying timeline is your guide for what’s next.\n\nIn addition to pulling in data from your offer, your timeline aggregates a list of the most common events that occur in your neighborhood between offers and closings, and knowing what to expect helps alleviate anxiety, especially if you’re a first-time homebuyer. 4. Making cosmetic improvements and moving in.\n\nThe rest of the process is fairly painless, and just six weeks later you’re the proud owner of your first home. But before you settle in, you want to update a few things that might make a bit of a mess. You hire an electrician to install recessed lighting in the living room and kitchen. The electrician has done two prior jobs on the house and about 25 in the immediate area—he’s built a great reputation. Because the house is always collecting funds for known bills, it still has $2,700 paid by the previous owner that is now available to you. Since the down payment cleaned out your cash reserves for the moment, you’ll use some of these funds to pay the electrician.\n\n5. Becoming part of your neighborhood.\n\nNow that you’re settled in, you start participating in your new neighborhood. Just as houses are part of a physical community, their block chain–based digital identity is part of a community as well—one that can much more effectively coordinate and operate as an aligned group.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTurns out there’s a property on the main street nearby that’s just been vacated, and there are three different proposals for how it could be used. The landlord pushes the proposals out to the neighborhood network to gather feedback and get assessed.\n\n6. Working together with your community.\n\nOver time, houses can work together for better community outcomes. It turns out that there hasn’t been much rain in your area over the past year, and there’s a severe drought. The local government wants to avoid imposing water bans. Instead, they decide to structure smart incentives for each zip code in the town. They offer to rebate 10 percent of the total neighborhood water bill next quarter if total water use can be cut by at least 25 percent. Because each house knows its water use relative to others, they can collectively optimize to get to an overall 25 percent reduction. A home that uses water for low priority needs like watering the lawn could receive a large part of the incentive for reducing their use significantly. In contrast, a home that uses very little can still benefit from a small part of the incentive without reducing their use by much at all. No one house can reach the incentive target alone, so they’re better off banding together and optimizing as a community.\n\nAs a designer who has recently bought a home, I’d love to see this future begin to unfold. Block chains could create fundamental changes that would transform everyday real estate transactions. My colleagues and I have written about five opportunity areas where block chains could create better experiences for people, ranging from peer-to-peer exchange to shared ownership. For home-buying, I’m particularly excited about these three: When we give homes identity and agency, we empower them to act on behalf of themselves. Peer-to-Peer Exchanges: In the real estate industry, we’re equally excited about new forms of exchange between people as exchange between non-human actors—homes themselves. When we give homes identity and agency, we empower them to act on behalf of themselves, their owners, and the neighborhood, making new forms of value exchange possible.\n\nadvertisement', ""CoinTelegraph spoke with Leon Li, CEO of Huobi — one of China’s ‘Big Three’ bitcoin exchanges — to discuss its new tool connecting bitcoin and the traditional stock market, why the Chinese yuan doesn’t actually comprise 80% of BTC trading, and how Beijing’s new policy is fostering Bitcoin startups in the country.\n\nBitcoin, China and the Stock Market Boom\n\nIn addition to Huobi’s recent partnership with “China’s MIT,” Tsinghua University, Li confirmed that the exchange is also looking for opportunities in the currently booming stock market and is launching a new trading platform named Caimao that will enable users to mortgage their bitcoin to borrow Chinese yuan, which are then used for trading shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index has more than doubled in the past 12 months, making it the hottest bull market in the world today, following Chinese monetary “easing” and the recently announced subsidies for FinTech (including Bitcoin) startups in the country.\n\nWhile there has been no new policy directed at Bitcoin in particular since December 2014, “the environment is actually very flexible,” explained Li. He added:\n\n“The Chinese government is giving a lot of leeway to bitcoin startups with their FinTech startup support initiative, which will have a positive effect on the industry and will add value to Bitcoin in China.”\n\nHowever, Li also added that they do not expect any new announcements from Beijing with respect to cryptocurrency and instead are keeping a close eye on American regulators, as Huobi expects “the situation in the U.S. will strongly influence Chinese policy.”\n\nMeanwhile, a significant fraction of its traders are “either already trading or want to trade in this stock market,” explained Huobi’s analyst Robert Kuhne. Thus, Caimao will serve as the “new bridge” between bitcoin and the conventional stock market.\n\nThe platform will work as follows:\n\nDeposit bitcoin to platform; Borrow up to 60% of CNY value of BTC deposits; Buy and sell shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange via Caimao; Pay back borrowed amount plus interest; Withdraw initial bitcoin deposit plus profits (or minus losses).\n\nThe platform has a “sophisticated” risk management system, which operates on the same basic principles as Huobi’s risk management for bitcoin margin trading and bitcoin futures. In other words, forced liquidations will automatically be triggered when necessary to ensure that a trader's losses never exceed the CNY value of the BTC deposit.\n\n“The key point of using this platform is that bitcoin holders who want to participate in the Chinese stock market can do so without having to cash out their bitcoin holdings,” added Kuhne. “There are many bitcoin holders who believe bitcoin will recover and make new highs in the future, so they do not want to sell at the current low price. But at the same time, the bull market in Chinese stocks is just too appealing to ignore.”\n\nIndeed, Li noted that his company is seeing a significant share of Bitcoin traders quitting as “everyone wants to jump in the booming stock market.”\n\nGoldman Sach’s 80% Statistic ‘Inaccurate’\n\nIn March, Goldman Sach’s released a report stating that approximately 80% of all BTC trading is conducted with the Chinese yuan. Li questioned this figure when asked about its accuracy.\n\n“It’s not the correct number because there are a lot of zero-transaction-fee trades being done on Chinese exchanges including high frequency trading,” explained Li. “The data was collected by Goldman Sach’s from different exchanges, but these exchanges gather statistics on their own without any third-party audit or verification, so we don’t know how accurate this number is.” He added:\n\n“The correct number should be around 40-50%. We believe this is a more accurate representation of BTC-CNY trading volume.”\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is no secret that China’s relationship with Bitcoin mainly revolves around mining and trading. With respect to bitcoin payments, Li reiterated that this was still prohibited in China, as was addressed in the aforementioned memo. However, trading is allowed, which explains why mining, investments and trading make up the largest share of bitcoin activity in the country, particularly when compared to neighboring nations, who are finding other use cases, such as remittances in the Philippines.\n\nIn fact, Huobi does not expect bitcoin payments to take off in China anytime soon, as the situation is “a lot different that in the U.S.,” where fiat transaction can incur significantly larger fees from third-party processors. Bitcoin payments in China, on the other hand, are not a good use case in the country, as popular services like Alipay (China’s PayPal equivalent) and Wechat offer zero fees for fiat payments, with China’s Central Bank (PBOC) serving as the clearing house.\n\nHuobi therefore expects China’s affinity for mining and trading to continue, along with the emergence of many new Bitcoin startups that will be fostered by the state. However, the Chinese Bitcoin community will be keeping a close eye on how cryptocurrency will be treated in the U.S., and in New York state (the BitLicense) in particular, to get an idea of what to expect from Chinese authorities in the future."", 'Through a partnership with Uruguay-based remittance company, More Money Transfers (MMT), Latin American Bitcoin exchange Bitex.la has 19 agents in Argentina and one in Chile who will now sell bitcoin.\n\nProviding services for the non- or underbanked in emerging markets has been regarded as a powerful use case for bitcoin, especially in Argentina. The country’s high inflation and strict economic controls have led many to believe bitcoin as currency and a payment network could succeed there.\n\nAccording to a company spokesman, Bitex.la had that in mind when they were planning the branches. The exchange currently allows people in numerous Latin American countries to buy bitcoin, but that requires a bank account. The new retail stores allow Argentina’s and Chile’s unbanked population to buy bitcoin with cash.\n\nOffline Then Online\n\nBitex.la says it has signed an exclusive agreement to use More Money Transfers’ large agent network in Latin America. More Money Transfers has agents in more than 13 Latin America countries and partners around the world.\n\nCustomers interested in buying bitcoin will first need to create a Bitex.la account online and go through the know-your-customer process. Once the account is activated, he or she can then go to one of the More Money Transfers branches with a valid ID and pesos. Fifteen minutes later, U.S. dollars will be credited to the user’s account and then he or she will be able to buy bitcoin online.\n\nCurrently there are More Money Transfers offices in Chile’s capital, Santiago, and in numerous Argentinian cities, including 12 in the nation’s capital, Buenos Aires. Bitex.la told Bitcoin Magazine they will expand to all of Latin America and that the service will be expanded to Uruguay, Peru and Brazil in the coming weeks.\n\nBitex.la said More Money Transfers is very supportive of Bitcoin, citing the company’s exclusive deal and further expansion as proof. More Money Transfers says it looks at digital currency as “near-future remittance technology.”\n\nLatin American Powerhouse\n\nBitex.la was founded in 2014 and quickly became a leader in Latin America’s digital currency industry. The company operates an online bitcoin exchange that is available in nearly every South American exchange and has partnered with AstroPay, one of the largest payments services in the region.\n\nIn May of last year, the exchange launched with a $2 million investment from an undisclosed U.K. firm. Later that year, the company bought regional digital currency exchange Conectabitcoin. The company has continued to run and grow the exchange as it seeks to bring bitcoin to Latin America.']"

We have picked 15 finalists that you can find below. The finalist with the most votes will win 1 bitcoin. We will pick a winner on Monday, max 1 vote per person.\n\n#1. Glutius (disqualified due to vote manipulation):\n\nLately my payment option had been limited and i had no means of payments. Then i won a small bet with someone and i earned my self about $20 worth of bitcoins, which i used the $13. With the $7 i had left, i gambled my self up to 2 bitcoins. After that, i started a small business which i will not go into, that has earned me even more in irl money. I am a 15 year old student and i can afford things people in my age would never imagine. Also it’s the only freedom i have. Also if you guys noticed Bitcoin is now a major currency, and by that i mean it’s been used everywhere. Major companies/shops such as Dell accepts bitcoins, even some embassies accept it as a mean of payment. #2. TuaPoma: Bitcoin to me means a mathematical truth, a clear and objective truth, which is not dependent on our arbitrary choice. By contrast the fiat money is a “relative truth”, a mere illusion! The Bitcoin came remind us that the truth does not change! Many ask me: who gave the first shot? Who is the initial cause? It’s a mystery to me, has not yet come in revelation. But what really matters is the encrypted evidence; a truth that does not change! Mathematics and God have always been in existence and so always will be, because mathematics is the language in which God has programmed everything in a rational way! Please do not forget, heaven and earth will pass away, and my words will not pass away. I’m talking about real freedom, you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. #3.

No matter how many times I got scammed but the uncertainty of the coin gave me so much profit that it agree me to invest all my earning.\n\nNowadays, Bitcoin is going down and down but I know it will pop up once again to show its really worth millions. I think I will live whole life using bitcoin and obviously die with them.\n\n#4. Occrest:\n\nBeing homeless, Bitcoin is to me a tool with which I can utilize on my way to financial freedom. I started out by hitting the faucets (gained some,) playing the altcoin markets (lost some) and have been cloud mining. It’s been an interesting adventure, and i get a small sense of wonder when i realize that I am part of something as revolutionizing as Bitcoin.\n\n#5.

Tom Guimberteau:\n\nBitcoin is my business. By buying and selling i create profits and am able to support my family. I am only 14 years old but I am paying for my parents electricity bills. I am looking towards buying mining equipment but difficulty is too high… Bitcoin allows me to spend at ease. Being young, the main truly beautiful aspect of bitcoin is that it is practically a bank account. Sure I could go for a Debit Card but the fees are so high! So Bitcoin really helps me out. Ever since me and a few of my friends started playing that bitcoin billionaire app, we id some research now we’ve got about 40 people in our school transacting in bitcoin (we are reaching out to IA as well). “Hey dude can i borrow 5 bucks? I’ll pay u back in bitcoin” ‘Yeah, Sure man”. :) <-Its like an actual like a thing.\n\n#8. Neil:\n\nI can open my own account, with my money and manage it how I see fit. I do not have to be vetted, ask permission, explain or conform to any norm the banking normally enforces upon their customers. I can instantly trade worldwide with whom I choose, for product and services I want without any approval being required from anyone – and at a minimum cost to myself. I am not supporting the bloated and corrupt banking system in any way shape or form. I am in fact causing its demise. Bitcoin is an honest, value based system for everyone and a social leveller. I can operate as a peer to peer lender to projects of my choice without interference. It promotes the Block-chain technology that will destroy the parasitic middle men/women in a whole range of industries such as property sales, contract law and money transfers. It empowers the average person, gives dignity, and installs faith in a non corrupt and non manipulative wealth transfer system for use by all on this planet of ours – for the first time in history! ‘We the people’ now means something – self determination, a fiscal reality.\n\n#9. CryptoReporter:\n\nBitcoin is LIFE. Hear me out on this please. I have relatives in Ukraine. Most all of the banks around Donetsk and Lugansk are not operating anymore. Government doesnt run anymore so that means no pensions either (as small as they were). I have a granny who relied on a small pension for food and a cousin who is partially blind who was receiving a small pension too. Most people in their city have fled. However they can not leave. My cousin recently had a child and his wife died shortly after giving birth. He is on his own now with an year old baby and no birth documents for the baby. He cant cross any borders. Granny wont cross borders either. They are stuck. They have spent the last year with bombs from both sides dropping in all around them. My wife and I were watching the news a couple months ago and we saw her granny crying on the news as her neighbors house was destroyed and the neighbor killed. Last April we sent a 30 pound care package to them filled with food. Mostly protein bars and peanut butter and whatever else we could get in there that would last them a while. Some winter clothes too. It never arrived. Things have looked pretty grim ever since. Here comes bitcoin. Thanks to Google Translate (I dont speak Russian/Ukrainian) and Skype I taught him how to set up a wallet. He had heard of bitcoin since several banks in Ukraine have(had) ATM machines that can convert, but sadly those banks dont operate anymore. So my cousin found out there is a pretty good underground market place where people accept lots of different currencies for goods, including bitcoin. Right now exchange rates are terrible (and btc keeps dropping!) but its the only option we have now since I cant wire money to them at all. Most people have smart phones now so THANKS to bitcoin I can send him money for free, instantly, and he can buy what he needs for the family. Food is getting scarce there. Its not really safe to go anywhere or to carry any money. But he can carry his phone and get to the local marketplace and get what he needs. It is really awesome. Bitcoin is thriving in many places! My wife isnt a fan of bitcoin since she cant hold it or touch it, but even she now sees the power that bitcoin holds. As I started this message, I will end the same way…. Bitcoin truly is LIFE. All of us sitting here in the USA and other western countries cant grasp its power yet. I’m really thankful for the invention of bitcoin and the entire bitcoin community. Its truly a lifesaver! #10. Ghosty: I was aware of bitcoin when it was brand new… Back in 2009… I almost got involved then being as how I’m a techie but I wasn’t convinced at the time it wasn’t just another Internet scam… It was a 50/50 choice and I made the wrong one… So it for me represents an opportunity missed in that I would have been set today had I made a different choice back then… However it also represents an opportunity going forward and I realized that I have not missed the boat entirely… Today I mine bitcoin and support the block chain… I see it as something that will change the world… As a species we are not evolved enough to eliminate money all together but this is a step in the right direction… The future is all about decentralization and Bitcoin will lead the way!\n\n#11. Datablade:\n\nI have studied Bitcoin (and other crypto currencies) since early 2013 while completing a Certified Financial Crimes Investigator program. As a result I am in process of adding a payment option via Bitcoins for my business services (recruiting and staffing of anti-money laundering specialists) and will be strongly promoting this payment option to my clients (large banks and accounting consulting firms).

In addition to having a revolutionary idea, we were very impressed with the validity of the business plan and sophistication of their implementation strategy""\n\nThe winning idea ‘TransferB’ redefines the nature of international remittance #TopTechTalent t.co/lWZWSk14Qn pic.twitter.com/7MbgMc6zT2 — Deloitte Ireland (@DeloitteIreland) April 29, 2015\n\nBy using Bitcoin, TransferB can offer remittance charges for 2% with each transfer being processed between 1 and 24 hours, a significant progress compared to the 8% average fee charged by traditional money transfer services, with waiting time usually varying between 3 and 5 days.\n\nAccording to Deloitte, €35 billion should be collected this year in remittance charges, a juicy market that have attracted many startups, including Bitcoin-powered Singaporean CryptoSigma and San Francisco-based Align Commerce, to name a few.\n\nDeloitte, one of the ""Big Four"" professional services firms, hosts each year the Top Technology Talent Competition, an event that seeks innovative fintech ideas from third level students across Ireland.\n\nKelleher and Nagle will be granted an all-expenses paid trip to one of Deloitte’s Digital Studios in North America and a six-week summer internship at Deloitte Ireland.', 'One of the largest players in bitcoin has warned fledging startups to remain vigilant on regulatory compliance issues.\n\nCoinbase\'s associate counsel Sarah Hody urged entrepreneurs to follow the firm\'s ""proactive"" stance in front of a packed audience at bitcoin developer meetup in San Francisco’s South of Market district.\n\nHody, who worked at several different law firms prior to joining the cryptocurrency space, noted that a number of other sectors, including food services and the automotive industry, have regulatory bodies that ensure consumer protection.\n\nIt is becoming more apparent that bitcoin will someday be in the same category as other industries that must heed compliance in the US, said Hody, adding: ""Federal agencies have expressed interest.""\n\nBecause bitcoin is a protocol, a payment network and a digital currency – often simultaneously –it may attract the interest of various different regulators, she said.\n\nComplexity requires compliance\n\nAs Coinbase has grown, adding more services for its user base has meant an increase in regulatory compliance for the company.\n\nThis was especially true when Coinbase launched its US bitcoin exchange; the company had to begin not only holding bitcoin but also US dollars. Keeping US dollars in Coinbase’s wallet was a service it launched months prior to the exchange – likely a precursor to its launch.\n\nAdding features such as US dollar holdings – as well as GBP and the euro just recently – makes Coinbase much more intricately structured in terms of how regulators look at the company’s operations.\n\nCoinbase, according to Hody, is a cautionary tale in how bitcoin startups will have to face ever-more complicated rules as they expand.\n\nShe said:\n\n""Inherent in having an exchange means having both dollars and bitcoin for users. Coinbase is handling all the dollars and bitcoin in the background.""\n\nFederal and state level\n\nHody listed in her presentation a number of federal level agencies that have talked about jurisdiction over bitcoin.\n\nThis included the Security and Exchanges Commission (SEC) the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), among others. What might be most confusing for bitcoin startups, however, is the fact that regulators on both the federal and state level require often overlapping compliance standards.\n\nFinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, was used as an example.\n\nHody pointed out that FinCEN information already gets passed down to over 350 law enforcement agencies, many at the state level.\n\nDespite what may seem like byzatine rules, Hody advocated that startups intensely evaluate their business models and open up relationships with regulators.\n\n""It’s always time to ask: why might a regulator want to regulate your project?""\n\nProtecting users\n\nHody made it clear that the purpose of regulation in the digital currency industry is about protecting consumers, restricting money laundering and making sure taxes are properly collected.\n\nBecause these are issues regulators are concerned about, Coinbase keeps records about customers, and must ensure that developers using its API are operating in a legal manner.\n\nThe company also keeps a list of activities users of its services are prohibited from participating in, and maintains a watchful eye on its platform.\n\nHody said:\n\n""We have to keep records in compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.

Several states allow exchanges to operate without a specific license, some require exchanges to comply with all sorts of regulations, while other states are not sure on what to do yet. However, this uncertainty isn’t stopping CEX.IO from offering exchange services to parts of the United States.\n\nAlso read: CEX.IO is Temporarily Suspending Cloud Mining Services\n\nCEX.IO: Bitcoin Cloud Mining Unprofitable\n\nCEX.IO is a well-known name in the Bitcoin industry. This company has quickly grown out to be one of the biggest Bitcoin cloud mining operators in the world. This company allows customers to buy contracts for cloud mining hardware on the CEX.IO exchange, as well as trade the contracts for Bitcoin.\n\nWhen it became extremely expensive to mine Bitcoin from home using dedicated rigs, CEX.IO offered miners the opportunity of purchasing cloud mining hashing power. The company also gave customers the option of flipping their contracts to cover their original investments.\n\nCEX.IO’s services generated such high demand that the price per GH/s started going up tremendously. This allowed people to make a profit by day trading the mining contracts, speculating on the price of hashing power. A different kind of Bitcoin exchange, of course, but no less profitable for skilled traders.\n\nFast forward to the end of 2014, and everything that CEX.IO had built up started tumbling down. Facing declining profits due to a falling bitcoin price, CEX.io had to suspend its cloud mining services. Apparently, the company needed a Bitcoin price of $320 USD or higher in order to guarantee profitable cloud mining contracts. Unfortunately for CEX.IO’s customer base, the Bitcoin price has not a sustainable price in that range for quite some time now.\n\nFocusing on Becoming an Official Bitcoin Exchange\n\nSince cloud mining is currently an unprofitable model for CEX.IO, the company has decided to offer another service. CEX.IO now offers normal Bitcoin exchange services to 23 states in the US, allowing eligible customers to deposit and withdraw fiat currency through its platform. In order to offer such a service, CEX.IO had to obtain a Money Services Business [MSB] status in FinCEN.\n\nJeffrey Smith, CEX.IO’s Chief Information Officer, said,\n\n“Entering the US market is great news, as now we can offer our services to users from the USA in full. We consider this step as the next level in CEX.IO history, and invite all users to check out the easiest way to buy Bitcoin. Officially, on CEX.IO.”\n\nHowever, this also means CEX.IO can only offer their fiat deposits & withdrawals in certain US states, similar to the limitations Coinbase is facing right now. But that situation could be changing soon, as CEX.IO started the procedure necessary for obtaining a Money Transmitter License (MTL) in the states it cannot service yet at this time.\n\nWill you use CEX.IO’s exchange services?

Dans le domaine bancaire, financier et monétaire, c\'est pain béni car ce sont de purs domaines abstraits dominés par les purs rapports humains que sont ""croyance et confiance"".\n\nAu nom de la liberté des échanges et des transactions, les monnaies cryptées ont fleuri sur ces dix dernières années. Les connaisseurs le disent, ce sont plus de 500 monnaies nouvelles relevant de la catégorie des monnaies cryptées qui ont vu le jour et parmi elles, les ""Scam-moneys"".\n\nD\'une monnaie cryptée à l\'autre\n\nDonc, il y a le bitcoin. On ne reviendra pas là-dessus. Le litecoin qui serait second dans la hiérarchie des monnaies cryptées est un bel exemple de ce que veut dire ""compétition entre les monnaies"". De fait, le litecoin est fondé sur les mêmes principes et processus de fonctionnement que le bitcoin, le minage et les preuves de travail, en d\'autres termes les mécanismes informatiques qui assurent que le propriétaire d\'une unité monétaire est ""attestable"" et que la monnaie elle-même n\'est pas contestable. On a indiqué dans les précédents articles que les processus en question minage compris étaient de plus en plus longs et de plus en plus coûteux au fur et à mesure de la création des bitcoins et du développement de leurs échanges.\n\nLe litecoin, lancé en 2011, challenge le bitcoin dans les deux domaines du ""minage"" et du traitement des opérations. Le réseau du litecoin est prévu pour ""miner"" 84 millions litecoins, soit 4 fois plus que le bitcoin. C\'est un réseau rapide. Là où le réseau bitcoin demande 10 minutes pour traiter une transaction, celui du litecoin en demande quatre fois moins. Quand on sait que la production des bitcoins demande des temps de plus en plus longs et s\'accompagne de dépenses d\'énergie de plus en plus élevées, on comprend que sur le papier le litecoin dispose d\'un avantage compétitif fort.\n\nCe n\'est pas le seul compétiteur! Il faut signaler le ""dogecoin"", dont le lancement ressemble à une plaisanterie. Deux ingénieurs à la fois intrigués et amusés par le développement des monnaies cryptées en ont créé une: le Dogecoin. On sait (voir les articles qui précèdent) que les monnaies ne valent que par les effets de la croyance et de la foi. Mais on sait aussi que dans le monde de la monnaie, il n\'y a qu\'un pas entre la crédibilité et la crédulité: le désir de s\'enrichir fait tomber beaucoup de barrières mentales et de capacité de réflexion. Les inventeurs du dogecoin ont été sidérés de constater que leur monnaie ""blagueuse"" marchait, et ce alors qu\'il était annoncé que le ""minage"" porterait sur 100 milliards d\'unités! Incrémentés de 5 milliards de dogecoins par an au-delà (à comparer aux 21 ou 25 millions de bitcoins au maximum). Un autre avantage doit être relevé: les blocs de transactions qui sont un des éléments clefs de la sécurisation sont traités en moins d\'une minute contre 10 minutes avec le bitcoin!\n\nPour continuer cette série, citons le darkcoin que la littérature sur les monnaies cryptées classe au 9e rang. Initialement, il était conçu pour renforcer le bitcoin dans le domaine de l\'anonymat. Lui aussi est ""miné"": un maximum de 22 millions de darkcoins, créés au rythme de 2800 par jour, seront à disposition en 2050. Le temps de confirmation par transaction est assez rapide et se situe en dessous de 2,5 minutes.\n\nLa place manque pour évoquer l\'ether, une invention canadienne, ou l\'Amazon coin au lancement duquel le géant de la distribution s\'intéresse ou encore, l\'Aurora coin... Cette dernière monnaie ressort davantage du principe des monnaies alternatives que des Crypto-monnaies, on ne la cite ici que parce qu\'en Islande où le projet est né, les autorités officielles la jugent comme une Scam-money.\n\nLes mauvaises mines des monnaies\n\nOn a dit dans des articles antérieurs que la monnaie n\'est plus depuis longtemps un bien individualisable comme une pièce de monnaie. La fabriquer, qu\'il s\'agisse de monnaie de compte ou de monnaie virtuelle, relève d\'une activité de service. La virtualité s\'y ajoutant, les barrières à l\'entrée sont faibles quoiqu\'on en dit. Les conditions d\'accession à une monnaie sont donc des clefs incontournables de sa validité. Les monnaies cryptées ""d\'accès facile"", celles qui se lancent sans ""minage"" ou qui offrent d\'entrée de jeu la facilité d\'un ""préminage"" à leurs utilisateurs, présentent des risques sérieux pour les communautés qui les utilisent. Ces monnaies qui ont fait quelques victimes (voir notre remarque sur la crédulité) sont dénommées ""Scamcoins"" (monnaies-arnaque).\n\nElles sont aux monnaies cryptées, les vraies, les sérieuses, ce que sont les billets de Monopoly à la bonne et vraie monnaie fiduciaire. Certaines sont bâties sur le principe des monnaies alternatives. Au lieu de demander un effort à leurs adhérents: le ""minage"", elles décrètent qu\'il y aura un ""préminage"" dont elles définissent à l\'avance le niveau: les unes, c\'est un million d\'unités, les autres... c\'est caché, on ne le sera qu\'au bout d\'un certain temps. Il en est qui en font une espèce de loterie, votre ""minage"" vous donnera le droit à un ticket ""chance"": vous serez riche aléatoirement alors que le mineur de bitcoin doit faire des investissements et des efforts.\n\nPour obtenir ces monnaies, puisqu\'on ne mine pas, il faut se délester de quelques bons euros ou dollars ou bien être payé de ses créances dans la monnaie cryptée concernée. Ce qui est peu probable au départ. Elles admettent en général l\'usage des autres monnaies et créent des plateformes de changes. La plupart se définissent par rapport au bitcoin: pour les unes, la valeur de leur ""coins"" est de l\'ordre 10 bitcoins, pour les autres mille ou toute autre valeur, sachant que tout ceci fluctue avec la valeur du bitcoin en toutes devises dont l\'euro et le dollar. Elles sont accusées de viser l\'enrichissement rapide de quelques malins dont leurs inventeurs. Qui sont-elles? Une liste sur une encyclopédie en ligne est savoureuse de tous les noms les plus évocateurs possibles.\n\n«Miner» apparaît donc comme le processus le plus solide par lequel est conférée une valeur à la monnaie cryptée.\n\nMais le monde de la monnaie est plus compliqué que cela. Les crypto-monnaies lancent un défi aux systèmes institutionnalisés, les banques, les banques centrales, les fonds monétaires internationaux ou régionaux. Pourtant, les modes de paiement, indépendamment des supports de paiement que sont les monnaies subissent eux aussi des bouleversements, dont certains peuvent déboucher vers de nouvelles monnaies... qui ne seront pas cryptées et qui ne seront pas ""minées"". On verra un peu plus tard, que ces compétitions naissantes des nouvelles monnaies soulèvent une question très lourde de sens entre monnaies locales et monnaies globales.\n\nProchain article: la révolution des systèmes de paiement.', 'GetDotBit.com is a domain name platform for registering .bit (dot-bit) URLs that recently launched. Users can now register a domain name for free. Additional names cost one dollar each. Domain names registered on GetDotBit.com are 10 times less expensive than their traditional counterparts. Domain names typically cost $10 yearly through GoDaddy.com or similar services.\n\nThe more important benefit provided by GetDotBit domain names, however, is the control provided by a decentralized, open-source information registration and transfer system. GetDotBit domain names are powered by Namecoin, a decentralized open source information registration and transfer system based on the bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\nDomain gives owner more control\n\nThe owner of a GetDotBit domain name controls the private key to their domain names.

TLDs are controlled by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in the U.S. Because the domains are subject to centralization, they risk being subject to censorship by the central authority as well; something Namecoin disrupts with its system.\n\nNamecoin allows users to register domains using .bit addresses, making the domains independent of ICANN. The URLs are inaccessible by traditional browsers because they are not part of the traditional domain name system.\n\nThe decentralized domain name system allows users to create new sites and transfer existing ones onto .bit domains. These domains are far more difficult for authorities to block and can therefore play an important role in situations where governments are trying to censor parts of the web.\n\nNamecoin offers security\n\nAlso read: Could Turkey’s Twitter ban push citizens to Namecoin?\n\nNamecoin users can be assured of its security since it does use hashed passwords, Ternyak said. In addition, Namecoin uses a secure socket layer (SSL). SSL is a protocol for securing a DNS.

05/03/2015,"[""Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently announced that it was partnering with a Chinese investment firm to lead a $50 million investment into Bitcoin start-up Circle Internet Financial. This deal represents the first large investment of its kind by a major bank, and it definitely could make a big difference in the Bitcoin space as well as the way we transfer money in our everyday lives. So what does Circle Internet Financial do, and why is it the first Bitcoin company to attract an investment from a major bank?\n\nThe deal, and why Goldman wants a piece of the Bitcoin business\n\nTo be perfectly clear, Goldman Sachs isn't actually buying any Bitcoins, nor has it expressed any intention or desire to do so.\n\nWhat Goldman is doing is investing millions of dollars into Circle Internet Financial, a Bitcoin start-up with an innovative new idea aimed at changing the digital-payments business as we know it. Along with IDG Capital Partners (and several other investors), $50 million is being invested altogether. We don't know exactly how much of this amount came from Goldman, but Jeremy Allaire, CEO and co-founder of Circle did say that the majority of the investment came from Goldman and IDG.\n\nAs far as Goldman's goal, well, obviously it would love for its investment in Circle to produce a large monetary gain. However, there is likely a deeper motivation.\n\nThe investment was made by Goldman Sachs' Principal Strategic Investments Group, which focuses on investments within the financial technology space. In other words, they invest in companies whose products they could conceivably use in Goldman's own business. So let's look at what Circle does, and why it could be different from the hundreds of other Bitcoin start-ups that have sprung up in recent years.\n\nWhat is Circle Internet Financial, and what does it do?\n\nCircle Internet Financial wants to use Bitcoin's underlying technology to transform the way consumers pay for things, by developing cheap, secure, and easy ways for people to transfer money.\n\nThe main thing that makes Circle different is a new feature it plans to integrate over the coming weeks. Circle is allowing consumers to hold U.S. dollars in their accounts but is allowing them all of the transfer capabilities of digital currencies. In other words, Circle is giving people Bitcoin, without the volatility or hassle of actually buying Bitcoins on an exchange. And the dollar-denominated account balances held in Circle accounts are FDIC insured.\n\nIn other words, Circle users can choose to hold U.S. dollars but can pay any merchant anywhere in the world who accepts Bitcoin. Circle will instantly convert the dollars into Bitcoin at the time of payment, and Circle users can also accept Bitcoin payments, which will be instantly converted into dollars. And Bitcoin is powered by a decentralized network of computers, not a company (like Visa) that can charge transfer fees.\n\nIn effect, for Circle users, Bitcoin isn't a currency at all. Rather, it's a new payment network that enables secure, instant, and nearly free payments.\n\nOf course, customers who choose to hold Bitcoins in their accounts can still do so, and they can deposit and withdraw their Circle balances to their other Bitcoin wallets.\n\nBitcoin's future could be bright indeed\n\nBitcoin has attracted a significant amount of negative attention over the past few years, because of its reputation as a black-market currency, the collapse of a massive bitcoin exchange, and the extreme price fluctuations that saw the value of a Bitcoin rise from less than a penny in early 2010 to $1,200 by the end of 2013 and back down to about $225, where it currently sits.\n\nHowever, there are a few things to note. First, all new technologies experience growing pains. For example, solar stocks such as First Solar were going through the roof in 2008, crashed over the next few years, and are now stabilizing and consistently profitable.\n\nAnd most importantly, the long-term value of Bitcoin may not be in the currency itself, but the technology that makes easy, low-cost transfers of money possible. That is what Circle Internet Financial is trying to capitalize on, and that's why Goldman Sachs is willing to throw millions of dollars behind it.\n\nBitcoin and its underlying technology are at the forefront of a technological revolution that could change the way we pay for things and transfer money, and it looks like Goldman Sachs wants to get in on the ground floor."", 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by JP Buntinx\n\nOne of the main concerns people have regarding Bitcoin payments is the fact that you always need an Internet connection in order to broadcast transactions to the network. For most of us in the western world, this is not a problem. But in the areas where Bitcoin could do some good — like Africa, and South America — Internet connectivity is scarce, which creates an issue. bitSIM wants to make Bitcoin and blockchain transactions available to anyone anywhere at any time.\n\nAlso Read: Review: Ledger Wallet, Secure Bitcoin Hardware Wallet\n\nbitSIM: A Brief Introduction\n\nAs the name suggest, bitSIM is a way to put bitcoins on any SIM card, regardless of what mobile phone you are using. If successful, this will help in gaining critical mass for Bitcoin adoption around the world.\n\nbitSIM is a secure platform that allows developers, next-gen payment providers, and consumers to leverage the Bitcoin technology on top of the existing mobile infrastructure. The possibilities are just about limitless, ranging from mobile banking to mobile remittance and infotainment.\n\nSimilar to most recent hardware Bitcoin wallets, bitSIM claims to put users in charge of their financial wealth. bitSIM users are the only people who know their private keys. But bitSIM hopes to take things one step further by allowing authentication of digital assets under their very own independent SIM token. The service also allows users to choose between various security profiles by using the Pin Authentication to Cloud-based Services.\n\nIn order to protect their customer base, bitSIM uses a PIN secure hardware token, which is based on Java Card. This technology enables any Java-based application — such as mRemittance or mBanking — to run securely on smart cards and similarly-sized devices. The Java Card core is widely used in SIM and ATM cards.\n\nbitSIM also uses a second dedicated SIM communications interface chip running embedded virtual SIM firmware. This special software allows for innovative mobile solutions, such as bringing Bitcoin and blockchain transactions to anyone in the world. Furthermore, this method of spreading Bitcoin adoption does not rely on Internet access.\n\nWho is This For?\n\nTechnically speaking, bitSIM could be a “golden egg” for anyone in the world. But as most of our readers will be aware of, the unbanked and underbanked communities around the world will benefit the most from this initiative. And that demographic is larger than one may expect; there are 2 billion unbanked adults and an even larger number of under-banked adults.\n\nThis market has been dominated by traditional money remittance service providers such as Western Union and others, totaling up to a US$1 trillion market opportunity. Bitcoin has the potential to turn nations suffering from poverty into “middle class” societies, simply because of the technology that powers the protocol.\n\nOne of the facts that is being harped on by a lot of companies trying to bring Bitcoin to the unbanked is that, while there may not be a decent financial infrastructure in place, nearly everyone has at least one mobile phone. All mobile phones use SIM card, giving bitSIM a large opportunity to bring Bitcoin to the developing world.\n\nBut How Does it Work?\n\nbitSIM will not replace the actual SIM card in a mobile phone. Instead, bitSIM acts a dual-chip overlay, called ZSIM (zero-footprint SIM). ZSIM sits on top of your regular Sim card, turning any mobile phone, even if it’s one of the very first models ever to exist, into a portable Bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin transactions — which are always broadcasted through over the Internet — will be encrypted in a text message.\n\nWhat do you think about bitSIM? Comment below!\n\nWebsite: http://bitsim.co\n\nAll images courtesy of bitSIM and Pixabay', ""Modest, Inc. is an interesting name for a company started by someone who proclaims himself to be “probably one of the coolest guys ever,” but the company is rising and worth keeping an eye on.\n\nWhat makes the company interesting from a Bitcoin community perspective isn't that they accept Bitcoin, because they don't. It's that their founder, Harper Reed, tells me that he has been a bitcoin enthusiast since 2010, and he still thinks bitcoin isn't ready for the mainstream.\n\nWith more people using their phones for everything, mobile commerce is of growing importance. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. If cryptocurrencies are going to be the wave of the future, they need to support the platforms of today and tomorrow.\n\nModest is a payment processor focused on mobile apps. The idea is that you can simply drop a Modest store into your app (like an SDK, or software development kit) and with very little leg work, start selling your products through your mobile app.\n\nReed started work on Modest after leaving the Obama 2012 re-election campaign, where he was in charge of fundraising through social media. Before that, he worked at various startups, including Threadless, an early example of Internet crowdsourcing.\n\nWe talked about where Bitcoin is now, what it would take to get Modest on the Bitcoin bandwagon, and the state of crowdfunding online, inside and outside of Bitcoin.\n\nThere are a few points that I disagree with him on and a few perceived problems with Bitcoin that have been solved through third-party offerings, but this isn't meant to be a debate. Rather, my task here as a journalist is not to assert my opinion on the interviewee, but to get to the heart of what he is trying to say. If I believe he is lying or being dishonest in some way, asking tough questions would be a crucial function of the job, but the goal is never to win debate points for “our” side.\n\nI will use this space to voice this opinion: We need to listen to what people like Harper Reed have to say.\n\nToo often, we in the Bitcoin community are isolated from the rest of the tech world. It can be easy to forget what the rest of the world thinks about us. Reed and Modest aren't in banking. They aren't threatened by bitcoin. Modest itself is a product that, from my (and I suspect much of the community's) perspective, seems to be an ideal candidate for Bitcoin adoption.\n\nWe could find some excuse to explain why we think Modest is not taking bitcoin. We could blame Reed, question his “nerd credentials” and say he never really liked bitcoin. Then we could pat each other on the back, confident in the knowledge that we are the future and he is not.\n\nOr, we could ask what is stopping him, we could listen to what people on the periphery of our community are saying about us and find out what problems, perceived or otherwise, prevent them from jumping in. This is what I tried to do with this interview.\n\nCoinTelegraph: You told me before that you guys are not accepting bitcoin, but that you are watching it closely. What are you looking for, and what would it take for you to utilize blockchain technology in some way?\n\nHarper Reed: Well, I think for us, it has to be more than just a mechanism. There are a few things: In our business, we have to make sure transactions are very fast. After years of watching e-commerce and being involved with very high-transaction organizations, the point is to make it easy, fast and exactly as the customer expects. Thus far, I don't think Bitcoin is quite there yet.\n\nBesides the fact it's not necessarily holding its value — and I'm not really worried about that — I'm more worried about the fact that when I think about my mom using Bitcoin as a payment method, it is very, very complex. The people that are consumers are not test people. They are normal retailers, normal customers, just normal people. What I really want to see is it working super well with those normal people.\n\nI would love to see Bitcoin work, but I'm just not willing to sacrifice our user's experience to make it work for us.\n\nCT: So would you say that complexity and transaction times are the two biggest concerns?\n\nHR: Usability is the key, I think. Usability and transaction times.\n\nCT: Bitcoin companies have mobile app payment APIs. What would you say to a mobile app developer trying to decide between one of those and Modest?\n\nHR: Well, it's not so much that the question is “Modest or Bitcoin?” As much as it is the tool that helps facilitate the transaction, but we are pretty agnostic in how you pay. For an example, we have talked a lot about how we would enter into a country like India. In India, a lot of the transactions are done by a COD [cash on demand], where they come to your house and ask for money. Now, we don't care if that is how you want to pay. The key for us is that it is fast, easy and the customer gets what they want.\n\nBitcoin has its place in there. I think it is important to figure out how it fits in a way that is really solid. I think right now we could wrap a nice interface around it, but I don't think there would be a really good [way to do it]. The transaction times would make it confusing, I think.\n\nThat is really the thing. We are just waiting. It's not so much Modest or Bitcoin, or that Modest can't use bitcoin. We are just waiting and watching. I think you said it better than I could, that it doesn't use it now, but hopefully in the future, it could.\n\nCT: Building on that, could a developer use Bitcoin in Modest, or have the two co-exist in the same app?\n\nHR: Not yet, but hopefully sometime soon.\n\nCT: Do you want to talk about the one-click email purchase feature Modest recently launched?\n\nHR: What we have been thinking about a lot is how do we quickly and easily complete a transaction. One of the big pieces here is: how do we very quickly and easily put that stuff into an email?\n\nThis is what happens now: I send you an email with a product in it, and you are really stoked and you think, “yeah!” and you click the email. Then it goes to the product page and then you go through the same set of emotions and you still think, “Yeah, I do want this,” so you click buy and it goes to “Add to cart” and then you are getting less excited and you are getting more opportunities to fall out. You really just wanted it that first time.\n\nWe did a lot of work, looking at email and where email is supposed to be. What I mean by that is, 60% of people — or something around there — check email on their phone. There should be a big asterisk there because I forget the exact number. [Writer's note: 61% of email users check at least “some” of their emails on their phone as of 2013, according to Yesmail, via emailmonday.com, so Mr. Reed isn't far off.]\n\nThe key and the hard part here is, how do you make sure that same magic we have on our mobile app can exist in email? Because if our emails are being checked on our mobile phones, then we have the same problem but even more so.\n\nWe thought, “Why don't we put the transaction as close to the email as possible?” So, what we went ahead and did was put a buy button in the email, and it's basically the product page and you decide, “Yes, I do want to buy this product!” Then you hit buy and then it’s, “Okay, you have it, its done,” and that's it.\n\nCT: Does the customer pay with credit cards, how does payment integrate into that?\n\nHR: The best case is we know who you are. If you come to “Harpers Store” and we already know who you are, we already have the data. We already have your credit card, we already have your email address and your billing and shipping addresses.\n\nIf we don't know who you are, and this is where it kind of gets exciting, we will only ask for the information we need. Lets say you ordered something before but you didn't save your credit card. We will just ask for that information and use the other information we already have. It is all about making it very easy and very straight forward to get a user to give us that information. Then, the next time you check out, it is super, super fast.\n\nIf you think about this, this is a custom e-commerce experience for you and for one product. You can't buy other products, because what we have found with email is that people really just want the one product.\n\nCT: You guys do have Apple Pay and PayPal listed as coming. Can you talk about the decision to add those and how that will work?\n\nHR: Apple Pay is an interesting piece of technology. The thing about it is, and it’s pretty open about this, it is pro-consumer. So, if you're a company — let’s say CoinTelegraph started accepting Apple Pay — you get less data than if it was a credit card, and more importantly, if you use Apple Pay at Home Depot and Home Depot gets hacked again, your credit card information won't be leaked. You aren't as susceptible to these hacks that seem to keep happening. Now, if Apple gets hacked, we are all screwed, but at least you are not distributing your credit card everywhere.\n\nIn Chicago, I have an iPhone, I take the bus and I can use my iPhone to use Apple Pay to pay for the bus. What that means is that the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] doesn't actually have my credit card information. What they have is a token that allows them to charge my card. They basically have the same thing, but they don't actually own the number. This is incredibly progressive and really pro-consumer. Much safer and much better. When this came out — we are primarily iOS — we were pretty stoked about how this works. The thing is though, if you are using Modest and are not using Apple Pay, buying things takes one tap. If you are using Modest and are using Apple Pay, buying things take two taps.\n\nSo, we don't necessarily like it because it is simpler or easier, we like it because it is safer.\n\nCT: How do you think that compares to Bitcoin, where there is no credit card. While you can get your bitcoin stolen or hacked from you, there isn't a central point of failure if you hold your own bitcoins. Do you want to talk about the difference in a decentralized system like Bitcoin and centralized systems like Apple Pay and PayPal, and which one is preferable for a company like Modest?\n\nHR: I don't think we have an opinion on where or how, or if something is centralized. I think we have an opinion on consumer ease and safety. Like I mentioned, I am a huge bitcoin fan, playing around with the software and mining and all that stuff, since 2010. It has been fun to watch and fun to play with, but you don't see as many people losing all of their money because of credit cards, as you often as you see someone losing all their Bitcoin because they messed up storing their wallet.\n\nI do not think Bitcoin is ready for mainstream. I don't think that is a judgment on how it is built. What happens if Coinbase gets hacked? It would be terrible for the community. What happens if the exchanges are hacked, which they all eventually are — it is terrible for the community.\n\nJust read the darkmarket subreddit. All these people are freaking out because their various vendor of choice disappears, with their money, their bitcoin. They have no recourse for that.\n\nA lot of pieces of our financial institutions were created to build up safe guards for the consumer. It is one thing to have a nice technology that is decentralized, somewhat anonymous in certain cases and allows money to be transacted without some laws and some rules, but then you also don't get the other rules that are pro-consumer.\n\nOne thing I really like watching is how people are using Bitcoin. Because it really is the future of payments. However, that doesn't mean that it works now. That's the problem. People keep trying to push it into, “well, why isn't it mainstream?” When I read r/bitcoin or hackernews about bitcoin there are a lot of people saying things like, “Well, this wouldn't happen if it was bitcoin.” It is like, “Yeah, that is true, that wouldn't happen, but if you bought something and it broke, you couldn't return it.”\n\nSo we need to solve the tech problem, which I think Bitcoin does in a good way. We also need to solve the consumer problem. We also have to solve the problem that no one I know who actually uses Bitcoin actually keeps it in Bitcoin. They change it to all these different kind of monies. Once it starts holding value, instead of going to sub-200 or where ever it is headed now, then I think things will start to be easier.\n\nI actually think the coolest technology to come out of Bitcoin, which you can see by all the investments, is aggressively the blockchain. That is exactly the right thing, the fact that you can put things in there and its distributed and it’s a good tally of what is happening. I would love to see more financial institutions use that technology. But, I don't think we can do that, or I don't think it matters so much if that technology is good or bad — if I don't think the consumers themselves, the people actually using it, don't have any of the protection they would normally have.\n\nDude, I hate credit cards. I hate the whole system. It is not a great system. It could be so much better. But that doesn't mean we need to trade it for another slightly broken one.\n\nCT: What was behind your switch from managing the social aspect of a political campaign to working on a mobile payments platform?\n\nHR: Basically, we have always been doing [these kind of things] for years and years and years and the campaign was kind of the intermediary between those. I was the CTO of Threadless for many years, worked on my own stuff for a while, worked in venture capital a tiny, tiny bit. So for me, the vacation from startups was the campaign. It's not so much that I stopped working on the campaign, as much as it was that I [stopped working on startups and then] started to work on campaigns, so it's interesting to get it going again.\n\nCT: You have a pretty unique perspective with political campaigns. Rand Paul recently became the first major U.S. political presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin for his campaign. Would you like to talk about that?\n\nHR: I would be interested in seeing if he can legally do that.\n\nCT: Yeah, the FEC (Federal Election Commission) ruled that it's okay last summer. There have already been a few state politicians who started accepting Bitcoin. Rand Paul is the first presidential candidate to accept it. It is already on his website.\n\nHR: Well, it is a cool thing. I think it is an exciting thing. [Reed looks over Paul's website.] This is interesting. I think it will be interesting to see what happens. There are a lot of very weird rules about money and the campaigns. Specifically about the co-mingling of funds.\n\nThis goes back to, I think, one of the issues with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is becoming a method of payment, but not as a method of storing money. If Bitcoin just maintains as a method of payment, that is not losing, that is not a problem. If you just look at Rand Paul's website here, it is really straight forward. You can see that you can pay with credit card, you can pay with Bitcoin or you can pay with PayPal. They are all first class citizens here.\n\nBut it is pretty interesting. The thing about bitcoin is that we could theoretically figure out Rand Paul's Bitcoin wallet, and see how much money he has. That is probably a pretty big liability for campaigns. Even though they have to report it, they probably don't want everyone to know immediately how much money they have.\n\nThat is pretty awesome though. That is pretty cool. I like it, it is awesome. I have been waiting to see how it would work.\n\nCT: Threadless was one of the earliest cases of crowdsourcing and crowdfunding. How do you feel about how that has evolved since then? And what do you think about the cryptocurrency ICO and IPOs that have turned out to be scams all too often?\n\nHR: It would be neat to see how they can interact better with the blockchain, because it is pretty tricky. It is a hard thing to handle. Crowdsourcing is a pretty complex thing. It seems like it should be easy, but I think Bitcoin could really make it better. The problem is once again, that you need the consumers to get on it, or it really doesn't matter. The thing is, you are staking your business on that Bitcoin will work, and your business will work. It is hard enough to get your business to work.\n\nCT: Is there anything else you want to say to our readers or the Bitcoin community?\n\nHR: I left Threadless in 2009, and the first time I installed a bitcoin client was at Threadless. I've been playing around with this for quite a while. I think the thing that is missing, and the thing I really want to make sure everyone remembers, is that there are a lot of people who are not us. They don't care about Bitcoin. They don't want to worry about getting ripped off, they don't want to worry about having a cold backup of their wallet, they don't want to worry about all the things we have to go through to safely use bitcoin. We have to fix that problem. If we want this to succeed, we are the ones that have to make sure my mom can use Bitcoin without having to worry about “am I going to get screwed,” or whatever.\n\nIf there is one thing I want people to think about, it is: how do we make it easier? That is the important thing, because if we make it easier and people start using it, then every political campaign will start using it, every business will start using it and people will start being stoked by it."", 'Subspace hopes to become a functioning messaging system, which Satoshi Nakamoto originally imagined as part of the Bitcoin protocol, and an idea that Google developer Mike Hearn had further developed. As Chris Pacia, founder of Subspace, writes:\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol has proven itself to be a versatile platform for innovation, yet there are still limits to what we can do with it. As an example, we cannot send arbitrary messages across the network. This is by design ? we want it to send value from person A to person B as efficiently as possible and not be bogged down storing information that is not needed for consensus.\n\nTowards this end, Pacia envisages a functional messaging layer. Pacia further elaborates upon the purpose of subspace:\n\nIn my own projects I have a number of use cases where I need to send data from one client to another ? payment requests, 2FA (multisig) signing requests, direct-to-recipient payments, ECDH transactions, etc ? but I have yet to find a messaging protocol that has all the properties I need to make these work.\n\nPacia looks to make Subspace the layer to make these sorts of improvements happen. This is not his first Bitcoin related project. He developed Bitcoin Authenticator, and has discussed how the Apple Watch could facilitate secure Bitcoin transactions.\n\nCCN sat down with Chris to discuss Subspace.\n\nHow did the idea to use email for sending BIP70 payment requests get started?\n\nThe idea was originally Mike Hearn’s. He proposed using an email-like system (though not SMTP) to extend BIP70 to individuals. There are some obvious benefits ? we can use the system for so-called ‘stealth’ transactions where we only give out a single payment address and receive the payment to different bitcoin address each time. We can attach arbitrary messages to transactions, send payment requests to individuals, and overall increase the amount of privacy in lightweight wallets.\n\nI started work on it after spending a good deal of time (unsuccessfully) trying to fix the privacy leaks related to bloom filters. At present, there aren’t any lightweight wallets that offer the same degree of trustless privacy that can be had by running your own full node. They either try obfuscate data by using bloom filters (which have quite a few privacy leaks) or require you to place 100% trust in a server with your sensitive financial information. Neither option is that great. But by sending a payment directly to the recipient we can avoid the privacy leaks that stem from downloading transactions from the network.\n\nThe design for subspace that I put out was a bit different than Mike’s concept. In Subspace messages are encrypted and non-content data is obfuscated using a filtering mechanism. But it basically accomplishes the same thing.\n\nWhat protocols does Subspace utilize?\n\nThe network uses the Kademlia DHT with the only changes being two new RPC calls. It really isn’t complicated at all. The entire project is maybe 350 lines of Python code (not including libraries).\n\nIf a wallet author wants to use it in their project, it’s just basic HTTP POST and GET. It should be very easy to implement.\n\nWhy is Subspace important for direct payments?\n\nWe should be able to achieve full-node like privacy for lightweight wallets. But on top of that we’ll be able to do things like ‘push’ payment requests to end-users. This could enable monthly billing for services, which we don’t currently have in Bitcoin. We can also attach messages to our transactions and even use it for messages between clients.\n\nHow is Subspace part of Satoshi’s original vision?\n\nBitcoin 0.1 had a pay-to-IP protocol that Satoshi felt would be the primary way to pay:\n\n“There are two ways to send money. If the recipient is online, you can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public key and send the transaction with comments. If the recipient is not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which is a hash of their public key that they give you. They’ll receive the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it’s in. This method has the disadvantage that no comment information is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can’t be online at the same time or the recipient can’t receive incoming connections.” ? Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nOne of the reasons pay-to-IP never caught on is it tends to be difficult to configure your computer to take incoming connections. Your average user doesn’t know how to do it and UPnP doesn’t work well all the time. And, of course, if you weren’t online you couldn’t receive a payment this way.\n\nSubspace can allow us to do the same thing but without the problems of direct IP connections.\n\nWhat stage in development is Subspace?\n\nA beta will probably be out in a month or so and I anticipate releasing a wallet that uses it so people can test it out. If you would like to contact Chris, you can reach out at [email protected] or on Github https://github.com/BitcoinAuthenticator/Subspace\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'While Bitcoin adoption has globally increased during the past two years, seven cities have stood out to be leading the way.\n\nThe cities that are leading the world\'s Bitcoin adoption are San Francisco, Vancouver, Amsterdam, Makati, Zurich, Tel Aviv and London.\n\n""San Francisco is home to over 68 rapidly growing Bitcoin startups, including Coinbase, Kraken, Purse, Changecoin and Lawnmower.

Based in London, Roolo is owned and operated by experienced professionals who have spent considerable time in traditional finance.\n\nRoolo features multisig wallet technology, with instant transfers and fees of 0.5% on one side of the trade only, making the platform half the cost of LocalBitcoins.\n\nRoolo offers only ‘on the blockchain’ transactions, which ensures that bitcoins are never mixed and are always visible.\n\nRoolo has partnered with San Francisco based Block.io so that any coins transferred from a Block.io green address will be instantly confirmed on Roolo. Coins purchased on the site are instantly confirmed and can be transferred to a private wallet without delay. Roolo was conceived and developed by Anthony Culligan and Nicholas Pennington.\n\nPennington hails from financial services with a history in technology development and implementation, as well as experience trading derivatives, risk management and hedge fund analysis. Pennington has experience coding as a trader dealing in real time with institutional capital at risk.\n\nCCN spoke with Roolo CEO Anthony Culligan, who began his career as a programmer in the 80s, having deployed his skills in traditional finance as a quantitative fund manager, derivatives trader and an investor in complex hedge funds. He has worked as a director at Rober Fleming Securities, JP Morgan and Aida Capital, as well as CEO of F&C Partners.\n\nPennington and Culligan had a clear vision when forming the p2p platform. According to Roolo’s website:\n\nThe vision is to create environments where real people can come together and trade freely with each other in an atmosphere of trust and without the need for an intermediating institution.\n\nWhat is the goal of Roolo?\n\nThe goal of Roolo.io is to bring together buyers and sellers of bitcoin and to provide an evironment where they can build trust and trade between themselves. We aim to be the cheapest, fastest and safest peer to peer bitcoin trading site. To do this we will engage with the p2p community, understand what their needs are and relentlessly improve our services to meet those needs.\n\nA wider goal is to stimulate the adoption of bitcoin in the world of traditional finance. With this in mind we are running a series of talks in the City. (See Bitcoin in the City)\n\nWhy did you choose to build a p2p trading site over a centralized model?\n\nThe most interesting aspects of bitcoin is that it is p2p. It defines ownership as control of the private key or keys. Centralised exchanges, while they can provide apparent quick changes in ownership, do not transfer ownership until the user withdraws their coins or their cash. In reality this can take days! Centralised exchanges also disintermediate bitcoin owners so that they do not have to address p2p trust and identity. We found this to be a compelling and interesting problem to work with and one which has a much bigger and broader reward in the long term. Finally, as a business a centralised exchange currently has a single point of failure – ie its payment provider. We did not want to take that business risk.\n\nCould you tell us a bit about the evolution of the Roolo Brand?\n\nThe foundation of the Roolo brand is that we believe in bitcoin as a concept as well as a technology. We embrace the social aspect of bitcoin and are loud and proud about them. We are liberal at heart and believe that uncensored access to a payments system is a good thing that will stimulate person to person relationships globally and will forge a powerful network of human interdependence. This far outweighs the impact of bad actors who, historically, have relied upon isolation of their populations to maintain their power. Overall its a force for good and we want our brand to be associated with that.\n\nWith respect to our name, we started life as ‘uBTCx’. We had two ‘brand changing’ experiences. We hired a penetration testing firm to black hat test our site. They hacked the wrong site. Even our suppliers could not remember our name! Second, a friend half joking tried to actually phonetically pronounce the name over dinner and ended up emitting small food particles. We knew it was time to change.\n\nWhat did you learn via the branding experience? Why did you wish to stay away from the words “bit” and “coin” in your name?\n\nWe went to the list of exchanges on the BitcoinAverage site. (There are about 50 or so publishing data). Any name that contained or ‘coin’ ‘x’ or ‘bit’ was simply camouflaged in the list. We resolved that we needed something which was memorable, stood out and was pleasant to articulate. We used Proof of Work, the media consultants to help us get to Roolo. We are very happy with it.\n\nWhere does Roolo derive from?\n\nRoolo is the phonetic version of rouleau or roll and can be used to describe a roll of coins. The logo contains a little representation of a roll of coins and the\n\nWhat does Roolo allow bitcoiners to do?\n\nIt allows bitcoiners to trade trade bitcoins safely between each other using whatever currency and settlement method they agree between themselves. The site will hold the bitcoins during the transaction and release them to the buyer when both parties agree that the fiat payment has been made.\n\nHow is Roolo a step forward for P2P technology?\n\nRoolo is focused on deploying the best, latest and fastest technology to the process of p2p. For example; Roolo has full multisig wallets on site. We use block.io as the wallet provider. We provide each user with two keys, we keep two keys and block.io has one. The ‘shared’ multisig wallet requires 3 of 5 to move coins. In the event that either Roolo or Block.io failed, there would be sufficient keys to move the coins to an alternative wallet.\n\nRoolo will shortly be providing private multisig wallets. These will require the user to sign in browser for coins to be moved. In effect they are external wallets that will not be under our control.\n\nWe will also be providing 2 of 3 multisig escrow accounts where we will hold a single arbitration key. One key will be given to the seller and one to the buyer. For properly completed transactions, neither the coins or the fiat will ever be in our control.\n\nWe currently work with greenaddresses provided by block.io. That means all coins instantly confirm as they move through our site. If a user has an independent block.io wallet the instant confirm extends to movements into and out of the site.\n\nHow importance is transparency, speed and trust to the Roolo platform?\n\nAll movements of client coins are ‘on the blockchain’. That means that we never mix client coins into omnibus accounts and there is full transparency through any blockchain browser.\n\nThe greenaddress facility gives us blistering speed.\n\nWe will be implementing ‘quickaddresses’ which will be a conduit address between counterparties that deal frequently. Sending coins to a quickaddress will automatically trigger a trade. When this is implemented we expect to set new world records for p2p speed.\n\nHow does it all work?\n\nIt works fantastically. We are always improving so – you can see our direction. We have spent our first 8 weeks of public release listening to clients and are working hard on pushing out new features in response.\n\nWhat else is Roolo involved in?\n\nWe are ardent supporters of the bitcoin ecosystem and spend a lot of time looking at what other people are doing. We tweet and support other companies when we like what they are doing. We are big supporters of Bitrated, purse.io, Bitreserve, Changetip and many others. It is our view that the more innovation there is, the more embedded bitcoin becomes and the stronger its future will be for all of us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Ethereum first grabbed the attention of the Bitcoin 2.0 movement with news of their plan to create a platform for distributed contracts and DACs. BitShares and BitSharesX introduced the concept of “BitAssets” as one of the numerous technologies claiming to be “bitcoin 2.0” or “finance 2.0.” In essence, this “Bitcoin 2.0” movement represents a movement to leverage the power of globally decentralized consensus and decision making networks as birthed by bitcoin.\n\nWe interviewed Beyond Bitcoin founder, and BitShares researcher, Ben Keyhotee, to discuss BitShares, its importance, its past and future, and how it humanizes crypto-currency.\n\nWhat got you interested in Bitcoin?\n\nIt is really an entire list of things, but I’ll try to shorten it up and keep concise:\n\nI have a background in community management as a Gamer and organizer of Guilds in Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs). It was here that I learned the value of digital commodities.\n\nMy Guild Leading days led me to find ways to become more efficient with my time, which led me to automation software, often called “bots”, that would gather in-game materials for use by guild-members. This is where I learned the value of using software for task automation.\n\nI then joined the U.S. Air Force, where I studied psychology and worked in mental health, deploying to Afghanistan in 2009. This is where I gained an appreciation for the Constitution and what it is like for people to live under the thumb of a corrupt regime.\n\nAfter joining the Air Force, I watched the banking failures in 2008 and began spending a great deal of my off time learning about the “elite” and their control over the currency supply. This is where I learned the true definition of money and the value of freedom of association, which directly relates to our most intimate interactions on a daily basis: the transfer of currency between two people in exchange goods and services.\n\nMy quest began as I learned about the Enron scandal, Carbon Credits, the Federal Reserve System, Agenda 21, and later things like CISPA and the NDAA. As I learned how much freedom and self-determination was taken from us by the “money masters” controlling the currency supply, and learning about their intentions for the future I realized that we needed to find a way to issue our own currency again–and that this was the only way we could nonviolently free eachother from the shackles of tyranny. It was apparent to me the very moment I learned about bitcoin that we could use these currencies to decouple ourselves from the control of those who despite their best intentions, are severely incapable of helping humanity on a granular level necessary to reach symbiosis with our world and eachother. Bitcoin is why I love cryptocurrency, but as always, we should be willing to acknowledge flaws in any system and strive to improve upon the status quo…which is what led me to BitShares.\n\nWhat is your role with BitShares?\n\nI, along with the bitshares community, am the founder of Beyond Bitcoin. Beyond Bitcoin is a media movement that is meant to help replace the current blind altcoin [ANN] thread paradigm which has enabled such a high level of corruption and scams that hurt newbies to the crypto space. I personally run Beyond Bitcoin Dev Hangouts for all developers who create Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS)-based chains and sharedrop a portion of the total supply onto current BitShares, PTS and AGS holders, but the Mumble Server I run for this is available for use by any bitcoin/altcoin community.\n\nThese are town-hall styled events where developers and investors can connect in a way that encourages open engagement and honesty between both parties because there is always someone able to fact check statements made.\n\nThe dynamic is intentionally set in such a way that the moderator does not have to be the one asking the difficult questions because in more centralized formats the interviewer is not incentivized to ask difficult questions for fear of losing future guests, which equates to a loss of viewers, advertisers and as a consequence profits. In Beyond Bitcoin Hangouts, the audience is most often going to be full of large stake holders in a project, individuals interested in investing a large amount, or competitors. It is for this reason they are incentivized to ask the questions that will best protect users from potential scams or financially unsound investments.\n\nThe crypto-space is dangerous to the unwary; we aim to reward trustworthiness and participation by correctly aligning incentives. Luckily Beyond Bitcoin Hangouts will enable us to grow and scale because we will not be forced to sell advertisement space for funding. This is because we can have a delegate (fuzzy.beyondbitcoin) voted into power by the shareholders of the BitShares DAC, which allows us to be hired and funded directly by the blockchain. This means we can focus on the best interests of the community at large, and only the community, providing this as a public service.\n\nWhat got you interested in BitShares?\n\nListening to Dan Larimer’s (aka Bytemaster’s) speeches, learning his philosophy on economics and human rights. It was clear that his intent was to use blockchain tech to these ends and the knowledge that he was one of the few who were regularly in direct contact with Satoshi Nakamoto was simply a bonus.\n\nDan Larimer coined the term DAC and recognized that cryptocurrencies in fact operated more like shares in a decentralized autonomous company (DAC). He was on the forefront with respect to using blockchain technology for industry and I believe his vision will change the world to help move us in a direction more toward freedom, liberty and abundance.\n\nWhy is BitShares important?\n\nBitShares is Unique in that is opens up a whole new paradigm of possibilities for the issuance of cryptocurrencies, while finding the proper balance of efficiency, security, scalability and decentralization of control over the networks built using its underlying DPOS protocol.\n\nAnd unlike many of its competitors, it is designed in such a way as it is meant to be a toolkit that provides thousands of chains that compete to offer services worldwide.\n\nBitShares recognizes the value of a community of DAC-Savvy investors and has set a precedent for the emergence of new DPoS-based chains to compete for BitShares’ userbase by distributing a portion of their total currency supply to holders of BTS, PTS, AGS or any other chain that best represents the demographic with which they would like to bootstrap their network.\n\nUnlike most projects that want to be the platform upon which all other technologies are built, it looks to be the Linux of the crypto industry with many DACs being built and flourishing side by side in a purely decentralized “Universe” of DACs. I call this the “BitShares Universe”.\n\nSo why is this important?\n\nImagine if simply holding Bitcoin gave altcoin developers an incentive to sharedrop a % of their total altcoin supply on you. If this were to be the Bitcoin consensus, people would not be forced to take the high risks of trading their BTC in hopes of finding the next big thing. This means there is a better risk profile for the entire ecosystem which still gives those interested in higher levels of risk taking the ability to trade their tokens in for technology they feel is better.\n\nIn short, because of sharedropping, DPOS-based chains are chains I could comfortably advise my mother invest in long term, knowing that in 10-20 years at least some of them would prove highly profitable. This opens the doors for wider adoption and also creates a more socially palatable range of options for investing in crypto projects and Devs who are willing to do it automatically gain access to the community in the form of hangouts, so their projects are more likely to receive the valuable input necessary to make them more likely to succeed. With BitShares, incentives align for the development of a more robust and equitable investment opportunity… and I am proud to be a part of that.\n\nWhat is a Decentralized Autonomous Company and how will it change the way the world works?\n\nWhen altcoins first began arriving on the scene, it became apparent that many were trying to fill specific niches in the market–to bring cryptocurrency to specific industries and fulfill specific market needs. From coins with specific features (like Darkcoin and Monero’s attempts to achieve anonymous transactions), to coins with little innovation that were simply banking on using specific brand positioning as coins of choice for certain industries (Sexcoin and Gamecoin come to mind), it was clear that blockchain protocols wanted to be used in multiple areas of society.\n\nThough the creators of these coins were visionaries with respect to how blockchain tech could be used, it was clear that the open beta technology that was Proof of Work (PoW) was not up to the task of scaling to enterprise transaction speeds and volumes. Equally as important, the power grew more centralized away from holders due to economies of scale and the use of Algorithm Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). PoW also unnecessarily taxed the holders of system tokens, essentially paying power companies inordinate sums in order to secure the network.\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) intended to be the solution to PoW but fell short with respect to enterprise scalability. It became clear that we had to rethink blockchain tech in terms of something broader and more expansive than a use as a “Gold-equivalency” of digital currency. It became evident we needed blockchains built specifically for business.\n\nWhen members of the crypto-community began thinking in these terms, it was not long after that technologies like Transparent Forging and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) came onto the scene. These technologies were engineered with business in mind and it was apparent. They began touching upon the ability of blockchain technology to create decentralized companies that provide specific services owned and controlled by stakeholders–not by force (hashpower).\n\nNXT and its clones like Horizon (HZ) and New Economy Movement (NEM) intuitively understood this, and engineered their infrastructure to become exchange platforms with far higher scalability potential. They did this while while making it possible to maintain a level of decentralization of control that was the primary draw for cryptocurrency users from the very beginning.\n\nAlthough NXT, HZ, and NEM intuitively understood this, it was the vision of Dan Larimer (aka Bytemaster) of the BitShares Project who actually outlined the dynamics of such systems, recognizing decentralized exchanges as only one of many potential Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs) that could exist to use blockchains. In fact it was Dan himself who coined the term “DAC”.\n\nPerhaps we can attribute some of Dan’s insights to multiple in-depth interactions with Satoshi himself, or perhaps Satoshi was drawn to Dan’s understanding and expansive vision of how blockchain protocols could be used, and as such BitShares’ innovation is solely that of Dan’s creation. Whichever is the truth of this matter, BitShares is important because it’s founder and chief engineer recognized the necessity to “reinvent the wheel” to build blockchain technology that can be truly be considered as the likely gold standard for blockchain protocols made for decentralized control and ownership of businesses.\n\nHow does Bitshares differ from other so-called “alt-coins?”\n\nBitshares differs from “altcoins” in that it is not an altcoin. It is, in fact is a DAC with “shares”. This is a key distinguishing feature because of the underlying philosophy of how and why BitShares was engineered. Because Dan Larimer understood that all blockchains were, in fact, acting like DACs.\n\nFor this reason he understood that it was important to engineer the source code to make alt-chains operate as companies. This means he constructed them in such a way as to maximize profitability and value creation while minimizing the cost of securing and maintaining the network.\n\nBitshares is a toolkit that powers the creation of unknown multitudes of potential DACs. The code is open-source and freely available for use by all to develop their own DACs.\n\nOne of the least known, understood, and yet most valuable aspects of the BitShares Ecosystem is that Developers who use the toolkit will most often use a method of initial distribution of their DAC’s shares called ShareDropping. Though we have spoken to a degree about ShareDropping earlier in this interview, I would like to explain it in a bit more detail here:\n\nShareDropping is powerful for a few reasons:\n\n– It utilizes a “snapshot” of blockchains at any given date in order to establish a targeted demographic of investors who are most likely to understand and bring value to a Developer’s new DAC. This is valuable for bootstrapping one’s DAC with a community most likely capable of increasing the value of the DAC’s shares.\n\n– It gives Shares to the owners of chosen blockchain investors, thus enriching them and diversifying their portfolios of crypto-investments by giving them a stake in one’s project without ever asking them to risk shares with proven value to purchase shares in projects yet unproven. This is a distinctly different incentive structure than the current status quo and opens up a lower risk category of crypto-investments for those more averse to risk (which in turn opens up more opportunity for investment in the cryptospace).\n\n– As ecosystems become more politicized in the BitShares Universe, people will begin to look for alternatives that share similar values to themselves while still having the same benefits DPoS offers. ShareDropping is a way to advertise one’s project to users who may be more inclined to help build a new ecosystem than remain in one they may feel has altered its path from its core views.\n\nWhat do you think BitSharesX will look like in ten years?\n\nBitShares, giving the power of ownership and growth back to the people who own stake in the project, has no choice but to become the flagship chain in an entire political network of DAC chains. All these chains will be created by Developers of varying philosophies, owned by networks of individuals who believe in the viability of these philosophies and run by professionals who bring the most value to each chain while maintaining the vision for which each chain was originally established and vested. But these networks will dynamically change to adapt to the various challenges faced when realities meet philosophies and force them to evolve. In essence, BitShares will not be just one chain. It will be a crypto-standard for networks to form communities that provide services like companies do. Where this dynamic will take us is hard to tell, but it is sure to be a wondrous and wild ride!\n\nWhy are delegates so important to the system?\n\nDelegates are the nodes that sign the blocks onto the blockchain. Anyone can try to become a delegate but must be voted into place by the stakeholders in the community. In BitShares, a developer can choose from any number of delegates his/her chain will have, but Daniel chose 101 for security purposes and for maximum scalability/efficiency. It is this choice that made it possible for BitShares to have 5 second block times and under 10 second transaction times.\n\nHow are delegates kept honest?\n\nBitShares Delegates must be kept honest in similar ways to how our politicians must be kept honest–good old fashioned community sleuth work. Of course there are some aspects of delegates operations, such as the missing of blocks or running on forks, that are monitored from http://bitsharesblocks.com and could end up causing a delegate a slot to be moved out of the top 101 (which is, in BitShares, the number of delegates allowed to produce blocks).\n\nWith that said, Beyond Bitcoin Community Services tries to offer Delegate Hangouts in addition to the weekly scheduled Dev Hangouts so the community can ask questions of the delegates voted into power. All these hangouts are made available on our Beyond Bitcoin SoundCloud (https://soundcloud.com/beyond-bitcoin-hangouts). We aim to become like the CSPAN of cryptocurrencies that give their stakeholder’s power over how the ecosystem is constructed. For this reason we make our hangouts open for anyone who wants to enter and ask questions/learn from each other.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""'Digital currencies' aren't needed to explain why distributed ledgers are important. In this post, IBM's Richard Gendal Brown develops an argument for replicated shared ledgers from first principles.\n\nThis is intended to be an 'education piece' aimed at those, particularly in the finance industry, who prefer explanations of new technologies to be rooted in a description of a real-world business problem rather than beginning with a description of a purported solution.\n\nSo, in this piece, you’ll find no mention of digital currencies, because it turns out you don’t need them to derive an argument for distributed ledger technologies.\n\nWe’ll start with banking systems\n\nStart by thinking about today’s banking systems. In what follows, I use a bank deposit and payments example. But the same logic applies everywhere you look, as I’ll argue later.\n\nLet’s imagine a world with three banks: Bank A, Bank B and Bank C and two customers, Customer A and Customer B. Each bank runs their own IT systems that they use to keep track of balances. This is a world very much like today.\n\nSo Bank A’s systems record the balances for Bank A’s customers, Bank B’s systems record the balances for Bank B’s customers and so on.\n\nPerhaps the picture looks something like this:\n\nTwo immediate observations jump out:\n\nFirst, look at Banks A and B . Bank A ’s systems record that it is owed £1m by Bank B . And Bank B ’s systems also record this fact: they record that Bank B owes £1m to Bank A . So the same information is recorded twice, by two independently developed, maintained and operated systems. And in other domains, this duplication is much greater and more expensive, as we’ll discuss below.\n\nand . ’s systems record that it is owed £1m by . And ’s systems also record this fact: they record that owes £1m to . So the same information is recorded twice, by two independently developed, maintained and operated systems. And in other domains, this duplication is much greater and more expensive, as we’ll discuss below. Secondly, look at Customer A. They are owed money by Banks A and C and are overdrawn at Bank B. Put another way, Banks A and C owe money to Customer A. Who records this fact? Banks A and C! We take this situation for granted but it does seem very odd that Customer A has to trust both that the bank will be good for the money and that the bank’s records will be accurate. That feels like a conflict of interest, if ever there was one …\n\nSo we have two interesting phenomena: deposit-makers have to trust their banks to be good for the money and to account for things correctly. And the banks themselves have to spend a lot of time and money developing systems that all do pretty much the same thing – and then spend even more time and money checking with each other to make sure their systems agree on common facts.\n\nEven in our simple example, there are potentially seven separate matching entries to be verified.\n\nBanking 'facts' are usually recorded by at least two different entities and an expensive process of reconciliation is needed to make sure each party’s view of the world is the same.\n\nIt’s not just bank deposits. Securities and Derivatives Markets have the same pattern\n\nThis story is about bank deposits. But exactly the same story could be told about securities systems and derivatives systems.\n\nIndeed, in the latter case, the problem could be even worse: not only do we need to be sure everybody agrees on who has done which deals with whom, we also need to be sure that their systems agree on the resulting obligations that arise – they also have to agree on the business logic.\n\nThink about how many near-identical systems exist across the financial landscape, each one working slightly differently and producing ever-so-slightly different results that have to be investigated and resolved. It’s hugely expensive.\n\nBack to the banking story\n\nBut let’s focus on the banking example for now.\n\nYou can do something really interesting with the five ledgers we’ve been working with. You can write them a different way, with all the same information stored in a single table, rather than spread across five different tables:\n\nThe five separate ledgers on the left can be written, exactly equivalently, as the single table on the right – and vice versa. You can derive one from the other. The only difference is that the table on the right has an extra column so we can record both the issuer and the holder of a claim.\n\nIn other words, rather than having a partial view of the world held by each bank, we could have a single table that records everything and achieve the same outcome.\n\nSo why not just have a single banking ledger for the world?\n\nThis raises an interesting question. If it’s so expensive and complicated for each bank to run its own system that contains its own narrow view of the world – and then have to check it matches the other systems where the facts overlap – why not just pay somebody to run a single ledger that everybody agrees will be authoritative?\n\nAfter all, as we showed above, any bank that wanted to could easily derive its own view of the world from this mega-table, completely trivially.\n\nOf course, we’d have to give thought to how to mediate access to the ledger – who is allowed to observe or update which records – but we know how to do that … and it’s not an impossible problem.\n\nAre you mad?\n\nNow, it is tempting to say that such a thing would be insane: imagine how powerful would be the firm who ran such a system. And imagine the catastrophic implications for the world if there was a system outage!\n\nPerhaps the expensive, error-prone, but fundamentally decentralised and robust (anti-fragile?) system we have today is a price worth paying.\n\nBut an interesting question arises: what if there a way to achieve the benefits of a globally shared system but without having to grapple with the difficult political question of how to control an all-powerful operator or how to deal with the risk of an outage of such an important, central piece of infrastructure?\n\nPerhaps we can achieve this…\n\nThe replicated, shared ledger\n\nRemember what we achieved in the diagram above: we created a single table that could describe all bank balances and which was inherently shared: different actors had different permissions to update different parts of it.\n\nBut the worry in the section above was that a shared global ledger would be controlled by a single powerful entity and that this centralized system could be a systemic risk. So can we make two tweaks to the model?\n\nFirst , why not replicate the ledger massively. So, rather than one copy, have lots of copies. Perhaps one copy at every bank. So now there isn’t a single point of failure. We would have to worry about how those copies are kept in sync, of course, so this isn’t an unambiguous 'win' but having copies at each bank might also make integration with existing infrastructure somewhat easier, too. Perhaps this would also help ease adoption.\n\n, why not replicate the ledger massively. So, rather than one copy, have lots of copies. Perhaps one copy at every bank. So now there isn’t a single point of failure. We would have to worry about how those copies are kept in sync, of course, so this isn’t an unambiguous 'win' but having copies at each bank might also make integration with existing infrastructure somewhat easier, too. Perhaps this would also help ease adoption. Secondly, why not have those who participate in the system – maybe just the banks or maybe their customers too – also be jointly responsible for maintaining and securing it. We know who everybody else is in this world, after all, so we know whom to punish if they cheat. So we replace a single powerful entity with a model where everybody contributes to the system’s security.\n\nIf so, perhaps the picture would look like this:\n\nIf a single copy of the global, shared ledger is undesirable or risky, then replicating it to all the participants could give the best of both worlds. Now the problem becomes one of automatically keeping the systems in sync rather than manually reconciling and dealing with breaks.\n\nThe picture above looks superficially like the one I drew at the start of the article. But there’s a critically important difference. In this model, all participants have a copy of the ledger but only have the right to amend entries pertinent to them. So it is both replicated and shared.\n\nAnd so this is why I call this concept the 'replicated, shared ledger'. I think this wording is better at evoking the right mental model than 'distributed ledger', for example.\n\nAnd depending on whether you want to model balances, other assets or even agreements between parties, there are startups working on a project. I wrote a piece last year that attempted to make sense of the various players out there – and many more have emerged since then.\n\n'Smart contracts'\n\nIt it worth paying particular attention to the idea of adding business logic to this concept: so that the 'facts' being recorded aren’t just who owns what but actual agreements between parties.\n\nThis opens up the intriguing possibility of 'smart contracts': a world where derivatives counterparties agree that a shared piece of code represents the agreement they have made with each other and they execute it on the shared, replicated ledger – perhaps completely eliminating the need to build, maintain, operate and reconcile their own proprietary derivatives platforms?\n\nMaybe even allowing the code to take custody of assets on the ledger, to manage cashflows and margin automatically?\n\nOutstanding questions\n\nI should stress that this approach raises lots of technical questions: it’s not an unambiguously good idea.\n\nFor example, do we know that the underlying replication technology works as described? Under all plausible threat scenarios? How can we be sure that one bank (or customer) can’t see (or amend) another’s information? How much data would such a system hold? Would it scale? Is it really a good idea to model legal agreements in code rather than English?\n\nConclusion\n\nThere do appear to be multiple examples of expensively duplicated systems in multiple areas of the banking system.\n\nThe idea of a shared ledger holds promise, with replication by participants being a mechanism to reduce risk and mutualise its operation. But whether this argument holds in practice needs to be tested. So I fully expect to see more and more experimentation by banks and others in the coming months and years.\n\nAuthor's note: For the avoidance of doubt, in the piece above, I was not talking about Bitcoin – this post is about the domain I sometimes call the non-'Bitcoin-like-world', as defined in this post.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Richard's blog.

Set up in 2013, Weve collects the data from more than 20m mobile customers of Vodafone, EE and O2, allowing it to target advertising to specific groups and locations. The group also launched mobile money services and loyalty schemes using customers’ smartphones. The group’s creation came after a lengthy fight to secure antitrust approval from Brussels competition authorities as rivals argued that the combined resources of the three telecoms groups would prove unfairly strong. The company’s start-up costs were covered with an investment of almost £40m by the three operators who hoped it would allow them to compete in a sector dominated by US technology groups such as Google, Facebook and Twitter. However, just three years later Vodafone and EE are set to withdraw from the venture and sell what is left to O2, which is being bought by Hutchison Whampoa for £10.5bn, according to people familiar with the matter. O2 will continue to operate Weve as a wholly owned subsidiary, according to a person close to the talks. O2 will still offer access to its mobile contract customers, 6m customers from its Priority Moments scheme and 14m customers using O2 WiFi. The other two groups will focus on their own mobile payments and market platforms O2 declined to comment. EE and Vodafone were not immediately available for comment. The move is a symptom of the difficulties that mobile groups have faced in breaking in to the rapidly growing world of mobile advertising. Weve has also had to abort an attempt to launch a mobile money service in the face of steep competition from rival services launched by banks and technology groups such as Apple.  On paper, mobile groups should have an advantage because they already hold so much data on their customers from names, ages and addresses to browsing histories and real-time location tracking. By bringing the customers of Vodafone, EE and O2 together, Weve was able to draw on anonymised customer details for more than 21m people, which represents a valuable market for targeted advertising.

It worked with Tesco to send out targeted text messages to customers in certain store catchments. Most recently, Weve worked with the Electoral Commission to send out messages to the smartphones of people aged 18-25 to encourage them to register to vote. More than 200 brands used the messaging platform in the fourth quarter of 2013 and more than 60 per cent of those campaigns used its location services to pinpoint their campaigns. However, Weve made a loss in its first year of about £25m on revenues of about £13m. Most of its sales came from text-based advertising messaging with offers for customers. It employs about 90 people.', 'Kate Burgess MAY 3, 2015 0 Soft furnishings has often been a hard industry. But the Downton Abbey effect and nostalgia for a lost British era continue to lift many UK interior design businesses, helped by a gradual return of consumer confidence. Walker Greenbank, the Aim-quoted maker of upmarket wall and window coverings, has benefited more than most. Its shares have more than doubled since 2012. It has invested heavily in manufacturing facilities and new digital printing machines — spending more than £9m since 2010. But that expenditure should tail off over the next three years, says John Sach, chief executive, and the investment is already paying off in higher profits. Other British interiors groups have also improved. Shares in Laura Ashley, known for its sprigged cotton designs, have risen by a third in three years, while shares in Colefax, another fabrics group, are up two-thirds. A quarter of a century ago there were close to 40 manufacturers of furnishing fabrics and wallpapers in the UK. But a taste for minimalism and the age of beige took hold, forcing mills across Britain to close down. By 2000 even businesses representing the quintessential English country house look — such as Colefax and Osborne & Little — had moved production to France, Italy, Belgium or Asia. Laura Ashley stopped making its own fabrics about 15 years ago, keeping just a Welsh facility to make wallpapers and bespoke curtains. Walker Greenbank became about the last remaining manufacturer of printed wallcoverings and textiles of size in the UK. “There wasn’t a grand master plan to keep manufacturing,” says Mr Sach, who has run the company for 11 years. The business was in such dire straits that it could not afford to close the manufacturing side down, he admits. Walker Greenbank has only just used up the £24m in tax losses it accrued between 1998 and 2004 and only resumed paying a dividend five years ago But retaining manufacturing plants in Britain — which was deemed a disadvantage a decade ago — has been turned to its advantage, says Mr Sach. Production costs in the UK have fallen, while those in emerging markets have risen. At the same time, Walker Greenbank is manufacturing other companies’ brands, which has provided an extra income stream, spread its costs, and helped to maintain margins. Its Lancashire and Leicestershire mills now roll out its own Zoffany, Morris, Sanderson and Harlequin printed papers and fabrics as well as other brands — including lines for Burberry, Liberty, Osborne & Little and Colefax. Manufacturing profits were up by a fifth to £3.7m in the year to January, accounting for nearly half of group profits, after stripping out a £1m charge for a long-term incentive plan for the management. Walker Greenbank is also reaping the benefits of its brands being upmarket but not too rarefied. By contrast, Laura Ashley, which has a more price conscious mid-market customer base, unveiled a 1.5 per cent drop in sales from its decorating division in the year to the end of January. And at the top end, Colefax’s first-half revenues were down 4 per cent to £37m to October 2014, largely through currency weakness on non-UK sales. Still, many of the clouds that shadow Colefax also hang over Walker Greenbank. Colefax is concerned about the effects on UK sales of this week’s election, with the possibility of a new mansion tax proposed by Labour compounding the effect of higher stamp duty on the upper end of the UK housing market. West End interior designers fret, too, about how political and economic difficulties in Russia and Ukraine could affect business in eastern Europe and London. Walker Greenback, which last year launched its Anthology brand — described by Mr Sach as “glitzy”— specifically to appeal to Russian and Chinese buyers, could suffer as much as any. The company thinks it has something its rivals lack — an expanding manufacturing base that will make it more resilient over the long term. Having tasted the group’s recovery, investors will hope it is now only Walker Greenbank’s fabrics that reflect a bygone era — and not its performance.']"
05/04/2015,"['You shouldn’t trust anyone with your bitcoins, and Case is well aware of that. Over the past few years, Mt.Gox, Bitstamp and countless other centralized services have suffered serious security breaches. But Case is about to put an end to all this, as this startup has built one of the most secure hardware bitcoin wallets in the world. The startup is launching onstage today at Disrupt NY.\n\n“There’s no easy and secure way to use bitcoin. You’re either getting security, or you’re getting ease of use,” co-founder and CEO Melanie Shapiro told me. Case wants to provide both — security and ease of use.\n\nCase is a small credit card-shaped device with a tiny screen, a fingerprint sensor, a camera, a built-in GSM chip and a few buttons. Any time you want to make a bitcoin transaction, you press the bitcoin button, scan the QR code with the camera, swipe your finger and you’re done. Everything happens on the device; you don’t have to log in with a complicated password or use a smartphone app. You can even buy and sell bitcoins from this device.\n\nBehind the scenes, Case provides a highly secured multi-signature wallet. You need two signatures to make a transaction. When you first start your Case device, you generate a private key on the device itself, and this key will stay on your device forever. “We don’t generate that private key — the device doesn’t come pre-populated with a private key,” Shapiro said.\n\nCase also stores a key in its encrypted online database. Transactions are only signed by the server if the fingerprint scan matches your biometric data. The small device communicates with these servers using its built-in GSM chip. Case works like the Kindle with 3G connectivity, meaning that you can use the device in more than a hundred countries around the world without having to pay for a subscription.\n\nBut what if you lose your Case wallet? As you need two signatures to send bitcoins using Case, you won’t be able to recover your bitcoins. But fortunately the startup has a backup plan. It also stores a third key in an offline vault. You can retrieve this key after proving your identity to the company.\n\nCase will cost $199 and will ship this summer after more than a year of hard work. The company is only starting to take pre-orders now. “We’ve seen a lot of hardware flops,” Shapiro said. “We wanted to be able to build the entire thing — the software, the firmware, the hardware. We are at that point now where we feel confident accepting pre-orders.”\n\ncase4 case13 case12 case11 case10 case9 case8 case7 case6 case5 View Slideshow Previous Next Exit\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nJudges: Noah Lichtenstein (Cowboy Ventures), Jessica Livingston (Y Combinator), Shana Fisher (Highline Venture Partners) and Heidi Messer (Collective[i]).\n\nNoah Lichtenstein: How much does it cost?\n\nAnswer: It costs $199.\n\nHeidi Messer: Isn’t the pricing of the hardware going to make it impossible for emerging markets to get its benefit?\n\nAnswer: Right now we’re selling to consumers and most of the interest we can get is in the U.S. But also we are targeting institutional partnerships as well. The price point for a security device is accurate right now. However, the reason I got into bitcoin in the first place is the social impact.\n\nJessica Livingston: I’d love to hear more about the genesis of the idea. How did you think this is what I want to do?\n\nAnswer: I was a victim of bitcoin hacking. And I first heard about bitcoin when I was doing my PhD in consumer behavior. A lot of the conversations I was having were centered around this thing called bitcoin. I wanted to build something that wouldn’t scare of customers. What if you built a device that looks like a credit card? I made my credit card my design model. It should look like a credit card, it should be as easy to use as a credit card. So that’s where we began.\n\nShana Fisher: What do you think of the better funded further ahead wallets the talk about cold storage disconnected from the Internet?\n\nAnswer: The benefit of our device over traditional web wallets is security. Our devices are embedded. Everything that we wrote lives on the firmware. You don’t have to trust any app. It’s a multi-signature wallet and there are three keys. Being in possession one of the keys is a lot, you own it, you feel it. That is very empowering.\n\nJason Kincaid: Can you break into the firmware and get the physical token?\n\nAnswer: In the events that your device is compromised and for some reason your key is extracted from the device, that’s just one of three keys and you can’t spend anything.\n\nJason Kincaid: You built this firmware yourself. How do I know that this is most secure than other solutions. Why do I trust you?\n\nAnswer: We are building it for the ground up and you can trust us. We’re also open sourcing the software closer to the date of the shipment. We’re finishing the auditing process.\n\nHeidi Messer: Will you support other currencies?\n\nAnswer: That’s definitely something we’re looking into.', 'The New York Times Magazine published a meaty feature this weekend asking the question, “Can Bitcoin take over Argentina?”\n\nThe article follows a long tradition of bitcoin reportage, filled with detailed accounts of swashbuckling early adopters and traders of the virtual currency, many of whom made a pretty penny as the dollar value of bitcoin rose to great heights in the fall of 2013 before crashing shortly thereafter. Still, at roughly $230 per bitcoin, the virtual currency is valued at roughly twice of what it was two years ago.\n\nIn the introduction to the Times Magazine’s money issue, Adam Davidson describes the emergence of bitcoin as a truly revolutionary development that is confounding central bankers, writing, “the Federal Reserve has no idea how much money is out there, at least in all its digital forms, or how fast the overall supply is growing. This is alarming, because the whole concept behind the Fed is to monitor and control the money supply.”\n\nBitcoin, Davidson argues, is a central force in the decentralization of money. He continues:\n\nThe authority to create, move and define money — once confined to central banks and treasury departments — is being dispersed to an odd mix of entrepreneurs, libertarian hackers and old-line banking institutions. Even for the most technologically skeptical, this monetary chaos isn’t something we can choose to avoid. It’s a new and pivotal force in our economy, and it will change the way we work and live.\n\nBitcoin sure is changing the way some people work and live in Argentina. The nation has a long history of macroeconomic policy mismanagement, going back to at least the 1930s. And Argentina is once again under the grip of inflation. Officially, the Argentine government allows its citizens to trade $11 for 100 Argentine pesos. But on the black market, the dollar is even more expensive. Such a market thrives because of the onerous capital controls the Argentine government imposed in 2011, all in an effort to combat the latest bout of inflation in South America’s third largest country.\n\nAnd so Argentines, at least the most technologically savvy of them, are turning to bitcoin as a way to exchange their pesos for what they’re actually worth, rather than what the government says they should be worth. Bitcoin, in other words, is simply a way for Argentines to make an end-run around the banking system, which works with the Argentine government to force its citizens to use the ever-devaluing peso. This is illegal behavior by any other name, but Argentines, like bitcoin broker Dante Castiglione, aren’t worried. “He takes comfort from the fact that, at least for now, the Argentine government has bigger problems to deal with,” according to the Times.\n\nBut the Times presents the issue of bitcoin use in Argentina entirely backward. It is probably a good thing that enterprising folks in underdeveloped economies, like Argentina and Kenya, have a way of avoiding some of the most onerous effects of their government’s policies. But if bitcoin were to really “take over Argentina,” that would be the very sad result of the Argentine government’s inability to put in place broadly beneficial economic policies and to reform its institutions so that the Argentine economy actually works.\n\nMeanwhile, Davidson overstates the case that bitcoin is really revolutionizing the creation of money. Central banks have always had a much more collaborative role in managing the money system than many believe. Most money in America today, for instance, is created by banks when they extend credit to their customers. The Federal Reserve can encourage that behavior by setting interest rates, but it was never intended to have an iron-clad grip on the process.\n\nAnd while bank credit and bitcoins are forms of money, their worth is inextricably tied to fiat money for the simple reason that tax obligations can only be satisfied with currencies endorsed by governments. That’s why when a business says it accepts bitcoin as a payment, they’re usually fudging the truth. In reality, these businesses partner with one of a few bitcoin exchanges, which immediately convert that revenue to dollars.', ""It has been a long time coming, but as of this morning, the publicly traded shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust have officially started trading under the ticker GBTC.

However, there hadn’t been any asks, or offers to sell shares.

Some users have said that a simplistic approach will not yield the best results, while others have said that the decreasing cost of storage space will compensate for the increase in block sizes.\n\nAndresen has been talking about the problem since last October, when he wrote in a blog post:\n\nMy best guess is that we’ll run into the 1 megabyte block size limit during the next price bubble, and that is one of the reasons I’ve been spending time working on implementing floating transaction fees for Bitcoin Core. Most users would rather pay a few cents more in transaction fees rather than waiting hours or days (or never!) for their transactions to confirm because the network is running into the hard-coded blocksize limit.\n\nWhile the “floating transaction fee” feature was introduced in February, it does not guarantee, as Andresen has astutely addressed, that all transactions will find their way into a block. However, larger blocks do accomplish the goal of a “simple solution.”\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Getting Serious? MIT Partially Funding Bitcoin Core Development\n\nNot Everyone Happy With The 20MB Idea\n\nThe debate will, of course, continue on. The comments on the commit inferred as much, with one user saying:\n\nSeriously Gavin, who do you think you are? Stop parading around the globe trying to dupe everyone into accepting this change. Do you seriously think you have the authority to take away my (and every other current holder of bitcoin’s) rightfully deserved privilege of getting a transaction in before others? What makes you think I want to or have the means to purchase more storage space and processing power to run my full node? What makes you think everyone has the bandwidth to handle this update? You’re losing any shred of credibility you once had by pursuing this nonsense.\n\nIt is hard to determine if this user was being serious, of course. Proposed changes do not necessarily make it into the final code. The nature of open source is that majority will rule. As with other changes that have been instituted by Bitcoin developers in the past, it is a matter of how many actually install the changes. Other users felt the changes are needed, and that Andresen at least fleshing out the code that would allow them is a step in the right direction:\n\nGreat work Gavin. Your earlier tests had me sold. Glad someone finally taking a stand and pushing for this needed change.\n\nI think this is a great change. By March 2016 the cost of hardware will continue to go down and I think the barrier to entry to running a full node will go down to the $50-$80 dollar level. Couple this with near-unlimited bandwidth given by home internet providers and we’ll have a situation where we’ll be able to a) support the network growth and b) still have a healthy degree of decentralisation due to consumer nodes. For everything else we’ll still have pruning and off-chain transactions.\n\nCertainly Bitcoin Core development has a responsibility to keep the protocol competitive with other large payment processors. If some feel the core developer, who has been working intimately with Bitcoin since the days of Satoshi Nakamoto, is being heavy-handed, still others feel that someone has to say it, and it might as well be the most authoritative voice to do so.\n\nWhat do you think? Can the network live with slow transaction times, or is this a move in the right direction?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""According to mathematician Meni Rosenfeld, Israel is a Bitcoin “forerunner.” With large numbers of users in the country, the number of startups and merchants continues to grow. Rosenfeld says:\n\n“I think the Bitcoin community in Israel is more coherent than in many other places in the world, which can be attributed to the small size of the country. Everyone is in driving distance from anyone else, so its much easier to breed communities that actually meet up and cooperate.”\n\nAmong the list of Israel-based startups, Bits of Gold — in which Rosenfeld is an investor — GetGems and Polycoin lead adoption.\n\nBitcoin Service Provider Bits of Gold\n\nBits of Gold LTD initially started out as an exchange, and now allows users to purchase or sell BTC via wire transfers, cash transfers and credit cards on the day an order is created. For users without bitcoin wallets, the startup has their own wallet service, Bits of Gold Mycelium Wallet on Android, where users can easily link their account to the exchange.\n\nFollowing the successful launch of the exchange, Bits of Gold began to operate the first ever bitcoin ATM in Israel. The ATM is located in Tel Aviv’s Bitcoin Embassy, a co-working space where enthusiasts openly discuss cryptocurrencies and related events.\n\nCurrently, Bits of Gold also provides a “check out with bitcoin” service for merchants that wish to accept the currency. However, applications are only reviewed after a merchant reaches out to the company directly.\n\nCoinTelegraph asked the Founder of Bits of Gold Jonathan Rouach to share more details:\n\nCoinTelegraph: What are your personal opinions about the bitcoin industry and ecosystem in Israel?\n\nJonathan Rouach: Israel is predominant in the international Bitcoin scene. We boast many experienced technologists and entrepreneurs in cryptography, security, payment, networking, hardware, finance.\n\nThe industry is becoming specialized, with teams building essential infrastructure: Spondoolies-Tech for high efficiency mining, SimplexCC for fraud-safe credit-card processing with Bitcoin, Colu and Coinspark for issuing digital assets on the blockchain (colored coins), Bitrated for consumer protection and reputation while using Bitcoin, LedgerLock (Bits of Gold's technology branch) for securing digital assets against internal theft.\n\nCT: How many merchants are currently using the checkout with bitcoin service? Do you expect the numbers of bitcoin merchants to increase over the next few months?\n\nJR: With the help of Meni Rosenfeld, our advisor and the chairman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association, we’re now building our merchant solution, and are in talks with large commercial venues to bring Bitcoin to many stores at once. We’ve already had a pilot with 300 restaurants in Israel (through OpenRest [an online menu and order management system for resturants]), and we’re thinking of ways to put bitcoins in more hands for daily use.\n\nRouach added:\n\n“Bits of Gold is Israel’s bridge to Bitcoin, focused on high-quality service and adherence to regulations, which we’re helping to establish. We recently closed a seed round of $400K, to help foster digital assets in Israel.”\n\nGetGems Messaging App\n\nGetGems, a social messaging app launched in October 2014 at Inside Bitcoins Tel Aviv is similar to Whatsapp, except for two additional features. One’s username can be used as an alias for the in-app wallet bitcoin address, and users can earn gems tokens for growing the network. The token can then be converted to bitcoins.\n\nBased on the Counterparty protocol, Gems accounts are connected with Counterwallet, and the username is an alias to the wallet address as a domain name is an alias to website IP, making sending and receiving Gems and bitcoins between users as easy as possible.\n\nOn April 28, GetGems finally received approval from Apple and launched their iOS platform in the App Store. Co-Founder and CEO Daniel Peled stated:\n\n”We are now able to devote our efforts to the attention economy and referral system, within the GetGems app.”\n\nCoinTelegraph asked Peled to share more.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Gems allows users to send bitcoins to each other like they can send messages. Are all accounts connected to Counterwallet? Or can users link their existing bitcoin wallets?\n\nDaniel Peled: Yes, all GetGems users automatically get their own wallet, protected by the passphrase chosen on registration, which can also be used at www.counterwallet.io. The social network username is an alias to the GetGems address, making sending & receiving bitcoins between users as easy as possible.\n\nAdditional technical information: The Android and iOS bitcoin clients [use] SPV (simplified payment verification), and the wallets are connected directly to the bitcoin network, removing the need for trusted servers, while maintaining much faster performance on mobile devices. Unlike other well-known iOS bitcoin wallets, GetGems SPV wallets insure trustless decentralization of bitcoin payments.\n\nCT: What is the estimated number of users in the GetGems Android and iOS applications?\n\nDP: During the beta testing phase, over 3,000 users of Android devices have been testing each update, including the referral functions and providing extremely valuable feedback to the development team.\n\nWhen the iOS version was released on the Apple app store last week, there were close to 1,500 users who downloaded the iOS app for iPhone and iPad, and now we are anticipating dramatic growth in the number of users, as new features are added and it becomes apparent that the users are making money on their referrals to new users.\n\nCT: Are conferences and meetups in Israel really as active as people say? What are some of your personal opinions on the bitcoin industry and ecosystem in Israel?\n\nDP: Yes, activity around the technology and use of bitcoin and bitcoin-related businesses is continuing to grow at a rapid pace. The Bitcoin em?assy is a key player, hosting public meetups and activities such as: Satoshi Square — a weekly face-to-face event to sell and buy bitcoins, weekly live instructions — “How to open your first Bitcoin E-wallet” and other social gatherings to help new users enter the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is the gap GetGems is aiming to bridge.\n\nInterest in technologies such as the type we are developing, as well as other Israeli Bitcoin startups, is the leading edge and has attracted interest and investment from the venture capital community. This atmosphere is very conducive to both investment and mobile digital currency development.\n\nPayment Processor Polycoin\n\nPolycoin is a bitcoin payment processing company founded in 2014 by Alfred Shaffir and Sergei Kovalov. The platform is similar to that of other global bitcoin processing platforms such as Bitpay, GoCoin and Coinbase. However, Polycoin has a feature that has not been introduced yet by others: bi-directional transactions.\n\nWith bi-directional transactions, merchants can both deposit and withdraw funds in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Co-Founder and CEO Alfred Shaffir believes that this feature will be favorable to businesses in the gaming industry and for online financial brokers.\n\nMerchants\n\nIsrael has hundreds of bitcoin-accepting merchants, according to a report from the Israeli Bitcoin Association. However, at this time only 65 are listed on Coinmap.org, including local coffee shops, restaurants, design and photography studios, bars, schools and a university. Bits of Gold is hopng to change that.\n\nRosenfield explained further:"", 'London photographer Abby Scarlet has embarked on a six month challenge during which she will only accept work from clients willing to pay her in bitcoin.\n\nSitting in her colourful studio in a warehouse in North London, Scarlet – who\'s approximately two weeks into her bitcoin-only endeavour – opened up about her discovery of the digital currency and her personal quest to spread its adoption.\n\nBitcoin \'head-first\'\n\n""I was thrown into bitcoin head-first,"" said Scarlet.\n\nAnecdotally, Scarlet explained how she shared a house in Brighton – a seaside hotspot in the UK – with a bitcoin miner and a bitcoin enthusiast last year.\n\n""He [the bitcoin miner] had all these machines and I didn\'t know what they were. I actually turned them off when I got home once because they were making so much noise. He came in and started yelling, asking what I was doing. I didn\'t realise he was actually mining digital currency.""\n\nThough her initial introduction to bitcoin was somewhat humorous, Scarlet now refers to the currency as ""mind blowing"", noting how it can be used to do good in the world.\n\nWhat really sold her, however, was the community built around bitcoin.\n\n""I was exposed to all the reddit and sub-reddit forums. Reading how the people in bitcoin were supportive of each other, how some took on voluntary roles without payment as an incentive really caught my attention. I have never been part of such a huge community where everyone wants to help each other.""\n\nThe photographer reiterated that the bitcoin community had ""been amazing, really uplifting"" following the announcement of her challenge.\n\nSpreading the word\n\nThis is not the first time Scarlet has set out to spread the word about the digital currency.\n\nWhile living in Brighton, she had helped Flawless Clothing, a local shop, get its first bitcoin ATM.\n\nOne could argue that her open-minded approach and her unique way of seeing the world through her camera lens were the driving forces behind her bitcoin challenge.\n\n""I believe that artists see the world slightly different to people who don\'t practise art. Maybe we see a light in something that nobody else really sees, perhaps with bitcoin its the same.""\n\nIt soon became apparent, however, that her bitcoin-only adventure is much more than an artistic vision. Scarlet is not just talk, she\'s action.\n\nHaving realised how bitcoin could potentially transform traditional finance, she decided to take matters into her own hands, telling clients about the digital currency and outlining its benefits.\n\n""There is a live music event that I photograph every month, I told the organisers about bitcoin, got them in touch with trader friends and now their flyers include the bitcoin symbol and they accept it at their food and bar stalls at gigs. They have been really supportive of me.""\n\nShooting for bitcoin\n\nHowever, Scarlet\'s challenge is not without risks. She was fully aware that it could potentially result in the loss of her frequent clients, mainly model portraits and wedding shoots.\n\nWhen asked about whether she would turn away clients unwilling to pay in bitcoin, she said: ""Unfortunately, I have to. I have been really trying to, not convert people to bitcoin, but ease them into it and show them how it all works.""\n\nShe noted that her business has not suffered dramatically, quickly pointing out that her workload remains ""more or less"" the same as when she was also accepting payment in fiat.\n\nScarlet is currently contracted by Fork the Banks, a charity album released by Occupy London, a movement that fights for a new political and economic order that prioritises people, democracy and the environment over profit.\n\nDuring her interview with CoinDesk, Scarlet shot UrbanD Soul, for the project. Both musicians, Romain and Enji told CoinDesk they liked the idea of bitcoin but were not entirely convinced.\n\nRomain said: ""Perhaps I am too French to believe in bitcoin.""\n\nIt was not all skepticism on the shoot, however. Lee Smith, project manager at Fork the Banks, told a different story, noting how the digital currency and the blockchain could potentially overhaul the art world, giving artists more control over the work and their revenue.\n\nSmith will be paying Scarlet in bitcoin. He said:\n\n""Everything that empowers the people and frees us from the middle man is a good idea.""\n\nFuture plans\n\nScarlet has undoubtedly set out to encourage bitcoin use, but before we see mainstream adoption, she said, there is one underlying issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nAccessibility, she noted, is a real problem. ""The average person does not know much about it. If they go online, they are mainly going to read all these negative articles. I want somewhere where people can go and get information.""\n\nTo overcome this, Scarlet is planning on using some of her bitcoin funds to set up a coffee shop where she would also like to hold bitcoin meetups and house a commission-free bitcoin ATM.\n\nImages via Yessi Bello Perez for CoinDesk.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'A new digital currency mining chip is being released next week that the manufacturer believes will severely decrease the amount of electricity needed to mine bitcoin, an important factor for miners.\n\nAccording to Marshall Long, the CTO of FinalHash, a mining consulting firm, “these new chips will allow hobbyists to get back in the game. Power to the miners.”\n\nThe new chip is being manufactured by SFARDS, a new company formed from the merger of two other Bitcoin mining companies, Gridseed and WiiBox. Gridseed was a mining chip and hardware manufacturer, while WiiBox developed software and hardware for controlling mining rigs. According to Long, Frank Li is leading the team that is bringing this chip to market.\n\n“This chip outperforms everything on the market by about 40 percent, give or take, on the bitcoin side, and about 130 percent on the litecoin side. Plus, you can mine both at the same time,” Long said.\n\nThe chip requires only 0.331 watts/GH, which is a measure of the electricity required to perform hashing operations. According to Long, this makes the new chip the most efficient ever produced. At the same time it mines bitcoin, the new chip will mine litecoin using 2.9 watts/MH.\n\nMany companies have attempted to make more advanced, efficient chips, but SFARDS used an experimental technology to reach these levels. According to Long, the company used a process called Fully Depleted Silicon on Insulator, otherwise known as FDSOI.\n\nWhile most chips are made entirely on silicon, this process allows for alternating layers of silicon and silicon dioxide. Long explained that this “allows you to take a design and, with no alterations in the design ,use this manufacturing process to keep the power consumption to a minimum.”\n\nWhile it works in theory, no manufacturer has been able to do this method at scale, a fact Long admitted was a concern for SFARDS. “However, the 100 sample chips I saw were flawless,” he said. Long visited the SFARDS production facility in Beijing to test the chip in person and pick up some development boards.\n\nSFARDS aims to release two production units. The first is a single chip USB miner for the average consumer who wants to experiment with mining. The second is a 16- or 24-chip full miner that is meant for enthusiasts and large-scale mining operations. Further, SFARDS plans to ship 50 development boards next week to developers who will be able to tweak the hardware to try to create an even more efficient chip.\n\nAccording to Long, the optimal setting to run the chip is at 0.062V, which allows each chip to reach the capacity of 100GH/s, coming out to the 0.331 watts/GH. Long explained that he tested the chip in an open environment which enabled the chip to remain around 49.2 degrees Celsius; however, he admitted that in an enclosed environment the heat might be much greater.\n\nBecause this chip can mine both bitcoin and litecoin simultaneously, there are two sides to it. On the bitcoin side, it has 160 processing cores, while on the litecoin side, it has 125 processing cores. It also has on-chip RAM.\n\nIs There Demand?\n\nThe mining industry has shrunken dramatically over the past six months due to the low price of bitcoin. On January 1, 2015, cloud mining company and GHash.IO mining pool operator CEX.IO announced that it was temporarily suspending cloud mining operations due to the bitcoin price drop. As the price has fallen lower, electricity costs and mining efficiency has become an even more important factor for miners. However, a new generation of high-efficiency chips, including this one from SFARDS, is in development.\n\n“I have personally already talked to many major farms, and many are excited,” Long said. “SFARDS is being cautious, and batch one will be produced only in a quantity of around three petahash. And they will limit each customer to a small amount so everyone can try it out. However, big farms will be allowed towards mid-summer to order in bulk.”\n\nDue to the chip being in the final PCB design phase, Long wasn’t yet sure what the price for the chip would be. He did say, however, that the price would be competitive and that, “I personally expect the first miners to be finished and ready to be shipped in under one month’s time from today.”\n\nWhen it does launch, FinalHash, Dual Miner, and a few other distributors will be allowed to sell both units.', 'BELIZE CITY, Belize, May 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Bitcoin exchange service 247exchange.com and its partner MoneyPolo™, large money transfer network, represent an innovative instant method of purchasing and withdrawing bitcoins – using express money transfer.

Even though most Bitcoin enthusiasts would like to see the world transition to a cashless system where all goods and services are priced in BTC instead of relying on a fiat currency value, which will not happen anytime soon. But it has to be said that Chip Chap is making a strong effort to push Bitcoin adoption.\n\nAlso read: Two Bitcoin ATMs Installed at Outpost Game Centers in Belgium\n\nBitcoin and the Western World\n\nSpreading Bitcoin in the Western world is not as easy as most companies originally assumed. If you take a closer look at the financial infrastructure we have in North America and Europe, Bitcoin is trying to solve a problem a lot of people don’t even know there. We are quite spoiled with the range of payment methods we can use in both the online and offline space, ranging from bank cards to credit cards, Paypal to SOFORT and so on.\n\nHowever, all of that does not mean the current financial system is perfect, as there is a lot of room for various areas of improvement. If there is anything the most recent financial crisis learned the population, it is that people are looking differently at banks and other institutions compared to a decade ago. The trust between customer and central banks is all but gone, and people are slowly starting to explore alternative options.\n\nWhether or not that will pave the way for new and disruptive technologies such as Bitcoin, remains to be seen. But there are quite a few companies in the Western world trying to push Bitcoin adoption to new heights, by merging it with existing infrastructure. Chip Chap is one of those companies, as they have added 4,000 Polish bank ATM’s to their global ATM network.\n\nChip Chap – Unifying Bitcoin and Existing Infrastructure\n\nChip Chap is an interesting company, as they have come up with a way to combine existing Bank ATMs and Bitcoin in Spain and Poland. In order to use the services provided by Chip Chap, users need to download the mobile application [currently only available for the Android operating system], which lets you convert payments into cash.\n\nEven though Chip Chap also operates in France, England and Mexico, the Bitcoin voucher functionality is only available in Poland and Spain. At the time of publication, we have not received an official confirmation on whether or not the other countries will make use of this feature in the future. Other supported payment methods include popular services such as Ukash, NetPay, Paysafecard and Halcash, among a few others.\n\nThe way the Chip Chap service works is that it will generate a voucher that does not require you to own a bank account or a credit card in order to redeem. Vouchers are generated by trading your currency – in the form of Paysafecard or Ukash for example – and convert those to Bitcoin. In turn, your Bitcoin amount is converted into a voucher, which can then be redeemed at any of the supported ATMs in Spain or Poland.\n\nUsing the Chip Chap App\n\nOne of the key areas about Chip Chap’s mobile application is the level of ease-of-use. Buying and selling Bitcoin is far from user-friendly at this point in time, yet Chip Chap has managed to make it very easy to do via their mobile app. Users just need to select their country, enter their phone number and the amount they would like to withdraw, and then send the corresponding amount of BTC to a generated Bitcoin address.\n\nAs soon as the Bitcoin transaction has completed, a voucher code will be generated in the Chip Chap app that can then be redeemed at any of the participating ATMs. Users can redeem these vouchers at ATMs from banks such as ING Direct, HalCash, Banco Popular, and many others. It is also important to note it takes just two confirmation on the Bitcoin transaction before the voucher will be generated.\n\nOffering such a service could prove to quite risky given the pending regulation on digital currency in the European Union. But Chip Chap app users need not worry, as the company is compliant with PCI-DSS, AML and CFT requirements. Do keep in mind that Chip Chap does not store user funds, but the service makes it easier to exchange between digital payments and physical currency.\n\nSource: Reddit\n\nAll images courtesy of Chip Chap']"
05/05/2015,"[""Today federal regulators announced a fine (PDF) of $700,000 against cryptocurrency company Ripple Labs for failing to register as a money service business. Ripple Labs built a payment transfer platform that people can use to move real or virtual money, and the company maintains its own cryptocurrency, called XRP II, which loosely compares to Bitcoin. (Unlike Bitcoin, XRP was fully generated before it went on the market, so an equivalent to Bitcoin miners doesn't exist in XRP.)\n\nFurther Reading US regulator: Bitcoin exchanges must comply with money-laundering laws In the cryptocurrency world, XRP was second only to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization in 2015, according to the settlement (PDF) reached between Ripple and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a branch of the US Department of the Treasury. FinCEN accused the company of violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to register as a Money Services Business while selling XRP and failing to set up an adequate anti-money laundering program. In 2013, FinCEN ruled that virtual currencies had to be properly registered with the US government and take steps to combat money laundering.\n\nIn addition to the $700,000 fine, Ripple will have to comply with all the rules and regulations set down by FinCEN for money-transferring companies, in addition to reviewing the last three years of its transactions for suspicious activity. The company must also submit to audits of its practices every two years until 2020.\n\nRipple's founder, Jed McCaleb, has founded other companies that have been met with controversy. He created the eDonkey filesharing platform around the time that Napster found itself in hot water, and he created the now-notorious Mt. Gox in 2010, but sold it to Mark Karpeles before the company crumbled and went bankrupt. McCaleb left Ripple Labs in 2013. He did not return Ars' request for comment.\n\nRipple Lab's spokesperson, Monica Long, told Ars in an e-mailed statement that Ripple Labs was happy to have the issue settled, but that FinCEN was focused on technicalities. “An early company in an emerging, undefined fintech category, Ripple Labs was one of the first to proactively build out a compliance and risk program,” Long wrote. “We’ve been consistent in our message of supporting a compliant and healthy Ripple ecosystem. We have not willfully engaged in criminal activity, nor has the company been prosecuted.”\n\n”Ripple is infrastructure technology for banks to build compliant payment networks,” she continued. “The settlement announced today does not impede our ability to execute on those bank integrations. We’re continuing to focus on working towards an Internet of Value.”"", ""The publicly traded shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust have officially started trading on the public markets, Bitcoin startup Case has launched its Bitcoin hardware wallet on-stage at TechCrunch Disrupt NY, and more top stories from May 5.\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust’s GBTC Begins Trading on Public Markets\n\nThe publicly traded shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) have officially started trading under the ticker GBTC.

According to Andresen, not raising the block size limit will soon lead to clocking of the Bitcoin network, which would deter people from using Bitcoin.\n\nAndresen:\n\n“If the number of transactions waiting gets large enough, the end result will be an over-saturated network, busy doing nothing productive. I don’t think that is likely– it is more likely people just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable.”\n\nIsrael is at the ‘Leading Edge’ for Bitcoin Startups\n\nAccording to a recent BitPost interview with mathematician Meni Rosenfeld, Israel is a global “forerunner” when it comes to Bitcoin adoption and innovation. With large numbers of users in the country, the number of startups and merchants continues to grow. In a CoinTelegraph special, Joseph Young took a closer look at these companies, the people, and the merchants within the growing Middle Eastern Bitcoin hub.\n\nCoinzone Payment Solution to Launch Bitcoin Wallet for European Currencies\n\nEurope-based Bitcoin payment solution provider Coinzone will this summer launch a new Bitcoin wallet that will support European currencies. Coinzone has developed the wallet to address privacy and legal frameworks in operation across Europe, while it will feature multi-layer verifications.\n\nCEO and co-founder Manuel Heilmann said:\n\n“The Coinzone Wallet will be unique for a number of reasons, both at launch and also looking ahead to the future (…) For launch, our goal is to make it very easy to spend bitcoin. It’s a simple yet very crucial feature that is either missing or not easy to use in other wallets.”\n\nAdopting the Chain: How Tesla Could Protect its Website and its Cars\n\nFollowing a hack of Tesla's website, Mike Ward in an op-ed for CoinTelegraph suggests the company should opt for a blockchain based Domain Name System. And not just that. While Tesla's at it, it might as well secure its cars through blockchain technology as well!\n\nWard:\n\n“The blockchain is, in fact, a terrific place to store records related to the automobiles, precisely because of its tamper-proof nature. If Tesla were to run their own blockchain, with only approved nodes being able to mine blocks (publish transactions) they could house warranty and purchase information, ownership and leasing data, maintenance history, accident details and much more on-chain — all nicely timestamped and replicated across the network in a fashion that would be both tamper-resistant and convenient.”\n\nLeet Launches Gaming Platform with Bitcoin\n\nSkills-based eSports platform Leet has launched a gaming mode where players can battle it out against each other for Bitcoin. In order to take part, players need to first deposit bitcoins in their Leet wallet, after which they can play each other online for the cryptocurrency. Leet currently supports Counter Strike: Go, League of Legends, and it will soon add Minecraft Hunger Games.\n\nCryptocurrency Exchange Cryptsy Responds to CoinFire’s Allegations\n\nCoinfire published an article last week that accused cryptocurrency exchange Cryptsy of operating illegally in the majority of US states. Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon has now responded publicly, and accused CoinFire's investigation of being based on false premises. Vernon wrote that their company had never claimed to be fully licensed at state level, but was stringently following the Federal MSB requirements.\n\nVernon:"", 'There\'s a new cryptocurrency coming to the market.\n\nWhat makes it unique to existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?\n\nIt\'s backed by gold.\n\nAnthem Vault, the metals and technology company, will launch the coin on May 25.\n\nThe coin will ""be valued at 1 gram of gold at the day\'s market price, [and] will serve as a more secure store of value than Bitcoin,"" according to the press release. It will be called the Hayek, ""after the Nobel-winning Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek.""\n\nAnthem Blanchard, the CEO of Anthem Vault, told Business Insider that ""gold is arguably the most trusted store of value of all time,"" which is why he chose it to back his new cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen asked about the recent volatility in the price of gold, Blanchard said, ""If you look at last year, gold did go down in dollar terms, but it went up in almost any other currency terms."" He also noted that, ""Forex has gotten even more volatile, in the last 10-15 years, which is scary to me.""\n\nOne use case for the Hayek coin, says Blanchard, is an alternative payment system for people in developing countries with volatile currencies. They could pay each other with the equivalent value of gold, if they each had Hayek coin wallets.\n\nThe other use case, he said, is if there is a massive distributed denial of service attack on the modern financial system.\n\n""Talking with friends of mine in the intelligence agencies, they say this is a real threat,"" he said. An attacker (he used the Russians as an example), ""could create a massive DDoS attack, make the [financial] system inoperable. Ultimately this is how we rely on our payments.""\n\nIf a big attack hit the computers that clear payments in the banking system, people would be unable to pay for things. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies based on the same technology don\'t work like that. There\'s a decentralized system of confirming that a payment has been made, so systemic failure is (almost) theoretically impossible.\n\nEventually, Blanchard would like to branch beyond gold.\n\n“We want to ultimately make every metal spendable. You aren’t going to be able to take practical delivery of plutonium or uranium in your house. But there’s no reason why you couldn’t have ownership of that metal,"" he said.\n\nAre you ready for plutocoin?', 'ALERT:\n\nWhen Do You Think Christ Is Returning? Vote Now\n\nVOTE NOW:\n\nIs Christ Returning?\n\nURGENT:\n\nWhen Do You Think Christ Will Return? Vote Here Now!\n\nSome Bible prophecy advocates think Bitcoin — a form of digital currency — could become the ""Mark of the Beast"" mentioned in the New Testament\'s Book of Revelation.The Mark of the Beast is thought to be among the characteristics of the ""tribulation years,"" and some believe Bitcoin is in a position to fulfill the prophecy by becoming or morphing into the one-world currency the anti-Christ will use to gain economic control worldwide.However, not everyone agrees. Here are five reasons some say the Bitcoin cryptocurrency shouldn\'t be considered The Mark of the Beast: According to Catholic Online, Bitcoin\'s volatility, security issues and potential regulatory challenges raise questions as to whether it\'s just a fad.Each Bitcoin contains a ""blockchain"" that keeps a record of every transaction made using Bitcoin since the system was initiated in 2009. According to Omegashock, ""As Bitcoin gains in popularity and usage, each blockchain will increase in size. Right now the blockchain for most Bitcoins is over a gigabyte in size. In the future the Bitcoin blockchain will increase to more than a terabyte. And THAT is just not going to work — especially if you are trying to create a global currency.""Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman described Bitcoin as ""a bubble"" that lacks intrinsic value, according to Bloomberg . In December 2013, Greenspan said that Bitcoin\'s prices as being unsustainably high.He added, ""There is no fundamental issue of capabilities of repaying it in anything which is universally acceptable, which is either intrinsic value of the currency or the credit or trust of the individual who is issuing the money, whether it\'s a government or an individual.""The change to virtual currency may come at a relatively slow pace because people have built up respect for currencies associated with nations, according to Catholic Online. People respect dollars, mostly because of their track record and relatively stability.Instead of being the Mark of the Beast, Bitcoin may be a way to beat that mark. According to Christian Money , ""One of the key elements of the Mark of the Beast is to be able to prevent those that refuse to take the Mark from buying and selling. Bitcoins are decentralized and prevent any such control.""', 'A recently discovered issue with the client-side SDK of Bitcoin software provider BitGo allows anyone to track all incoming and outgoing transactions taking place on the Bitcoin exchange BitStamp. It was discovered by Bitcoin security firm BlockTrail over the weekend.\n\nBlockTrail CTO Ruben De Vries first encountered the issue while conducting analysis on the blockchain, “for our own internal purposes.” He found a group of addresses had the same output, allowing them to be tracked. De Vries identified it as the change address, that is the address created to send any remaining bitcoin leftover from a transaction.\n\n“If one is able to correlate trends in deposits and withdraws to the price movement (for example, maybe a high velocity of BTC deposits might indicate upcoming sell pressure, uncovering big sellers, etc), then so long as this data was not in common knowledge, it could be greatly valuable to traders. But just like looking for a good domain name, you often enough find that someone smart was there before you – and so I am left wondering not if such information is already being used by traders with informational advantages, but rather to what extent,” wrote BlockTrail CEO Boaz Becher in a company blog post.\n\nThe Change Bug\n\nAccording to Becher, the company was able to get an “interesting picture” of the BitStamp’s activity, including deposits, withdrawals and volume, by exploiting this issue. The company submitted a proposed fix to BitGo’s API implementation over the weekend but the fix still had not been implemented by BitGo as of Tuesday morning.\n\nAccording to a comment posted online by BitGo CTO Ben Davenport, the Bitcoin API provider has been aware of this issue for a while and has not changed it yet because they “don’t consider it a huge deal.”\n\n“I wouldn’t call this a bug, per se, but it’s a known issue that we plan to fix,” Davenport said. “The BitGo API is agnostic where the change output(s) are placed – this is just an issue with the client-side SDK.\n\n“The primary reason we haven’t changed it sooner is that BitGoD (which Bitstamp uses), currently relies on the change output being last to determine which output of a transaction is change when listing transactions,” he continued. “This was needed due to missing functionality in our back-end transaction indexer which has been remedied in the last few weeks.”\n\nThe other reason this issue is not a bigger deal is because it is already easy to identify the exchange’s change address. BitGo makes the exchange’s wallets multi-sig and makes the output end with a “3.” Since adoption of multi-sig is still low, it is already fairly easy to identify the exchange’s addresses.\n\nBitGo Security\n\nThis is the second bug found in BitGo’s API in the past week. Over the weekend, a Reddit user going by the user name, rstn, claimed to have lost 85 bitcoin when transferring 116 bitcoin with BitGo’s Legacy Wallet Recovery Tool. The erroneous tool made the transaction’s miner fee 85 bitcoin instead of the usual fractions of a bitcoin according to the user.\n\nBitGo acted quickly and contacted AntPool, the mining pool that processed the transaction and had the bitcoin returned to the user in full. As part of the company’s ongoing bug bounty program, the BitGo has since fixed the bug and rewarded the user 25 extra bitcoin for bringing it to their attention.\n\nThe security of BitGo’s API remains intact, and its clients are insured by the A-rated XL Group for $250,000 of losses in the case of a hack or theft.\n\nPhoto by Marko Ahtisaari / CC BY 2.0', ""Ron Paul started talking about the serious problems of the Federal Reserve system in the 1970s. In his words, the ability to control the supply of money was “throughout history, the most sought-after monopolistic power of man” (below). He was generally greeted by the sound of crickets, both by fellow politicians and practically everyone else.\n\nFor an unfathomable reason, Paul was re-elected to U.S. Congress over and over again for the next 40 years, all the while speaking out against the Fed and its monetary practices of inflation, fractional-reserve lending, bailouts and “foreign aid.” There was no aspect of the dollar's nefarious doings that Paul didn't decry to anyone who would listen.\n\nLike most in Austrian economics (the economic school of thought Paul espouses), he saw the remedy to Fed-caused depressions and recessions as precious metals — a return to gold and silver currencies. “End the Fed” became both a mantra and a best-selling book title released by Paul during his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.\n\nBut Paul's political career did not result in the legal abolition of the Fed. Not even close. Not by a long shot. But it did leave a large portion of an entire generation hungry for a new money — an alternative currency — as a way to, as some put it, “Ignore the Fed.”\n\nAnd then it came: Bitcoin.\n\nPaul was first asked about his views on Bitcoin in early 2013. He was generally unfamiliar with blockchain technology, and famously said, “If I can't put it in my pocket, I have reservations.” But unlike so many Luddites, Paul didn't dismiss Bitcoin for good. He just held back from making decisive statements. (In other words, he did what intelligent people do when they know they're under-informed about something.)\n\nMany of Paul's supporters took his reticence about Bitcoin as a signal to return to their go-gold-or-go-home stance. Others said that Paul would come around eventually, once he'd gotten an education in cryptocurrency.\n\nIt now seems that the latter were correct.\n\nVoices of Liberty (formerly the Ron Paul Channel) recently released the interview below, which features Paul and a representative from Coin.mx bantering about crypto. The interview is actually a three-part series, and Paul reveals himself as having done a great deal of Bitcoin homework between 2013 and now.\n\nThis interview series marks a serious shift in the “sound money” movement that Ron Paul is largely responsible for. Though he lobbied unsuccessfully to “end the Fed” for decades, it would seem that his personal economic beliefs were proven true in the end: governments don't solve problems. Markets do."", '', 'For timely updates on price updates, follow me @sammantic\n\nThe Bitcoin price continues to be range-bound. This appears to be looking like the top of that range. Last week the price was ~$225 USD as of this writing and now its at $234 USD. It has attempted a few times to get above $240 USD, which is proving to be major resistance. This is where the 50-day exponential moving average (insert link) now lies. In the last few days price has tried to stay above this level and hasn’t been able to.\n\nAs has been mentioned in previous articles the slope of all the EMAs (50, 100, and 200) has turned downward and this is starting to prove problematic. The price is having trouble holding above these lines. The best case scenario would be to see a flattening out of the moving averages as a sign of improvement, this has not happened thus far.\n\nWhile many indicators have moved into neutral territory this move appears to be topping out as volume and momentum have not followed the price higher and many of the indicators appear to be topping out.\n\nWhile there have been some improvements in price short term, nothing has changed as far as the long-term trend goes. If the price were to break through 240 and continue higher 250-255 would be the top. The weight of the evidence says this move should not be trusted and is nothing more than a counter trend rally.\n\nLong-Term\n\nThe 1-year chart (long term) of Bitcoin remains bearish. The price continues to decline, and remains below all 3 of its Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). The 50-day EMA is proving to be a major resistance area and right now, that is approximately at ~US$241. The price has not been able to stay above it in recent days.\n\nAs mentioned above, the slopes of all 3 EMA’s are bending downwards as well. This is symptomatic of falling prices that are not ready to rise and if they can continue to slope downwards, the price will follow, which can lead to an accelerated downtrend.\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) both are following the same pattern they have risen to neutral levels and have now flattened out and are looking like they are beginning to turn downwards. Simply put, momentum is beginning to wane and this move doesn’t seem to appear to have much more strength in it. Also note that the MACD has been below zero for this entire move and has essentially remained flat. These are not signs of a trend change.\n\n- ""ICHIMOKU""\n\nNot much has changed in the Ichimoku charts. The 1-year Ichimoku (cloud charts) continues confirming this bearish scenario.\n\nThe price is below the cloud, which is bearish. The cloud is major resistance and it confirms the ~$255 USD area as the potential upper top of this move if price were to get there.\n\nWhat continues to be disturbing is the cloud in front of the price, which is 26 days ahead in the future. It is future resistance and it is at ~US$228. This is below the current price which means something has to give and in this case it looks like the price will conform to this move and head lower. That cloud had a bearish crossover a couple of weeks ago and continues to predict lower prices in the future. The cloud continues to descend providing additional pressure on the price.\n\nAside from the price below the cloud, the Chikou Span (Lagging Line) is below the cloud, along with the Tankan Sen (Conversion Line) and the Kijun Sen (Base Line), which are sloped downward but are flattening now. It appears they too are topping out in this current rally.\n\nMeanwhile, nothing in the Ichimoku chart shows signs of an imminent reversal. For further definitions of what is being discussed, please refer to this previous post on Ichimoku cloud charts.\n\nIntermediate-Term Trend\n\nUsing Fibonacci retracements from an intermediate-term price high of US$427 recorded in mid-November, we see that the price is above .236 support at ~USD $231. If it breaks below this, the downside scenarios mentioned below would take place. As of this writing price is ~$234 USD. Having failed to break above resistance and hold $240 USD a test of $231 is likely.\n\nThe US$210 level continues to be major support and should be retested. The RSI and MACD are both flat and appear to be topping out. This shows momentum is stalling.\n\nI have also added the Directional Movement Index (DMI), which looks at buying and selling pressures. The blue line indicates buying pressure, the red line indicates selling pressure and the orange line is the ADX, which indicates the strength or weakness of a trend.\n\nAs one can see, selling pressure has fallen as has the ADX line. This indicates selling pressure has receded in the most recent week. The Blue Line (buying pressure) has crossed over selling pressure, which is indicative of a move higher in price. This is all happening at a low level in the index which means volume and momentum are not confirming the higher move to the top of the range in price. This index has turned positive but at very low levels. Simply put this means this indicator should be watched but not used as a signal.\n\nShort-Term Trend\n\nLooking at the short-term trend (May 4 price high of ~$241 USD) using Fibonacci retracements, the short-term price trend looks to have topped out at ~$241 USD which again happens to coincide with the 50 day EMA.\n\nShort term $235 and $231 are both support areas which look likely to be tested. If these should break down $228, $225 and $221 come into play. The RSI and MACD are both showing that ~$241 looks like it was the top as they have both headed downward.\n\nThe ~210 area should provide support if price breaks below the targeted areas mentioned above.\n\nThe primary downtrend continues. While prices have moved higher, it appears to be the top of the range and most indicators are confirming this. Momentum and volume have not followed the price higher. The 50-day EMA looks to be fairly big resistance as the price has failed to stay above it. If the price does move higher, be suspicious. It still looks like there are lower levels to be tested. Every rally in price in recent months has been at lower levels and this is a concern as well. A retest of the ~$210 area looks like a real possibility.\n\nDisclaimer: Articles regarding the potential movement in crypto-currency prices are not to be treated as trading advice.

The London-based Bitcoin wallet, exchange and payment processor is the only digital currency startup competing in the event.\n\nThe annual competition tries to find the brightest and best entrepreneurs in all of Britain. Startups can compete in three different categories: New Things, Start-Up and Grow. Competing startups can receive up to £250,000 in marketing support, 12 months of business support and advice from billionaire and Virgin Group CEO, Richard Branson.“With the support of Sir Richard (who has been a high-profile advocate for bitcoin), we hope to grow the number of merchants who accept digital currencies. And make bitcoin become a part of everyday life,” read a LazyPay blog post.\n\nCompetition Details\n\nThe competition, which started earlier this month, is in its beginning stage. Thousands of startups have already registered and the public has begun voting for which startups they think is the best. The fifty startups with the most votes in each category by May 5th will advance to the shortlist.The startups that make it to the shortlist stage of the competition will participate in a series of phone interviews and workshops. Pitch To Rich officials will choose the top ten from each category to advance to the semi-finals. There, will they pitch their startup in front of a panel of judges that will include Branson himself.\n\nIf LazyPay wins, the young startup hopes to use the prizes to boost their payment processing services in England and the rest of Europe.\n\n“We’ll be targeting London first and then the rest of the UK and Europe. There is a real appetite for bitcoin merchant services and we’re on a mission to help bitcoin reach the tipping point we all know is around the corner. Our goal is to sign up at least 100 pre-registered merchants before the apps official launch this summer,” said LazyPay in a statement.\n\nRichard Branson And Bitcoin\n\nThe veteran businessman and international mogul is no stranger to digital currency. Branson started accepting Bitcoin for tickets to his space travel service, Virgin Galactic, back in November of 2013.

They can borrow up to 60% of the BTC deposit value.\n\nFunds for borrowing are supplied by a third-party provider.\n\nThe move takes some pressure off exchanges like Huobi, as Chinese investors cash in their coins to try their luck on the more bullish Shanghai Composite Index.\n\nLoans are offered on a daily (0.1% interest per day) and monthly (1.2–1.7% interest per month) basis. Customers could theoretically take out loans for six months to a year if they expected returns to exceed the interest owed, though Huobi anticipates it will be more attractive to short-term traders.\n\nAt completion of the loan\'s term, the customer pays back the borrowed amount plus interest, and then withdraws the initial BTC deposit amount – plus profits or minus losses.\n\nRisk management mechanism\n\nJuggling the value of multiple investment options at once might seem risky, but Huobi said it has a risk management system in place that works similar to those of margin trading platforms on other bitcoin exchanges.\n\nThe Caimao platform calculates a ratio based on money balances and the changing prices of both BTC and the shares purchased. If a customer\'s ratio falls below a certain set figure the position is liquidated, with shares and/or BTC being sold to cover any losses.\n\nA customer whose shares suffered a net loss at the same time as a drop in bitcoin\'s price would be more at risk of such a liquidation.\n\nHuobi says it will hold the bitcoin amounts as collateral for the loan, selling it only if necessary to cover any losses.\n\nDue to the deep liquidity of both Huobi\'s bitcoin exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange, plus the platform\'s execution speed, the company is ""confident"" any forced liquidations can be completed at the target price.\n\nBTC as collateral\n\nWhile Caimao is the first product aimed specifically at trading on the stockmarket, some Chinese exchanges, including Huobi, have deployed the BTC-as-collateral model for some time now.\n\nLast year BTCTrade launched the Yuanbao loan service, which also allows customers to borrow up to 60% of their bitcoins\' value for whatever purpose they wish. Yuanbao also let users set their own interest rates and term limits within recommended parameters.\n\nHuobi\'s Dangpu.com service, which will continue operating, also works on similar principles.\n\nOpening world markets to all\n\nAt this stage, the loans will be available to mainland Chinese citizens only, but Huobi\'s Robert Kuhne told CoinDesk the aim is to offer the service to everyone as soon as possible.\n\nHe said Huobi is building another service similar to Caimao ""but much more global in scale"".\n\n""Huobi\'s long-term vision is a world in which anyone anywhere can invest in anything. Five years ago, the idea of connecting all of the world\'s capital markets and providing equal access for every person would have seemed like a fantasy, but bitcoin has provided the conceptual and technological foundation for this vision to become a reality.""\n\n""It certainly won\'t happen overnight, but this is Huobi\'s strategic direction and Caimao is our first step,"" he added.\n\nKuhne also stressed that the Shanghai Stock Exchange shares offered on Caimao were genuine shares, and not just virtual assets representing them.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

05/06/2015,"['BitGold Inc. has announced the public launch of the BitGold platform, a software service that connects gold storage with payment networks, resulting in a banking-like platform for gold.\n\nThe announcement refers to the BitGold platform as a “new global operating system for gold.” In fact, BitGold is a digital payments platform that connects gold stored in real-world vaults with online payments.\n\nThough the BitGold press release emphasizes that BitGold is not a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, there are similarities. In particular, the BitGold platform allows for the quick settlement of gold trades so that a users’ gold is easily acquired and accessible across various payment networks such as SWIFT, Visa, MasterCard, Interac, SEPA, UnionPay, Discover, American Express and others – including bitcoin.\n\nBitGold payment fees are higher than those of bitcoin payment processors but lower than most alternatives.\n\nThus, BitGold provides some of the advantages of bitcoin payments – faster and cheaper digital cross-border transactions – combined with the advantages of gold as a store of value, and can be seen as a Bitcoin-like system for gold. BitGold seems likely to become an appealing option for those who trust gold more than bitcoin.\n\nThe BitGold website states that the company views gold as a security switch for a world that is increasingly digital, and implemented security features to protect users’ accounts and identities, such as secure vaults, full insurance with Lloyds of London against theft or loss, military-grade encryption (RSA 4096 and AES256) to secure users’ accounts and personal information, and multi-factor authentication measures.\n\nBitGold claims that it offers the most competitive rates in the industry for buying and selling gold, and is the only platform that allows users to spend from their gold account.\n\n“At BitGold we have a mission to democratize global access to gold for stable savings, and to make gold useful in micro-transactions using the Internet or mobile phones,” said co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Josh Crumb. “No matter where you live in the world, gold has held value over time relative to costs like food and energy that we require as humans, making it one the most important savings tools for most of the human population. We believe that by broadening access to a commodity-money that holds value we can help combat the rise in wealth inequality and the short-termism.”\n\nBitGold is a Canadian corporation with offices in Toronto and Milan and a network of secure vaults for gold storage, operated in partnership with The Brink’s Company, a global leader in security-related services for banks, retailers and a variety of other commercial and governmental customers. Users can choose where in the world they want their gold physically stored. The company’s financial statements are audited by PriceWaterhouse Coopers.\n\nBitGold accounts are free and can be opened in minutes. New users are provided with a secure vault account to purchase and hold gold, the ability to make and receive instant gold payments, and a debit card for spending gold at traditional points of sale. Customers can fund their accounts with local-currency by using a network of ATMs. BitGold will not initially be available to U.S. residents, and will be unavailable to residents of sanctioned countries.\n\n“We are excited to unveil the BitGold platform, an architecture and technology that’s taken years of careful planning and execution, which now allows users to seamlessly use gold again as a store of value and medium for payments,” said co-founder and CEO Roy Sebag.\n\n“As a global asset, gold is recognized in nearly every culture as a long-term protector of value, but has been a poor medium of exchange compared to the advances in money technology,” Sebag said. “We felt that gold needed the modernization and mobilization that’s now happening in the global payments revolution. We have built a financial services platform that is as close to being counterparty-free as possible, enabling economic transactions within the existing global financial system to be settled in full reserved gold bullion.”\n\nThe term “BitGold” may be confusing because it is also used by Bitreserve. Previously, it was used by cryptographer Nick Szabo for the cryptocurrency that he proposed before Bitcoin.\n\nOld Vault Door / CC BY 2.0', ""Airbitz impressed judges last week in the Inside Bitcoins startup competition, and the wallet walked away as the winner.\n\nYou might remember Airbitz as the wallet that has a built-in Bitcoin directory, which points users to nearby merchants that accept Bitcoin. The company is also known for rolling out the first one-touch 2-factor authentication for a mobile wallet, which makes security a little easier for the average Bitcoin user.\n\nThe mission is to stick to Bitcoin's decentralized roots while also to make Bitcoin easy to use, a balance that appears to be the unicorn of the Bitcoin space. Airbitz claims that Bitcoin could shake up the fragmented system of mobile payments, improving upon the likes of Square and Google. CoinTelegraph caught up with Airbitz founder Paul Puey at Inside Bitcoins New York this month to learn more about where the wallet is headed.\n\nCoinTelegraph: I know there are many aspects to Airbitz, but can you briefly summarize your goals?\n\nPaul Puey: At a high level the company's goal is to drive privacy, decentralization, and security to the masses. Those are kind of the three core tenets. We do that by making those three things almost invisible, so that people don't have to see it. They don't have to know it happening.\n\nOtherwise, you're going to be relegated to only the techno-elite or the people that are willing to go through the effort because they believe in the core value system of it. You'll only get those people taking advantage of those core benefits.\n\nCT: How is Airbitz different from other Bitcoin wallets?\n\nPP: There's a pretty significant divide in the bitcoin space in wallets and platforms. The most usable ones, the ones that have the most traction, tend to be the ones that are not wallets at all—they're entirely banks. I made this statement—and I'm trying to challenge this myself—and have other people challenge it—that when you hold your bitcoin with a central party, a third party, you give up every single one of the core benefits of the bitcoin protocol. It's a statement that's a little bold to say. But I haven't heard an argument against it yet.\n\nIf we're all so excited about the bitcoin—this whole conference, why are we even here—then why are giving away all its core benefits? These core benefits that it brings to an individual, why are we giving them all up? Right now, those are the implementations that are gaining the most traction. We're trying to bring that level of familiarity and usability while not giving up the core benefits of the core protocol. So retaining the privacy, the decentralization, the autonomy, and the user controlled funds. That's why it's so unique. It's unbiased access to a global economy.\n\nSo why is it different from other wallets? It's definitely not a hosted wallet. We don't hold any funds. With respect to the other wallets that are not centrally controlled, we feel that we're usable by the 99 percentile. It's grandma-friendly all the way to the developer-friendly. And there's a tremendous amount of use functionality that makes it usable long-term.\n\nIf you're using bitcoin every single day, not as a toy that you send someone a nickle or a few bucks for dinner—but you actually try to live your life in the economy—then all the other wallets would break down. Airbitz wouldn't break down under a true crypto-economy.\n\nCT: So how does it feel to win the Inside Bitcoins startup competition?\n\nPP: I mean, obviously it feels good to win anything, and to have some validation from third parties that what your vision is is somewhat aligned and that you can present well. But it's such a small stepping stone to what we're trying to achieve. I'd like to look back and think, “Wow, that was a fun nugget.” But the stepping stone of what the company and all the founders are trying to achieve, is something that's going to rewrite history books. This is a massive revolution happening and if that change doesn't happen, then we don't feel like we've done our job. It's as simple as that.\n\nTo answer the original question: It feels good. It's cool and hopefully it will help us achieve that goal, but it is so, so far from the goal.\n\nCT: What are your immediate next steps?\n\nPP: Continue developing on the app. When I pitched, one of the things I had promised is that we'd offer global bitcoin buy and sell in a handful of countries by this quarter and next quarter—so we're actively developing that.\n\nWe'll continue iterating on that. And the big thing to keep innovating rapidly in this competitive landscape is to raise funding. That's why we're here. We're raising a seed round of funding. We can do a ton with few resources because our team runs very lean and is very efficient. We have a software architecture that allows us to do a lot with little work. But that's our big focus and one of the reasons why we're here."", 'Ripple Labs found themselves on the wrong side of FinCEN this week and has been subject to a $700,000 fine for failing to keep up with regulations as a money exchanger. Most notably the fine also comes with requirements that Ripple Labs comply better with anti-money laundering regulations, including better tracking of money transfers.\n\nGavin Andresen, Bitcoin luminary and core developer, has come out with a series of arguments why Bitcoin’s max block size needs to be increased (he proposes to 20MB by March 2016). This has generated a great deal of talk in the community, see below for links to his posts arguing for the change.\n\nSteve “Woz” Woziak has joined Planet Capital, a milti-function ATM kiosk developer. Low-power, fanless Bitcoin node Bitseed V2 servers are now up for pre-order. And, Case, a hardware wallet prototype with a GSM chip and fingerprint reader, was announced at TechCrunch Disrupt NY.\n\nWelcome to this Bitcoin Weekly.\n\nGavin Andresen argues that increasing the max block size is urgent\n\nIn a blog post aptly titled “Why increasing the max block size is urgent,” Gavin Andresen, Chief Scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, argues for increasing the max block size, and soon.\n\nBitcoin works by miners grabbing up transactions and stuffing them into blocks, those blocks are then verified through cryptographically strong mechanisms and attached to the blockchain. As the number of transactions approaches the maximum size of a block, transactions may be dropped and this could lead to longer and longer transaction times. This is an extremely simplified explanation of Andresen’s argument for larger block sizes.\n\nIn an index blog post, “Time to roll out bigger blocks”, Andresen seeks to address counter-arguments to his proposition. The first, addressed in the above blog post, is amid seven other arguments that he has yet to address with blog posts. It’s worth keeping this post bookmarked if you’re at all interested in the protocol that runs Bitcoin.\n\nThese blog posts were mentioned by Andresen on Reddit in response to questions about a post he made to his personal repository stating, “Hard fork: allow 20MB blocks after 1 March 2016 Allows any block with a timestamp on or after 1 March 2016 00:00:00 UTC to be up to 20,000,000 bytes big (serialized).”\n\nCurrent posts by Andresen at time of publication are as follows: “Why increasing the max block size is urgent,” “It must be done… but is not a panacea,” “Block size and miner fees… again,” “Will a 20MB max increase centralization?“, and “Big blocks and TOR.”\n\nFinCEN fines Ripple Labs $700,000\n\nFinCEN has fined Ripple Labs inc. $700,000 under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) for not registering as a money services business without registration. The complaint by FinCEN further claims that Ripple Labs failed to implement and maintain adequate anti-money laundering (AML) programs.\n\n“Virtual currency exchangers must bring products to market that compy with our anti-money laundering laws,” said FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery.\n\nRipple Labs is a cryptocurrency company that uses a crypto asset called “XRP II” or Ripples to exchange value across the Internet. Through the Ripple system money can be transferred between different participants via a cryptocurrency exchange mechanism. Unlike bitcoins, XRP II was already fully pre-mined before Ripple went to market, but as XRP has cryptocurrency qualities it can be exchanged in the same manner bitcoins can.\n\nAs part of the agreement with FinCEN, “Ripple Labs will also undertake certain enhancements to the Ripple Protocol to appropriately monitor all future transactions.”\n\nSpeaking to Ars Techinica, Ripple Labs’s spokesperson, Monica Long said that the company was glad to have the issue settled. Long focused on the fact that Ripple Labs exists in “an emerging, undefined fintech category,” and that Ripple has been consistent in supporting a complaint Ripple ecosystem.\n\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak joins Planet Capital board of directors\n\nMulti-function ATM and kiosk operator Planet Capital announced recently that Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is joining the company’s board as advisor and director. Reported by CoinTelegraph, this move appears to signal increasing affiliation between Wozniak and blockchain infrastructure.\n\n““[H]aving an engineer as innovative as Woz around to look over our shoulders and make suggestions is priceless,” said Planet Capital CTO Dan Sokol.\n\nPlanet Capital deploys kiosks programmed to act as multi-function payment systems, which simplifies financial transaction activity into an easy to use machine. The ATM kiosks provide traditional ATM functions, bill payments, and even full point of sale functionality.\n\nWhat will interest Bitcoin Weekly readers is the ATMs also have two-way buy and sell options with numerous cryptocurrencies. Included for buying and selling is Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and any other future derivatives of cryptocurrencies that attain widespread demand.\n\nBitseed V2 now available for pre-order\n\nBitseed personal servers are small machines about the size of a thick book with a fully enclosed, fanless design. The machine is designed to run services and applications for customers looking for something obtrusive, which is why Bitseed is offering the Bitcoin Edition that can store and run the Bitcoin Core open source client (bitcoind) and maintain the entire blockchain (which has grown to over 26GB.)\n\nThe V2 device launches the bitcoin node automatically on startup and needs only to be plugged into the wall and attached to an Ethernet cable. No display monitor is needed. The OS is Unbuntu 14, with an optional GUI desktop; and it can support a mouse, keyboard, and monitor. The device ships with a 160GB hard drive.\n\nBitseed V2 currently sells at $149 for pre-orders and there is no information on when it will ship.\n\nBitseed V2 is also planned to mint flavors for altcoins, but only after an order comes in for 100 Bitseed V2 supporting that specific altcoin, e.g. if Bitseed receives 100 orders for Litecoin units, then single Litecoin units will become available.\n\nCase announced at TechCrunch Disrupt NY\n\nCase Wallet Inc. (aka CryptoLabs) recently presented their product, a bitcoin hardware wallet called Case, at TechCrunch Disrupt NY, the sixth annual technology conference for product and company launches.\n\nCase differs from many of the other wallets on the market by combining a credit-card sized device with a GSM chip for cellular network communication. The device will not require a computer or phone tethered for bitcoin transactions to occur.\n\nCase integrates a multi-signature, multi-factor hardware concept to protect user security by using both the device (in the user’s hands) and a cloud service to deliver enhanced security. With a 2-3 multi-signature setup, the service requires both the device and the cloud service to sign before a transaction can be processed. The cloud-stored key can only be accessed via a biometric fingerprint scanner on the device (sent to the server for verification)\n\nA third key is kept in a secure service by Case for situations when the device is lost or stolen, allowing the user to recover lost wallets.\n\n“As online blockchain technologies evolve as a means for buying and selling bitcoin, they will require devices like Case to ensure security and maintain privacy,” stated Case Chief Technology Officer Stephen Schultz.\n\nAs a hardware wallet, Case also seeks to simplify the process of transacting in bitcoin. With the GSM chip and a QR code reader, Case replaces a smartphone wallet with a single-function device that securely interacts with bitcoin and provides ease-of-use.\n\nCase will be will shipping in Summer 2015 with limited availability (only 1,000 units in the first run) for an introductory price of $199. Pre-orders have already started.\n\nPhoto credit: Steve Wozniak, Wikipedia photo', 'Dubai-based startup BitOasis has announced the launch of a new bitcoin buying platform.\n\nAimed at consumers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the platform was revealed at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY Startup Alley, a venue for early-stage companies taking place over the course of the three-day conference.\n\nCo-founder Ola Doudin explained that the goal of the service is to increase bitcoin liquidity in the Middle East as part of BitOasis\' long-term strategy of serving what she characterized as the vital remittance corridors of the region.\n\nDoudin told CoinDesk:\n\n""The UAE specifically serves as a gateway to the Middle East, but it\'s a big outbound remittance market with corridors to India, Philippines, Thailand, Kenya and other countries. It\'s a connection between different countries and different markets and we see a big opportunity for bitcoin.""\n\nFor now, Doudin indicated that BitOasis is acting as a bitcoin brokerage, purchasing bitcoin on other, more liquid markets, with the goal of one day opening up cash-in, cash-out services that can appeal to the 75% of consumers in the region locked out of traditional bank accounts.\n\n""Bitcoin can fill lots of gaps in the Middle East when it come to payments and providing affordable financial services for an underserved market,"" she added.\n\nIn addition to its brokerage service, BitOasis offers a three-key multisig wallet. The company estimates it has registered 15,000 users since its January launch, with users in the UAE, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nTelling its story\n\nWhile not available in the US, Doudin explained that BitOasis sought to foster connections with the broader payments industry at TechCrunch, with the hopes of also being selected by popular vote for a presentation slot on the event\'s main stage.\n\nWhile BitOasis fell short in the vote, however, Doudin said her company received attention due to what she characterized as their \'unique story\', being among the few bitcoin companies that services MENA markets and one of the only bitcoin companies at the event.\n\n""For us, it\'s about networking with startups and investors,"" she continued. ""We\'ve been approached by different people, people who want internships and other startups who are interested in payments to the Middle East.""\n\nThis attention, she said, has translated to easier messaging in its domestic market. ""We\'re one of the only ones so we get the attention and the spotlight, which was a nice marketing strategy, we kind of came built-in,"" she added.\n\nAs part of its initial wallet sign-up process, the four-person company offered 1,000 bits to new users, with referral bonuses of 500 bits for those who referred family and friends.\n\nCurrently, buyers are limited to purchases of 2000 AED, or roughly $550, which can be made through cash deposits at banks and wire transfer.\n\nMoving forward in MENA\n\nDoudin reported that the public in the Middle East is still learning about bitcoin and blockchain technologies, but that the environment is warming.\n\nWith this in mind, BitOasis aims to launch a mobile wallet app this summer, with the goal of capitalizing on the region\'s high smartphone penetration. As for how these consumers will take to a new currency as well as unfamiliar terms like multisig, Doudin expressed her belief that focus on the consumer experience could propel BitOasis past these problems.\n\n""For the less tech-savvy users, mutlisig is more technical to understand, but they understand that with three keys it\'s a higher level of security. They understand why it\'s better logically without going into the technical details,"" she added.\n\nOn the legal and regulatory front, Doudin framed Dubai as a progressive jurisdiction for bitcoin development.\n\n""In Dubai, we\'ve been interacting with different partners and there hasn\'t been any negativity from regulators, they are being open about it,"" she said, adding:\n\n""UAE has been open for innovation for years and they\'ve been embracing innovation on different industries, so I see that as an opportunity.""\n\nDubai image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As a reminder, the twins have been working on an exchange traded fund (ETF) under the symbol ‘COIN’ so that old-school traders can trade bitcoins on the NASDAQ OMX. The two brothers also recently announced a new bitcoin exchange called Gemini. They want to build a fully regulated and fully compliant U.S.-based exchange.\n\n“A lot of people don’t want to deal with the effort needed to secure your bitcoins,” Cameron Winklevoss said. “That’s why we started to build Gemini, which is a U.S.-based exchange with compliance — it’s NASDAQ, E-Trade and DTC built into one.”\n\nWe don’t just have our skin in the game, we have our whole body in the game — Cameron Winklevoss\n\nAccording to Tyler, there is a long-standing dilemma when it comes to bitcoin exchanges — it’s either too hard or not secure enough. Buying and storing bitcoins yourself in a cold storage wallet with private and public keys is a real burden. But startups that make it easy aren’t dealing with financial authorities enough and don’t provide enough guarantees to their customers.\n\n“Bitcoin was this really strange technology that only geeks — and even not a lot of geeks, it was geeks within geeks,” Tyler Winklevoss said. “We really wanted to make sure we built this right. And then, you have to build a great product. Most of the startups deal with that last piece first.”\n\nAnd then, there is the ETF. For this project, the two brothers wanted to build a product for wall street traders, bankers. For years, the financial industry thought bitcoin was a joke and didn’t want to make any effort to diversify their portfolios with bitcoin. To make it as easy as possible, the brothers filed an S-1 registration with the SEC to create this financial product that you can buy as any other ETF. It has yet to launch, and the SEC is looking into it right now. In short, it’s a neat workaround to make bitcoin tradable on the NASDAQ OMX.\n\nWhen John Biggs asked them about the vocal critics against the Winklevoss brothers, the two brothers’ answers were pretty clear. They are in bitcoin for the long term. It’s not a sudden interest to an industry they can’t understand, it’s something that they are passionate about.\n\n“We’ve put our money where our mouth is. We don’t just have our skin in the game, we have our whole body in the game,” Cameron Winklevoss said. “We are building a company, Gemini, and the ETF, which is another company. I don’t know if we’re experts, but the goal is not to be an expert but to change the world. Does Richard Branson understand all the physics behind his space craft? I’m not sure.”\n\nAnd the two brothers aren’t just building two bitcoin companies; at one time they owned 1 percent of all mined bitcoin. Or, as Tyler Winklevoss said, “we eat, sleep, breathe bitcoin.”', 'Very few things in this world that we use every day have unlimited growth potential. The Internet, as we now know it, has limits of which we need to be mindful. Your smartphone’s data plan certainly has limitations. The Bitcoin network itself also has limitations, and these limitations may be holding Bitcoin’s development back, so core developers are getting involved in upgrading the capacity through different means.\n\nMike Hearn talked to Satoshi Nakamoto about this\n\nBack in 2010, Bitcoin Core Developer Mike Hearn had questions about the limitations of the Bitcoin network and when adjustments should be made. He emailed Satoshi Nakamoto about this upcoming issue, and this was Satoshi’s response:\n\n“A higher limit can be phased in once we have actual use closer to the limit and make sure it’s working OK. Eventually when we have client-only implementations, the block chain size won’t matter much. Until then, while all users still have to download the entire block chain to start, it’s nice if we can keep it down to a reasonable size.”\n\nAccording to Hearn’s calculations, Bitcoin capacity will run out this year, and this is why he and Gavin Andresen have begun talking about and working on getting ahead of this issue. Bitcoin usage seems to have fallen into a fairly consistent pattern of stagnation in the Spring and Summer, and growth in the fall and winter, going back to Mt. Gox in 2013. Mike Hearn worked for three out of his eight years at Google doing capacity research within their Geo Team for Google Maps/Earth, so this is not his first rodeo when it comes to network capacity issues.\n\n“Quite simply, we are out of time. There are no credible technical proposals that could gain widespread adoption within the next twelve months, beyond simply raising the capacity on the existing system,” says Mike Hearn.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Core Developer Commits to 20MB Block Size by March, 2016\n\nBitcoin Core Developer Gavin Andresen has seen fit to submit a “pull request” for some time within the next twelve months. This would allow miners to create blocks that are larger than 1MB as a max block size. He believes the exchange rate is more important than the block size, at least until the reward drops to zero. Increasing the bitcoin exchange rate will help make the network more secure over the long run, say ten years from now.\n\nThere are many things that make bitcoin more and more valuable, in the long run, primarily adding new people to the network, which is becoming more difficult under the current limitations. Will benefit from a larger maximum block size. An increase in innovation and development of useful bitcoin apps, and improving security for users would also increase bitcoin’s appeal.\n\nWhat Hearn and Andresen agree upon is that the time is now to act and get ahead of any capacity issues. Hearn believes this is fairly urgent in nature, and should have been done awhile ago. Miners may see another drop in returns, and they’ve had a tough go of it over the past almost eighteen months, but bitcoin needs these tweaks for the incremental growth that will lead to its long-term success.\n\nFor all the miners out there, how and when would you look to improve bitcoin network capacity? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Worstall on Wednesday The Official Greatest Business Plan Of All Time was back at the time of the South Sea Bubble of the Georgian Age. A promoter made a stock offering for “A company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage but no one to know what it is.”\n\nWhat made it the officially greatest ever was that this was, obviously and clearly, a scam, yet the promoter still got his money. The reason being that there was obviously an investment bubble going on and people happily bought the stock assuming that they would be able to pass it on to a greater fool soon enough at a higher price.\n\nWhich brings us to the company 21 Inc. Which is not a scam and is not quite so glorious but it is a fascinating business plan all the same. FT Alphaville tells us all about it here. It's heavily involved with Bitcoin and there's those of us around who think that that whole thing is simply a bubble. Even if it's not one (ie, the blockchain might be useful for something even if the currency isn't) it's most certainly been interesting watching every single scam, fraud and oopsie! moment in humanity's monetary history being played out at warp speed.\n\n21 Inc has raised $116 million of venture capital from all the right people - Andreessen Horowitz, Qualcomm, Peter Thiel, Mark Pincus and the rest. And, of course, there's the Valley's secret sauce, jargon, to be played with as well. Democratising Bitcoin, payments are now packets and all of that.\n\nAnd one could imagine a variety of business plans to build all of that into. Cash, sexy bitcoins, chip makers, sexy payment systems: why not? Create a really simple to use pay by bonk bitcoin chip, get it into all smartphones in the world and make a killing. By harvesting the information of what everybody is bonking for, of course. We could imagine that as a plan, couldn't we?\n\nBut the Financial Times tells us that that is not the plan. And this was published on April 30, not 1.\n\nThe core business plan it turns out will be embedding ASIC bitcoin mining chips into everyday devices like USB battery chargers, routers, printers, gaming consoles, set-top boxes and — the piece de resistance — chipsets to be used by Internet of Stuff devices.\n\nYes. Your toaster will mine for bitcoins. No, really.\n\nSeriously.\n\nThe idea is that these whatevers, the household appliances, the Goblin Teasmade, will be given to us, or at least sold at very cheap prices. We'll also get 25 per cent of the value of the bitcoins that the lasses' vibrator will mine to keep as our very own. The other 75 per cent goes to 21 Inc as thanks for their delivering to us the cheap electronic tchotchke. Plus whatever the value they can make from the information of how often the various devices are used I assume.\n\nThis is simply a blindingly good business plan, exotically gorgeous in fact. For of course the cost of the electricity required to mine for bitcoin is very much larger than that 25 per cent of the value of the bitcoin that we get to keep. Yet we will obviously be paying for the electricity while 21 Inc gets 75 per cent of the bitcoins. In fact, at domestic electricity prices these days (including all those lovely green levies and so on) the electricity costs more than the value of the mined cryptocurrency. And we get to pay all of that electricity bill and 21 Inc gets 75 per cent of the bitcoin.\n\nOne thought is that we tend to replace our toasters less often than miners have to replace their ASICS. So, that internet of things doing the mining will steadily become less economic over time as the installed base just won't be updated that often. But this doesn't matter! Because 21 Inc isn't paying for the electricity which is the cost that other miners have to minimise by continually upgrading.\n\nI've written more than a few business plans in my time and if I'd come up with this one I wouldn't be able to stop giggling long enough to present it. Nor, in fact, stop hugging myself for long enough to type it out. Obviously these people are made of sterner stuff.\n\nInquiring minds will be able to work out that of course this plan, by definition, loses money for consumers. So the big bet underneath it all is are the general public actually stupid enough to go for it? Here's a free toaster, some bitcoin, and please don't check your electricity meter?\n\nHmm, toughie really but I'd say probably yes. After all, as the phrase goes, no one has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the American public. By overestimating it, yes, but not under. ®"", 'Toronto’s industrial rock band 22HERTZ, created by Ralf Muller, is set to encode a copyright of the band’s new single into the Bitcoin blockchain. The song, mixed by Yoad Nevo, will be hashed and attached into an OP_RETURN function – a standardized feature that allows data to be passed to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nFollowing the trace of Muller’s former heavy metal band Point Blank, 22HERTZ released their first album in 2013. Motivated by the commercial success of the previous album, 22HERTZ began to work on a new single with Yoad Nevo. However, the band encountered problems while trying to issue a copyright for the single.\n\nThe overly charged copyright turned out to be a certificate with a title of the song, without any information regarding the lyrics or the melody. Muller continued to search for alternative ways to issue a copyright for the song until he thought of encoding it in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nRalf Muller spoke to CoinTelegraph about the encoding of the copyright.\n\nCoinTelegraph: How and why did you decide to copyright the song to the Bitcoin blockchain?\n\n22HERTZ: Two words, free and absolute. In Canada, it costs $50 CAD a pop for one song and all you get is a certificate mailed to you with the title of your work on it. How this would ever help you in court regarding lyrics or a melody is disheartening. I contacted their support to ask this question and they replied, “I can’t answer that because I am not a lawyer.” I got inspired when I read an article a few months back when someone hashed a book into the blockchain, first time ever apparently.\n\nCT: Images, texts, and digital documents can be encoded to the Bitcoin blockchain by encoding hex values to bitcoin addresses. Is this what the band plans to do?\n\n22HERTZ: No not really. I don’t know much about that method and wouldn’t want to burden the blockchain with a few megabytes of song data if that were even possible. I’m going the hashing route with the OP_RETURN feature. Less bloat and as effective in proving a file existed in time.\n\nCT: The Bitcoin blockchain’s OP_RETURN limits data storage to 80 bytes. Other databases are far more efficient to store non-currency data. Why did the band still decide to encode it to the Bitcoin blockchain?\n\n22HERTZ: Other databases might be more efficient to store non-currency data but are not as secure as the Bitcoin blockchain with all the petahash of power the network has. Once you encode a hash in the OP_RETURN and block upon blocks get written on top, it is basically impossible to go back and change anything, this to me is incredible.\n\nCT: The band’s online store accepts bitcoin and offers discounts. Is this to support bitcoin? Or because other payment platforms are difficult to deal with?\n\n22HERTZ: Anything to help destroy the greatest form of evil on this planet, the Federal Reserve System. Traditional payment systems are very easy to use but yes there are fees, and you are not helping the evolution of anything. I’m not into ‘business as usual’.\n\nCT: Surprisingly, not a lot of musicians are accepting bitcoins for sales of albums, merchandise, etc. Do you think this could change over the years?\n\n22HERTZ: Yes. Once more and better infrastructures are in place, I can’t see how other bands won’t at least add a bitcoin option. It’s just a matter of time for people to learn about bitcoin and compare it to our current banking system. Good information like this takes time to spread over a planet of over 7 billion people, especially when competing for attention with such things as sports, reality shows, etc.\n\nData Storage In The Bitcoin BlockChain\n\nTransactions in the Bitcoin blockchain are more flexible than it seems. Each transaction contains a two-part script – challenge script which describes how a coin can be redeemed, and a response script, which is provided by the transaction redeeming the payment that has a signature to prove if the private key corresponds to the public key.\n\nA transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain is verified by combining the two scripts into a validation script. If no errors occur during the process of verification, the transaction is verified.\n\nDue to the ability of bitcoin transactions to store data in a script, new methods of storing strings or texts in bitcoin transactions were discovered. As different methods began to emerge, the core developers of Bitcoin standardized it to a feature named it “OP_RETURN” during the 0.9.0 release of Bitcoin Core.\n\nThe OP_RETURN function allows a “user defined sequence of up to 40 bytes,” which means that small data like texts, digital documents and even images could be encoded into the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nStoring data or assets in the Bitcoin blockchain is inefficient, as the core developers of bitcoins stated, ""storing arbitrary data in the blockchain is still a bad idea; it is less costly and far more efficient to store non-currency data elsewhere.” However, as Muller mentioned, the “petahash of power the network” makes it impossible for anyone to change the information encoded in the blockchain. This could be used as an advantage to storing contracts, copyrights, and small data.', 'The Spanish Bitcoin startup Coinffeine has launched a technical preview of its peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin exchange. For the first time in a P2P exchange, users can experience an automatic and secure exchange similar to that offered by traditional exchanges, but with all the advantages of the P2P.\n\nThis version is intended to enable independent users and banks to try the application at an early stage, integrate it into their services and operate as Bitcoin exchanges. Anyone interested can download the application and, once it is installed, can begin to buy and sell bitcoin with other Coinffeine users.\n\nAlthough the Coinffeine Technical Preview is fully functional, they decided to go step-by-step in this early stage and distribute a version that is configured to be used on a Testnet or test blockchain.This way, users can try it without spending actual bitcoin.\n\n“From today, the Bitcoin community can try Coinffeine, the first P2P Bitcoin exchange without arbitrators,” said Alberto Go?mez Toribio, CEO of Coinffeine. “This is the same version that we are offering to our bank partners and customers. Users will have to wait a little longer to use it with real bitcoins, but we are sure the wait will be worthwhile. We hope to transform Coinffeine’s relationships with banks and payment processors into services that give them added value.”\n\nTo test the platform, users can download it from the Coinffeine website. Just as users do not need to register to use BitTorrent, they do not need to register or provide any identification to use the application; they just install it and use it.\n\nCoinffeine is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\nThe new version also introduces a new user interface, which is very different from its previous public appearance.\n\n“Few Bitcoin products invest sufficient resources in design and usability. Our team continues to grow, and we have recently added an expert in this field to our team. He has been in charge of the transformation of Coinffeine’s user experience, and the result is something completely new,” said Go?mez. “Coinffeine’s intention is to combine the concept of a wallet and exchange in the same product. It is a concept we believe have a great potential, and therefore we leave the following steps to the imagination.\n\n“Coinffeine is a desktop wallet like Armory or Electrum with which you control your money safely,” Go?mez added. “This allows the company to avoid disclosing MSB, because we do not touch the money or the bitcoins from our users. We have learned much from the P2P industry and we want to apply many of these concepts to the FinTech ecosystem.”\n\nThe release concludes the period of private testing that started December 18th, where Coinffeine presented the first alpha version of the platform in a public event in Madrid and a limited number of users joined the private user experience program.\n\nPrior to the release of the 1.0 version, they will evaluate the creation of a similar private testing program, but with real bitcoin and money.\n\nCoinffeine, a desktop application\n\nCoinffeine is a desktop application that has been defined by those who have tried it as the “BitTorrent for Bitcoin.”\n\nThe application works as a wallet, which allows users to store bitcoin safely and to connect an OKPay account – a payment processor similar to PayPal – to buy and sell bitcoin with other users.\n\nThe main difference with other P2P Bitcoin exchanges, such as LocalBitcoins or BitSquare, is that these exchanges function like eBay, i.e. with the need to establish contact with another person, agree on the price, and pay, trustingthat the user will receive the bitcoin. In Coinffeine, the process is automatic, safe and without arbitrators; the experience is the same as using an exchange as Bitstamp or Coinbase.\n\n“In LocalBitcoins or BitSquare you can’t do trading efficiently because you can’t keep orders in the market that run automatically. In these markets, when a user opens an order that corresponds to yours, you must intervene. Some platforms incorporate persons acting as an arbitrator in a dispute, which makes the process a little safer, but much slower and expensive,” said Go?mez.\n\nIn addition, with Coinffeine you do not have send your bitcoins to a platform to operate, as in Bitstamp. Instead, they remain at all times in your wallet, and only you have control over them.\n\nCoinffeine’s design is similar to BitTorrent: It works between users. This means that the user does not have to register or provide personal information to use the application – he or she can simply download it and use it.\n\nCoinffeine also is open source and the entire source code is available to anyone who wants to review it on Github.\n\nBrief history of Coinffeine\n\nCoinffeine is a Bitcoin startup based in Madrid. It was founded in 2014 by four Spanish engineers with previous experience working together on projects related to distributed systems and big data.\n\nIt was the first company in the world that was founded using bitcoin as social capital. The potential of Coinffeine’s work has been recognized at conferences such as CoinSummit. The Spanish organisation ICEX recently selected the startup as one of the 12 Spanish companies with most international outlook to be presented in Silicon Valley.\n\nPhoto by Freepik']"
05/07/2015,"[""Earlier this week, an enforcement arm of the Treasury Department fined a virtual currency company, Ripple Labs, $700,000 and said it “willfully violated” the bank secrecy act and failed to report suspicious activity.\n\nMr. Lawsky has been working for more than a year to establish a regulatory procedure to deal with the unusual nature of virtual currencies and the unique security risks that they present. He has proposed a so-called BitLicense and has said he hopes to complete it later this month.\n\nItBit avoided the need for a BitLicense by instead applying for a trust company charter, which appears to come with even stricter regulations. It is the first trust company to be created in New York since the financial crisis.\n\n“The technology behind Bitcoin and other virtual currencies could ultimately hold real promise, and it is critical that we set up appropriate rules of the road to help safeguard customer funds,” Mr. Lawsky said in a statement on Thursday. “Indeed, we believe that regulation will ultimately be important to the long-term health and development of the virtual currency industry.”\n\nMany Bitcoin companies have been held back by the difficulty of opening accounts with banks, which have been hesitant to deal with the risks of virtual currencies. As a trust company, itBit will be able to be the custodian of customer funds by itself.\n\nVideo\n\nThe process of obtaining the charter has been arduous and expensive and occupied itBit for more than a year. It has already been operating for foreign customers from Singapore.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBecause of the extensive requirements for opening an account with the company, itBit is planning to focus primarily on larger investors and financial institutions.\n\nThe company was founded by several people with Wall Street experience, including the chief executive, Mr. Cascarilla, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. The company’s chief operating officer, Andrew Chang, came to itBit from Google.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Last week, Goldman became the first bank to make a significant investment in a Bitcoin company when it helped lead a $50 million funding round for the Bitcoin payment company Circle.\n\nMany banks are most interested in the financial network, called the blockchain, that allows the Bitcoin digital tokens to be transferred quickly and cheaply.\n\nThe focus at itBit will be on allowing customers to buy, sell and hold the digital tokens as an asset, like a sort of digital gold.\n\nVideo\n\nSince Bitcoin was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator named Satoshi Nakamoto, the largest exchanges have mostly been outside the United States.\n\nMt. Gox, an exchange based in Tokyo, was the dominant exchange for years, but it declared bankruptcy last year and said that nearly $400 million worth of customer coins were either lost or stolen. A criminal investigation is continuing.\n\nMt. Gox was overtaken by Bitstamp, an exchange based in Slovenia. Earlier this year, though, Bitstamp was hacked and lost about $5 million in coins.\n\nMore recently, a company in San Francisco, Coinbase, said it was opening the first Bitcoin exchange to have all the necessary licenses in the United States. But soon after that announcement, Mr. Lawsky’s office said that Coinbase did not have the licenses needed to operate in New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Winklevoss brothers, famous from their legal battles with the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, announced their intention this year to open the first regulated United States Bitcoin exchange, but that has not come to fruition yet.\n\nMany early Bitcoin users, who were drawn to the virtual currency because of its independence from government, have opposed efforts to win regulatory approval for the technology. But itBit and other companies have said that approach is unlikely to work in bringing virtual currencies into the mainstream.\n\n“While some see Bitcoin as alluring for its potential to operate outside this system, we see it differently,” Mr. Cascarilla said in a blog post Thursday morning. “We believe Bitcoin and blockchain technology have immense potential within the system — to help make it more efficient, to offer new solutions and to bring us all into the future.”"", 'Registration\n\nMondaq Ltd requires you to register and provide information that personally identifies you, including what sort of information you are interested in, for three primary purposes:\n\nTo allow you to personalize the Mondaq websites you are visiting.\n\nTo enable features such as password reminder, newsletter alerts, email a colleague, and linking from Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) to your website.\n\nTo produce demographic feedback for our information providers who provide information free for your use.\n\nMondaq (and its affiliate sites) do not sell or provide your details to third parties other than information providers.

Could it? Would it? Should it? Like just about everything else involving finance, the topic of central banks and their potential replacements is complex with valid arguments for and against.\n\nPerspective: Central Banks Play an Important Role\n\nThe digital era may be taking aim at central banks, bit it has not yet managed to kill off the trusty Encyclopedia Britannica, so we turn to the venerable reference to learn that central banking can be traced back to Barcelona Spain in 1401. The first central bank, and those that followed in its wake, often helped nations fund wars and other government-supported initiatives.\n\nThe English refined the concept of central banking in 1844 with the Bank Charter Act, a legislative effort that laid the groundwork for an institution that had monopoly power to issue currency. The idea being that a bank with that level of power could help stabilize the financial system in times of crisis. It’s a concept that many experts agree helped stave off disaster during the 2007-2008 financial crisis (for more information, read The 2007-08 Financial Crisis In Review) and the Great Recession that followed. Today, modern central banks play a variety of roles. The U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, is tasked with using monetary policy as a tool to do the following:\n\n• Maintain full employment and stables prices\n\n• Ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and enable consumers to access credit\n\n• Stabilize the financial system in times of crisis\n\n• Help to oversee the nation’s payment systems\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the Federal Reserve and other central banks can increase or decrease interest rates and create or destroy money. For example, if the economy seems to be growing too quickly and causing prices for goods and services to rise so rapidly that they become unaffordable, a central bank can increase interest rates to make it more expensive for borrowers to access money. A central bank can also remove money from the economy by reducing the amount of money the central bank makes available to other banks for borrowing purposes. Since money largely exists on electronic balance sheets, simply hitting delete can make it disappear. Doing so reduces the amount of money available to purchase goods, theoretically causing prices to fall. Of course, every action has a reaction. While reducing the amount of money in circulation may cause prices to fall, it also makes it more difficult for businesses to borrow money. In turn, these businesses may become cautious, unwilling to invest, and unwilling to hire new workers.\n\nIf an economy is not growing quickly enough, central banks can reduce interest rates or create money. Reducing interest rates make it less expensive, and therefore easier and more appealing, for business and consumers to borrow money. Similarly, central banks can increase the amount of money banks have available to lend.\n\nCentral banks can also engage in additional efforts to manipulate economies. These efforts can include the purchase of securities (bonds) on the open market in an effort to generate demand for them. Increased demand leads to lower interest rates, as borrowers do not need to offer a higher rate because the central bank offers a ready and willing buyer. (Read more Bond Basics Tutorial)\n\nCentral bank-led efforts to steer economies on to the path to prosperity are fraught with peril. If interest rates are too low, inflation can become a problem. As prices rise and consumers can no longer afford to buy the items they wish to purchase, the economy can slow. If rates are too high, borrowing is stifled and the economy is hobbled.\n\nLow interest rates (relative to other nations) cause investors to pull money out of one country and send it to another country that offers a greater return in the form of higher interest rates. Consider the plight of retirees who rely on high interest rates to generate income. If rates are low, these people suffer a direct hit to their purchasing power and ability to pay their bills. Sending cash to a country that offers better returns is a logical decision.\n\nManipulation of interest rates and/or the monetary supply also has a direct effect on the value of a nation’s currency. A strong dollar makes it more expensive for domestic firms to sell goods abroad. This can lead to domestic unemployment. A weak dollar increases the price of imported goods, including oil and other commodities. This can make it more expensive for consumers to purchase imports and for domestic companies to produce goods that rely on imported parts or materials. Arguably, a weak dollar is beneficial for a slow economy that needs to pick up steam while a strong dollar is good for consumers.\n\nBecause there is a lag between the time a central bank begins to implement a policy change and that change actually having an impact on a nation’s economy, central banks are always looking to the future. They want to make policy changes today that will enable them to achieve future goals. For a closer look at central banks, check out What Are Central Banks? and Get To Know The Major Central Banks.\n\nPerspective: Central Bank are Unnecessary\n\nThe very complexities associated with national and global economies set the stage for an argument that these economies are too unpredictable to be successfully managed by the type of manipulation central banks engage in. This argument, made by proponents of the Austrian School of Economics, can be used to support the implementation of Bitcoin-style peer-to-peer currency that eliminates central banks and their complex schemes.\n\nFurthermore, modern central banks have been the subject of controversy since their inception. And the reasons for discontent are wide and varied. On one hand, the concept of monopoly power is profoundly disturbing to many people. On another, the existence of an independent, opaque entity that has the power to manipulate an economy is even more disturbing. Along these lines, many people (including economists and politicians) believe that central banks make mistakes that have enormous ramifications in the lives of citizens. These mistakes include increases in the monetary supply (creating inflation and hurting consumers by raising prices for the goods and services they purchase), the implementation of interest rate increases (hurting consumers who wish to borrow money), the formulation of policies that keep inflation too low (resulting in unemployment), and the implementation of unnaturally low interest rates (creating asset bubbles in real estate, stocks, or bonds). Along these lines, no less an authority than former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke blames manipulation by the central bank (which raised interest rates) for the Great Depression of 1929.\n\nIn an era when technology has enabled consumers to engage in commerce without the need for a central authority, an argument can be made that central banks are no longer necessary. A broader examination of the banking system extends this argument. Corruption associated with the banking system resulted in the Great Recession and a host of scandals. Bankers have caused great angst in Greece and other nations. Organizations such as the International Monetary Fund have been cited for fostering profits over people. And at the more local level, bankers make billions of dollars by serving as the middle men in transaction between individuals. In this environment, the elimination of the entire banking system is an appealing concept to many people.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCentral banks are currently the dominant structure nations use to manage their economies. They have monopoly power and are not going to give up that power without a fight. While Bitcoin and other digital currencies have generated significant interest, their adoption rates are miniscule and government support for them is virtually nonexistent. Until and unless governments recognize Bitcoin as legitimate currency, it has little hope of killing off central banks any time soon. That noted, central banks across the globe are watching and studying Bitcoin. Based on the fact that metal coins are expensive to manufacture (often costing more than their face value), it is more likely than not that central banks will one day issue digital currencies of their own."", 'Unocoin, a trading platform in India, has reportedly been at the center of an intensifying debate in India over the legality and regulation of Bitcoin. The trading platform portends to be India’s Bitcoin Exchange, and has shut down once before due to uncertainties over Bitcoin in the country.\n\nAccording to a BitcoinTalk Bitcoin Forum Hero Member, Dashingriddler (OP), who claims to be affiliated with the Unocoin team, the company’s directors were asked to visit their local authorities this week. As OP writes,\n\nThe officer is bothered about bitcoins coming to India bypassing the regulated route and those bitcoins being exchanged for INR in India using [services] like Unocoin.\n\nAs Unocoin learned in the first day of meetings, the Indian had questions not only about their services, but about Bitcoin in general. According to Unocoin, the authorities “had the idea of transaction volumes on Unocoin and this officer we are talking to know a LOT about Bitcoin technically.” The meeting with the official on Wednesday continued through Thursday.\n\nThroughout the BitcoinTalk thread, the OP clarifies exactly what has been discussed in the meetings:\n\n“The question [goes] back to – “Where exactly can I see what you are doing is legal in India and you are not violating any regulation?” According to OP, it seems the officer is arguing that, “if Bitcoin is not declared legal, then even face to face transactions would [be deemed] illegal.”\n\nAlthough OP could not disclose which authority he was speaking with, he did note that the authorities had some questions regarding a particular customer of Unocoin, whose information was not requested. The poster describes the main issue of the meetings:\n\nThe issue we are trying to address is, how can an external official figure out from where the bitcoins (funds) are coming from without really questioning the person who got the bitcoins. They can do this with all regulated channels but not with bitcoins.\n\nThere are certain points the OP and the official agree on:\n\nIn the conversations about Bitcoin, when I mention bitcoins are not illegal – I am not getting confronted…When I say there are no regulations for bitcoin in India as of now – I am not getting confronted.\n\nOP clarifies: “The officers are agreeing with me when I say these.”\n\nIt appears that the officials in question recognize that the Bitcoin technology has brought up new regulatory issues for them to consider and are questioning users to identify how to regulate Bitcoin. An obvious answer to this, as industrialized nations have noticed, is to merely regulate Bitcoin businesses, in particular exchanges.\n\nThe drama comes less than six months after an Indian Reserve Bank Governor claimed that “Bitcoin is fascinating.“\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The blockchain is a unique way for a distributed network of computers that don’t necessarily trust each other to achieve consensus. Stephen Pair explains why this is important\n\nNew technologies are usually conceived with a specific use case in mind. But often that purpose evolves over time, and sometimes it changes beyond all recognition.\n\nTake bitcoin. It was created as a digital cryptocurrency, but anyone who remembers Digicash from the 1990s will know that cryptocurrencies are nothing new, and several of them have already come and gone. But Bitcoin is different.\n\nThe Decentralized Blockchain\n\nUnlike other currencies and payment networks, bitcoin is not controlled by a bank, government, or even a financial institution. Instead, thousands and thousands of computers around the world independently verify encrypted transactions and manage a decentralized ledger of every transfer on the network. This ledger can be accessed online by anyone.\n\nCrucially, while records can be added to the ledger, no existing transactions can be changed or removed. It’s a permanent record that cannot be corrupted. The ledger essentially creates a trail of financial DNA which removes the possibility for fraud, theft or compromising sensitive data.\n\nThis open-source technology which underpins the entire bitcoin ecosystem is called the blockchain. It is a unique way for a distributed network of computers that don’t necessarily trust each other to achieve consensus. But why is this so important?\n\nCommercialization and Control\n\nAs the internet has become increasingly commercialized over the years, we have witnessed a growing centralization of network infrastructure, with power and control concentrated among a small number of very wealthy corporations.\n\nThis has led to legitimate concerns about net neutrality and the ability of ISPs to control the web and tap into private user communications. As a result of well-publicized cases where user privacy has been violated, many internet users are becoming increasingly skeptical of how companies and government organizations are using the internet to track and analyze their behavior online, as demonstrated by the court case Google v González which eventually led to the ‘right to be forgotten’ becoming established in law.\n\nRebuilding Trust\n\nIt’s an issue of eroded trust. Trust between consumers, between businesses, between organizations and between governments has been broken down. The blockchain has the power to remove the need for trust in any third party, as every device involved in the public ledger must work to reach a consensus.', 'UPDATE (7th May 18:52 BST): Comment added from Brian Donegan, head of operations for digital development and e-business at the Department of Economic Development and Nick Williamson, CEO of Pythia.\n\nThe Isle of Man\'s Department of Economic Development today announced plans to trial the first government-run blockchain project.\n\nUsing proof-of-stake protocol Credits, developed by local startup Pythia, the department will create a registry of digital currency companies operating on the island.\n\nBrian Donegan, head of operations for digital development and e-business at the Department of Economic Development, told CoinDesk the project marked a step towards the use of blockchain technology within government, though he stressed it remained an ""experimental technical trial"".\n\n""What we’re actually looking at is a major initiative on the back of the work the Isle of Man has been doing around cryptocurrencies ... We’re the first to do this but we’ll be assessing it as we go.""\n\nCrypto-businesses who come to the island will still require approval from the Financial Supervision Commission, the department’s regulator.\n\nHowever, Donegan said it was ""entirely possible"" the Commission would implement a trial of its own.\n\n""We would anticipate that at a later date that the Financial Supervision Commission will do their own dedicated register ... it’s entirely possible they might want to have their own blockchain.""\n\nCredits\n\nNick Williamson, CEO of Pythia, the startup behind Credits, told CoinDesk the move highlighted the ""wider use"" of blockchain technology outside digital currencies. He added:\n\n""There has been a lot of talk over the past four to five years about such a thing being able to happen in the future, but we need to show the potential and show it can be a frictionless endeavour. I think this a good first step.""\n\nThe Department for Economic Development will use a customised proof-of-stake model on the Credits protocol to secure its registry.\n\nWilliamson explained the network will be manned by three ""validating"" nodes within the department, though anyone can download its client.\n\n""Whenever any two of those nodes agree on a block, then that block will be part of the blockchain. Anybody who connects to the network can audit and download the blockchain. It will be interesting to see how many do connect once it\'s up and running,"" he said.\n\nThe benefit of using Credit\'s consensus model, against bitcoin\'s proof-of-work for example, is that you ""only pay for the transactions that actually happen"", rather than the upkeep of the network, Williamson added.\n\nRegulation\n\nIncluding Pythia, there are 25 digital currency businesses currently based on the Isle of Man.\n\nApril saw the introduction of anti-money laundering (AML) laws that require all these firms to collect ID information and report suspicious activity to authorities.\n\nThe Financial Supervision Commission will oversee AML matters after the legislation receives Royal Assent in the UK, which Donegan hopes to happen ""in the next couple of months"".\n\nHe added:\n\n""The Isle of Man is adamant in its forthcoming regulations that it wants to protect the consumer and keep crime out. It\'s very keen to use as many mechanisms, tests and technical trials that will assist that long-term objective.""\n\nWhile murmurs of government involvement in Central America and Hong Kong have surfaced, the Isle of Man is the first nation to pin its colours to bitcoin’s mast.\n\nThe Department of Economic Development\'s trial is set to start privately next week, with a public release expected later this month.\n\nAdditional reporting contributed by Yessi Bello Perez.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But even if it doesn’t turn out to be, a growing group of investors and entrepreneurs is convinced that the idea at the center of Bitcoin could revolutionize industries that rely on digital record keeping. It might replace conventional methods of keeping track of valuable information like contracts, intellectual-property rights, and even online voting results.\n\nBitcoin’s real promise, they say, is not the currency. It’s the underlying technology, in which thousands of computers in a distributed network use cryptographic techniques to create a permanent, public record of every single Bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred (see “What Bitcoin Is and Why It Matters”). Investors are betting that this record-keeping system, called the blockchain, will be valuable for many other things besides tracking payments.\n\nIt’s become common for enthusiasts to compare where Bitcoin is now to where the Internet was in the 1980s and early 1990s. Joel Monegro, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, says the open-source technology that creates the blockchain can be fairly compared to the open-source protocol that is the basis for the Internet, called TCP/IP. Technically a pair of protocols, the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, TCP/IP dictates the specific ways data is packaged and routed between computers in a network. For years after TCP/IP was invented, the technology was accessible only to people with a certain level of technical knowledge. Similarly, right now Bitcoin is too arcane for most people and challenging to use even for those who are familiar with it.\n\nEventually, additional protocols were built that worked with TCP/IP and paved the way for e-mail applications, Web browsers, file transfer services, and so on. Something similar could be brewing now with Bitcoin. The process for making payments with the currency can be thought of as just the first application built on the blockchain system, says Brian Forde, the director of digital currency at MIT’s Media Lab. New protocols being built on top of the foundational technology could lead to easy-to-use consumer products and services.\n\nWhat might those be? Anything that would benefit from having information stored in an unchangeable database that is not owned or controlled by any single entity and yet is accessible from anywhere at any time.\n\nOne early example of such a “Blockchain 2.0” service is Counterparty, which promises its users they can “engage in advanced financial contracts without having to trust anyone else to hold your funds or do your accounting.” In addition to providing a platform for exchanging bitcoins, Counterparty stores important accounting or contractual information in the blockchain.\n\nAnother early-stage company taking this general approach is Factom, which is aiming to appeal to a wide range of businesses. Factom says it can “maintain a permanent, time-stamped record” of a company’s data in the blockchain, which will “reduce the cost and complexity of audit trails, managing records, and complying with government regulations.” To test the concept, it has teamed with a medical records company to build a tool health-care providers could use to store data that would be valuable during billing disputes or audits.\n\nThe reason the blockchain has the potential to be an all-purpose global database is that as every Bitcoin transaction is verified cryptographically by thousands of computers running the software, they can add a small volume of additional information. Right now that is roughly 40 characters, but there are ways around that limit. A service can build a separate network that can store more information and then use cryptography to encode that information as a string of numbers and letters small enough to be written into the blockchain. Counterparty and Factom employ this basic principle.\n\nOne twist, though, is that bitcoins themselves are still inherent to the process: they provide the incentive for people to help make all this happen. Verifying transactions and storing their data in the blockchain earns “miners” newly minted bitcoins. In other words, any service that aims to use the blockchain as a general-purpose database will have to pass a bitcoin (or a fraction of one) around in the process. Or it will have to find some other way to motivate miners to put the information into the ledger.\n\nThe concept of a blockchain is not limited to Bitcoin, and several other networks have recently emerged as potential alternatives. Indeed, Bitcoin’s blockchain isn’t even necessarily the one that is best equipped to have applications built on top of it. But Bitcoin has gained by far the most traction and has the biggest network, which makes it more resilient than the others, says Monegro.\n\nIf it is to become a mainstream technology, Bitcoin’s software will probably need to be adjusted so that it can handle the huge transaction volumes that would be involved (see “The Man Who Really Built Bitcoin”). There are also open questions about how well Bitcoin’s design will hold up over the long term (see “Academics Spy Weaknesses in Bitcoin’s Foundations” and “Price Slump Tests Bitcoin’s Self-Correcting Economics”). Nonetheless, if the future of blockchain technology is not necessarily contingent on the future of Bitcoin, the powerful idea at the currency’s core is likely to be here to stay.', ""Bitcoins are widely called “digital gold,” so it's fitting that many crypto fans like their physical gold, too. Several companies have sprung up in the last two years to serve this bitcoins-to-gold market.\n\nWhy buy gold? Some choose it as a savings instrument, others a trading commodity, and still others as a fiat-free hedge against crypto volatility. Whatever your purpose, the following five companies may pop up onto your radar:\n\nSerica\n\nThis San Francisco-based company was rebranded this year from the name DigitalTangible. They've been called a “trailblazer in the gold-bitcoin space” for launching the first online gold/bitcoin trading platform last year.\n\nSerica uses Counterparty tokens (colored bitcoins) to issue “proof-of-custody” certificates for the gold, which is held in vaults in either Delaware (U.S.) or Singapore. Serica doesn't require government papers to use its services.\n\nSerica also pays bitcoins to sellers who mail them their gold though their Bitcoin4Gold program.\n\nVaultoro\n\nJoshua Scigala is reported to have lost a chunk of change in Mt. Gox's collapse, and he went on to found Vaultoro as a “glass books” bitcoin-gold exchange.\n\nThe exchange uses three types of bitcoin wallets. They include “a hot wallet that is hosted online and used for daily trades, a warm wallet for auditing purpose that holds an amount of Bitcoin slightly above the amount in the hot wallet, and finally, mutisignature cold wallets, which hold the majority of users' funds.”\n\nVaultoro's vaults are located in Switzerland, and are audited bi-annually by BDO International. No government papers are required to purchase through Vaultoro unless the user buys more than US$5000 worth of gold per day. Services are not offered to anyone from Iran, Syria or North Korea.\n\nMidas Rezerv\n\nMRCoin is the meta-cryptocurrency (colored bitcoin) of Thailand-based Midas Rezerv. One MRCoin represents one gram of gold bullion, stored at one of several vaults across the world: Dubai, Amsterdam, or Hong Kong.\n\nAn audit of Midas Rezerv's holdings is regularly published on the bitcoin blockchain itself.\n\nMidas Rezerv does not act as an exchange, but rather a MRCoin seller and wallet provider. They require no government papers to use their service.\n\nBitreserve\n\nWith offices in both San Francisco and Shanghai, Bitreserve acts as a counterparty between bitcoins and a handful of fiat currencies, including U.S. dollars, yuan and euros. They convert them back and forth between one another on demand to allow spending in the currency of one's choice.\n\nBitreserve claims to have US$1,664,187 worth of currencies in their vault as of today. This amount is published via their “Reservechain™” and “Reserveledger™” systems. (Their site does not list the physical location where these currencies are stored).\n\nAnd yes, those are trademark symbols you see. Bitreserve claims ownership of some commonly-used words, including “bitsilver” and “bitgold.”\n\nA phone number is required to start an account, and government papers are only required “when certain account limits have been exceeded” or if you claim residency in China.\n\nBitGold\n\nThis Canada-based bitcoin-to-gold reserve service must not have gotten the memo that Bitreserve owns the word “bitgold.” And still BitGold manages to offer customers some unique services.\n\nAmong them is the BitGold Mastercard, which acts as a debit/credit card that draws on the customer's gold holdings with the company. They also have their own ATMs, called BitGold ATMs, which allow the immediate purchase of gold to one's account within 1% of spot price.\n\nThe gold is stored in “Brinks in Toronto, New York, London, Zurich, Hong Kong, and Singapore among others.” Government papers are required to use the service.\n\nGolden Opportunities, Etc.\n\nThough it doesn't fit our category of outright owning gold, BitShares is worth a mention as it offers gold futures trading. Smart futures contracts are available in “BitAsset” tokens called bitGold (don't tell Bitreserve!).\n\nAnd for those interested in physically holding gold themselves, Amagi Metals has been accepting Bitcoin for precious metals since 2012. The Amagi team are such fans of various cryptocurrencies that beginning in 2016, they'll no longer accept fiat. Veldt Gold also buys and sells precious metals for Bitcoin, and has never accepted credit cards as a matter of principle.\n\nLastly, remember that whenever you let someone else hold your property (in this case gold), you're taking on trusted third-party risk. This means that any of these companies could decide to make off with your metals in the night. This is where market reputation, due diligence, and risk management come into play. Don't let a third party hold anything that you can't afford to lose, and be certain of the terms of delivery should you ever wish to take physical possession of the gold."", '""For the first time, digital art becomes collectable and tradable without printing or materializing it."" - Stephan Vogler\n\nWith the help of Bitcoin, a new kind of license transforms the usage rights to copyright-protected digital artworks into limited and tradable virtual properties. CoinTelegraph spoke with entrepreneur and artist Stephan Vogler, who publishes his artwork under this new license that provides more usage rights and easily-proven ownership.\n\nVogler and the art law experts of dtb rechtsanwälte in Berlin teamed up to create a license based on Bitcoin technology to transform digital artworks into technically and legally limited and tradable virtual properties.\n\n“These licenses can be securely transferred worldwide with minimal transaction costs and — if paid with bitcoins — securely sold without the need for an escrow service,” explains Vogler. All usage rights owners are recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n-- Faces Series by Stephan Vogler\n\nCoinTelegraph: First, could you tell us a little bit about yourself and how you got into Bitcoin?\n\nStephen Vogler: I’m co-founder and managing director of an online games company in Germany. We\'re developing and running some very successful MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) for more than 10 years. So I\'ve got a thorough understanding of virtual items and their market value. I also have a long-standing interest in information technology, modern art and law. Discovering that digital art hasn\'t touched some very interesting conceptual topics, I started to create digital artworks myself.\n\n“[T]he blockchain is the first decentralized trustable database […]. You can use it to transform any kind of legal claim into an independent virtual property.”\n\nI learned about Bitcoin in 2013 and soon realized that the blockchain is the first decentralized trustable database, which can track the ownership of virtual properties in a reliable way. You can use it to transform any kind of legal claim into an independent virtual property.\n\nCT: You are one of the first people in the world to apply a license for every published work, using the Bitcoin blockchain to transform its usage rights “into an immaterial good.” How is this license created and how does it work?\n\nSV: Think of the license as a piece of paper that says: ""Whoever owns this piece of paper is the only person allowed to use the work."" Just like Bitcoin can replace banknotes, Bitcoin can replace this piece of paper.\n\nThis is how it works: The author publishes the license text file together with his digital signature file. The license text includes a Bitcoin address, which belongs to the author. The author is now able to put a file (e.g., a digital artwork) under the license by creating a transaction from this address with a hash value of the file in one of the transaction\'s outputs (using OP_RETURN). The recipient of this transaction is the licensee who owns the usage rights. The license is exclusive and is granted only to this recipient. A new transaction can then transfer the usage rights to a new owner.\n\nCT: Are you using any third-party services to do this (Factom, Counterparty, etc.)? Do you think these types of solutions would improve upon your method?\n\nSV: No, I\'m not using any third-party services. To put new files under my license, I\'m using a simple script, and to transfer the immaterial goods, you can use the standard Bitcoin client. There are a couple of projects out there that try to implement similar concepts or parts of it as a service. They are in a very early stage of realization and differ in various aspects. In the future, they will certainly help to bring the concept to a larger audience.\n\nFor me, it\'s important that my digital artworks don\'t depend on a single service. They will exist and are transferable as long as the blockchain exists.\n\nCT: How can artists showcase their work to potential buyers without it being copied?\n\nSV: The concept does not prevent anyone from copying the work itself. However, the license enables the owner of the exclusive usage rights to prove his ownership. An example: A digital photo is put under the license and sold as an immaterial good to an art collector. If someone else sells prints of the photo, the art collector is able to prove his exclusive ownership of the usage rights and sue this person.\n\n“[T]he blockchain can unlock the true potential of digital art.”\n\nCT: How beneficial could the blockchain be in the art world? What specific problems can it solve?\n\nSV: Until now, in the art world everything is built on trust. There is no way to prove the authenticity or scarcity of material art. Art collectors need to trust auction houses, art dealers, authentication boards and of course the artists themselves. Unfortunately there is a long, sad history of abuses of this trust in the art world. The blockchain and its scripting mechanisms can help to reduce the necessary amount of trust to a minimum. In this way the blockchain can unlock the true potential of digital art.\n\nThis includes the following advantages:\n\nThe authenticity of the signature and the signature date of the work can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt;\n\nThe entitlement to the connected usage rights can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt;\n\nThe good can be securely and instantaneously sold or transferred worldwide with minimal transaction costs;\n\nIf the good is paid with bitcoins it can be securely sold worldwide without the need for an escrow service.\n\nCT: The granting of the right to transfer the “immaterial good” is exclusive and legally limited to only one licensee. What happens after the piece of digital art is sold and the rights are transferred? Can the buyer make multiple copies of this work after buying it?\n\nSV: The buyer will be the only person who is allowed to distribute digital or physical copies of the work. He is also the only person who can transfer the usage rights to a new owner. However, if he does, he will lose the usage rights.\n\nCT: You mention that if the good is paid for with bitcoins, no escrow service is needed. However, what guarantee does the buyer have that they will receive the artwork and the exclusive license?\n\nSV: Thanks to the way Bitcoin transactions work, it is possible to transfer the usage rights and pay for this transfer in a single transaction. Either both things will happen — the transfer AND the payment — or both will fail. It\'s not possible that only one part of the transaction fails.\n\n“[P]eople will try to use the blockchain to turn almost every legal claim into an immaterial good (e.g., copyrights, patents, stocks, trademarks).”\n\nCT: To what other “immaterial goods” can Bitcoin’s technology be applied, in your opinion? Do these good have to be immaterial? For example, can the blockchain be used to determine the ownership, authenticity or provenance of physical goods, as well?\n\nSV: I think people will try to use the blockchain to turn almost every legal claim into an immaterial good (e.g., copyrights, patents, stocks, trademarks). If this really works out or not depends on the laws in the various countries. Of course, legal claims can also refer to physical objects (e.g., the right to use a car or the right to live in an apartment). However, the blockchain will only keep track of the ownership of these rights. I don\'t see any way to prove the authenticity of physical goods with the help of the blockchain.\n\nCT: Loopholes in the patent system have led to the emergence of a burgeoning patent troll industry that comprises over $29 billion dollars annually. Do you think the protected digital property could undercut this practice (by eliminating the need for litigation since the blockchain can be easily used to prove ownership)?\n\nSV: Probably not. Even though the blockchain can help to easily prove ownership, it will not prevent anyone from violating the rights connected to the ownership. The process of enforcement of the rights will stay the same.', ""The Connecticut House of Representatives has passed a bill that would give the state's top financial regulator new powers to oversee parts of the local digital currency industry.\n\nIf signed into law, Substitute House Bill No. 6800 would require a company seeking a money transmission license from the Connecticut Banking Department to specify that it plans to offer digital currency services. State regulators would then be empowered to assess whether or not to reject that applicant’s request based on the potential risks to consumers.\n\nThe bill states:\n\n“The bill allows the commissioner to deny a money transmission license to an otherwise qualified applicant who will or may engage in business involving virtual currency if the commissioner believes it would be an undue risk of financial loss to consumers, considering the applicant's proposed business model.”\n\nPassed unanimously in the House on 6th May, the bill now moves to the Senate for approval. If approved and signed by Connecticut Governor Dannel P Malloy, the bill would also put in place new laws regarding payday loans, mortgages and consumer credit reporting.\n\nDifferent bond requirements\n\nThe proposed law outlines how license applicants may face additional hurdles should they opt to serve the digital currency market.\n\n“The bill allows the commissioner to place additional requirements, restrictions, or conditions on the license of an applicant involved with virtual currency,” the bill states.\n\nThese stipulations could include “different surety bond requirements than ordinarily apply to money transmitters”. The bond posted by a company seeking a money transmission license would have to reflect the price fluctuations in the digital currency market, according to the bill, which reads:\n\n“For applicants and licensees who will or may engage in the business of transmitting monetary value in the form of virtual currency, such bond shall be in a principal sum as determined by the commissioner and shall be calculated reasonably to address the current and prospective volatility of the market in such currency or currencies.”\n\nThe proposed law also identifies ‘virtual currencies’ as digital units of exchange in both centralized and decentralized systems. Units used exclusively for gambling and consumer reward points that cannot be redeemed for fiat currencies would not fall under this definition.\n\nA full copy of the bill can be found below:\n\n2015HB-06800-R000177-FC\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Netki has now launched a service that should do for Bitcoin what domain names did for the internet: for about US$20, the company will register your wallet addresses to a traditional ICANN-served domain (.com, .org, .net, etc.).', '""I\'ve moved on to other things...""\n\nThese sound like the words of a man who invested everything in a failed invention, a man who discards a lost cause, a failed gym membership, or the latest juice diet after determining that enough is enough. That\'s why hearing these words from Nakamoto in April 2011 seems so mysterious. Just imagine if Bill Gates had disappeared after launching Windows 95 or if Steve Jobs had vanished prior to the release of the first iPhone.\n\n\n\nNakamoto is hailed as the brilliant mastermind behind an incredibly successful protocol and open-source software called Bitcoin. This begs the question--where is Nakamoto now? And what is he currently working on? What would motivate someone to create such an innovative technology and then seemingly want nothing to do with it?\n\n\n\nPerhaps Nakamoto knows something that we don\'t?\n\n\n\nBitcoin: A Legacy\n\n\n\nWhile Bitcoin, Nakamoto\'s brainchild, is now several years old and seeping into mainstream culture, many people still have no idea how it actually works. Luckily, it\'s easier to pin down and understand the inner workings of Bitcoin technology than the mind of the mastermind who is allegedly behind it.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is described as digital peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. That\'s geek-speak for digital money. In similar spirit to a cash transaction between trustworthy friends, Bitcoin allows for a democratic payment exchange, built upon a foundation of trust and immediacy. Essentially, individuals can send digital payments directly to each other without going through a middleman financial institution.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin makes it easy to send money around the world with no transaction fees, since no third party financial institutes are required. It is an easy and effective choice; this is one of its major selling points. Another appealing characteristic is the level of anonymity it can afford, as it\'s possible to send and receive bitcoins without providing any personal information that might endanger your identity.\n\n\n\nLike most game-changing e-commerce inventions, Bitcoin is also a favourite among its early adopters within the criminal underworld. Sites such as the Silk Road allow people to exchange illegal contraband without detection, relying on Bitcoin\'s anonymity. New innovations such as the Dark Wallet further raise questions over Bitcoin and its appeal among money launderers. Think about it; a currency which offers total anonymity when transactions are configured correctly is a money launderer\'s dream! Remember that the internet was also plagued with scandal during its early years and it\'s certainly not a gathering place for saints and angels today.\n\n\n\nAllegedly, even the federal agents investigating the Silk Road case have not being able to resist temptation.\n\nAccording to this press release provided by the FBI in March 2015"" two former agents were indeed charged with wire fraud and money laundering. Bitcoin has already experienced many scandals due to its association with the dark web, criminal activity, and fluctuations in value.\n\nAs of May 2015, one Bitcoin is worth about $240, down from a high of $1,240 in 2013.\n\n\n\nThe Allure of Bitcoin\n\nThe libertarian nature of a decentralised currency is the most disruptive concept since the internet itself. Stop a second and think about how far we\'ve come. Imagine if, 15 years ago, someone were to tell you that you could send instant messages in real time, for free, from a mobile device anywhere in the world. You\'d probably think that both the person and the notion were pretty crazy. About as farfetched as The Terminator becoming Governor of California...\n\n\n\nRegardless of California\'s choice of governor, the impact of the internet is nonetheless inarguable. Yet while the internet has transformed how we communicate, the financial system has not kept pace. It can take days to transfer money between accounts; that\'s understandable, since it\'s layered with so many complex fees, taxes, and regulations.\n\n\n\nToday, Bitcoin has the potential to completely revamp global commerce by reducing the cost of digital transactions for businesses, removing international currency conversion costs, and eliminating costly chargebacks (since bitcoin transactions are irreversible.)\n\n\n\nJust as nobody puts baby in the corner, nobody controls Bitcoin. It exists independently of individuals, countries, banks, and governments. This is both Bitcoin\'s greatest strength and greatest weakness. One the one hand, this freedom prevents corrupt governments from tampering with its value; the darker flip side, however, appears when something goes wrong and there is no one to turn to and no one to be held accountable...\n\n\n\nIt is this lack of control that terrifies some bankers and governments; Bitcoin\'s anonymity meanwhile keeps law enforcement agencies on edge. Bitcoin has the potential to impact international currencies in the same way that mp3s impacted the music industry. Can our traditional banks and financial systems survive a ""Napster"" of modern currency transactions?\n\n\n\nBlockchain: The Technology Behind Bitcoin\n\n\n\nThe Blockchain is a distributed database that manages all Bitcoin transactions and acts as a public ledger of all transactions in the Bitcoin network. You could think of it as a giant public spreadsheet. Blockchain also solved the ""double spend problem"" that plagued previous digital currencies.\n\n\n\nI\'ve stated that Bitcoin offers anonymity, yet it\'s probably one of the most transparent financial systems that exists since all transactions are publicly logged in the Blockchain, yet the information used can\'t identify anyone if set up correctly. Given that most people struggle setting up their digital recorders, it\'s likely that the people who will avail of Bitcoin\'s anonymity are not the people you\'d like to get help from setting up your digital recorder.\n\n\n\nA ""bitcoin"" is generated when computers running specialised software solve complex mathematical equations. This is called bitcoin mining. It was possible to mine for bitcoins on your home computer; today, you\'d be competing with large-scale bitcoin mining farms in China that spend over $80K on electricity alone each month.\n\nWhat\'s interesting is the possibility of using the Blockchain for purposes beyond that of Bitcoin. Entrepreneurs are now turning their attention to outdated, back-office financial systems, and Blockchain-eqsue technology has the potential to revolutionise the payments industry--along with many other industries--given its secure, powerful, and decentralised architecture.\n\n\n\nWhile no one can positively predict what the future holds for Bitcoin, two things are certain: the financial system is ripe for disruption, and digital currencies are here to stay. They might even transport old-school banks and malfunctioning governments into the 21st century.\n\n\n\nBack To Nakamoto\n\n\n\nNakamoto published his original Bitcoin paper in 2008.\n\nThe following year, he launched Bitcoin software and released the first 50 bitcoins. The first known transaction was for a pizza that in 2013 was estimated to be worth well over $7 million. I hope that pizza was worth it.\n\nBy late 2010, however, Nakamoto began to fade from the scene. While he always worked with other individuals, he was careful not to reveal any personal details with the people he collaborated with online in the Cryptography Mailing List at metzdowd.com. This ensured that he retained his cloak of invisibility.\n\nSince then, several attempts have been made at trying to identify Nakamoto. Most people assume that he is Japanese, if only due to the name; this is more than likely a cover given his use of language and perfect English, and the fact that the original bitcoin.org domain was registered by a Finnish company based in Helsinki. Maybe these were all subtle tricks to throw us off his trail.\n\n\n\nIs he even a ""he""? Is this identity even based on a single person, or is there an entire organization lurking behind this, masking their identity with a logo and a name? Could it possibly even be some sort of cyber-criminal mastermind who walked out of a modern James Bond film and invented the perfect underworld currency?\n\n\n\nThree Possible Candidates:\n\nJed McCaleb | image source: e-money.com\n\nA researcher by the name of Skye Grey believes the real Nakamoto is Nick Szabo . For one, Szabo developed a system called ""bit gold"", which is a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture. People have also taken into consideration an analysis of Szabo\'s writing style and his cool reaction to Bitcoin given that he\'d spent nearly ten years working on cryptocurrencies. Szabo denied being Nakamoto. The evidence linking this ""origin story"" to Bitcoin\'s creation is interesting but hardly convincing.\n\n. For one, Szabo developed a system called ""bit gold"", which is a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture. People have also taken into consideration an analysis of Szabo\'s writing style and his cool reaction to Bitcoin given that he\'d spent nearly ten years working on cryptocurrencies. Szabo denied being Nakamoto. The evidence linking this ""origin story"" to Bitcoin\'s creation is interesting but hardly convincing. Joshua Davis, a reporter at The New Yorker, published a fascinating investigative article backing his belief that Michael Clear --a cryptography graduate from Trinity College in Ireland--is the original Nakamoto. According to this Business Insider article Michael was:\n\n--a cryptography graduate from Trinity College in Ireland--is the original Nakamoto. Hired by Allied Irish Banks to improve its currency-trading software, and [who] co-authored an academic paper on peer-to-peer technology. The [first-ever Bitcoin academic] paper employed British spelling. Clear was well versed in economics, cryptography and peer-to-peer networks."" Like Szabo, Michael Clear has denied this claim publicly. A third potential suspect is Jed McCaleb, creator of the troubled Tokyo based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox (an acronym for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange). McCaleb has since moved on and co-founded the decentralised payment exchange Ripple. Could his time in Tokyo have influenced him to create a Japanese pseudonym and could he have just gotten tired of the Bitcoin protocol and moved on to Ripple? Again, I think the evidence here is pretty loose; still, Jed McCaleb is an interesting candidate.\n\nWhile many more theories about this mysterious figure do exist, the fact remains that no one has been successful in conclusively finding or unveiling the ""real"" Nakamoto. The truth is, I\'m actually not overly concerned with who the real Nakamoto is, and I rather hope his identity remains a mystery. Everyone has the right to privacy, including cyber geniuses.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\'m more interested in Nakamoto\'s motivation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Art of Anonymity\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as a true artist lives by his or her art--creating and being remembered through a legacy of masterpieces--Nakamoto\'s anonymity perfectly mirrors the anonymity of his Bitcoin masterpiece.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mystery surrounding Nakamoto\'s identity and disappearance might be far more mundane than we think. Perhaps he really is just someone who became worried or disappointed after witnessing how Bitcoin was being abused by the criminal underworld. Maybe he didn\'t want to attract the attention of U.S. authorities due to cases they\'ve filed against companies and individuals involved in creating new currencies, which is illegal (or at least resides in a ""grey area"") in the States.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom what I\'ve read, Nakamoto\'s motivations seem politically inspired due to the libertarian nature of Bitcoin. However, it\'s claimed that he owns 1 million bitcoins, which does seem capitalistic. I suppose inventing a global currency is one way to get rich.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn today\'s fame-craving, media-obsessed, I-want-it-now culture, it\'s refreshing to think that modern Bruce Wayne characters exist, quietly going about their business, selflessly focused on delivering value for the greater good. Which then begs the question--is Nakamoto the real Batman (or Daredevil) of the cryptocurrency?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhoever Nakamoto is or isn\'t, no one can deny his mysterious brilliance and the influential legacy he has left behind.', 'Bitcoin exchange BTCXIndia has announced that it is closing its doors later this month following the loss of its banking partner.\n\nThe India-based exchange, which featured a live trading platform and wallet service, said in a statement on its website and via email that it would close its doors on 20th May.\n\nThe exchange operator suggested that the closure was a result of a broader policy shift on the part of its Indian banking partner, explaining:\n\n""We have been informed by our bank that they will no longer serve bitcoin businesses. We have investigated the possibility to operate through other banks, but it seems this is a general policy in India as of today.""\n\nBTCXIndia urged users to withdraw their funds before the cut off date and suggested that the exchange could reopen should a new banking partner be acquired in the future.\n\nThe exchange, launched in May of last year, had previously emphasized its commitment to regulatory compliance and cooperation with the Indian government. Its closure is notable given unconfirmed reports of regulatory issues facing other exchanges in India.\n\nCoinDesk reached out to BTCXIndia, which declined further comment.', 'Joe Maristela, a healthcare entrepreneur, has invested $100,000 in Satoshi Citadel Industries (SCI) and has challenged other traditional business owners to follow him by investing in Philippine technologies. SCI is an umbrella firm for seven Philippine bitcoin companies, including Rebit.ph, a remittance service, Bitmarket.ph, a bitcoin payment processor, and the recently-acquired BuyBitcoin.ph, a bitcoin exchange.\n\nSCI’s mission is to increase bitcoin adoption in the Philippines through the creation of solutions that realize the full potential of bitcoin technology.\n\nBelieving in a mission\n\nMaristela said he invested in SCI since he believes in its mission. He also thinks it has the team in place to ensure the company’s success. Officers include John Bailon, CEO, Jardine Gerodias, COO, and Miguel Cuneta, CCO. Cuneta was one of the co-founders, bringing SCI’s first vertical, Bitmarket.ph, the first bitcoin payment processor in the country with nearly 100 merchants.\n\nMaristela’s investment signifies the growing interest bitcoin is attracting from business leaders from other industries.\n\nMaristela spent most of the past 16 years in his healthcare company, PediaHealth Medical Group. During the past five years, he focused on the back office support system for the medical group.\n\n“Though other people may not know it, the Philippines is at a turning point,” Maristela said. “We must stop thinking about how we can grow our current industries and begin to think about which new ones we can create. Philippine tech is the path to this future, and investors must pave the way.”\n\nAlso read: Why the time to invest in bitcoin is always now\n\nA company on the move\n\nMaristela believes SCI offers an example of a company that grows current industries and creates opportunities for new ones. The company has grown from four co-founders to more than 20 people in just over 10 months. The company also supports bitcoin traders who transact via its ecosystem and whose daily trading volume accounts includes millions of pesos.\n\nMaristela recognizes that SCI faces some risks. Like much of the tech industry, bitcoin is volatile.\n\n“If you’re going to evaluate Philippine tech-based purely on numbers, there will be many other industries that will likely yield a much higher return on investment. But if you’re talking about potential impact on the country, about changing the status quo and improving the lives of Filipinos, there is no greater opportunity,” he said.\n\nSCI can benefit the millions of Filipinos that don’t have bank accounts. It can also dramatically lower the cost of sending and receiving remittances. Bitcoin can save the Philippine economy hundreds of millions of pesos by lowering remittance costs.\n\nMaristela plans to invest in other Philippine startups this year.\n\n“At the end of the day, I look at the team. If a startup has strong co-founders and what they are working on can positively shape the Philippines, then you can bet that I will be first in line to invest in them.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Hello dear friends, and welcome back to another episode of TCBTC, TechCrunch’s kinda-weekly bitcoin podcast.\n\nThis time around the Skype booth, main host John Biggs and myself dug into the Winklevoss twins’ love of bitcoin, consumer interest in the cryptocurrency itself, and something technical that we probably got around half right.

Bitcoin looks like a solution in search of a problem, and an unconvincing solution at that. If my hazy memory of A-level economics is correct, to succeed money should have three functions: as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. With its obscure origins, limited take-up and wildly fluctuating purchasing power, bitcoin seems to fail all three tests pretty conclusively. In 1887 a new “world language” was created with high hopes of transcending national linguistic barriers. Today it is spoken only by a few true believers. Perhaps bitcoin will one day be perceived as the Esperanto of the 21st century. John C Boothman St Lawrence, Jersey, CI', 'A new device is aiming to offer comprehensive security for bitcoins, reports Romain Dillet in a TechCrunch article. Called Case, the credit card-shaped product is aiming to prevent any further data breaches against bitcoin users.\n\nThe device features a robust security apparatus employing a fingerprint sensor, a small screen, and a GSM chip. In order to authenticate a transaction, the user presses the bitcoin button, scans a QR code using Case’s camera, and performs biometric authentication via the fingerprint sensor. Each device comes with its own unique built-in key, and Case keeps a corresponding, encrypted key in its online database. There’s also a third key in an offline vault, which can be used to recover bitcoins in the event that a user loses their Case.\n\nWhile a recent MasterCard study indicated that consumer attitudes toward security in mPayments are apparently pretty lax, it seems a good bet that users of the bitcoin crypto-currency will be somewhat more concerned about safeguarding their stockpiles. Other organizations have dipped into biometrics to try to offer such security, as in the case of Robocoin’s bitcoin ATM, but no device has offered as comprehensive a solution as the one from Case.\n\nCase devices are slated to go on sale this summer at a price of $199 USD.\n\n—\n\n(Source: Mobile ID World)', 'Core Developer Gavin Andresen announced a request to increase the Bitcoin block size next year, which could mean significant changes to the Bitcoin code.\n\nThis measure would require a hardfork to the entire network. A hardfork involves a change to the Bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks or transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade.\n\nAndresen has been a strong supporter for a hardfork concerning scalability. At the last two Bitcoin conferences he attended, he titled his talks, ""We\'re gonna need a bigger chain.""\n\nOn his blog, Andresen previously addressed the scalability issue and his personal roadmap. A few days ago, redditors noticed this announcement, or rough idea, Andresen shared with the world. On GitHub, Andresen had stated:\n\n""Hard fork: allow 20MB blocks after 1 March 2016 Allows any block with a timestamp on or after 1 March 2016 00:00:00 UTC to be up to 20,000,000 bytes big (serialized). “I believe this is the simplest possible set of changes that will work.""\n\nRedditors and Core Developers Disagree\n\nImmediately after the GitHub post, the Reddit community went into an uproar over the announcement, while some readers were positive about the news. Another core developer, Gregory Maxwell, wrote a reply to the Reddit post:\n\n""Reddit, I think you\'re jumping the gun based on watching a personal repository. I think this is just some testing code — he hasn\'t discussed this particular change with the other core developers; I for one would vigorously oppose it."" “For one, it\'s actually /broken/ because it doesn\'t change the protocol message size (makes for a nice example of how misleading unit tests often are; in this case they\'re vacuous as they don\'t catch that blocks over about 2MB wouldn\'t actually work). It\'s also not consistent with the last discussions we had with Gavin over his large block advocacy, where he\'d agreed that his 20mb numbers were based on a calculation error.”\n\nDeveloper Peter Todd agreed with Maxwell via Twitter.\n\nGregory Maxwell talking some sense about reddit\'s premature response to @gavinandresen\'s 20MB blocksize code: https://t.co/cRc4gRVWgv — Peter Todd (@petertoddbtc) May 4, 2015\n\nRecently, CoinTelegraph spoke with Todd about Andresen\'s advocacy to increase the block size. He said he was not in favor of it and called Andresen’s move ""premature."" Todd told CT that others agreed with his stance. He said that with a 20MB increased, centralized systems will grow larger, saying it goes against the very nature of decentralization.\n\n""If transaction demand goes up about a hundred times — which can easily happen — then we can’t just do another block increase,” he said, continuing:\n\n“Six megabytes is the best you can do; 20 megabytes is already stretching it based on [an] optimistic set of assumptions. You are not to going to get 100-megabyte blocks, gigabyte blocks; not in a system that’s decentralized.""\n\nThere are many arguments against Andresen’s proposal. He seems to want to address them all one by one. It\'s public knowledge that some disagree with Andresen’s ideas on scalability.\n\nFollowing the comment made by Maxwell\'s disagreement with redditors, Andresen responded:\n\n""Actually, it does change the protocol size. But yes, it is intended as \'it is time to discuss this now.\' I will be writing a series of blog posts in the coming week or two responding to objections I\'ve heard.""\n\nObjections have been discussed everyday since the block size announcement. Maxwell stressed on Reddit that most of the core developers are not committed to the proposal posted by Andresen.\n\nLightning, Chains and Factoids\n\nOther ideas, such as lightning networks, sidechains, and even Factom have been mentioned as alternatives to Andresen’s idea. Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn discussed the alternatives in a recent editorial following Andresen’s proposal. He specifically highlighted lighting networks as a method of using payment channels as arbitration to transmit payments.\n\nAndresen spoke about all of these counter-arguments openly in his blog. In his recent keynote address in both Boston and London he stated, ""Consensus is hard,"" noting that his theory may not solve the problem.\n\n“The next scaling problem that needs to be tackled is the hardcoded 1-megabyte block size limit that means the network can support only approximately 7-transactions-per-second,” he stated. Shortly after that, Andresen released a blog post titled, ""Block Size and Miner Fees ... Again,"" about the disagreements shared over his proposal.\n\nHe described his views about the argument for a 1MB block limit. ""The network will be more secure with one megabyte blocks, because there will be more competition among transactions, and, therefore, higher transaction fees for miners,"" he stated, adding that he\'s countered this argument before:\n\n""I’ve written before about the economics of the block size (and even went to the trouble of having \'Real Economists\' review it), but I’ll come at that argument from a different angle.""\n\nHe argued that a limited block size of even 1MB only handles 30% of transactions per day. He said that over time, the blockchain will increase in size, and pruning the network is seemingly becoming necessary.\n\nA Fork in the Road\n\nAndresen wrote a blog post addressing Todd and others’ focus on ""centralization theory."" Andresen has written a series of blog posts concerning this subject since the Github statement.\n\nHe addressed the centralization of nodes using API services like those that heavyweights Coinbase and Bitpay offer. Andresen also addressed the cost increase to network transactions. He said he agrees that increased costs will likely happen:\n\n“I agree with Jameson Lopp’s conclusion on the cause of the decline in full nodes — that it is a direct result of the rise of web based wallets and SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallet clients, which are easier to use than heavyweight wallets that must maintain a local copy of the blockchain. “Give the typical user three experiences — a SPV wallet, a full node processing one-megabyte blocks, and a full node processing 20-megabyte blocks, and they will choose SPV every time.”\n\nAndresen believes these two issues have a possibility of increasing, but not by very much. Over time, the network will level itself out, he said.\n\nBitcoin expert Andreas M. Antonopoulos has joined the block size debate as well, encouraging others to follow along:\n\nAn very important debateon block size limits is happening in bitcoin. Read the core dev thread containing 100+ posts: t.co/APB2f9f9ow — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) May 7, 2015\n\nHe said, “If you ever wondered how the bitcoin core development team debates key issues that affect ‘consensus’ code, this is your chance.” Now is the time to see ""almost every core dev ... posting detailed, nuanced and well-considered arguments for and against increasing the block size limit.""\n\nBitcoin has experienced a hardfork in the past and people disagreed then. Many remember the hardfork of March 11, 2013 where miners rejected the new implementations. The fork caused the network to roll back to an earlier version of the Bitcoin protocol. The code is open-source and secured by the network itself, and either the consensus updates or the fork is ultimately rejected. With consensus necessary, big changes to the code happen rarely.', 'Asian Bitcoin company BitSpark announced the temporary closure of its bitcoin exchange earlier this month so the company could focus on its pioneering bitcoin remittance service. The company also recently expanded into mainland China through a partnership with Chinese Bitcoin company Melotic.\n\nMelotic recently shut down its own crypto-currency exchange, citing a lack of demand for the service. A company blog post read, “Simply put, we did not experience enough growth in this product to justify the ongoing costs of development, maintenance, and support.” According to BitSpark CEO George Harrap, his company closed their exchange for similar reasons.\n\n“Recently our remittance business has [been] taking off with rising support for our key remittance corridors of the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, Hong Kong and China. Given this, we have decided to temporarily retire the exchange and shift focus on building our remittance service as it is the best direction for Bitspark at this stage,” read a BitSpark press release.\n\nThe First End to End Cash Bitcoin Remittance Service\n\nSpeaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Harrap said the company might reopen its bitcoin exchange in the future, but for time being it will focus on what it does best: remittances. BitSpark was the first company to offer a “bitcoin in the background” remittance product, meaning senders and receivers didn’t have to fret with the hard-to-understand digital currency, but still got the benefits.\n\nThat “cash-in, cash-out” philosophy has since taken off, with many Bitcoin companies hoping to increase bitcoin adoption and remove the complexities of bitcoin. BitSpark will publicly announce a new remittance product at the Innotribe 2015 Asian Semi-Final showcase, a fintech startup competition run by the SWIFT payment network.\n\nHarrap was short on details about the new product, but he did say this when asked about what was still missing from the company’s remittance offering:\n\n“Onramps and offramps are still very difficult for Bitcoin. If you are in a less developed or small country, it may be very difficult buy or sell bitcoin, making remittance impossible. With a ‘bitcoin in the background’ product users don’t have to worry about that, but, nonetheless, liquidity is an issue and something we’re looking to solve.”\n\nThe CEO also shared that though the company set out to help individual senders of remittances, the majority of the company’s customers are businesses sending money to other businesses aboard. Though not its originally targeted customers, the new B2B customers were welcomed, and the company now will focus its efforts on better serving that new demographic. Harrrap added that the extra liquidity brought by the larger customers could help all customers, small and large.\n\nMelotic Partnership\n\nLike BitSpark, Melotic is not calling its quits when it comes to Bitcoin. Though the company has closed its exchange for good, it will be launching a new product, supposedly months in development, soon. Harrap was also unwilling give any details about the nature of his company’s partnership with Melotic, but did said the two companies will be working together extensively in the future.\n\n“We are going to be working together to bring several new and innovative Bitcoin products and services to mainland China,” he said. “The country accounts for the majority of bitcoin trading volume but is still a very untapped market when it comes to bitcoin.”', ""Digital currencies and blockchain technologies cut across numerous sectors, with the potential to impact everyone from the suits on Wall Street to the world's unbanked.\n\nWe want to drive the conversation forward by connecting the doers and thinkers in those sectors – global development and aid, civic technology, government and policy-making, financial services and more – with the technologists, entrepreneurs and investors at the heart of the digital currency world.\n\nTo do that, we're launching our first conference: Consensus 2015 at the TimesCenter in New York City on 10th September.\n\nAt Consensus 2015, we'll discuss the role of a decentralised public ledger in global aid and disaster relief scenarios with the individuals and organisations who are spearheading that debate.

05/09/2015,"['Mycelium has announced the launch of a new merchant processor, Mycelium Gear. Merchants can now receive payments directly into a Mycelium or Electrum wallet free of charge by installing a payment widget on their website or by integrating its open-source API into their backend.\n\nIn Friday’s announcement on r/Bitcoin, Mycelium Community Manager Dmitry Murashchik states, “Mycelium Gear is a merchant processor which demonstrates something that has never been possible before Bitcoin: the ability for merchants to use a full featured merchant processor to receive payments online, and have the money go straight into their own wallets, even if that wallet is running on their own phone in their pocket.”\n\nAccording to Murashchik, Gear “generates invoices with unique addresses for every customer, automatically calculates the exchange rate, and sends a payment confirmation to the site’s shopping cart software. Basically, instead of coding a basic thing from scratch on your own, you can use advanced shopping cart software that tracks customers, invoices, addresses, revenues, etc., and add this little plugin to it to allow it to process bitcoin transactions too.”\n\nGear is built on top of the open-source Straight Server payment processor, originally developed by Roman Snitko in 2014. “It turned out [Mycelium] wanted to build the exact same thing and were looking for people capable of doing that,” said Snitko in an email to Bitcoin Magazine. “They liked that the project was open source and already the most important parts were functioning. So we decided to join our forces on this one.”\n\nStraight Server uses the BIP32 protocol to generate a new bitcoin payment address for each customer order. As a result, merchants are able to receive payments directly from customers without Mycelium ever touching the funds. Once the payment is sent, Gear is able to track it through the Bitcoin blockchain. This capability is the pivotal feature of Gear: it is a tool that watches the blockchain and detects new transactions at the addresses associated with its clients.\n\nFrom there, Gear offers the same features as most other payment processors: webhooks that notify your website of the transaction, automatic currency conversion, and notification of over- and underpayments. A notable exception to this common ground is that Gear bypasses traditional payout structures associated with other payment processors. Funds are transferred instantly and directly into merchant wallets.\n\nIn the comments following the original Reddit post, Murashchik points out that it is also possible to integrate Mycelium Gear with a Trezor hardware wallet, with Ledger support “coming soon.” It is also useful for sites that accept donations in bitcoin.\n\nAt the moment, prices can be set in USD and EUR. Bitcoin prices are automatically adjusted based on the price of bitcoin at the time of purchase. Gear has plans to introduce fast EUR withdrawals in the EU in the near future.\n\n“What’s important to emphasize is that there are two things to supporting currencies: setting prices and conversion of received funds,” Snitko explains. “The first one is easier and we plan to introduce many different currencies in a relatively short period of time. The second one is more complicated due to all the regulatory problems and also the fact that by design Mycelium Gear doesn’t touch the merchants money and thus has no ability to convert them at this point.”\n\nMycelium Gear adds to its trustless, hands-off approach to payment processing by eliminating personal information gathering, approvals, and KYC/AML requirements. According to the company website, “Because Gear doesn’t hold or even touch the money, we don’t need to know any intrusive information about the merchants.”\n\n“Mycelium’s hope is that Gear will encourage even more merchants to adopt bitcoin and completely change the way merchant transactions are done,” Murashchik adds, “thus continuing our goal of decentralizing everything, improving privacy, and eliminating unnecessary third parties in the Bitcoin economy.”', 'Kinetics Inc’s founder Morgan Rockwell has a dream. That dream is to compete with the likes of Google, Apple, GE, Visa & Chase. How does he plan on doing this? By bringing Tesla into the Bitcoin movement.\n\nFor a long time, Rockwell has worked towards this goal.\n\n“I’ve focused on Tesla Motors heavily in regards to Bitcoin from gaining partners at the Motor company, putting our headquarters down the Highway 20 from the first giga-factory and up the 101 from the Fremont auto factory,” Rockwell told Cryptocoins News. Buying one of the first gas stations in California to convert it into into a supercharger station, powered by Solar City and Tesla Energy also helped.”\n\nOne goal for Rockwell is to bring more foot traffic to an incipient, so-called “Block Chain Valley.” Rockwell currently lives in Upper Lake, California, which he plans to turn into the world’s first Bitcoin Town. Tesla is key to his plan.\n\n“[The supercharger station] will bring our headquarters more customers, foot and auto traffic to the town we are currently buying up, and it will bring the people inside Tesla who I’ve educated about Bitcoin into our business in both relationships and partnerships,” Rockwell says. “A self-driving Tesla vehicle that responds to Bitcoin payment is one of the larger goals for putting block chain technology inside of a tesla.”\n\nRockwell has been busy with Kinetics Inc. The company already features many products, such as BitSwitch; BitNODE; BitServer; BitVender’ BitSD15; BitCongress; Axiomity, and BRICKxy. There are also numerous subsidiaries under the Kinetics umbrella, like Build-A-BOT Inc.; General Blockchain Inc; US Cryptobank Inc, and US Thumbprint Inc.\n\nThe bulk of the work at Kinetics Inc. takes place in the Northern California gas station the company purchased.\n\n“It is a mad scientist lab inside a 100-year old gas station,” Rockwell explains. “I’ve built 3 office spaces in the back metal garage building and am building the front lobby into a Robot shop for now with the ATM, and a farmers market in back.”\n\nRockwell hopes to procure investment from major companies. He is constantly in touch with some of the biggest names in tech.\n\n“[I want to] inject the Bitcoin ecosystem with the Intel brand and help build trust in the block chain in regards to scalability and viability,” Rockwell explains.\n\nFor now, Rockwell will continue developing a wide-range of products in Kinetics Inc.’s gas station in Upper Lake, at the heart of tomorrow’s “Block Chain Valley.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Featuring 25 startups, 22 of which are focused on bitcoin or its open ledger, the blockchain, Boost VC\'s Tribe 5 Demo Day showcased a flurry of early-stage companies, all bidding for coveted investor interest.\n\nAs stated by event emcee and Boost VC CEO Adam Draper, this particular demo day promised more bitcoin startups on one stage ""than there have ever been in history"", meaning the task of standing out, and making progress on funding goals, was no small feat for those involved.\n\nPacked into three-minute bursts, many pitches sought to illustrate user growth and the utility of the given product in larger, more well-known markets. Often the emphasis was on how such products might be beneficial for consumers beyond those in the bitcoin community on the basis that the technology could help lower costs or improve existing services.\n\nSpecific mentions of bitcoin were often secondary to the startups, a change from past events where infrastructure companies were more numerous.\n\nFor example, among the most frequent subjects of attack was the remittance industry, with six startups targeting this market – BitQuick, Bitrefill, BlinkTrade, BTCPoint, Celery and Zapgo.\n\nCompanies like CleverCoin, Coinage and CoinJar, by contrast, were among the few seeking to strengthen the foundations of the ecosystem through traditional financial industry models.\n\nWhile the end result may suggest that more than 20 bitcoin startups might have been too many given the current state of the industry, Draper nonetheless was forceful in his opinion that this class would have a lasting impact.\n\n""These are the future bitcoin companies,"" he said. ""These companies are going to be changing the word.""\n\nWhile only time will tell for certain, here are five startups that made us believe they\'re on their way toward this lofty goal.\n\nBitQuick\n\nYou can image the surprise, calling to inquire about a new Middle Eastern bitcoin trading platform only to reach an Ohio State University undergrad in his dorm room. Such was my introduction to BitQuick in August 2014.\n\nMore remarkable than this turn of events, however, has been the company\'s refocusing before and during its time at Boost.\n\nAs a US-focused bitcoin buying and selling platform, BitQuick is now aiming to make inroads in the cash-for-bitcoin market long dominated by a single competitor, the Finland-based LocalBitcoins. By offering a peer-to-peer marketplace that allows buyers to deposit cash at local bank branches, exchanging the funds for bitcoin with sellers online, BitQuick aims to be a safer, and as its name suggests, faster, alternative.\n\nThis transformation from awkward beginnings to new potential was on full display during CEO Jad Mubaslat\'s confident opening pitch.\n\nOne of the surest presentations of the night, Mubaslat\'s was tightly focused on disarming open questions about the company\'s business model, moving seamlessly from presenting a clear concept to showcasing a growing user base, rising US dollar volumes and a focused approach to scaling the operation.\n\nMubaslat moved on to frame the service as an enabler of remittances, one that could connect with other outlets in various international markets, concluding:\n\n""We\'re the fastest service to buy and sell bitcoin for cash. Our true potential lies in our international strategy.""\n\nReveal\n\n""Coin-first is the new mobile-first.""\n\nSuch was the opening salvo of Reveal CEO Matt Ivester\'s enthusiastic introduction to Reveal, a social networking company billed as the first to use its own integrated cryptocurrency, revealcoin, which is an asset on the Stellar network.\n\nThe founder of college gossip website JuicyCampus, Ivester had reason to be confident at the event, having already closed the majority of its seed funding from investors including Resolute Ventures and Bitcoin Opportunity Corp.\n\nWhile light on technical details, the pitch seems telling of the company\'s strategy to come. Reveal has so far sought to target everyday teenagers outside the bitcoin community while courting unidentified ""social media celebrities"" to the service.\n\n""We believe that users should share in the value they help create,"" Ivester said. ""We can do things that no other social network can. We can create true community ownership, we can directly incentivize viral growth.""\n\nDesigned for quick sharing, Reveal allows users to design two-layer messages, the first of which can be peeled away to reveal a picture or drawing. Reveal aims to monetize through a similar strategy as the messaging service GetGems, mandating advertisers on the network pay with revealcoin.\n\nUsers can in turn earn revealcoin for promoting the network, interacting with ads or by reading priority messages from other users.\n\n""We can solve spam, access and messaging,"" Ivester said. ""Eventually we can be the way millions of teens are introduced to cryptocurrency.""\n\nReveal is currently operating in beta with an eye to launch this fall.\n\nLoanbase\n\nHaving previously raised €200,000 in seed funding as BitLendingClub, newly-minted Loanbase entered Boost as one of the more established companies in the bitcoin lending market.\n\nThis solid market presence enabled CEO Kiril Gantchev to ground the presentation by boasting that the company had already cornered ""40% of the bitcoin market"" in its vertical, having completed 5,000 loans worth $4m since it was started in January 2014 by its own estimates.\n\n""The one true testament to our success is the number of returning lenders, it has been increasing 20% month over month since we started,"" Gantchev continued.\n\nGantchev was also able to showcase how Loanbase had successfully overcome larger challenges, such as the lack of credit scoring in many countries around the world, by creating its own version of the financial product for its users.\n\nUsing bitcoin as a payment rails for loan delivery, Gantchev framed Loanbase\'s next challenge as one that would find it seeking to deliver its products to the global unbanked.\n\n""Loanbase is a global lending market,"" he concluded.\n\nLawnmower\n\nSure, CEO Pieter Gorsira looked like he would have been more at home at a Danzig show than in the formal atmosphere of a polo club. But, standing out has its advantages.\n\nGorsira\'s casual attire aside, Lawnmower remains as compelling a product as ever, allowing users to convert ""spare change"" into bitcoin when making everyday banking purchases. The roundabout description, however, hides the app\'s value – it effectively allows users to purchase small amounts of bitcoin without doing anything at all.\n\nRight now, of course, the app\'s utility is rather limited as the investment app allows users access to only one asset.\n\nHowever, Gorsira sidestepped this issue by effectively framing Lawnmower within a small ecosystem of micro-investing products. ""The things in purple are boring and they don\'t know who you are,"" Gorsira said, comparing the app with a graph to competitors like Robinhood and Acorns.\n\nGorsira charted a course for Lawnmower beyond its current 400-person user base, suggesting that it still plans to harness its access to bitcoin users\' bank and credit card spending accounts to deliver targeted products to customers.\n\nWhat was new in his latest talk was the vision to make micro-investing more of a social experience, one that would encourage users to invest in their favorite brands.\n\n""Let\'s say you shop at Chipotle a lot, that means you believe in their burrito,"" Gorsira continued. ""The overall goal is that no two lawnmower users will have the same portfolio.""\n\nBTCPoint\n\nSometimes an idea can transcend a lackluster pitch, and it\'s arguable this was the case with bitcoin ATM solutions provider BTCPoint, one of the most cited in conversations after the pitches had ended.\n\nThe standout among the assembled remittance companies, BTCPoint COO Alex Lopera Devesa laid out how the startup pivoted away from an ATM manufacturing business model to one focused on leveraging the already extensive global ATM network.\n\n""Today we\'re working with more than 10 banks using their ATM infrastructure. Thirty percent of our volume is remittances. These are individuals sending money across borders,"" Devesa emphasized.\n\nThis successful scaling from seven physical ATMs to implementing its technology in 17,000 traditional ATMs in Spain and Poland was one of the most resonant examples of growth from the assembled startups.\n\nGoing forward, BTCPoint set its sights higher in its concluding remarks, framing itself as a competitor to Western Union. But while other companies may have also issued similar declarations, BTCPoint was able to make the ambitious goal feel more within reach.\n\nHonorable mentions: BlinkTrade, CoinJar and Fold\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk; Courtesy of Boost VC.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The company is still in its early stages, but founders say they’re already in talks with financial institutions to start implementing ShoCard as verification for online purchases.\n\nAlso Read: Blockchain Apparatus Launches a New Trusted Will System\n\nShoCard was presented this week at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York, where co-founders Armin Ebrahimi and Jeff Weitzman explained the concept to an audience of technologists and potential investors.\n\nThey touted the ShoCard application as a solution to the cumbersome identity verification often used by banks, credit card processors, and other entities that process sensitive information through the internet.\n\nDespite these lengthy and expensive efforts, the insecure nature of credit cards and bank accounts led to identity theft that was responsible for over $27 billion in losses during 2012 alone.\n\n“Identity has always been a problem on the internet,” Weitzman said. “Creating a relationship between a real person and their online activities is an enormous and costly challenge.”\n\nIndeed, many websites that manage sensitive information require users to verify their identity through complex and sometimes confusing methods. Multiple choice questions like “Which street have you lived on before?” and “Which phone number is associated with you?” are commonplace during these security checks.\n\nShoCard could streamline that process by taking personal questions out of the equation, and by using a cheaper infrastructure based on the bitcoin blockchain. The result would be a major cutback in the $27 billion of losses caused by identity theft each year, and reduced headaches for businesses and customers alike.\n\nShoCard’s core innovation is the way it handles the storage of identity credentials. Rather than the company acting as a trusted third party, ShoCard depends on decentralized blockchain technology to store the information in a trustless manner. A user’s sensitive information is distributed across nodes in the bitcoin network instead of sitting on a server.\n\nAlthough the bitcoin blockchain is inherently public and transparent, the information stored within it — like ShoCard identities — are kept private by enterprise-grade encryption. Users keep their private keys safe on their own smartphones or computers, and they have a public key that can be used by services to verify their ID using ShoCard.\n\nShoCard Shifts Narrative: Bitcoin vs. Blockchain\n\nThe company founders were careful to stress that ShoCard is an application built on top of the blockchain, and not on top of cryptocurrency itself. The distinction is important for many in the finance industry who are wary of bitcoin’s volatility and regulatory issues. Matt Turck, managing director of venture capital firm FirstMark Capital, asked the ShoCard founders if the blockchain infrastructure was “mature enough” to build a security system on.\n\n“Absolutely,” Ebrahimi replied definitively. He went on to clarify a distinction between bitcoin, the currency, and its underlying technology:\n\n“I think a lot of times people mistake the applications that sit on top of [the] blockchain with the infrastructure of blockchain. The blockchain itself is an incredible infrastructure. There are questions about bitcoin’s viability, its growth — but that’s an application on top of it. The blockchain itself — the distributed database that ultimately exists, the encryption, all of the security embedded within that — has actually been quite mature, very well developed. And that’s what we’re really using — not the applications on top of it.”\n\nThis perspective ignores the fact that bitcoin, the currency, is essential for the blockchain to work as intended. The only reason miners secure the global transaction ledger in the first place is because they are rewarded with bitcoin currency as income. This provides a financial incentive to maintain the network and results in the decentralized blockchain that entrepreneurs have become so fond of.\n\nBut don’t tell that to Wall Street. In order for institutional firms to warm up to cryptocurrency — at least according to businessmen like Ebrahimi and Weitzman — the narrative must shift away from bitcoin as a form of money, and toward the blockchain as an innovative platform for applications.\n\n“We don’t use bitcoin. We use the blockchain,” Ebrahimi went on. “Bitcoin is one instance of the blockchain, but we’re really focused on the technology.”\n\nIt’s true that ShoCard doesn’t deal with the bitcoin currency at all. The app doesn’t cost any bitcoin to use, nor does it transact in the cryptocurrency behind the scenes. The cryptographic blockchain is simply used as a secure database for stashing sensitive identity credentials. For ShoCard, that may be all that’s necessary to create a competitive product.\n\n“Our application literally uses [the blockchain] so that we can keep all the [personally identifiable information] on the phone, on the mobile device that belongs to the user,” Ebrahimi explained, “and ultimately take ourselves out of being a trusted party that has to keep anything.”\n\nCan the blockchain act as a secure method of storing personal identity information? Let us know what you think in the comments below!\n\nPhoto Sources: ShoCard', 'Summary: The e-conflicts have begun with the development of e-currencies, e-markets, and even e-wars. History tells us that people often don’t see the major trends of their time, either lacking perspective or distracted by more cool but less important phenomena. So it is today, as bitcoin gets the most attention while dark e-markets change the world. But governments and corporations see their challengers, and marshal their power to push back.\n\nContents\n\nDreams of freedom Bitcoin, the first e-currency Dark markets The corporate wars For More Information\n\n(1) Dreams or freedom\n\nFantasies of radical personal autonomy, an independence from governments, have been common in western civilization since Daedalus’ dreams of flight. Modern tech has given them new life, with dreams of independent suburbs in the sky — the L5 orbital habitat — and of seasteading — floating nations of makers and their servants, free of the takers.\n\nPrivate currencies are another expression for this search for autonomy. Currencies provide a storehouse of value and medium of exchange. Gold served as a currency for millennia, providing a relatively good store of value but too cumbersome for a medium of exchange in the modern era, so people seek to create privately issued currencies.\n\nIn American history we had government-regulated privately issued currencies from the State-chartered banks which issued dollars during the 1837-1862 free banking era (more info here) and the Federally chartered banks that issued dollars after the National Banking Acts of 1863-66. These had many problems, most notably a tendency to fail from bad luck, mismanagement or theft (by insiders or outsiders) — making their currency worthless. The need for more a stable currency led to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that created our current currency.\n\nNow we have a new era as tech makes possible private e-currencies, in theory perhaps beyond control of governments.\n\nThere are many types of non-State currencies, aka alternative currencies. Digital currencies are currencies based on the Internet. A virtual currency is an alternative digital currency. A cryptocurrency is a digital currency using cryptography to secure the transactions and create new units.\n\nBitcoin was the first major crypto-based virtual currency. Satoshi Nakamoto published his design in 2008, and released its open-source software in 2009. It got great attention but little commercial traction for two reasons: a weakness of implementation and a conceptual flaw.\n\n(2) Bitcoin, the first e-currency\n\nAlthough Bitcoin works as a medium of exchange, its wild fluctuations in value make it a poor storehouse of value. But its implementation had a greater weakness. There are two common means of creating new currencies. First, by gaining acceptance of users by voluntary agreement (e.g., shell money) or coercive means (“legal tender for all debts public and private”). Second, by allowing easy conversion into a widely accepted currency or store of value (e.g., dollars or gold) — the solution most e-currencies use.\n\nAlthough the system is peer-to-peer, allowing users to transact directly without an intermediary, in practice most users relied on exchanges to hold bitcoin and convert them to dollars. These are a bitcoin network’s most vulnerable points, exposed to failure and government action.\n\nSuch private exchanges are a commonplace in history. In the late 19th century, rural areas had a shortage of currencies. The local general store often acted as a clearinghouse for IOUs among people and bank (extending credit for purchases in the general store). Today we have the government-regulated clearinghouses backing the US securities exchanges (e.g., DTC for stocks, OCC for options).\n\nThe unregulated bitcoin exchanges have had a spotty history (e.g., the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, “The Inside Story of Mt. Gox, Bitcoin’s $460 Million Disaster“). In response bitcoin has followed the usual path with the creation of government-regulated clearinghouses (e.g., Coinbase). If bitcoin use grows to real size then government regulations will follow, showing the fallacy of the bitcoin concept: why bother with the complexity of creating another government-regulated payments system? Why not just use PayPal, or some similar method to bypass the massive fees harvested by the credit card oligopoly?\n\nSuccess in e-currencies comes from losing the dream of freedom from government. That failure results from a fundamental failure: few people want a currency free from government regulation. Techies listen to libertarians and other on the right-wing fringe and so focus their energy on a sideshow. Meanwhile the main event builds in the shadows, providing services in great demand.\n\n(3) Dark markets\n\nDark markets have always existed. The internet makes them vastly more powerful. They provide better ways to buy and sell forbidden services (e.g., sex, assassination), to buy porn, to trade free of taxes (e.g., tariffs, income and sales taxes), to buy and sell forbidden goods (e.g., drugs, pirated entertainment), to meet in the shadows (e.g., Ashley Madison for adultery), to talk unheard (e.g., hackers and al Qeada), or to exchange information (e.g., Wikileaks).\n\nBuilding the dark web will create fortunes. It’s a gold rush still in the early stages.\n\nThe primary challenge is to avoid government oversight (e.g., subpoena of records by civil or criminal agencies) and government regulation of their operations. The secondary challenges are to conduct normal business operations: raising capital, marketing, personnel (recruit, train, motivate, pay, and retain employees), finance, etc — while in the shadows. In many cases that requires building relationships of trust with customers and suppliers (or becoming a trusted intermediary or agent between others) without the usual government stamps of approval.\n\nThe third and most difficult challenge is to do these things in the face of attacks by combinations of government or corporate forces. They face powerful enemies on all sides. The DEA and Disney want to shut them down. The NSA wants to monitor them. The IRS, Customs, and divorce attorneys want their records.\n\nSome of these next-gen web commerce companies operate in the legal world and some on the deep web — protected by means such as secrecy, cryptography, and hosting in cooperative nations. Collectively they are insurgents to the established order (social, political, economic). The Empire will strike back (e.g., see “Bugs in Tor network used in attacks against underground markets“).\n\n(4) The Corporate Wars\n\nJust as techies focus on building e-currency platforms instead of the vastly more lucrative dark e-commerce platforms, geopolitical experts chatter endlessly about minor conflicts among the great powers (if you believed them we’d be on WWXI by now) but ignore the serious wars in the developed nations.\n\n“Corporate wars” have been a commonplace of science fiction futures for decades, usually describing a world where corporations that outgrow nations and fight with each other. In the real world corporations operate in conjunction with nations, both subsidiaries of the world’s rich.\n\nIn the real world we have the wars of the establishment vs. e-insurgents. The US-led alliance of governments attacking Wikileaks (focusing on Julian Assange, its leader, and its funding sources). The assault on Pirate Bay by nations and corporations. The US government’s arrest and prosecution of the Silk Road 1.0 and 2.0 (see the Ars Technica series about “The Silk Road Trial“).\n\nConflicts run both ways. E-insurgents (aka hackers) attack governments and corporations while nations and corporations attack one another. These kinds of wild conflicts are common in history, such as the Hundred Years War. It’s too early to say how this will evolve. We live in interesting times.\n\n(4) For More Information\n\nThis post results from discussions with Steve Randy Waldman (blogging at Interfluidity), who contributed many of these insights.

But customers can use bitcoin to load an app and get a 20 percent discount using the app to pay for purchases at many Starbucks stores. The app, foldapp.com, also plans to include purchases at Target and Whole Foods.\n\nThe ability to use bitcoin to make purchases through apps and gift cards at major retailers takes bitcoin one step closer to mass consumer acceptance.\n\nHow it works\n\nStarbucks customers are loading bitcoin onto foldapp. Foldapp then transfers the designated amount from the customer’s bitcoin wallet to a virtual Starbucks gift card. The customer takes their smartphone to Starbucks and presents the barcode to the barista, who scans the bar code. Fold sends refunds to the customer’s bitcoin wallet.\n\nSeveral Starbucks customers have posted comments on Reddit and elsewhere that they have been using the foldapp at Starbucks.\n\nThe foldapp website states that it is not affiliated with Starbucks Corp.\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson contacted by CCN declined to comment on foldapp other than to confirm that there is no affiliation between the two companies.\n\nMore than 2,000 Starbucks purchases\n\nMatt Luongo, CEO of foldapp, told CCN that foldapp has delivered more than 2,000 purchases, mostly in the last four months. He said the first version of the app, coinforcoffee.com, launched about a year ago. The app relaunched in September as Fold.\n\nLuongo said the foldapp can work in 10,000 locations in eight countries. “There are a few exceptions that don’t work (e.g., franchises, some airports) but the coverage is pretty strong,” he said.\n\nHe said foldapp buys Starbucks e-gift cards with another gift card service he heads, cardforcoin.com. Cardforcoin.com allows people to trade Starbucks, Target, Amazon and Walmart cards for bitcoin or dogecoin. The cardholder enters their gift card information, then cardforcoin makes them an offer for the gift card. If the cardholder accepts the offer, cardforcoin debits their gift card and sends the cardholder the agreed-upon value to their bitcoin or dogecoin wallet. The cardforcoin offers range between 40 and 90 percent of the card balance, and vary based on demand.\n\nAlso read: Apple approves bitcoin mobile wallet for App Store\n\nMore retailers to come\n\n“We’re looking forward to using the same approach to support a number of other retailers this summer,” he said.\n\nStarbucks’ website offers a payment app that customers can download from the App store, Google Play and Amazon Appstore. The Starbucks website does not mention any discount for purchases made with the app.\n\nLuongo noted in a Reddit posting that Card for Coin Inc. is working with BTCJam and BitLendingClub at Boost VC to accept more cards.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by JP Buntinx\n\nBitSeed is an interesting company to keep an eye on in the next few months, as they are determined to bring more nodes to the Bitcoin network. And that is needed, as the more nodes we have, the more secure the Bitcoin network is at any given time. Interested parties can now purchase one of BitSeed’s Bitcoin Node, and contribute to the network from the luxury of their home.\n\nAlso Read: All About The Blockchain Part 4\n\nBitSeed Bitcoin Node: A Brief History\n\nThe name BitSeed started popping up on the internet in March of this year, when the company first announced their Bitcoin Node product. A small batch of devices was made available for purchase, which sold out relatively quickly. Customers who didn’t make it to the batch cutoff number didn’t have to worry, as their orders would be labeled as pre-orders for the next batch.\n\nOnce the number of orders to sell out bach one was reached, BitSeed ordered the necessary parts to assemble these units and get them shipped to customers as soon as possible. All outstanding orders – the ones that didn’t make batch one – were shipped out a few weeks later.\n\nThere was a genuine interest from enthusiasts around the world, as people wanted to run a Bitcoin node at home. What made these products so attractive is their relatively low power consumption compared to running a computer 24/7. This is achieved by using a Raspberry Pi 2 – Model B – as “main” hardware for the Bitcoin Node, which comes with its custom software to make the entire product plug-and-play.\n\nIn order to run your BitSeed Bitcoin Node, simply plug in all the cables.,The device will automatically run the Bitcoin Core full node client. The hardware inside consists of an AllWinner A20 SoC, 1GHz ARM Cortex A7 Dual Core, combined with 1GB of RAM. To store all blockchain data, a 160GB HDD is enclosed as well.\n\nNote from the Author: The BitSeed Bitcoin Node is available in the official store, at the price of US$149. Do keep in mind this does not include shipping costs, and you may be subject to VAT if you outside of the United States.\n\nThe BitSeed Assembly Community\n\nBitSeed has planned several open source projects, and has therefore created an Assembly community. The term Assembly refers to a collaborative platform for open source projects, tracking contributions with colored coins on the Bitcoin blockchain. Revenue generated by the projects people have contributed to will be distributed among those who helped realize the end goal.\n\nThis Assembly community’s first monthly distribution is scheduled for June 1st 2015. For the time being, there is a US$one reward per unit to reward bounty winners. Not only will the Assembly community help with developing BitSeed’s open source projects, but it will also spur future development in terms of both hardware and software solutions.\n\nConsidering how BitSeed’s first project is a Bitcoin Node for home usage, their first open source project is focusing on bringing an intuitive user interface to their hardware. The main goal of this interface is to let people check on the status of their Bitcoin Node, detailing information such as wallet balance, the current block height, number of connections, et cetera.\n\nWhile the plan is to make this a browser-based user interface, BitSeed also wants to focus on making this user interface as secure as possible, without sacrificing user-friendliness. Furthermore, additional features to be integrated with future versions of this interface are more than welcome. At this point, it is up to the Assembly community to make their voice be heard.\n\nBitSeed V2 – Including Altcoin Support!?\n\nOne of the things that have to be said about the BitSeed Bitcoin Node is that the design needs some tweaking. Mock up designs of the “next version” of these Nodes have appeared online, and everything appears to be far more streamlined and compact. But these BitSeed V2 devices will not come into being on their own either.\n\nTo fund such a new undertaking, BitSeed is hosting a crowdfunding campaign on their website. Early adopters will be able to pre-order a BitSeed V2, and be the first ones in line to receive this new piece of hardware. Not only will there be a new case design, but a completely new web interface as well. Plus, you will be able to choose between a 160GB or 250GB hard drive.\n\nNote from the Author: Upgrading to a 250GB hard drive is free of charge until May 10th.\n\nBut that is not all, as BitSeed plans to include altcoin support in their V2 product line. Do keep in mind that altcoin support will be handled on a per-coin basis. Once 100 or more devices have been purchased to support a specific altcoin (in one large order), individual units for that altcoin will be added to the BitSeed store.\n\nWhat do you think about BitSeed?

Deep Web makes the connection between digital currencies like bitcoin and how they relate to our freedoms online.\n\n“The Silk Road reflects ‘where we are as a culture.'” – Alex Winter\n\nAlex Winter, who wrote, directed, and co-produced Deep Web, spoke to Bitcoinist about his new film and shared his opinions on the Silk Road case. Alex said he wanted to create the documentary because of the significance of Silk Road and because it touches on many issues we face in the digital age.\n\nOne of the most unique aspects of Deep Web is its exclusive access to the Ulbricht family. Viewers get a rare look inside Lyn Ulbricht’s quest to fight for justice for her son, Ross Ulbricht. The film also offers a different perspective on Ross Ulbricht than you may have seen in the media.\n\nSome of the other key people featured in the documentary include Andy Greenberg, the first reporter to interview “Dread Pirate Roberts,” Amir Taaki, British libertarian and programmer, and rare interviews with Silk Road vendors.\n\nFilming Deep Web\n\nAccording to Alex, filming Deep Web came with some unique challenges. Since the Silk Road trial was still unfolding, things were constantly changing. Alex said filming Deep Web presented the challenge of “not knowing what was going to happen from one day to the next.” The filming of Deep Web took place over the course of 2 years in various locations worldwide.\n\nInterviews With Silk Road Vendors\n\nI asked Alex about his contact with the Silk Road vendors featured in Deep Web. Alex said he reached out to them and some were eager to share their message. These vendors felt the site had been misunderstood and wanted to explain the altruistic motives behind the Silk Road.\n\nAs they describe in the film, the Silk Road was founded on libertarian principles as well as the desire to reduce drug violence. They believed a large source of this violence stemmed from the War on Drugs.\n\n“There needed to be a violence reduction” in buying drugs, says one dealer, referring both to gang warfare and violent raids by law enforcement.\n\nViewers may be surprised to hear what these people have to say and it many very well redefine the stereotype of what it means to be a “drug dealer.” Alex shared in a previous interview that when he met with these Silk Road vendors, they appeared to be intelligent, educated, and articulate people.\n\nD.P.R. – A Hero or Villian?\n\nDuring the interview, I felt I needed to confront the issue of the Dread Pirate Roberts. So I asked Alex if he thought D.P.R. was a hero or a villain. He remarked that he found it difficult to make this quick judgement. Believing one way or the other is difficult because of the case’s lack of evidence and clarity.\n\nThe D.P.R. is a “fictitious username,” Alex reminded us. One Silk Road vendor in the film even claimed the username D.P.R. was used by more than one person on the site — up to three different people according to his account.\n\nGovernment In the Digital Age\n\nThe Silk Road case has become notorious not just because of its “dark” nature, but how it has been handled by the government. Some may describe these actions as questionable or even outrageous.\n\nThe Silk Road case points to major corruption and unfairness in the justice system, from government agents stealing millions of dollars in bitcoin during the investigation, withholding this information in the trial, and the fact the government may have hacked into the Silk Road server. Alex shares his point of view on the Silk Road investigation:\n\n“It is one of the most shocking enigmas I’ve ever encountered. So much conflict, so many paradoxes.”\n\nDespite the obvious threat of such corruption to a fair investigation or trial, Ross Ulbricht was denied a retrial. He is awaiting sentencing on May 15, 2015.\n\nDeep Web leaves viewers with burning questions like: What does the Silk Road case mean for the future of internet privacy? How will future digital crimes be handled by the law? Does the right to a fair trial actually exist? and Is Ross Ulbricht an illicit criminal or a figure of martyrdom?\n\nDeep Web premieres May 31 @ 8pm EST on Epix\n\nDo you think the government should allow online drug markets like Silk Road to move the drug trade off the street?

It lets users make payments anonymously, instantly, and without government regulation.\n\nThe blockchain ledger is accessible to all users of bitcoin, a virtual currency created through a computer “mining” process that uses millions of calculations. Bitcoin has no ties to a central bank and is viewed as an alternative to paying for goods and services with credit cards.\n\nA Bitcoin (virtual currency) paper wallet with QR codes and coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris July 11, 2014.

We priced out the alternative of having a deposit held in trust by a lawyer, and this option saved us around $6K.” — Dave Bradley\n\nThe acquisition move is immediately important to Western Canada as a whole, since it consolidates Bitcoin ATM ownership under one ambitious provider. This furthers their goal of creating a country-wide Bitcoin ATM network, and positions it as the leader in Western Canada’s Bitcoin services by spanning the cities of Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver and Richmond\n\nIn certain ways, the deal’s future is the future of Canada’s Bitcoin ATM Network. If things go well for BitNational, it could indicate that they will go well for the entire network.\n\nCoinTelegraph took some time to talk in depth with Bradley. He shared with us his insights about his company’s beginnings, their experience educating people about Bitcoin, and small but remarkable successes like a hairdresser who cuts her expenses by 70% because of Bitcoin.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What can you tell us about the deal?\n\nDave Bradley: We're pretty excited about it. It’s a 10-year deal valued at $2.1 million. It will see BitNational take over all our brokerage operations in Calgary. The really interesting thing is that we secured the deal with a deposit done by multisignature. This kind of application will be huge in the future. We priced out the alternative of having a deposit held in trust by a lawyer, and this option saved us around $6K.\n\nCT: How did you start Bitcoin Brains?\n\nDB: We basically started off doing brokerage as hobbyists, meeting people from localbitcoins.com at coffee shops or diners. It got to a point where we were doing enough volume that way that we figured it made sense to open a store. That was early 2013. Once we had a store, we decided that it would only make sense to sell mining equipment and get our fingers into anything else relating to Bitcoin that we could. To my knowledge, we were the first full-service, brick-and-mortar Bitcoin store in the world. We officially opened in September 2013. By November 2013, we were selling out of bitcoins every day.\n\n“Gox got away with running a fractional reserve for so long because people are trained not to expect instant access to their funds by the banks.”\n\nCT: That date means you went through the Mt. Gox crash. What can you tell us about that?\n\nDB: Luckily we weren’t directly affected and neither were most of my customers. However, one person I talked to had put in 10K U.S. dollars the last day deposits were being accepted. He was hoping to buy BTC at 130. Greed got the better of him. Gox got away with running a fractional reserve for so long because people are trained not to expect instant access to their funds by the banks.\n\nCT: How many people work at Bitcoin Brains?\n\nDB: Myself and my co-founder Andre Gagnon. We employed a couple other people when we had a bigger store. We’ve also employed international freelancers. Bitcoin will help us close international wage gaps as it opens the world up. When we started this company, I hired a guy in South Africa to make my logo, and it cost about 1/20 of what it would have cost to have a local designer do it. It’s just open markets.\n\nNow everything is integrated to BitNational. They have been running ATMs and a brokerage in Edmonton. Now they are expanding to Vancouver and Calgary with the goal of a national network. We’re excited to be working with them.\n\nCT: Bitcoin Brains also sells mining equipment. Is it good business? Any accidents?\n\nDB: Yes, we sold a ton of mining equipment over the last two years, but we’re selling less and less. We always try to get people who are looking at mining as an investment to compare that choice to just buying the BTC as it’s not really a great money maker for the average home miner these days. You either need free or very cheap power, or free equipment to compete. We haven’t had any accidents personally, but some of our clients burnt out their power supplies either because of their bad quality or insufficient wattage.\n\n“For every high-profile, VC-funded startup out there, I bet there are 100 smaller companies working on just as interesting and innovative things.”\n\nCT: How do you feel about Bitcoin Brains bringing knowledge to the public?\n\nDB: Now that we've made this deal with BitNational and we won't be doing the day-to-day brokerage, education is one area we'd like to focus on a lot more. We are still thinking around some ideas. One restaurant we've spoken with wants to do a “dinner and Bitcoin” night where people can buy a ticket and come learn how Bitcoin will affect them. It’s just getting into the consciousness of lawyers, bankers and other traditional business people. A lot of people have realized that it will be an important part of their industry or world, but aren't yet sure how it will fit in. Most of the time they react uncertain.\n\nWe are focusing less and less on mining. We are still available to help anyone who needs some guidance, [whom] we are put in contact with through the BitNational network, but overall we are focusing on consultation and education, and we have a couple other projects on the go that I can't announce yet. The only thing I can really say about one of them is that we want to make it even easier to get bitcoins anywhere in Canada.\n\nCT: What about your local Bitcoin community?\n\nDB: We are pretty entrenched in the Calgary community. We know all the local enthusiasts. The community here is fairly small for a city of its size. This is an oil and gas town and people are pretty conservative sometimes. In Canada overall, it's huge — probably the biggest per-capita community of any country.\n\nSince we aren't running ATMs or doing over-the-counter brokerage anymore, we have a lot more time. One of the things we are working on is how we can help the different brokerages around the country. There are a lot of ways that we can help make things more efficient for people operating existing brokerages, and for anyone wanting to set up a new business we can pretty much give them an out-of-the-box solution.\n\n“The next wave of Bitcoin companies will be focused more on using Bitcoin as a tool to solve real-world problems than simply on pushing adoption.”\n\nCT: What do you think about Canada's Bitcoin market penetration?\n\nDB: Well, I'd say Canada is leading the world in adoption. At least at the consumer level, we have more ATMs than any other country with a fairly small population. At the merchant level, we've haven't seen a ton of brick-and-mortar adoption yet, but I don't think that's what people are really after.\n\nI suppose it's a pretty expensive infrastructure. I think the next year or two will be really important, though. Some countries may set themselves back decades if they over-regulate and stifle all the innovation that's coming from the Bitcoin world right now. For every high-profile, VC-funded startup out there, I bet there are 100 smaller companies working on just as interesting and innovative things.\n\nCT: What can you tell us about Bitcoin’s current and future impact?\n\nDB: The next wave of Bitcoin companies will be focused more on using Bitcoin as a tool to solve real-world problems than simply on pushing adoption. It’s such a useful tool. We are already seeing it. Companies like rebit.ph are making remittance possible at much cheaper rates. Individuals are also using it to solve their problems. I've got one customer who owns a hair salon and can buy supplies from china at about 70% off what he can buy them locally, and the vendor will only take BTC because the risk of chargebacks from overseas is so high for them.\n\nPeople are finding the opportunities to take the middlemen out the loop, and the next wave of companies will just empower them to do that on a greater scale with more products and services.There will still be middlemen in Bitcoin, but it's more efficient, so fewer middlemen will be needed. In cases where you are the trusted party, it works great."", 'Mysterious Bitcoin startup 21 Inc. may be coming to a toaster near you, with a report over the weekend perhaps disclosing clearly for the first time what the company with $121 million in the bank is planning to do.\n\nAccording to a report from Coinspeak, 21 Inc. is building “new technology that is expected to facilitate worldwide bitcoin adoption and promote bitcoin mining.”\n\nThat, of course, could mean anything and everything, but then the details get more interesting:\n\nUnder the company’s new business plan, 21 Inc. will insert ASIC chips for bitcoin mining into such daily devices as routers, gaming consoles, USB battery chargers, toasters, set-top boxes, and chipsets.\n\n21 Inc. is said to have partnered with Qualcomm and Intel to work on the development of what’s being described as “split chip” technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Although not made clear the terminology may suggest the embedding of Bitcoin mining hardware on to existing IoT chips.\n\nThe company is also said to be seeking partnerships CISCO, Facebook, and IBM.\n\nRadical distribution plan\n\nA salesman might say “but wait, there’s more” and there most certainly is from this report: 21 Inc. is said to be planning to attract new customers by offering devices for free.\n\nIn return for free devices, 21 Inc. will get a revenue share from the Bitcoin mining in each device: 75 percent going to 21 Inc. and the end user receiving the remaining 25 percent.\n\nThat’s right: a free toaster with a Bitcoin miner that revenue shares.\n\nWhile it is easy to joke about the toaster, it goes further as 21 Inc. wants to put the tech into everything including smart LED light bulbs and even smart doorhandles.\n\nRadical might not be the right word, but stranger ideas have worked in the past, although this is right up there with the strangest of them.\n\nAs we covered when they took their last round of $116 million back in March, the company still officially remains mysterious (there’s still nothing on their website) and we can’t verify at this time whether all these details are correct, although we will attempt to during the week.\n\nDespite the somewhat odd nature of the proposal, Investors in 21 Inc. include some of the cream of VC from Silicon Valley, so there might be something to the idea; investors include Peter Thiel, Qualcomm Ventures, Data Collective, Khosla Ventures, Yuan Capital, RRE Ventures and others.', 'Bitcoins can now be traded on the public markets. After a long wait, Grayscale Investment’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) received formal approval on March 26 and began trading in May with the ticker GBTC.\n\nOver the last few days the price of BIT surged, and at one point traded at US$133.70 per share.\n\nA share of GBTC is equivalent to approximately one tenth of a bitcoin. As of today, GBTC on major exchanges is traded at US$49 per share, which means that bitcoins in the Bitcoin Investment Trust are being sold at $490 per BTC.\n\nOn its debut, the shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust traded at around $35 per share and rose to $45 per share in a matter of days, an amount significantly higher than the value of bitcoin on other exchanges. On the first day, investors traded 765 shares (76.5 BTCs), including Joe Colangelo and Alan Silbert, founder of BitPremier.\n\nAccording to founder Barry Silbert, the Bitcoin Investment Trust held more than 100,000 BTC in April 2014.\n\nThe Details of BIT\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust was assembled by Grayscale Investments and is led by Barry Silbert for two main purposes — to make bitcoin eligible for investment by institutions, and to guarantee its investors a safe storage of BTCs.\n\nSo far, major investment firms have held back on purchasing and holding bitcoins due to the uncertainty over regulations and compliance. The Bitcoin Investment Trust allows investors to invest in bitcoin “via a security, making it eligible for investment for institutions, certain IRAs and other types of brokerage accounts.”\n\nAll too often, bitcoin holders have fallen victim to security breaches and hacking of their online wallets. These incidents could deter investment firms from taking a large position in bitcoin. And while lost BTCs in wallets and exchanges are not recoverable, the shares of Bitcoin Investment Fund guarantee an ownership of bitcoins.\n\nThe arrival of GBTC has been eagerly anticipated and could signal the start of a new era for bitcoin. BIT now gives investors a fully regulated and transparent way to invest via the public markets. Hopes are high that this will bring bitcoin to the attention of a wider audience and make it an attractive option for institutional investors to pour money into. It also marks the first clear path for funds held in retirement accounts to gain some bitcoin exposure.', 'Collapse. It seems to be a word that is becoming more and more relevant in our everyday lives. The economic collapse of Greece. The collapse of the Petrodollar. The collapse of our civil liberties and constitutional rights. And the upcoming collapse of the U.S. Dollar. There’s a lot on our plate right now, but why not lay all the cards on the table? What would happen if Bitcoin collapsed? This possibility is much closer than you think, and efforts to avert it are underway, but what if nothing was done? Let’s pretend everyone just acted like everything’s peach fuss with Bitcoin and its current block chain trajectory. All the signs were ignored, and more and more people jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Here’s a glimpse into one version of the future.\n\nA Bitcoin Collapse is Very Possible\n\nIf all signs were ignored, that the Bitcoin Core capacity was ignored, in the very initial stages of collapse, you wouldn’t notice a thing. Your normal Bitcoin transaction would collect in a “memory pool”, where transactions go before appearing in the block chain. These transactions would be alive in a node’s memory only. The first sign of trouble would be the transaction times. Once the core capacity reaches 80%, about half of the transactions would double in confirmation time to 20 minutes. As capacity approaches 100% full, the transactions would start to create a backlog, and this is where it would get tricky.\n\nThe Bitcoin core is not designed to handle a backlog of transactions. The backlog creates a memory queue until the Bitcoin node does one of three things. Option one, the node slows down dramatically under the pressure. Option two, the node crashes or collapse when it tries to find enough memory and fails to do so. Or option three, the node is killed by the operating system kernel. The owner of the core needs to manual restart it, and notice that it has collapsed in some form. This takes time. While this is going on, Bitcoin wallets, not knowing the system’s internal strife, keeps sending in new transactions at up to seven per second. Like having three people stand on top of you, with a football team heading your way. Not good.\n\nWould rebooting the node clear the memory and solve the problem? Yes and no. It creates brand new problems like double-spending. And the wallets will still keep re-doing the transactions until they get confirmations, so the problem will repeat soon enough, only now double-spending is on the menu, and the backlog will worsen. Now, the block size is at 1 MB, but this scenario did happen at the 250KB block size, two years ago. The solution was to increase the “soft block size limit” of blocks. There were a lot of angry people and wayward transactions, and this was with far fewer people in the Bitcoin network. It’s best not to replicate this after every two years of growth.\n\nAlso read: We Have a Bitcoin Soft Fork Going On – ETA of Increased Block Size “6 Months to a Year”\n\nYou could increase the fee you pay per transaction, but this also would create a wormhole in the opposite direction, exacerbating the Bitcoin collapse problem. You pay a little bit more, and the next guy pays a little bit more, and you don’t get a confirmation, so you redo your transaction at a higher price. You are just throwing spaghetti at a wall. People worldwide are generating more and more transactions to get confirmations, and nothing is getting done but a bigger and bigger backlog, destroying more and more nodes under the pressure.\n\nDo you think the mainstream media might get tipped off that Bitcoin is having rampant fee escalation, double-spending worldwide, confirmations taking hours if at all, and internal systems crashing throughout the block chain? Like Bitcoin needs more bad publicity? The Bitcoin developers look bad, the currency would look bad, people would start to lose faith in the protocol. People start to sell Bitcoin, head into “cold storage” to sell dormant BTC, and meanwhile the backlog gets worse and worse.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Network Capacity Reaching Critical State\n\nThis is what could happen if nothing is done, according to Mike Hearn, potentially turning Bitcoin into the MySpace of digital currency. And if Bitcoin goes down, it likely takes every altcoin down with it. Bitcoin businesses, trying to take it mainstream, would fold, or downsize, and move onto the next big thing. The “Network Effect”, the venture capital, and most importantly the belief in the protocol all would suffer death blows.\n\nThis upcoming, and fairly simple problem to solve is a good sign. It’s a sign that Bitcoin is continuing to grow, as expected. This is the kind of problem owners, and users should want to have. How to handle Bitcoin’s future growth. Visa does over 200 transactions per second. PayPal about 125. Bitcoin is stuck at seven, and it’s time to make a move forward. More transactions per second mean more people can use Bitcoin quickly and easily.\n\nThis Bitcoin collapse scenario can be averted with Bitcoin Core upgrades in the near future. You know what they say. An ounce of prevention beats a pound of cure. Bitcoin masterminds like Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen are on the case and I, for one, am thankful for their proactive approach to Bitcoin’s overall protection. It’s a tough job, but someone’s got to do it.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nDo you think Bitcoin can surpass PayPal and Visa in usage?

Ranging from its lack of regulatory oversight, inclusionary attempts, taxation clarification for cryptocurrency, consultations, and meetings. All leading to the current state of waiting on what will emerge in the regulatory framework for the Bitcoin sector.\n\nBack in early 2013 I started my journey into the regulatory area surrounding bitcoin businesses and especially cryptocurrency exchanges within the UK. I spent a few months talking back and forth between the various agencies involved. Most of my time and effort over the proceeding months involved the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customers (HMRC) and Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT).\n\nThough the discourse was more extensive than just emails, the email conversation can be read here, https://ibwt.co.uk/files/HMRC.pdf (this is a pdf file). Neglected in the email conversation is the various discussions had by phone.\n\nIt should be noted that IBWT (In Bitcoin We Trust), was formerly known as FYB-UK. The business name changed after forming a new team in the late summer of 2013.\n\nThroughout my research into this matter, I discovered that Digital Currency (or Cryptocurrency) exchanges could not currently be regulated under UK law as there was no provision to cover the relevant businesses.\n\nWith reference to your enquiries I need to discuss this with our Policy team, I hope to have an answer sometime next week.\n\nAfter a certain amount of discussions and presentation of information during these months. On topic was how current regulations and law apply to businesses in this space (though I was focused on exchanges) the central policy team of HMT took the matter under their wing.\n\nIt was finally decided at the time that there was no requirement (nor was it possible) for digital currency exchanges to register with HMRC as an MSB (Money Services Business).\n\nCoindesk was the first to report this news back in early July, 2013. This article was the first ‘public’ statement that exchanges were exempt from regulation at the time. Unfortunately, even though requested, HMT were not able to give a timeframe at the time as to when they would make a public announcement regarding this matter.\n\nWith reference to your further enquiry unfortunately I cannot give you a timescale of when HM Treasury will make a public announcement regarding the Bitcoin market.\n\nI was quoted as saying to Coindesk at the time that\n\n“Regulation will definitely come into play at some time in the future, so it is in the best interest of businesses that think they are transacting as a money services business to still keep anti-money laundering and know-your-customer practices in play, so they’re prepared for when HMRC does come knocking”.\n\nHMRC State Bitcoin Tax Guidelines\n\nOver the following year, various exchanges started to emerge after IBWT (IBWT launched in September, 2013). And then occurred a series of efforts by individuals and the UKDCA to get a clearer picture than was previously stated by HMRC. The pre-existing taxation model for cryptocurrency can be seen from a Coindesk inquiry to HMRC back in June (19th), 2013.\n\nthe tax system already deals with transactions in currencies other than sterling … traders would need to convert their profits into sterling before entering them into their UK tax returns.\n\nIn early March 2014 HMRC brought out clear guidance on how taxation is applied to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For the most part, publicly reiterating what they had already been stating.\n\nYou can find the full brief from HMRC here.\n\nHowever, in all instances, VAT will be due in the normal way from suppliers of any goods or services sold in exchange for Bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrency. The value of the supply of goods or services on which VAT is due will be the sterling value of the cryptocurrency at the point the transaction takes place.\n\nThe clarification straight from ‘the horse’s mouth’ was appreciated in many corners of the bitcoin sector, from miners, businesses and individuals. And business continued as it was before, with a bit more confidence and security in this public acknowledgement.\n\nI wrote a piece for Bitcoin Magazine to describe the taxation outcomes; you can read this piece here, HMRC publicize Pro Bitcoin Stance.\n\nHowever, the issue of the banks remained.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nIsle of Man Rises, Staggers, Continues Onwards!\n\nThe Isle of Man (IoM) has been in and out of the Bitcoin spectrum over the last year. Rising in the sector as a potential haven and destination for cryptocurrency business. In early 2014, the IoM was initially seen as a potential candidate for digital currency exchanges and the place to lead innovation in the financial industry.\n\nThis was until later in the same year when the banks closed any potential innovation and creativity that the IoM could offer. UK banks put their foot down and closed access to the traditional financial sector to bitcoin related businesses.\n\nCapital Treasury Services were forced to close the accounts of any clients involved in bitcoin or cryptocurrency from its banking partners, HSBC and RBS. Making the IoM another potential avenue of growth that had fallen by the wayside.\n\nIn the most recent months, the IoM seems to have taken guidance from HMT’s actions (which we discuss below). In that, they have introduced digital currency exchanges and related businesses to already existing anti-money laundering (AML) laws from the 1st of April, 2015.\n\nDiffering from the approach that HMT is taking, in that HMT is working on designing specific criteria for related businesses so as not to overburden them. The IoM have made amendments to already existing legislation that might prove to be too burdensome to attract businesses and investment.\n\nThough interestingly the new requirements place similar burdens as what already exists for financial bodies of the same nature for exchanges, but does not provide the benefit of customer protection that it provides for similar financial bodies.\n\nAll the Burdens and None of the Benefits.\n\nPeter Greenhill, head of e-gaming in the department of economic development (IoM) had this to say to the BBC last month.\n\nWe also passed through parliament the Designated Businesses Bill, which treats digital currency exchanges the same as any other company holding value for a client in escrow [a form of safe keeping]”\n\nBe that a bank, estate agent or accountant – those come under registration with the Financial Supervision Commission.\n\nThe government is stopping short of offering customer protection on Bitcoin investments like the UK’s Financial Services Authority (FSA), which guarantees individual savings to the value of £80,000 in the event of a bank collapse.\n\nThere is to date no faster payment banks on the Isle of Man that provide services to exchanges.\n\nAnd still the issue of the banks remain.\n\nHM Treasury Opens Public Consultation\n\nIn late 2014 HMT opened a public consultation to the public through a Call for Information. Asking numerous in-depth questions they invited a response from all quarters, bitcoiners, businesses, banks, if you had an interest and were bothered enough, then they wanted to hear from you.\n\nThis went on for a month, from November to December. At the beginning of the December, HM Treasury closed its public consultation to review all the feedback it had received. A few months later in March 2015, HM Treasury released their public response after reviewing all the public feedback it had gained from its earlier open public consultation.\n\nThe summary of this response consisted of initiating talks to develop a unique regulatory framework for exchanges and cryptocurrency where it was felt relevant. Such regulations will very likely include anti-money laundering and know your customer practices though it is unlikely that they will prove as onerous as existing regulations.\n\nThis can be surmised from the UK’s ‘open arms’ approach to cryptocurrencies. Allowing businesses to operate with impunity to date, they (HM Treasury) have expressed an interest for minimalistic regulations and for the banks to better co-operate in the supposedly friendly field of competition.\n\nHM Treasury also gave £10 million to the Alan Turing Institute for the purposes of Cryptocurrency research. Five UK Universities dedicated to the education, knowledge and research into the data sciences are joined as the Alan Turing Institute.\n\nAlan Turing’s genius played a pivotal role in cracking the codes that helped us win the Second World War. It is therefore only right that our country’s top universities are chosen to lead this new institute named in his honour.\n\nThe Payments Systems Regulator – PSR\n\nThe PSR is a little talked about body, and this is understandable as it is a very new government agency. The Payments Systems Regulator, or PSR, is an independent sub-body of the FCA that has been created by The Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 (“the 2013 Act”). The PSR may have emerged from the 2013 Act, but it has only now become fully operational as of April, 2015.\n\nThe PSR was created to act as a competition focused economic regulator for payment systems in the UK.\n\nThe 2013 (Banking Reform) Act defines a “Payment system” and grants the Treasury the power to designate payment systems, enabling the Treasury to bring a designated system under the review of the PSR.\n\nHM Treasury may only designate a system to be reviewed under PSR if there are deficiencies in the design of the system, disruption in its operation and if either (but not limited to) would have serious consequences.\n\nThe 2013 Act provides that the Treasury may designate a payment system only if it is satisfied that: any deficiencies in the design of the system, or any disruption of its operation, would be likely to have serious consequences for those who use, or are likely to use, the services provided by the system.\n\nThere follows more details on the process of designating a payment system fit for review. These range from the number and value of transactions currently and potentially processes, the nature of the transactions, whether those transactions could be handled by other payment systems, the relationship between the system at issue and other payment systems.\n\nYou can read more details on this in section 2.2 here.\n\nThe PSR essentially is the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) subdivision ‘sic em’ body. The FCA is in charge of regulating a £75 trillion industry, and with recent scandals such as Libor and the Forex market, it could be argued that the body will be better served with a capable body that forces changes on mismanaged systems.\n\nUK Banks, Coinbase & Fidor\n\nBoth Coinbase and Fidor have recently been making strong public moves and claims of UK integration. Coinbase has created new trade windows that allow for GBP trading. However, they still require customers to internationally wire money to their banks outside of the UK. This, unfortunately, does not make it a ‘UK exchange’ by most people who live in the UK’s reckoning.\n\nMt. Gox allowed GBP to be traded on its exchange, but you had to wire money to Japan (or Poland if you were fully verified). You would have to pay the exchange fee to transfer your GBP into Euro, and then receive euro in your account, if you wanted GBP you would have to trade your euro into GBP on the Mt. Gox platform.\n\nThen withdrawing would convert your GBP to Euro (face a fee if converted to Euro on Mt. Gox or face the standard exchange rate fee again), and then changed it back to GBP. Also included was your international wire transfer fee, which varies from bank to bank.\n\nFidor still has yet to make an actual foothold into the Faster Payment systems network, which would give any exchange under Fidor a clear technical (arbitrage) edge over any other exchange. I knew of Fidor intentions for the UK nearly two years ago; it has been a long time coming, and I will believe it when it happens.\n\nBoth have reported moves to establish themselves fully within the UK, as their next target for expansion. One is either blocked by non-existing regulations to allow them to acquire a bank account (Coinbase). The other (Fidor) is being blocked from linking with the existing framework, even though they do not directly deal with bitcoin or other cryptocurrency; they just provide banking to cryptocurrency related businesses.\n\nIt is most likely that no one will get faster payment access until regulations force the UK big four into compliance, or one of the big four capitulate and start working with a bitcoin related business.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nThe Winds of Change?\n\nSince the arguably favorable response to the public feedback HM Treasury had released, fingers have been twiddled in anticipation of further progress along the paths that HM Treasury is taking us.\n\nA new government has been elected voted upon this May 7th, and will come into force on May the 18th, but the people behind the front of the play stay the same and motions that have already been started will continue.\n\nWill a push in the financial services for competition, growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies continue? I like to think so, and that wise heads remain behind the scenes. And I like to hope (against expectations) that a new government will help to usher in a new era of financial equality.\n\nAnd it behoves me to mention the birth of the baby Princess, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, fourth in line, born this May the 2nd. A baby princess, a new government, PSR oversight into the traditional payments sector, maybe the dawn of the true emergence of cryptocurrency in the UK if regulations emerge favorably over the next year.\n\nWe can but hope these are signs of a new beginning.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Jared Marx is an attorney at Washington, DC law firm Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis. He advises companies about bitcoin-related regulatory law and represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings.\n\nHere, he discusses what cryptocurrency businesses should consider if they find themselves face-to-face with a US government subpoena, interview or search warrant.\n\nCryptocurrency businesspeople are a hearty bunch. They deal not only with the ordinary anxieties of running a startup, but also with a lack of clarity on a whole range of fundamental legal issues. (Remember when people were still asking whether bitcoin was even legal?)\n\nOne upshot of this is that a number of companies – including many who have tried hard to comply with applicable laws – have found themselves either receiving investigative subpoenas or subject to civil or criminal enforcement action.\n\nThe recent Ripple Labs fine, along with comments from FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery, suggest that this trend is on the upswing.\n\nSince regulatory uncertainty is likely to persist for some time, here’s a primer on things to consider when the US government knocks at your door (either figuratively or literally).\n\n1. Subpoenas\n\nVirtually every US government agency has the power to demand documents from businesses that operate under its regulatory supervision. Generally speaking, the way that the government does this is by issuing a subpoena (sometimes styled as the essentially-identical \'civil investigative demand\').\n\nImportantly, while the government doesn\'t need to go to a judge (or anyone else) to issue a subpoena, an agency must go to a judge to enforce a subpoena. That means that when a party doesn’t respond to a subpoena, the agency must first convince a judge that it issued a valid subpoena before anyone will compel the target to produce documents or items.\n\nHowever, when a party ignores a subpoena, the agency likely will go to a judge, and that will almost certainly make things worse. An agency who asks a judge to enforce a subpoena because it has received no response usually gets what it wants, even if the subpoena was overly broad.\n\n“US regulatory law is stunningly broad, and the consequences of an investigation gone wrong can be crippling.”\n\nIndeed, if there’s a criminal investigation in play, the agency may change its mind and seek a search warrant rather than a subpoena, and raid the offices where it’s looking for files. That’s definitely worse.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that subpoenas aren’t self-enforcing also means that they’re negotiable.\n\nMost agencies issue cookie-cutter subpoenas, asking for broad and often burdensome productions of documents. Truth be told, those agencies would rather not try to justify an overbroad subpoena to a judge. Just as often, they only issued a broad subpoena because they weren’t sure what they wanted in the first place.\n\nThe first step that experienced companies usually take after receiving a subpoena is to have their lawyer call the agency to ask what they’re really after. Especially in the cryptocurrency space, where government actors may or may not fully understand the technology, there’s a good chance of getting the government to agree to a \'narrowing letter\', which limits what’s being asked for in the subpoena.\n\nOnly very seldom can lawyers convince the government to simply go away, but a narrowing letter often saves a lot of time and money by significantly limiting the subpoena’s reach.\n\nWhen a subpoena is truly out of line, parties can also go to court to \'quash\' (or cancel) the subpoena as improper or overly broad. But that’s a lot easier to do when the challenging party is the first one to the judge, and the agency hasn’t already been there complaining about how the target thumbed its nose at them.\n\n2. Interviews\n\nUS federal law makes it a felony to intentionally lie to government agents. It’s like being under oath any time you talk to a government agent – except that it’s actually worse: if you testify in a courtroom, a stenographer records your testimony in open court. But when you talk to an FBI agent, the only record of your conversation are the notes that the agent writes up back in their office.\n\nSo the first problem is obvious: the agent conducting the interview may hear only what they want to hear, or they may simply make honest – but ultimately harmful – mistakes in recording the interview.\n\nMoreover, federal agents are permitted to, and regularly do, lie to suspects or witnesses when conducting an investigation. So the mere act of engaging in conversation with an agent can be treacherous.\n\nEven if – and maybe especially if – a person has ""nothing to hide"", most defense lawyers will agree that the safest bet when an agent asks for an interview is to treat the agent respectfully and politely, but to decline an interview at that time.\n\nA lawyer can then follow up with the agent, and if an interview truly is in the person’s best interest, the lawyer will also arrange to be present for it.\n\n3. Search warrants\n\nFinally, in criminal matters, the government sometimes skips subpoenas and gets a search warrant from a court.\n\nUnlike a subpoena, a search warrant gives the government the power to search a party’s premises itself and remove items (including computers) listed on the warrant.\n\nAt the moment agents show up with a search warrant, the target can’t do much to stop the ensuing search. But many parties (and their lawyers) nevertheless stay for the whole search, because staying can help set the stage for what comes next. This is primarily because there are many laws about what constitutes a proper search, and sometimes a party’s eyewitness testimony describing a search can be helpful if the government does something wrong.\n\nOne risk of staying for the search is that this puts important players in the presence of government agents for a long time, which means that there’s more opportunity for agents to try to engage targets in conversation.\n\nThe challenge here is not only remaining disciplined about not engaging, but also continuing to be polite to the agents conducting the search. However, this is not an insurmountable task.\n\nAnother risk of staying for the search is that the government can ask a party who is present for permission to conduct searches beyond what’s in the search warrant. Consenting to that kind of enlargement is not required, and doing so is very seldom worth the associated risk of unintended consequences. Simply knowing this, however, reduces the risk that a party will thoughtlessly consent.\n\nWith some luck and ingenuity, most cryptocurrency businesses may hope to avoid unwanted government scrutiny. However US regulatory law (and, even more so, criminal law) is stunningly broad, and the consequences of an investigation gone wrong can be crippling.\n\nSo when luck’s not enough, smart lawyering and some preparation can make the difference between a government investigation that is a mild headache and one that is a train wreck.\n\nDisclosure: This is not legal advice, and is not intended to establish an attorney-client relationship.

As a result, you hardly ever see a manufacturer operating one of their own ATM’s these days. This opens opportunities for other companies, whom will gladly purchase one or more machines from a respected manufacturer. EBTM is a Belgian Bitcoin ATM operator, and this is their story.\n\nAlso Read: The Mt. Gox Post-Bankruptcy Claims: A Detailed Guide\n\nBuying From Manufacturers and Operating the Machine\n\nSimilar to other companies and individuals around the world, EBTM purchased a Bitcoin ATM from a reputable manufacturer. In order to earn back their initial investment — and hopefully turn a profit — this Belgian Bitcoin company charges a commission of 5% per Bitcoin transaction. That number is in line with most Bitcoin ATM’s around the world, even though some of them charge fees up to 8%.\n\nContrary to popular belief, however, operating one Bitcoin ATM does not guarantee a quick profit. Depending on the location of your machine, you may or may not receive a lot of interest from foot traffic. Belgium is keeping a low profile in terms of Bitcoin adoption and awareness, so operating just this one ATM is not enough for EBTM staff to quit their day job.\n\nThe Bitcoin ATM located at the Coffeelabs building in Antwerp is manufactured by BitAccess, an up-and-coming ATM manufacturer based in Canada. What makes these devices produced by BitAccess so interesting is that they are two-way Bitcoin ATM’s by design. This allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency.\n\nOf the 5% fee charged per transaction through the Bitcoin ATM operated by EBTM, a small cut goes back to BitAccess. Said cut covers the support behind the scenes, such as software updates, remote access to fix issues and general maintenance. All of the software and API hooks are provided by BitAccess, yet everything can be tweaked to the operator’s liking.\n\n“When we were deciding on which manufacturer to choose, two companies were on the top of our list. BitAccess – which became the company we went with – and Robocoin. The deciding factor for us was that Robocoin sell themselves as a bank account, and not a Bitcoin wallet. Furthermore, the Robocoin Bitcoin ATM only accepts USD fiat currency, even in Europe. “ – EBTM\n\nEarnings, Limits and Liquidity\n\nAs I mentioned before, the EBTM staff is not getting rich overnight from operating one Bitcoin ATM here in Belgium. According to the estimates they provided us with, a total of 7 or 8 ATM’s would be needed in order to make a profit on a regular basis. Quitting day jobs can only happen once the transaction volume picks up drastically.\n\nThe overall transaction volume has picked up since November of 2014. Statistics indicate there is an even balance between the number of buys and sales. This may be something you would not expect from a Bitcoin ATM, but it is a welcome surprise nonetheless. No exact transaction numbers have been provided at this time.\n\nWith the number of Bitcoin and fiat currency transactions going up, liquidity becomes an increasingly important factor. On the Bitcoin side, the EBTM-operated Bitcoin ATM is hooked into Bitstamp’s API, which provides enough funds for now. On the side of fiat currency, however, EBTM staff has to travel to Antwerp on a regular basis to feed Euro bills to the machine.\n\nAs is the case with nearly every Bitcoin ATM around the world, there are certain limits in place when using the machine. Verifying a user’s identity is a key factor for EBTM, even though the local government does not rule Bitcoin as money [yet]. Customers can spend up to 2,000 EUR worth of fiat currency or Bitcoin by verifying their identity. Up to 500 EUR requires you to provide a mobile phone number, and to bypass that limitation, an ID scan is required.\n\nThe Travelling EBTM Machine\n\nIt has to be said, however, that this BitAccess ATM operated by EBTM has seen its fair share of travelling so far. The machine was originally installed in Brussels during a round of beta testing, yet it was moved to Antwerp later on. Right now, the machine is hosted at Coffeelabs’ ground floor, but the ATM will be moved upstairs later this year.\n\nFinding a location for a Bitcoin ATM has proven to be a bit of a struggle for EBTM. Business owners are still wary of digital currency, and would rather not get involved in hosting a Bitcoin ATM. However, companies with an interest in new technologies — such as Coffeelabs — are more keen to get involved with Bitcoin.\n\nFuture Plans\n\nThe way things are looking right now, EBTM is looking at buying and installing a second Bitcoin ATM in Belgium. Before that can happen though, the company feels a Bitcoin price increase is needed, as that will influence both media attention and ATM usage. Once people see how the price per Bitcoin goes up again, more customers may be buying digital currency from an EBTM-operated machine.\n\nFinding investors to back financially a Bitcoin ATM-related company is difficult these days. Especially when you consider that EBTM is not building these devices themselves, but buying them from a manufacturer. Investing in a company that “only” gets a cut from the transaction fees is not as straightforward as you might think.\n\nWhat do you think about EBTM?

05/11/2015,"['The Nasdaq stock exchange is tapping Bitcoin\'s powerful new transaction technology to create a more secure, efficient system to trade stocks.\n\nMost people have heard of Bitcoin (XBT) as a system of electronic money -- one that hasn\'t really caught on yet.\n\nBut what gets less attention is blockchain, the technology that powers the Bitcoin system. It\'s a computer program that automatically processes transactions and creates a perfect, reliable digital record.\n\nHigh-tech bankers are starting to realize this could revolutionize trading. Nasdaq (NDAQ), a favorite exchange among many technology companies, is making the first move.\n\nOn Monday, the stock market announced it will start using a blockchain system to keep records for its Nasdaq Private Market, which handles trading of shares in the pre-IPO phase before a company goes public.\n\nNasdaq sees the blockchain\'s perfect recordkeeping as a major step in the right direction for more transparency. The pre-IPO market doesn\'t typically see as much trading and what does occur is often by a tight circle of employees and early investors.\n\n""Blockchain technology will provide extensive integrity, audit ability, governance and transfer of ownership capabilities,"" Nasdaq said in its public announcement.\n\nThis doesn\'t mean Nasdaq is using actual Bitcoins as currency. But Nasdaq will be interacting with the Bitcoin system to slip data into the blockchain.\n\nBy using Bitcoin\'s core technology, this is a major acknowledgment of Bitcoin\'s contribution to finance and trade. This is the first time the world has seen a trading system that doesn\'t require a trusted middleman. It sounds boring, but in the banking world, it\'s revolutionary.\n\nCNN explains: What is Bitcoin?\n\nIt seems odd to equate Bitcoin with better security. The world\'s first true big digital currency is generally known for two things. One, its popularity in online black markets. Two, the epic fall of Mt. Gox, a major Bitcoin exchange market that wiped out $400 million in people\'s savings.\n\nBut these have nothing to do with the digital currency itself. Bitcoin\'s perfect recordkeeping actually helped convict a black market kingpin. And computer security experts say Bitcoin\'s technology actually makes it more secure than any other money transfer system.\n\nNasdaq\'s experiment is a limited one. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal referred to Nasdaq\'s pre-IPO market, which launched in January 2014, as ""a fledgling marketplace."" But if it works out, expect to see it use the blockchain concept elsewhere.\n\n""Utilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,"" Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld said in a statement.\n\nJose Pagliery is the author of Bitcoin - And the Future of Money (Triumph Books, Chicago).', ""Princeton University professor of computer science and public affairs Ed Felten has joined the White House Office of Science and Technology where he will advise President Barack Obama on policy decisions related to technology and innovation.\n\nThe appointment is notable for the digital currency industry given Felten's longstanding interest in bitcoin and the digital currency's public ledger, the blockchain.\n\nIn addition to writing on the subject, Felten also attended the New York BitLicense hearings held in January 2014 where he presented a moderate view of the technology that stood in contrast to the more aggressive criticism levied by Boston University professor Mark T Williams.\n\nThough his appointment is the sum of his professional accomplishments, Felton may nonetheless play a role as the White House begins to craft policy on financial technologies such as bitcoin.\n\nFelten's appointment as deputy chief technology officer follows a stint with the US Federal Trade Commission that began in 2011.\n\nImage via Princeton"", 'by\n\nJoint post with Andrew Miller.\n\nVirtually unknown outside the Bitcoin community, a debate is raging about whether or not to increase the maximum size of Bitcoin blocks. Blocks are created in Bitcoin roughly once every ten minutes and are currently limited to a size of 1 megabyte, putting a limit on the rate at which the network can handle transactions. At first sight this might seem like a technical decision for the developers to make and indeed it’s largely being treated that way. In reality, it has far-reaching consequences for the Bitcoin ecosystem as it is the first truly contentious decision the Bitcoin community has faced. In fact, the manner in which the community reaches — or fails to reach — consensus on this issue may set a crucial precedent for Bitcoin’s long-term ability to survive, adapt, grow, and govern itself. [1]\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Bitcoin protocol is decentralized and no one controls it, then how can it be changed at all?\n\nYou may know that Bitcoin is a decentralized system and that no single company, government, or entity controls it. In that sense it’s a lot like the Internet. But unlike the Internet, which is an ad-hoc collection of networks and protocols, and thus can be gradually upgraded piecemeal, all Bitcoin nodes are basically part of one giant distributed computation which means that upgrades need to be much more tightly — dare we say centrally — coordinated. The default Bitcoin software, Bitcoin Core, is that point of coordination. The five Core developers have a huge amount of power in determining how the network operates and in making upgrades to it.\n\nThe developers don’t have all the power though — if changes made to Bitcoin Core are contentious, people running the software are free to go their own way, creating a “fork”. The distribution of power between the different entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem is fascinating and intricate, and we encourage you to take a look at Chapter 7, “Community, Politics, and Regulation” of our Bitcoin textbook-in-progress or the corresponding sections of the video lecture. The bottom line, though, is that while changing the Bitcoin protocol can and does happen, it requires consensus of a social kind. This is related to but different from the technical consensus protocol that Bitcoin miners execute.\n\nThere are numerous stakeholders in the block size debate with widely differing incentives\n\nMost of the time, protocol changes are purely technical decisions. They might be deployed to increase the network’s efficiency or prevent potential attacks, so no one has a specific reason to oppose them beyond the general risk of making changes which may introduce new bugs or cause incompatible clients to diverge. But the block size debate is different. A decision to change the current policy of a fixed 1MB block size would affect virtually every group of Bitcoin stakeholders and, moreover, it would affect them differently.\n\nAt a high level, Bitcoin will likely evolve in different directions depending on whether the block size limit remains fixed or is increased. [2] With a fixed block size, transactions will become increasingly expensive because space for transactions on the block chain will become scarce. That means the Bitcoin network may be limited, directly handling only a few types of transactions such as settlement transactions between financial intermediaries. Transactions representing everyday purchases (“buying coffee with Bitcoin”) will get pushed off the main network into “side chains” or off-chain payment channels.\n\nVarious companies have made bets on one or the other future. Some have developed alternative blockchains or payment channels that would thrive in a fixed-block-size world whereas others such as Bitcoin payment processors stand to benefit from a growing block size that accommodates everyday transactions.\n\nAnother high-level impact is on mining: larger blocks will favor bigger miners. Bigger miners can more easily absorb fixed costs of storing larger blocks and verifying more transactions. More importantly, they can invest more in the necessary network infrastructure to quickly retrieve large blocks and can “peer” with other large miners directly to avoid costly delays in hearing about new blocks. Smaller miners will face higher processing costs as well as increased propagation delays on the public Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. Ultimately, many may drop out entirely. The resulting centralization of mining may leave the system more open to a 51% attack, making security worse for everyone. Similarly, it’s been argued that the number of independent entities running “full nodes” will decrease because of the increased storage and bandwidth, again weakening the decentralization and security of the system.\n\nFinally, some of the development community’s implicit criteria are informed by the development process itself. For example, Gavin Andresen explains that proposal to increase the limit to 20MB is the “the simplest possible set of changes that will work,” and therefore the easiest to pass testing and code review. On the other hand, core developer Pieter Wuille has expressed concern that this increase is a stopgap solution, ultimately creating more “technical debt” to pay off later.\n\nResolving the block size debate — and similar contentious issues in the future — requires effective governance\n\nA popular perception in the Bitcoin community is that Bitcoin doesn’t need governance, or at least structured governance. While Bitcoin may not need traditional governments, the very consensus process by which Bitcoin operates is an example of governance. So far, that governance has operated loosely without much formal structure — and this has worked well.\n\nThe key point of this post is that Bitcoin is now at a stage where the current process is no longer adequate. The block size debate is the first time in Bitcoin’s history that a change is being contemplated that will steer the ship in one of two (or more) very different directions. Virtually every participant in the Bitcoin ecosystem is touched by it, and their incentives are not all aligned. Keeping the block size constant is not the simple “status quo” option it may appear to be. Due to continuously increasing transaction volume, Bitcoin will surely change significantly even if nothing is done. The debate is an old one within the community, but it has now started to become urgent. [3] And while this might be the first such contentious issue, it won’t be the last: a decision will need to be made on sidechains soon, attacks might be discovered that can’t be fixed to everyone’s satisfaction, and over the long run there’s always the question of whether mining will survive the repeated halving of block rewards or whether some changes are necessary.\n\nWhat do we want out of a governance process for deciding debates such as this? First, every stakeholder’s voice should be heard. Not only should it be technically possible for them to air their views, but the community should actively and systematically seek their input. Second, it should be clear how different stakeholders’ views were weighed against each other and how trade-offs were made. Third, the stakeholders and other observers should be convinced that there were no back-channels to the Core developers — who are, after all, the ones with the technical ability to push changes. Fourth, there should be a transparent transcript of all the inputs and the decision-making process, so that if the decision that was made turns out to be sub-optimal, there’s a way to revisit it using the logs and learn lessons for the future.\n\nBitcoin’s current governance model is seriously inadequate\n\nSo far, the bitcoin-developers mailing list has been the primary place for discussion of technical changes to Bitcoin, augmented by the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, GitHub’s issue tracker, IRC channels, and a “long tail” of other avenues: the Bitcointalk forum, blog posts, Twitter, Reddit, and, of course, conferences and other physical meetings. While this model worked great as long as proposed changes were purely technical, it breaks down for contentious issues. In fact, it satisfies virtually none of the criteria we laid out above.\n\nFirst of all, many stakeholders such as miners aren’t participating in the debate, either because they’re not aware of the effect of the decision on their interests or because they don’t realize they have a voice. The Core developers seem to do their best to take miners’ views into account, but often this amounts to informed guessing. None of the groups other than developers post regularly on the developer mailing list, which is entirely natural — the interface isn’t familiar to non-developers, resulting in a lot of friction, not to mention a lot of noise considering that the vast majority of discussions are about technical issues of no interest to non-developers. Miners sometimes post on the Bitcointalk forum, but for the most part they don’t voice their views publicly. As for Bitcoin companies, venture capitalists, and other relatively privileged groups, their best way to influence the decision is to communicate directly, and perhaps privately, with the developers.\n\nFurthermore, the plethora of public channels ironically serves to decrease transparency. It’s not clear which of these are noticed — and valued — by the developers. And there’s the danger that whoever shouts the loudest will drown out other more reasonable voices.\n\nAs a result, what’s happened so far is this: the block size debate has been up in the air for years (for example, see this thread from October 2013). Developers seem to have waited for technical consensus to occur naturally — as it usually does — perhaps not fully realizing the extent to which this debate is different from the purely technical ones of the past. Everyone who is speaking now has already weighed in, while a variety of others who should be heard from have still today remained silent. It’s not clear to anyone how the decision will ever be made and a bit of panic is starting to set in. [4]\n\n\n\nBitcoin urgently needs formal governance\n\nStructurelessness is a myth. [5] What we’ve been seeing is Bitcoin’s latent, informal governance structure manifest itself. While it’s been effective for most decisions, in this case it’s led to confusion and inaction. The only way out of this mess is more explicit, well thought out, structured governance.\n\nOf course, that’s going to be a tough pill to swallow, both because of the politics of many in the Bitcoin community and because of what happened with the Bitcoin Foundation. The allegations of corruption and lack of transparency the Foundation has faced are precisely the kinds of things that can go wrong with formal governance. A crucial difference, though, is that the Bitcoin Foundation focused on loosely defined goals like advocacy rather than protocol changes to Bitcoin. A governance process for Bitcoin Core — and nothing else — could be far more light-weight and transparent. Hopefully, if it worked well, it would only need to be invoked occasionally.\n\nRejecting governance altogether is not an option. To meet the challenges now facing it — to grow up — Bitcoin will have to develop effective governance. The current debate, then, is a rite of passage.\n\nThree suggestions for better governance\n\nIn keeping with the light-weight yet formal approach to governance we’ve suggested, here are three suggestions for more effective governance for Bitcoin Core. We intend these to be a starting point for discussion. Note that each of these can be adopted individually.\n\n1. Form a technical advisory board. Many open-source projects utilize an advisory board as one governance mechanism. For Bitcoin Core, the goal would be to bring the different types of stakeholders together to deliberate major or controversial decisions. For each such change, the board will produce a document that describes the inputs, the output(s), and the criteria that were used to make the decision — especially who the stakeholders are, their opinions and interests, and how their interests were weighed. By being more methodical, the advisory board’s deliberations would hopefully also be more scientific than the current process. [6]\n\nThe output of the advisory board wouldn’t be binding in any way on the Core developers, but if Bitcoin Core departs in a significant way from the advisory board’s recommendations, then it’s a sign that something is seriously wrong.\n\n2. Create a polling mechanism and a public comment process. Let’s make better use of Bitcoin’s unprecedented capability to have built-in voting and opinion polling mechanisms. The challenge of Bitcoin governance is actually a great opportunity, since Bitcoin’s technical innovations include new tools for effective governance! For example, miners can express their preferences and vote on decisions by putting data into block headers (in other words, votes are weighted by proof-of-work). This has already used by Core developers in the rare “soft-fork” upgrade procedure, but proof-of-work voting could also be used more frequently even when it isn’t so urgent. Investors — people who hold bitcoins — can similarly vote via proof-of-stake. Regular users running Bitcoin nodes could vote if a polling mechanism is built into Bitcoin Core, although this would require some way to prevent sybil attacks. All these stakeholders are important, so no one voting mechanism is superior to the others. None of these votes would be binding and they’re better thought of as opinion polls. The idea is to give the Core developers actual data on how each contingent feels about a decision, and to collect such data in ways that can’t be easily gamed.\n\nWe also recommend a public comment process analogous to what most federal agencies use to solicit inputs for decision-making. This would give a voice to merchants, payment services, exchanges, and other such entities whose opinions can’t be as easily captured through built-in polling mechanisms. Public comments would be written documents as opposed to votes. Unlike polling, these would not be anonymous and, indeed, the identity of the respondents would be important for evaluating the comments.\n\n3. Reach consensus on evaluation criteria and tradeoffs in advance of the actual discussion. In a way, this is the most important suggestion — it directly addresses the reason why we think the block size debate is currently going nowhere. Instead of simply re-hashing the not-directly-comparable pluses and minuses of each option, the community must first reach consensus on how competing interests will be balanced against each other. The first two suggestions can be seen as ways to make this easier, but even in their absence, “meta-discussion” is essential to break out of the gridlock.\n\nIn summary, the current block size debate has made it clear that the decision-making process for the Bitcoin protocol is lacking. But the need for structured governance was anticipated long ago in a paper by Kroll, Davey and Felten at Princeton. [7] The problems we’ve pointed out aren’t new and some Bitcoin developers have already at times hinted at the need for improvement (for example, here’s Matt Corallo’s post about the need for discussing decision criteria, incentives, etc). But sometimes it’s more apparent from the outside when a process needs to change and adapt. We hope the suggestions we’ve laid out will be a starting point for some much-needed changes.\n\n[1] Gavin Andresen has been the main public proponent of increasing the block size. His blog post earlier this year addressing the technical feasibility of a block size increase (and acknowledging that “economic arguments” remained) kicked off the latest round of debate, which has reached a crescendo over the last week.\n\n[2] We’re simplifying a bit and considering only the two main options: keeping the block size fixed vs. growing it indefinitely as necessary over time to accommodate demand. There are various other possibilities such as allowing the market to decide the size of each block. For some examples, see here.\n\n[3] The chart is a projection of when the current limit will become insufficient, but some have suggested that things could come to a head far sooner, say due to a flooding attack.\n\n[4] For example, Mike Hearn is quite pessimistic about the ability of the developer community to reach consensus.\n\n[5] The link goes to a famous essay reflecting on the feminist movement in the 1960s. The movement resisted organizational structure, viewing structure as oppressive. The author argues that structureless groups don’t exist, that the only choice is between formal and informal structure, and that formal structure is necessary for effective action, especially in large groups. The similarities to Bitcoin’s current quandary are remarkable.\n\n[6] Emin Gün Sirer has also suggested a Technical Advisory Board. Some of his other Tweets on the topic: “The #Bitcoin blocksize debate, at the moment, is being waged in a way that has nothing to do with science. A TAB can help refocus.” and “The most critical thing to do on the #Bitcoin dev front is to help elevate the discussion, from half-baked forum posts to proper science.”\n\n[7] The paper identified the dwindling block reward as the key challenge that would require governance. However, much of what they said parallels what we’ve said here about the block size debate:\n\n“…we argue that Bitcoin will require the emergence of governance structures, contrary to the commonly held view in the Bitcoin community that the currency is ungovernable.”\n\n“The only way to preserve the system’s health will be to change the rules … Different groups benefit from each solution … The choice is likely to drive political disputes within the Bitcoin community … A political choice such as this is difficult to make without some sort of governance structure, even if an informal one.”\n\nThe authors also point out that: “Other challenges to the system’s health and viability may also emerge, perhaps due to issues of scaling or security.” The block size is, of course, primarily a scaling issue.', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article.\n\nHow itBit defied naysayers to become bitcoin’s first chartered company\n\n– Reporter, New York Business Journal By Michael del Castillo Reporter, New York Business Journal May 11, 2015, 9:50am EDT\n\n– Reporter, New York Business Journal By Michael del Castillo Reporter, New York Business Journal May 11, 2015, 9:50am EDT"", 'Ziddu.com, a cloud-based content distribution platform operated by Singapore-based Meridian Pte.

These transactions provide security for the Bitcoin network which in turn compensates miners by giving them bitcoins. Miners can profit if the price of bitcoins exceeds the cost to mine. With recent changes in technology and the creation of professional mining centers with enormous computing power, many individual miners are asking themselves, is bitcoin mining still profitable?\n\nThere are several factors that determine whether bitcoin mining is still a profitable venture. These include the cost of the electricity to power the computer system (cost of electricity), the availability and price of the computer system, and the difficulty in providing the services. Difficulty is measured in the hashes per second of the Bitcoin validation transaction. The hash rate measures the rate of solving the problem—the difficulty changes as more miners enter because the network is designed to produce a certain level of bitcoins every ten minutes. When more miners enter the market, the difficulty increases to ensure that the level is static. The last factor for determining profitability is the price of bitcoins against standard, hard currency.\n\nThe Components of Bitcoin Mining\n\nPrior to the advent of new bitcoin mining software in 2013, mining was generally done on personal computers. But the introduction of application specific integrated circuit chips (ASIC) offered up to 100x the capability of older personal machines, rendering the use of personal computing to mine bitcoins inefficient and obsolete. When miners used the old machines, the difficulty in mining bitcoins were in line with the price of bitcoins. But with these new machines came issues related to both the high cost to obtain and run the new equipment and the lack of availability.\n\nProfitability Before and After ASIC\n\nOld timers (say, way back in 2010) mining bitcoins using just their personal computers were able to make a profit for several reasons. First, these miners already owned their systems, so equipment costs were nil. They could change the settings on their computers to run more efficiently with less stress. Second, these were the days before professional bitcoin mining centers with massive computing power entered the game. Early miners only had to compete with other individual miners on home computer systems. The competition was on even footing. Even when electricity costs varied based on geographic region, the difference was not enough to deter individuals from mining.\n\nAfter ASICs came into play, the game changed. Individuals were now competing against large bitcoin mining centers who had more computing power. Mining profits were getting chipped away by expenses like purchasing new computing equipment, paying higher energy costs for running the new equipment, and the continued difficulty in mining.\n\nProfitability in Today’s Environment\n\nBitcoin mining can still make sense and be profitable for some individuals. Equipment is more easily obtained and various efficiency machines are available. For example, some machines allow users to alter settings to lower energy requirements, thus lowering overall costs. Prospective miners should perform a cost/benefit analysis to understand their breakeven price before making the fixed-cost purchases of the equipment. The variables needed to make this calculation are:\n\nCost of power: what is your electricity rate? Keep in mind that rates change depending on the season, the time of day, and other factors. You can find this information on your electric bill measured in kWh.\n\nEfficiency: how much power does your system consume, measured in watts?\n\nTime: what is the anticipated length of time you will spend mining?\n\nBitcoin value: what is the value of a bitcoin in U.S. dollars or other official currency?\n\nThere are several web-based profitability calculators, such as ones provided by vnbitcoin.org or mining-profit.org, that would-be miners can use to analyze the cost benefit equation of bitcoin mining. Profitability calculators differ slightly and some are more complex than others.\n\nRun your analysis several times using different price levels for both the cost of power and value of bitcoins. Also, change the level of difficulty to see how that impacts the analysis. Determine at what price level bitcoin mining becomes profitable for you—that is your breakeven price.\n\nTo compete against the mining mega centers, individuals can join a mining pool, which is a group of miners who work together and share the rewards. This can increase the speed and reduce the difficulty in mining, putting profitability in reach.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTo answer the question of whether bitcoin mining is still profitable, use a web-based profitability calculator to run a cost-benefit analysis. You can plug in different numbers and find your breakeven point (after which mining is profitable). Determine if you are willing to lay out the necessary initial capital for the hardware, and estimate the future value of bitcoins as well as the level of difficulty. When both bitcoin prices and mining difficulty decline, it usually indicates fewer miners and more ease in receiving bitcoins. When bitcoin prices and mining difficulty rise, expect the opposite—more miners competing for fewer bitcoins.', 'The Philippines has the world’s third largest remittance market just behind India and China, with overseas remittances reaching more than $25.1 billion in 2013. But due to the country’s poor banking systems and expensive remittance services, overseas Filipino workers and the local workers working far from their provinces have always searched for alternative systems for transferring cash.\n\nFor generations, remittance services including Lhuiller and Palawan Pawnshop dominated the market in the Philippines, despite its high transaction fees. On average, the fees are close to 10 percent for small transactions ranging from $1 to $300. The majority of overseas workers have been using expensive remittance services due the bank’s inefficiency in sending payments and its substantially high minimum deposit rates.\n\nSince late 2013, Bitcoin startups aiming to introduce bitcoin as a remittance solution began to emerge. One of the first Bitcoin startups to do so is Coins.ph, founded by Ron Hose.\n\nCoins.ph\n\nCoins.ph launched its platform in 2014, announcing a major partnership with Metrodeal, the largest e-commerce store in the Philippines. Started out as a bitcoin payment processor for merchants and a bitcoin exchange, Coins.ph evolved into a complete bitcoin service through partnerships with the country’s largest financial institutions and banks including the aforementioned remittance service Lhuiller, BDO (Banco de Oro), BPI, China Bank, HSBC, RCBC, MayBank and many others.\n\nOn December 17, 2014, Coins.ph partnered with Security Bank, which has allowed Coins.ph users to withdraw cash in 450 ATMs nationwide. The partnership also meant that Coins.ph users could purchase bitcoin by depositing cash to the ATMs.\n\nSince December, Coins.ph continued to add features to help day-to-day purchases, currently allowing users to pay bills for utilities (electricity and water), credit card, cable providers, insurance and tuition.\n\nBitSpark\n\nLaunched in late 2014, Bitspark is a bitcoin remittance startup which initially aimed to help overseas Filipino workers transfer cash to the Philippines using bitcoin.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based startup charges less than 1 percent in transaction fees, which Is substantially lower than Lhuiller, Palawan Pawnshop and the global remittance service Western Union.\n\nTo send payments, Hong Kong-based workers can simply visit the Bitspark booth in World-Wide House (a place where most migrant workers spend their time during weekends) and give them Hong Kong dollars and specify the preferred bank outlet.\n\nDue to its success in Hong Kong, BitSpark expanded to Indonesia in January of 2015, targeting more than 165,000 Indonesians working or staying in Hong Kong. Bitspark partnered with Artabit, an Indonesian bitcoin payment solution to allow the recipients to collect Indonesian Rupiah from a bank or a post office.\n\nDuring its expansion, Bitspark stopped charging its transactions fees in percentages. Instead, the startup began charging a flat fee of $25 HK (to Indonesia) and $14 HK (to the Philippines).\n\nIn April, Bitspark partnered with multi-sig institutional wallet security provider BitGo, following the startup’s first external funding round.\n\n“There are a number of Bitcoin startups involved in the Philippines remit corridor but the volumes are still low compared to the established incumbents so there is still plenty of room for growth,” the CEO of Bitspark George Harrap told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n“I think you will continue to see this area grow over the coming years and Bitcoin remittances reaching more people forcing existing businesses to consider adopting Bitcoin as a means of transmission of money,” he added.\n\nHarrap also told Bitcoin Magazine about the company’s vision for expansion, explaining, “Ultimately we want to continue to bring our services to more people in more places throughout the APAC region. We are seeing a rise in B2B interest, which is something we are pursuing at the moment and we’re focusing on the sell sell sell, getting the word out.”\n\nRebit.ph / Satoshi Citadel Industries\n\nLaunched by the co-founder of Satoshi Citadel Industries, Miguel Cuneta, Rebit.ph allows its users to receive cash in more than 20 different bank outlets. Rebit receives BTC from anywhere around the world and converts the BTCs to Filipino pesos with a zero percent conversion fee.\n\nThe parent company of Rebit.ph, Satoshi Citadel Industries, has acquired and launched many of the Philippines’ active Bitcoin startups including the nation’s first bitcoin exchange Buybitcoin.ph, Bills Ninja, prepaidbitcoin.ph and Bitmarket.ph.\n\nRemittance is and has always been a serious problem for both overseas and local employees in the Philippines. Although trading volumes of bitcoin remittance startups are substantially lower than the existing remittance services, the number of employees sending remittances in bitcoin is rising so quickly that the bitcoin remittance startups may be able to compete with the existing remittance services such as Western Union or Lhuiller in the near future.', 'Lance Parker has always had an interest in space. He was an early adopter of Bitcoin, having mined it in the early days until it seemed the difficulty had gotten the better of him.\n\nHe’s run a number of different companies since graduating college, notably a mobile security company called iTag, which grew to 50,000 customers at its height. ConnectX is a much more ambitious project that intends to have its first launch in 2017. CCN spoke to him via Skype recently.\n\nI’ve seen all of the cycles that happen with companies not being able to manage data and solutions that come in to try to solve these issues. We are in an area of tremendous problems around the growth of data and how to secure it.\n\nI had this idea to meld everything that I had been interested in as far as security, computing, and data processing, aviation, and space. And then when I saw the cost of satellites dropping to a point where you have college students launching ten-centimeter cubes called CubeSats routinely. So, there’s a standard being set in the satellite industry. There’s continually more providers coming in that have new techniques to lower costs, and plus there’s much more innovation that will commercialize space.\n\nThe overarching project is to leverage the advantages of space to the benefit of the economics, technology and most importantly, security. Later, other applications are possible, says Parker, but for now his company is focusing on financial companies with the FIRST secure distributed satellite database, specifically in the Bitcoin industry. ConnectX aims to bring a new level of security to the Bitcoin and the financial sector. Parker says there are a number of advantages that space has which earth does not, particularly a lower cost of producing energy, zero gravity, and inherent cooling superiority.\n\nThe ultimate vision of where our platform could go is to actually do all the data processing on a platform in space.\n\nAlso read: Xapo Bitcoin Security Measures Use Satellites, Military Bunkers, and “Deep” Cold Storage\n\nMany readers may think of Xapo when they think of Bitcoin wallets and space, but Parker says that they’re not exactly on the same plane as ConnectX.\n\nIt’s interesting that you mention Xapo. To me, their partnership with a satellite company is not that they’re putting Bitcoin wallets in space. I think there is a component to their system where they might be monitoring their security platform through satellites. The way that I understand the Xapo solution is that it’s cold storage in a military bunker in the mountains of Switzerland, so very much a terrestrial solution. They raised $40 million to build it.\n\nTo avoid confusion, Parker made a very simple explanation of what ConnectX is doing.\n\nWe’re focused on our core competency as the first ever distributed satellite database platform. So when we look at storing things entirely off planet, you get into just the questions you talked about. Availability. Reliability. Redundancy. Accessibility. Data Assurance.\n\nThese are all these things that we’ve architected into the system. Our unique way that we deploy these satellites, you would essentially have to blow up the earth and our entire constellation to destroy the data. So we distribute the data in a way that galactic events – nodes smashing into asteroids/other satellites or otherwise becoming inoperable does not affect the integrity or loss of any data in our storage platform. Whether that’s a Bitcoin wallet or financial information that an institution has stored in our system.\n\nOff-Chain? Off-Planet!\n\nClients who store data on ConnectX’s system will be able to access their data directly via a mobile device. At first, this will be done via mobile web, but Parker says they will have a specialized device that connects directly to the satellites hopefully eliminating the risk of interception that can exist when utilizing a network like the Internet for any form of communication.\n\nOur first deployment will be the Internet as the interface. It will use mobile Internet access to get to our ground station, initially, until we have a full deployment, and then it will be a direct connection eliminating the use of the Internet using an entirely new symbol structure and modulation scheme that changes the economics on the order of magnitudes for each satellite node. It also adds another layer of security, using our symbol structure rather than binary. So we’re introducing speed, capacity, performance, and a level of security that is several layers above and beyond what you have with the current state of the art security.\n\n[…] They would have to know what street corner you’re on, for instance, as you access your secure vault or secure data in our system. So to me, you would have to kidnap the individual and steal their device to get access.\n\nParker says the company is built for financial institutions, Bitcoin companies and users, but will be adaptable in the event that other currencies eventually replace bitcoins as the primary means of cryptocurrency transfer. He says that a tokenized system similar to the one used by Counterparty assets is a distant possibility. His firm has hired top talent in the fields of aeronautics, satellite communications, space and mathematics in an effort to have a smooth launch. The satellites will cost roughly $1 million each to get into space in the beginning, and set launch dates have yet to be scheduled.\n\nIt is a common refrain for Bitcoin traders and enthusiasts to say “to the moon!” It seems that ConnectX is, in a sense, taking this quite literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Earlier this week, Indian Bitcoin exchange BTCXIndia shut down after a banking partner closed the account for an undisclosed reason. Unocoin, an Indian Bitcoin exchange which raised funding from Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity Corp., was questioned by local authorities who reportedly said that Bitcoin and the exchange were illegal in India.\n\nWhen contacted for further information, BTCXIndia was unwilling to give any further details. BTCXIndia CEO Mupparaju Siva Kameswara Rao did state that the exchange was running a regulatory compliant trading platform, and had been in close contact with banks and authorities to ensure they were as “legally compliant as possible.” He added, “Today’s news comes as a big shock to us all.”\n\nUnocoin CEO Sathvik Vishwanath told Bitcoin Magazine that the exchange could not disclose the name of the government agency they were contacted by, but they were being questioned whether their exchange was operating legally.\n\n“There are always confusions in the regulatory landscape for Bitcoin in pretty much every country as there are no official statements,” Vishwanath said. “It is so in India as well.”\n\nHe added that Unocoin’s banking relationships “have continued to be fully secure.”\n\nBitcoin Regulations in India\n\nBitcoin has had a rocky history in India. In late 2013, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank Of India (RBI) gave a warning against the digital currency, and subsequently several Bitcoin exchanges in the country were raided by police, and some were even shut down. Since then things have gotten brighter for the digital currency in the country.\n\nOn an Indian TV show last December, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said that despite problems, he saw a future for digital currency in India.\n\n“I have no doubt that down the line we will be moving towards primarily a cashless society and we will have some kinds of currencies like this which will be at work,” he said.\n\nThough the recent events were unfortunate for India’s young Bitcoin industry, it is not the end of digital currencies in the country. According to Mohit Kalra, CEO of Indian bitcoin exchange CoinSecure, these events are bound to happen given the regulatory uncertainty around Bitcoin in the country. He also added that business remains as usual for his exchange.\n\n“Coinsecure has not been contacted by any local law enforcement so far,” said Kalra. “This is due to our strong and legally guided KYC (know-your-customer) policy and terms and conditions. Our KYC policy includes strong and valid procedures to verify our clients, and we only allow clients to deposit or withdraw fiat to their verified linked bank accounts.”\n\nHe also added the exchange’s two banking partners, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, are still fully committed to banking the Bitcoin startup.\n\nKalra went on to say that he remains optimistic about the future of Bitcoin regulations in India and that his company has had a very positive experience with the Indian government.\n\n“I feel that all the government authorities in India have been cooperative towards our Bitcoin businesses,” he said. “We have not faced any engagement from regulation departments. This is due to Coinsecure being safe and following procedures advised by our legal panel. The day we incorporated our company in India, we informed RBI, SEBI and other authorities of our upcoming Bitcoin exchange.”', 'There are considerably more steps involved for a website to accept bitcoins for payment than simply having a wallet address for payments to be sent to. A payment processor, in most circumstances, needs to generate bitcoin addresses, provide the order status at each stage and notify the website when the correct amount has been paid, so the product can be released accordingly.\n\nUntil now the only payment processors in existence, to do this important job for merchants, were also aimed at accepting fiat currencies. They include the popular services Coinbase, Bitpay, CoinOfSale, and Coinify. Not only do these processors usually charge a fee, albeit substantially smaller than any credit card processors fees, but they also have to conform to federal Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) laws, which require them to collect US customers\' information and report any suspicious transactions to the US federal government.\n\nHaving to comply to a multitude of fiat-payment rules makes existing payment processors complex, and less useful for merchants who only want to add bitcoin payment processing to their website. Reluctant to sign up with one of these companies, many merchants have opted for placing a bitcoin address on their website. However, in doing so they forgo the extra services that would help their business. To solve this problem Mycelium recently introduced the completely free and open source software program, Mycelium Gear.\n\n-Mycelium\n\nDesigned to be a solution for payment processing without any compromises, and with no fees or middlemen, Mycelium Gear offers all the benefits of bitcoin merchant processing services.\n\n- Mycelium\n\nUnlike other payments solutions Gear does not go through a bank or any 3rd party service. Instead, Gear uses the blockchain\'s natural ability to track spending so users can watch their bitcoins go directly from the customer into their bitcoin wallet, with no stops in-between. In an interview with BraveNewCoin, Gear project lead Roman Snitko explained, ""Mycelium Gear is called a payment processor because it provides a service similar to other payments processors - notifying merchants that a payment has been made. However, it doesn\'t hold any money. It simply watches the blockchain (which anyone can do) and generates addresses from the BIP32 public key. (which anyone can do).”\n\nIt may sound like a simple program, but it\'s a merchant solution that has been sorely missing from the bitcoin merchant tool chest.\n\n- Mycelium\n\nGear\'s payment processing is simple. When a purchase is made the customer is presented with an invoice, including a bitcoin address to send their payment to. The program monitors the public Bitcoin blockchain and notifies the merchant when a payment is detected. It can even tell you if an order has been overpaid or underpaid.\n\n- Mycelium\n\nSince Gear needs to run on a server, Mycelium offers two options for merchants. Neither of these puts the platform in a position to hold bitcoins. Mycelium Gear never needs to interact with any money directly. For novice users, Mycelium will run the software on their servers for free. More experienced users can download and run the open source Gear core software. This latter option should be welcomed by merchants concerned with privacy.\n\nWhen asked if there is any way for a government agency to penalize merchants running their own Gear server, Snitko replied “It is hard to imagine how any kind of regulatory body can treat this as subject to financial regulation. Even if such a thing is possible, the core is opensource. Any merchant can install it on their own and continue accepting payments.""\n\nSince Gear has adopted the BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic address standard, generating bitcoin address in Gear is simple but powerful. For each customer payment a new public address is generated, which allows easy merchant tracking and bookkeeping, as well as being an added layer of security.\n\n- Mycelium\n\nSetting these addresses up is easy, and at no point do you hand over a private key to the software. You do have to use a bitcoin wallet such as Electrum or Mycelium\'s own wallet that has adopted the BIP32 standard, so that you can obtain a compatible format of your wallet\'s public key from the wallet software.\n\n- Mycelium\n\nAlthough Gear only processes bitcoin, products on merchants\' websites can still be priced in any fiat currencies. Mycelium offers several options during install that make it a fully-functional replacement for bitcoin payment processing.\n\n- Mycelium\n\nMycelium has a long record of innovating in the bitcoin space that goes back to the very origin of bitcoin itself. With a product suite that includes one of the most popular wallets, a hardware wallet device, a marketplace to buy and sell bitcoins locally, and even a highly-secure paper wallet generator, Mycelium has added another great offering for it\'s customers and the bitcoin community as a whole.']"
05/12/2015,"['James Angel compares bitcoin to MySpace, the social network that paved the way for far more influential services like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nToday\'s bitcoin digital currency, says Angel, a professor of finance at Georgetown University, is too flawed to replace existing currencies. But the basic ideas underpinning the technology, he believes, can significantly change how the financial world operates. This is already starting to happen.\n\nMany believe that the blockchain can ultimately remake the public stock market altogether.\n\nAs it revealed over the weekend, Nasdaq OMX—the company behind the Nasdaq stock exchange—is testing a system that uses bitcoin technology to oversee stock trades on a separate market solely for private companies. Brad Peterson, who leads technology efforts at Nasdaq OMX, says the test will happen on the Nasdaq Private Market, which launched early last year, giving companies a way of better managing their shares before an IPO. In short, Nasdaq will handle the market\'s trades using technology based on the bitcoin ""blockchain,"" the online public ledger that tracks ownership of the digital currency via machines spread across the Internet.\n\nAngel calls the project ""the perfect application for the blockchain."" Today, pre-IPO companies track their stock sales and trades using ad hoc technology like computer spreadsheets. The blockchain can streamline private trading, and give pre-IPO companies a more reliable way of auditing trades in their stock. ""CEOs often ask us: \'Why can\'t I know immediately who owns my stock and who trades my stock?\'"" Peterson says. ""That\'s a fair question.""\n\nWith companies waiting longer to offer an IPO—and seeking new ways of giving employees added liquidity before going public—Nasdaq\'s system could serve a growing need. Perhaps more importantly, the project could spark the use of bitcoin technology as a way of refining public stock markets as well. Today\'s public markets are woefully inefficient, taking up to three days to settle trades, and the blockchain could help change this.\n\nPeterson believes it will. When asked if the company\'s work with the blockchain in the private market could lead to something similar in the public market, he doesn\'t hesitate. ""Yes,"" he says, ""we think so."" And he\'s in a position to help make this happen. Nasdaq not only runs the Nasdaq stock market. It operates eight other stock markets in Europe, and it provides technology for countless others.\n\nMarket Remaking\n\nPeterson isn\'t the only one who believes the blockchain ultimately can remake public stock markets. Big-name online retailer Overstock.com, a public company, is building bitcoin-based technology that it hopes to use as a means of issuing its stock online. (Late last month, it filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in an effort to win regulatory approval for its plan). And open source projects like Counterparty are exploring the same basic idea.\n\n\'The private market can go from quill pins and parchment into the 21st century.\' James Angel\n\nAngel refers to this concept as ""the stockchain,"" and like Peterson, he sees Nasdaq\'s private market technology as a stepping stone to a blockchain-based public market. ""This is the type of application that makes a good test case,"" he says.\n\nNasdaq already has built a prototype using what\'s called the Open Assets Protocol. Essentially, this is a way of ""coloring"" bitcoin transactions so they represent an asset other than a bitcoin (such as a stock trade). The prototype runs atop bitcoin\'s existing network of machines, and Peterson says Nasdaq will start experimenting with outside private companies ""right away.""\n\nAngel warns, however, that there are many challenges to overcome before this kind of thing can succeed, particularly on the public stock market. Nasdaq and other exchanges must hone the ideas that underpin the blockchain before it can thrive in the face of what Angel calls the ""incredible conservatism"" that characterizes Wall Street. Most notably, he warns that the technology must balance the open nature of the blockchain with the need for privacy. A chief benefit of the blockchain is it tracks all transactions on a ledger anyone can view at any time. But as Angel notes, many investors prefer to keep transactions private. A bitcoin-based stock system will need a way of keeping transactions public while hiding the identity of individual investors.\n\nPeterson says Nasdaq already offers such privacy tools. ""It\'s similar to the way a bitcoin wallet works today,"" he says. ""We can give the company and the people a view into their private transactions, but they can’t see other companies\' transactions."" That said, researchers have shown that even if you hide behind anonymous addresses, there are ways of determining who you are.\n\nKeeping Public Private\n\nThis is often the tension in the world of bitcoin. And it\'s a key reason the technology is still used relatively rarely as a digital currency. But at the same time, public stock markets could very much benefit from the technology bitcoin provides. Today, stock trades are overseen by an organization called the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation or DTCC, a privately controlled middleman that works under a system where trades need not be settled for three days. ""The DTCC is really 1970s technology with 2000s hardware,"" Angel says. ""That\'s why it still takes three bleeping days to settle a trade.""\n\nFor Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne, such middlemen create loopholes that can be exploited by investors. He aims to close them with his blockchain project. Angel believes that even if Overstock\'s plan receives SEC approval, the company will have difficulty moving investors in its bitcoin-inspired platform. Investors in public companies like Overstock are too married to the old way of doing things, he says. They already juggle their Overstock shares through other parties and technologies.\n\nBut Nasdaq may have an easier path to success. When investing in brand-new company whose stock is only available in the private market, Angel explains, investors are more likely to give the technology a try. ""The private market can go from quill pins and parchment into the 21st century,"" he says. And if it\'s successful, perhaps then the public market will follow.\n\nPeterson sees a direct path to the public markets. Companies that use the blockchain in the private market will be more likely to use it in the public market, he says. And though there is enormous inertia to overcome among US investors, he adds, that inertia isn\'t there in the developing world. ""We may see countries jump straight to the blockchain,"" he says.', ""These days, among the digiterati, all that glitters is not gold—it's Bitcoin.\n\nSilicon Valley investors are betting heavily on the online currency. But is it a libertarian boondoggle?\n\nThanks to the resistance to any sort of public oversight, Bitcoins have proven notoriously unstable—prey to panics over adverse news events, speculative runs, and price meltdowns at a moment’s notice.\n\nThe next great digital frontier is money.\n\nNo, not the vast troughs of venture capitalist cash that have elevated Silicon Valley into a gaudy empyrean of wealth, but the idea of money—the tenuous social contract that underwrites economic life in market societies.\n\nBitcoin—which debuted a mere six years ago under the aegis of a mysterious, and presumably pseudonymous, computer geek known as Satoshi Nakamoto—is a digital currency distinguished by its lack of a central bank to keep track of who owns what, making Bitcoin extremely secure. Instead, Bitcoin valuations and transactions are managed by a peer-to-peer computer network.\n\nWhen people lend their computer’s processing power to the network, they also “mine coins.” The virtual coins thus earned can then be used like any other currency—to purchase goods and services from participating vendors, to hoard, to underwrite black market exchanges or to fuel rampant investor speculation, which explains why Bitcoin is a big hit with the digiterati.\n\nSilicon Valley investors are betting that Bitcoin’s technology will come to displace most routine financial transactions—from currency exchanges to legal contracts to stock trading—via a passel of coding functions, known in the Bitcoin world as “the blockchain.” One recent Bitcoin startup, 21 Inc., pledges to take the shadowy, often extra-legal subculture of Bitcoin trading into the mainstream.\n\nBut as Nathaniel Popper makes clear in Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money, a chronicle of the Bitcoin insurgency, the virtual currency has a long way to go before it upends the old monetary order.\n\nEver since Nakamoto introduced the concept of a secure digital currency, Bitcoins have been catnip to libertarian ideologues and utopian anarchists. Because it’s accessed via a completely private key, Bitcoin is not only (in theory) a quantum leap forward in the security of digital money exchanges; it is also (in theory) a private medium of exchange, out of reach of meddling government regulators who have termed digital currencies the “Wild West of finance.”\n\nSmall wonder one of the earliest adopters of the currency was the online exchange for illicit drugs and other illegal entertainments, Silk Road. According to the FBI, the service was, at its peak, logging more than 7,000 daily transactions and earning more than $20,000 in daily commissions for its creator and operator, Ross Ulbricht. The Silk Road saga ended badly for Ulbricht, however, when American federal agents tracked him down. In February, he was convicted of seven charges, including money laundering and narcotics trafficking.\n\nOver the course of Silk Road’s rise, Ulbricht had descended from his perch as a slacker-entrepreneur presiding over transgressive digital commerce into a Michael Corleone-grade study in paranoid sociopathy. By the time of his arrest, Ulbricht had allegedly put out six contracts to kill people associated with Silk Road. One was a vendor who attempted to blackmail Ulbright; another, a recently arrested Silk Road collaborator whom Ulbricht feared would divulge information about users. No actual murders seem to have occurred, but Ulbricht’s wan handling of these virtual killings is nonetheless chilling; a seized computer diary entry concerning one of them simply reads: “got word that blackmailer was executed / created file upload script / started to fix problem with bond refunds over 3 months old.”\n\nLikewise, the central exchange for Bitcoins, the online clearinghouse known as Mt. Gox, came to an inglorious end last year. The site’s Japan-based proprietor, a French national named Mark Karpeles, managed to have all the site’s reserves stolen out from under him before going bankrupt, with tens of thousands of clients losing Bitcoin accounts valued at more than $400 million.\n\nThanks to the resistance to any sort of public oversight, Bitcoins have proven notoriously unstable—prey to panics over adverse news events, speculative runs, and price meltdowns at a moment’s notice. A 2013 study found that 45 percent of exchanges like Mt. Gox had gone under. The new wave of Silicon Valley boosters assure skeptics that the currency will stabilize as more big-ticket players (like them) enter the Bitcoin market.\n\nThe mainstreaming of the Bitcoin, however, looks like another libertarian boondoggle—not unlike the labor-soaking “sharing economy” or Alan Greenspan’s disastrous anti-regulatory tenure at the Federal Reserve. For the signature weaknesses of Bitcoins are nearly identical with those that already assail our conventional paper economy: the systemic vulnerability to unchecked speculative end-runs around regulation; the deep instability of debt-driven financial instruments; and the proliferation of bad actors, cheats and market frauds. After all the cheerful rhetoric of market conquest that now attends the ready-for-primetime Bitcoin industry, Digital Gold reminds us of how rapidly the libertarian Valhalla degenerates into a capitalist Hell."", 'This week’s crisis in the Indian Bitcoin market involves BTCXIndia’s recent closure due to the loss of its banking partner.\n\nThe India-based exchange, BTCXIndia which featured a live trading platform and wallet service, said in a statement on its website and via email that it would close its doors on May 20, 2015 citing that “without a bank account, we can no longer operate as a business and we are thus forced to close operations.”\n\nThis sudden turn of events startled several active bitcoiners, who interpreted the move as being a strategic regulatory move by the central bank towards an eventual ban.\n\nThe members of the Bitcoin India Alliance (BIA) – an alliance of India’s top Bitcoin entrepreneurs - were quick to to assess the issue. Vishal Gupta, SearchCoin Network Founder, told the following to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“BTCXIndia has posted on their site that their bank accounts have been shut and further claimed that no other bank is offering to open an account for them. This seems to have set panic within community at large. On our further probing the matter it seems its a case in isolation and there is no blanket ban or directive from RBI (Reserve Bank of India) to this effect. We at BIA would like tell Bitcoin users in India not to panic on this news. We would also like to request for BTCXIndia to make document they received from their bank public in larger interest of Bitcoin community in India.”\n\nMeanwhile, other members reassured that their businesses have not received any orders to cease operations. Sathvik Vishwanath, Unocoin CEO, said:\n\n""We have bank accounts with national sector, private sector and co-operative sector. All relations are fully secure and we have not received any kind of request asking us to part with them. We look forward to continue growing our business with their continued support.""\n\nIgot’s Ansh Day:\n\n”As far as Igot is concerned, there have been no such restrictions imposed by India\'s banks or government. Our banking relationships are very positive and the country\'s Bitcoin community is increasingly important for us.""\n\n\u200bOverall, it seems that BTCXIndia’s case may have been a rare exception in an otherwise growing Indian Bitcoin market. While there has been no official release of any central bank regulation to the effect of a potential bitcoin ban, further communication is awaited from both BTCXindia and the bank in question.\n\n""Indian Bitcoin ecosystem is waking up to the positive actions and news being shared by western world,” explained Zebpay Co-Founder, Saurabh Agrawal. “Volumes and demand for bitcoin is on rise. VCs are showing interest in the field. Most of national and international banks are allowing opening and running of Bitcoin businesses. We see no problem in operations at India.”\n\nBack in December 2014, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India commented that he has “no doubt” digital currencies will play a role in India\'s future society.', 'If you are building a car, and you either want the car to be faster or more efficient than ever before, you can do one of two things to it. You can increase the power of the car to make it faster (or lower the power rating to make it more efficient.) Or you can reduce the weight of the car, which usually helps both speed and efficiency. This cause-and-effect approach works throughout many operating systems. People, or athletes, can also be tweaked in this fashion to become faster, or more efficient, or both. Banks can also be trained to be better in this fashion, and organizations like the Euro Banking Association (EBA) see Bitcoin’s block chain technology as something that can streamline the banking industry. If the bank is the athlete in need of the latest advanced training methods, Bitcoin’s block chain technology could be the new trainer they’re looking for.\n\nThe EBA Takes a Look into Block Chain Technology\n\nBanks, especially their stockholders, love new streams of revenue. As a former banker, I know that banks’ revenue streams have revenue streams inside. The other side of that is becoming more efficient also saves you money as a business. It’s not how much you make but how much you keep, right? Well, innovations like Bitcoin’s block chain can help banks worldwide do faster transactions, with fewer third-parties to involve, reducing instances of counter-party risk. A streamlined economic process saves time and money, and that is something Bitcoin’s technology does very well and the legacy banking industry is about 50 years behind Bitcoin in doing. So overseers like EBA have gotten to work, creating a crypto-currency report that is similar in vain to what The Bank of England produced last year. This is being done to help the banking industry see what the future potential for leveraging the latest in digital technology, like the advantages of Bitcoin’s block chain.\n\nThe EBA doesn’t see greatness in Bitcoin the currency, as current legislation and regulations are several steps behind it, keeping it out of the mainstream of banking finance, for now. Yet, they see it as very relevant in their industry, nonetheless.\n\n“The fact that regulatory institutions in Europe, such as the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank, have issued reports on this topic testifies to the relevance of crypto-technologies.”\n\nAlso read: 400 European Banks Accept Bitcoin Purchase Agreement\n\nThe EBA sees that while it’s time may not be now; it is worth watching and analyzing for the future. And some of its technology will help banking operations right away, upon implementation.\n\n“Apart from possibly being able to speed up processes and reduce their complexity, crypto-technology applications in this area can also be integrated with legacy IT, legal frameworks and existing assets (currencies, stock, bonds etc). Therefore, existing financial services could be ‘powered by crypto-technologies’ offering financial institutions potentially lower costs, better products and faster time to market.”\n\nThe EBA has grown over the last 30 years from 18 member commercial banks tenfold, to over 180 banks under its stewardship, so they have quite the sphere of influence in the European banking industry. European banks have shown an interest in connecting with Bitcoin before. As they said, major economic leaders like the Bank of England, the ECB, and the EBA all giving Bitcoin, and it’s underlying technology, a hard look says a lot. Its innovative design and value as a more efficient operating system can no longer be ignored. It is a couple of generations better than what they have on their books, and that is hard to ignore.\n\nBanks aren’t going anywhere, as they have several advantages that being around for centuries brings, but they see that Bitcoin has a new bag of tricks. Think of a bank as an economic sorcerer, looking for a new financial spell to cast over the masses. Or just the ability to execute its current economic spells much better and faster. Bitcoin’s more advanced block chain brain and the banking industry’s massive reach and infrastructure would make quite a quantum leap forward. In an industry that has only created the ATM and the debit/credit card over the last 50 years, it’s about time banking stepped into the 21st century.\n\nThis is proof positive that good news travels fast. Bitcoin is great news, but has it fallen into the wrong hands?\n\nWill banking get stronger through Bitcoin, or will a day come when the banks’ spell over the masses is broken, and people realize they don’t need banks to live?

The expansion within the SEPA network is a movement for supporting both the pay-in and pay-out operations for both legs. In simple terms – we can now move faster and cheaper.""\n\nIn addition to its consumer features, Coinify allows businesses to accept bitcoin and receive next-day settlement in fiat currencies, including euros, dollars and kroner, among other currencies.\n\nThe platform also offers a plug-in, which enables merchants already using BigCommerce, Magento, Shopify and WooCommerce to integrate bitcoin payments.\n\nFuture plans\n\nLarsen said the company was planning to take on further investment in the second half of this year.\n\n""We expect to raise a significant amount to make sure that Europe will be playing a leading role in this new payment space. We believe that our strategy on providing the traditional payment service providers with dedicated service is our way in to the market,"" he added.\n\nCoinify announced a seed funding round in September last year, with investment from venture capital firm SEED Capital and startup accelerator Accelerace. The total remains undisclosed.\n\nWith the funds, Coinify acquired Bitcoin Nordic, a bitcoin broker and the merchant services formerly offered by Bitcoin Internet Payment Systems (BIPS).\n\nCompetition\n\nWith its European expansion, Coinify is entering a hotly contested space, competing with various bitcoin exchanges also supporting SEPA payments.\n\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase recently announced its expansion to the UK, enabling customers to add euros to their wallets using SEPA.\n\nThe exchange, which now serves over 20 countries in Europe, previously sent its co-founders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, on a tour of the region to meet potential customers and promote the company\'s API to developers.\n\nBitcoin exchanges Bitstamp and Safello also allow customers to purchase bitcoin through SEPA deposits.\n\nEuropean map image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While, DEVgrants is not a funding platform, it does provide resources to continue building a Dapp.\n\nCCN, founded in 2014, is a nonprofit dedicated to blockchain education, innovation and development. CCN focuses on connecting the novice with the experts and has reached a network spanning the globe in more than 150 locations.\n\nProponents of DApps claim that the decentralization of software services people use on a daily basis, such as Dropbox, WhatsApp and eBay, could greatly benefit the users of those services. For example, a decentralized marketplace would mean that buying and selling goods and services would be conducted directly between buyer and seller without unwanted third-party involvement, and would be regulated by cryptocurrency smart contracts and arbitration.\n\n“Over the next decade businesses will start assessing their decentralization strategies. Decentralization technology undermines the core control mechanism businesses use today to monopolize their customer base thanks to its abstraction effect,” states the Corona whitepaper.\n\nCorona also outlines the possibility that decentralized identity, reputation and credit rating applications could possibly be the backbone in the creation of more competitive peer-to-peer insurance and loan markets which have the potential to disrupt these industries, as well as serving the unbanked worldwide who cannot currently benefit from such protection. Decentralized messenger and network applications free from government interference could also have positive impacts on democracy and freedom of speech.\n\nAbout Corona\n\nFounded by Greene and backed by an experienced team of developers and advisors, Corona strives to make DApps easier to develop while promoting their use cases.\n\nAccording to Greene, DApps can be built “in a shorter time period compared to standard applications because of the turnkey infrastructure, lowered barrier to entry and simplified deployment. The increasing ease of creating such software will lead to the rapid expansion of decentralized services. These peer-to-peer services are revolutionizing the Internet economy, offering alternatives to centralized corporate monopolies.”\n\nBy building a networking hub for DApp developers in need of funding and resources, Corona is poised to advance new blockchain technologies, open-source software solutions and disruptive decentralized business models that may benefit billions worldwide.', 'Secretive bitcoin startup 21 Inc has performed tests illustrating how its technology could enable machine-to-machine bitcoin transactions as part of a company overview created during the fundraising of its $75m Series C.\n\nIn its pitch, 21 Inc, then still operating under original moniker 21e6, showcased both slides and video that demonstrate how bitcoin could be used to facilitate real-time marketplaces for Internet bandwidth. Using three proxy users, a Vimeo demonstration (now removed) outlines how a service can parcel out its download capacity through the use of bitcoin payments.\n\nConnected to an account set up in the name of 21 chairman Balaji Srinivasan, the demo illustrates an example whereby three clients participate in such an auction, with their bandwidth speeds changing in real time as bids are placed.\n\nA narrator explains:\n\n""Tomorrow, perhaps it would be possible for clients to send bitcoin to get bandwidth. That is to say, different clients could send bitcoin to the server to indicate their need for that resource.""\n\nAn analysis of the blockchain confirms the transactions for clients 1, 2 and 3 were received by bitcoin’s public ledger on 16th October, while an example of the display can be found on a URL registered as cooperative-algorithms.com.\n\nAlso included in the overview is an email exchange allegedly taking place between Comcast West Coast strategic development managing director Francisco Varela and 21 CEO Matt Pauker in which the cable giant exec evaluates how its customers could benefit from participating in 21’s bitcoin mining operations.\n\nA representative from Comcast confirmed such talks took place, but suggested they were ""exploratory"" in nature and that the company has no plans to work with 21 at this time. Comcast, which boasts 21.7 million customers in 21 states, generated $67bn in revenue in 2014.\n\nOverall, the 80-page overview suggests 21 was, at the time of its apparent fall 2014 preparation, seeking to become one of the bitcoin network’s largest transaction processors, a microtransactions protocol layer for the Internet and a mining pool branded as a social networking platform.\n\nThe cornerstone of the strategy as presented would have been the release of consumer products that would turn power from wall sockets into bitcoin through the widespread dissemination of bitcoin mining chips.\n\nWhen reached for comment, representatives from 21 suggested that information presented was ""outdated"" and did not paint an accurate picture of how the company would ultimately seek to go to market.\n\n""Much of the information is inaccurate, and that which is not grossly inaccurate is long obsolete (especially the numerical figures),"" a 21 spokesperson said, declining to elaborate further.\n\nBitcoin is power\n\nThe slides lay out a plan hinging on embedding 21\'s custom-made \'BitSplit\' mining chips into everyday tech products such as USB chargers, PCs, routers, game consoles, phone chargers and direct chipsets at no cost to the hardware producers. The document suggests 21 had a working demo of its BitSplit chip at the time it was prepared.\n\nAccording to the overview, the BitSplit chip\'s key innovation was intended to be a hardcoded bitcoin wallet address that would give the user 25% of mining proceeds, with the remaining 75% going to 21.\n\nEach device would be built with target applications in mind that would then allow consumers to, in theory, spend any bitcoin earned for online content or digital services.\n\nFor example, PCs, mobile phone chargers and USB hubs would seek to encourage micropayments in applications, while routers and game consoles would allow users to spend bitcoin for added bandwidth or on in-app purchases.\n\nGiven that users would constitute a small portion of the network individually, 21 detailed how it could potentially increase the average payouts for both itself and the owners of consumer products with its technology.\n\nThe document suggests 21 had sought to build 20,000-server, 26-megawatt datacenters to serve as the center of a mining pool that could ensure block rewards.\n\nAs an example of the potential power of its pool, 21\'s mining operations generated approximately 5,700 BTC in 2013 and 69,000 BTC the following year, according to the document.\n\nBy the time its chips were to be embedded into Internet of Things (IoT) devices, 21 projected its cost to produce 1 BTC could be as low as $7.45.\n\nGoing social\n\nThe documents suggest 21 had been considering a multi-pronged strategy to build out a competitive mining network that also sought to reimagine the transaction confirmation process as a way to onboard consumers.\n\nWithout a strong core of industrial bitcoin mining facilities, the document contended, consumer mining with the chips would have been too unprofitable to attract interest.\n\nThe documents projected that, should the BitSplit chips seek to process transactions alone, a user would need 34,722 days, or about 93 years, to discover a block. By pooling its resources, however, 21 projected it could reduce the average block time to 200 minutes, or roughly three hours, paying users 0.72 mBTC or about 17 cents per day.\n\nAs part of this effort, 21 would also seek to make the activity of mining more user-friendly by auto-enrolling users into its own social network. Named BlockParty, the project was introduced via a visual mock-up of how the social network might look running as a mobile application.\n\nAccording to the image text, users could keep track of BTC earned daily and view the purchasing habits of friends. In the example, one user is able to use his BTC to skip 15 minutes of commercials on online video service Hulu.\n\nOther updates show friends activating and deactivating devices.\n\nTies to Intel\n\nComcast was not the only major company named in the documents.\n\nFor example, 21 indicated it had been processing bitcoin transactions with what it called the ""only chip"" built at computing giant Intel’s foundry, touting close relationship with US computing giant Intel.\n\nIntel factories, the documents suggested, were responsible for at least two generations of 21 bitcoin mining chips, a 0.57 w/GH 22nm FinFET chip (codenamed CyrusOne) and a 0.22 w/GH 22nm chip (codenamed Brownfield).\n\nThough Intel has so far kept its relationship with 21 quiet, the bitcoin startup took the opposite approach in its company overview, which included a screenshot of an email allegedly from Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Dated 5th September, the email finds Krzanich informing Pauker and investor Marc Andreessen of his opinion on a proposal to distribute bitcoin mining chips in consumer electronic devices.\n\nKrzanich indicated he would be instructing Intel VP and GM Doug L Davis to evaluate the potential addition of mining chips to Intel products, including desktop PCs, writing:\n\n""I am copying Doug on this note to make an introduction … but trust me I will stay 100% engaged in this and be the godfather of it at Intel.""\n\nIntel’s apparent vote of confidence in the company was detailed in another entry.\n\n""We are taking your suggestion very seriously and if Intel was to ubiquitously apply mining to the majority of our chips, it is a significant event and will impact the landscape,"" general manager of the New Business Group at Intel Corporation Jerry R Bautista remarked in an email with Pauker.\n\nBoth 21 and Andreesseen Horowitz declined to comment on the nature of any talks with Intel. Intel did not offer a response when contacted.\n\nAdditional emails included infer the company had reached out to technology companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm to assess their interest in increasing their revenue through the addition of BitSplit-enabled products.\n\nEmails included from Qualcomm\'s Andy Oberst indicate that the firm had just approved an investment in 21 at the time of the document\'s preparation. AMD declined to comment for this report.\n\nInternet of Value\n\nOnce consumers and businesses are set up to receive bitcoin via everyday devices, the documents provide evidence 21 had built technology that intends to serve as the template for how such earnings could be used in microtransactions on the Internet.\n\nIn particular, 21 had been working on a process that would allow developers to block users from accessing websites unless funds are sent to a bitcoin address. Notably, the process used the 402 Payment Required error code originally intended for web-based micropayments at the outset of the World Wide Web.\n\nUnder this scenario, a client would ask a server to open a connection, and rather than seeing an error when denied, the user would receive a price quote in BTC.\n\nPaid APIs, paid Wi-Fi, priority email and ad-free web browsing, 21 had suggested, were all additional use cases that could be enabled once consumers are able to generate small amounts of bitcoin through its mining products.\n\nFirst quarter rollout\n\nTo move its market strategy forward, 21 indicated that it was developing a first-party device that would serve as the idea’s market introduction.\n\nProjected for launch in Q1 2015 was a 21-produced USB charging hub, the introduction of which would be followed by the integration of chips into net-enabled devices before ending up in chipsets.\n\nThough no dimensions were given for the product, illustrations produced by Mountain View-based Bould Design showcase a white, router-sized USB charger that would come complete with two USB charging portals.\n\n21 went on to describe the combined effect of its work in lofty terms that evoked the early Internet, suggesting the launch would mark the beginning of a more widespread uptick in consumer bitcoin adoption.\n\n""The AOL CD of bitcoin,"" the document called the strategy. ""Give every user a free trial of bitcoin at near-zero marginal cost. A proven model to onboard millions.""\n\nStan Higgins and Joon Ian Wong contributed reporting.\n\nFeatured images courtesy of Plug and Play accelerator, game console image via Stefano Tinti / Shutterstock, Comcast image via Mr Tin.DC / Flickr.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The DCI was announced in April following a year of additional grassroots efforts on campus.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Forde contended that the regulation ultimately enacted by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) should strive to help grow and mature the industry, rather than simply protecting consumers.\n\nForde wrote:\n\n""If regulation is done right, it will increase investment in digital currency startups, create jobs and allow consumers to receive cutting-edge financial services of the future, faster and safer.""\n\nForde went on to argue that, as the first US state to craft a specific regulatory framework for the industry, New York\'s BitLicense is among the most important regulations globally, influencing development both in the US and abroad.\n\nHowever, he warned that, in its current state, the mass replication of the BitLicense would likely impose ""substantial burdens"" on all but the most well-funded companies.\n\nBitcoin backwater\n\nAmong the issues presented by Forde is the fact that, under the current guidelines, bitcoin companies operating in New York would need to have all app updates approved.\n\nThe process, he contended, would slow down features and fixes and turn New York into the ""bitcoin backwater of the US"".\n\nForde also drew attention to a provision that would mandate bitcoin and digital currency startups receive approval if they sought to give away more than 10% of their company to investors.\n\nIf applied en masse, he argued, this would mean startups could need such approvals in all 50 states to secure working capital.\n\nNew York\'s approach to regulation, however, already stands in contrast to states including Vermont and North Carolina, which have taken steps to regulate the industry under existing regulation.\n\nThe need for startups to potentially undergo similar treatment in other states again emerged when Forde cited how the BitLicense would, in effect, require two licenses – a money transmitter license and a state-specific license.\n\nRepeating history\n\nFinally, Forde called on the NYDFS to draw on the history of the Internet when making its final adjustments to the bill, regulating Internet service providers (ISPs) not web browsers, or in other words, companies that control funds and are not pure technology operations.\n\n""Similar to an ISP, the controller of assets is where the transfer of money happens, and they can provide the information needed to address potential money laundering or illicit uses,"" Forde explained.\n\nForde ended his statements with a call of patriotism, encouraging the NYDFS to embrace the free market ideals of America by creating a healthy but competitive landscape for bitcoin and blockchain startups.\n\n""If changes to the proposed BitLicense are not made, only a handful of the most well-funded companies will survive — not because they are providing the best product or service, but because they have access to the most money,"" Forde continued, adding:\n\n""And that’s not the competitive environment that creates the world-changing startups for which America is known.""\n\nMIT image via Wikipedia\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

05/13/2015,"['The stock exchange is experimenting with ‘coloured coins’ as a way to use the public ledger to record private equity transactions\n\nThe US stock-exchange Nasdaq is experimenting with incorporating the underlying technology of the bitcoin cryptocurrency into its pre-IPO trading arm, Nasdaq Private Markets.\n\nThe wing, a subsidiary of the company that focuses on assisting investment for firms that are not yet publicly traded, will begin to write a copy of its trades into the publicly available ledger of all bitcoin transactions, known as the “blockchain”.\n\nIn doing so, it hopes to “provide extensive integrity, audit ability, governance and transfer of ownership capabilities”, according to a release from Nasdaq.\n\nConventionally, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin rely on the blockchain to free them from the centralisation of traditional finance. Traditionally, one trusted authority (usually a bank) holds an accurate ledger of how much money each customer has, and electronic transactions are made possible by rewriting the ledger of the sender and recipient simultaneously.\n\nBut bitcoin, with no central body, instead shares all the information about who holds what amongst every computer running the software, to create a public ledger, the blockchain. The blockchain is so called because it records every transaction in the currency’s six-year history, grouped into a continuous chain of approximately 10-minute long transaction blocks. Every 10 minutes, when a complex mathematical problem is solved, a new block recording all the latest transactions is added and the blockchain. It means that every bitcoin transaction is public, and no single authority can prevent a transaction from taking place.\n\nThe blockchain can also hold information other than just who spent what, however, and it is this feature which Nasdaq is using. The company will be creating “coloured coins”, appending special information to the blockchain indicating that a particular fraction of a particular bitcoin can be redeemed according to the terms written into it. That coloured coin can then be passed around just like a normal bitcoin, while preserving a record of who owns the asset it is linked to.\n\nIt’s akin to sticking a note on to a pound coin that says “the owner of this coin also owns 1% of HotNewStartup Inc.” – except that the note can never be removed, the ownership of the coin is always public, and the message doesn’t have to fit on a postage stamp.\n\nBob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said: “Utilising the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities. Once you cut the apron strings of need for the physical, the opportunities we can envision blockchain providing stand to benefit not only our clients, but the broader global capital markets.”\n\nBitcoin remains in use as a currency, with companies such as bitcoin bank Coinbase growing rapidly. That firm is now valued at $400m, and provides services such as online wallets, currency exchange, and merchant tools to customers who want to use bitcoin to buy and sell goods and services.\n\nBut with interest in the currency at a low point in its recent history leading to a corresponding slump in the price of bitcoin, many have begun to examine the use of the blockchain technology for other purposes.\n\nLondon’s Eris Industries uses a spin-off of the blockchain to offer users a fully programmable decentralised database and web server, while San Francisco’s Hello Block lets developers build their own applications directly into the blockchain.', 'Taylor Swift famously pulled her music from Spotify last year because she didn’t believe the streaming service fairly compensates artists. Perhaps she’d be more impressed with a new feature from a startup called ChangeTip: the ability to tip artists on SoundCloud using the digital currency bitcoin.\n\nSpotify pays artists, on average, less than one cent per play, leading Swift to tell Time that it “has been shrinking the numbers of paid album sales.” She called out both Beats Music and Rhapsody as better options for artists because, “you have to pay for a premium package in order to access my albums. And that places a perception of value on what I’ve created.” Swift’s music is not on SoundCloud currently, although the site has many covers of her songs. Last year, SoundCloud launched On SoundCloud, a partner program that allows artists to get paid by advertising against their content.\n\nChangeTip, which calls itself a “money layer for social media,” announced today a SoundCloud tipping feature that it created through SoundCloud’s public API. The company’s prime vehicle is a button, embeddable onto web sites via the Tip.Me widget, that allows content producers (be it news outlets large and small, bloggers, musicians) to accept tips. In the early days of the company, it called itself a “love button” for the Web, though it has moved away from that language.\n\nThe bitcoin startup sees this newest feature as a unique and exciting monetization option for artists. Perhaps artists will agree. The only drawback? The donations will be in bitcoin, a currency that still has large volatility, fluctuating in value from around $210 to $240 over the past few months. (The price very briefly hit $300 on March 10 and has not gotten that high since.) But there already are many services, such as BitReserve, for quickly exchanging bitcoin to other currencies.\n\n“Now people can actually reward content that they really appreciate, and it will go directly to the individual, rather than to the label or to an intermediary,” says Kyle Kemper, the company’s head of tipping. “We are creating a new channel for fans to engage with artists, and for artists to engage with fans. And beyond SoundCloud, with the ChangeTip platform any musicians can accept donations over Twitter and on their own web sites.” Kemper notes that SoundCloud has been one of the most requested platforms from ChangeTip users.\n\nUltimately, ChangeTip wants to become the de facto way that people exchange micro-payments over the Web, with no fee and shorter transfer times.\n\nBut that lofty goal is still far away. For the moment, the startup is mostly being used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts to send bitcoin to each other, or to journalists and bloggers as a kudos for bitcoin coverage. The tipping happens over Twitter, using fun shorthand that users can customize, like sending someone a beer, or a burger, or even a poutine. With a single tweet, the system recognizes those as keywords tied to a specific amount of bitcoin.\n\nDaniel Palacio, founder of 2-factor authentication service Authy, points to ChangeTip as one of the few apps the bitcoin community has produced that, “already are very useful for lots of people.” The platform is “a great and fun way to send money to anyone,” he said, speaking to Fortune earlier this year.\n\nTyler Winklevoss, who along with his brother Cameron has been extremely bullish on bitcoin, said, “I think that’s such a cool application, the ability to tip a blogger, send them a coffee, make sure their work is appreciated. And it can truly only live inside bitcoin—that’s the kind of thing we need to see more of.”\n\nChangeTip is just one of many apps using SoundCloud’s public API, so the company declined to comment on this news.\n\nIt’s unlikely the ChangeTip button is going to lead Taylor Swift to post all her songs to SoundCloud. But for amateur artists seeking to build a fan base, this new functionality could be exciting.', 'Competition in the US bitcoin exchange market continued to escalate last week with the announcement by New York-based itBit that it would open to consumers in all 50 US states.\n\nThe decision comes amid a time when many US exchange market participants appear to be jostling for position ahead of the release of the final BitLicense regulatory framework this May. Coinbase launched its exchange product to customers in 24 states in January, while the Winklevoss Capital-backed Gemini intends for its launch to coincide with the release of the BitLicense.\n\nDespite the number of entrants competing for a small but burgeoning market, itBit CEO Charles Cascarilla is confident that his exchange has done enough to separate its product owing to its status as ""the only regulated entity in the entire bitcoin world"".\n\nAlong with its announcement that it raised $25m as part of its Series A, itBit revealed it had secured a banking charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).\n\nIn a new interview, Cascarilla cited the inability for other exchanges to offer regulatory assurance to large institutional investors as a competitive advantage that would set his firm apart, one that was hard fought, but won by following the rules.\n\nCascarilla told CoinDesk:\n\n""Mainstream adoption is not going to happen if you circumvent the financial system, you\'re going to have to be a participant in it. That doesn\'t mean bitcoin isn\'t disruptive. It is in important and very valuable ways, but that disruption will never be able to reach its full potential unless you\'re able to interface with the system.""\n\nIn this light, Cascarilla sought to position itBit as the beneficiary of a strategy that was set in place some 15 months ago when the company decided to obtain a trust charter, a compliance attribute he framed as necessary for any of its competitors.\n\n""Having a BitLicense will not allow you to operate an exchange in the state of New York,"" Cascarilla continued. ""The NYDFS, its view of the law is that you need to operate as a qualified custodian and they make that clear in their directives, a BitLicense doesn\'t make you a qualified custodian.""\n\nCascarilla further positioned itBit as a platform that he believes has the sound structure to compete on a global scale, boasting more than 40 employees and staff operating across time zones in Singapore and New York.\n\nChicken and egg\n\nOverall, Cascarilla framed itBit as the most immediate solution to bitcoin\'s challenge of gaining traction in what has been a largely unregulated market in the US, or at least one fraught with significant complexities.\n\nCascarilla acknowledged that there were other ways bitcoin service providers could become regulated, but argued that no matter which option a company chooses, the end result would be about accomplishing something that has been difficult – engendering market trust.\n\n""I think there\'s been a misunderstanding of what being regulated means, and I think that ultimately is where the rubber hits the road because financial institutions are willing to trade on you and feel comfortable with you and that\'s ultimately what matters,"" he said.\n\nShould each of itBit\'s current competitors in the exchange market achieve a similar goal, Cascarilla said he remains unworried about potential market competition, citing the fact that $5.5tn in foreign exchange (FX) transactions are completed daily.\n\n""I don\'t think bitcoin is a small opportunity set,"" he said.\n\nMoney transmission\n\nWhat may be most unique about itBit\'s approach is its decision not to attempt regulation under money transmission laws, a process that requires obtaining permission on a state-by-state basis.\n\n""You can get a money transmitting authority and to us that felt like the wrong way to do it because we\'re not a money transmitter, we\'re an exchange. We\'re not moving funds on behalf of our customers,"" Cascarilla said. ""If you deposit funds with us, you can only withdraw funds to yourself, you can\'t withdraw funds to anyone else or me.""\n\nCascarilla said that itBit intended to only operate as a custodian of customers funds, holding wallet accounts for users, making regulation under banking law more apt and appealing.\n\nStill, he framed the trust as a necessary component of this strategy, arguing that to run an exchange in New York, bitcoin companies would need to secure a trust. ""A BitLicense will not get you that,"" he said.\n\nAccording to Cascarilla, however, itBit will operate differently than banks in that it wouldn\'t be able to extend loans to users.\n\n""We\'re purely an agent, we\'re a custodian and fiduciary,"" he continued. ""There\'s a variety of exchanges and exchange clearing organizations that are organized as a New York trust and operate on a global basis using that charter.""\n\nExchange attributes\n\nThough Cascarilla framed regulation as a large part of itBit\'s competitive advantage, he suggested there were other factors that would make the company a compelling option for traders, including its international liquidity.\n\nOriginally launched in Singapore, itBit continues to operate in Asia, migrating to New York primarily as a means to secure its banking charter.\n\n""Right now our US dollar market share is between 4% to 5% but it is a liquidity pool that offers tight bid/ask spreads, as tight as any market, and our order book is one of the deepest in the bitcoin world,"" Cascarilla said.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs and Bank of America analyst continued, discussing itBit\'s financial information exchange (FIX) API and web API, which he argued allow it to appeal to both financial and more tech-savvy players.\n\n""This is all technology that we\'ve created and processes that we\'ve put into place that have been honed over the past 16 months, so that we\'ve been in a position to be a reliable counterparty to people who want to trade,"" he explained.\n\nCascarilla boasted that itBit is capable of handling volume that is ""orders of magnitude"" beyond its current trading levels.\n\nCalifornia controversy\n\nThough itBit has been confident in conveying its ability to operate in 50 US states, not every regulator has agreed with its interpretation of its mandate to serve consumers.\n\nCalifornia\'s Department of Business Oversight, for example, which is still debating its own licensing regime for bitcoin businesses, has suggested it is investigating itBit\'s claims.\n\nStill, Cascarilla argued that itBit\'s conclusion represents the opinion of tenured counsel, including former FDIC general counsel Michael Krimminger. As part of its recent funding announcement, itBit also announced an all-star cast of additions to its advisory including former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chairperson Sheila Bair and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley.\n\n""I think we\'re confident that as a New York exchange trust, not operating as a money transmitter, we\'re appropriately and able to operate in all 50 US states,"" he stated.\n\nCascarilla further indicated that obtaining a trust is ""not a new way of operating an exchange"", noting how Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), one of the world\'s largest exchanges, operates ICE US Trust, a New York-based trust company.\n\n""This is not a novel interpretation of how trust operates in the exchange world, it\'s an extremely time-honored one and one that is now being utilized,"" he stressed.\n\nStraight and narrow\n\nThough the timining of the launch may have come before the final BitLicense, Cascarilla suggested that itBit was not intending to cut corners with the launch.\n\n""This isn\'t something that we did because it was going to be faster, this is probably a slower route. This is certainly a more time-consuming route than going through a money a transmitter licensing or a BitLicense process,"" he said. ""But, I didn\'t think itBit could operate in the US without going this way.""\n\nGoing forward, itBit will continue to use its Singapore operations to serve international customers while its US customers will go through its New York trust. Both operations will share liquidity.\n\nThis, Cascarilla suggested, was the long-term goal set in motion by itBit last year, one that is now being actualized but that will give way to a more nuanced long-term strategy.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""We certainly have other projects that are in our sights in terms of how we want to expand the exchange over time and continue to offer new fresh products for our customers that allow them to interact in the world of bitcoin and to do it in a way that is safe and sound.""\n\nChess piece image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Polychemy, with the company’s focus on personalized products, puts the individual first, as “every product meticulously designed for each individual,” according to their website.\n\n“The Jewelry industry has always focused their efforts on brick & mortar stores,” Polychemy founder Aaron Issac told Cryptocoins News. “Selling online and ecommerce has not always been their priority. Many jewelry companies are still selling through traditional means and have poor online strategies.”\n\n“With more and more people purchasing jewelry online. It’s time the jewelry industry adapt with the evolving trends. E-commerce allows a level of interactivity that might not be possible in a retail outlet.”\n\nPolychemy allows customers to personalize their own rings and necklaces to their liking straight from a web browser. Customers can even view their customizations in real time 3D before purchasing them.\n\nThe company uses 3D printing and sophisticated software to design the pieces. The company also offers their own “couple’s ring”, as can be seen here.\n\nBy working with some of the best artists in the world on one-of-a-kind designs which marry fashion and technology, the company ensures that its products are special.\n\nFounded in 2012 in Singapore, Polychemy was the brainchild of a group of artists and programmers who wanted to create designs and accessories for the fashion and technology conscious consumer.\n\n25-year-old entrepreneur Issac founded Polychemy.

At least one customer has encrypted a Bitcoin wallet on the QR code pendant.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nIssac wants to Penetrate a Growing China E-commerce Industry\n\nLike many other entrepreneurs, Issac has his sights set on China’s growing e-commerce industry and 1.4 billion consumers — he expects Polychemy’s Chinese nameplate necklaces to be a hit.\n\n“We realized that there was [online] search traffic for name necklaces in other languages — Japanese, Korean, Chinese,” he said. “Most companies don’t do this because it’s too niche … but we can combine all the niches together and capture a lot of this market.”\n\nIssac is excited for the future of Polychemy.\n\n“We are really at the beginning,” he told CCN.\n\n“The technology we have developed here at polychemy really opens up a whole new world of design to us. I believe we will see more personalized designs & algorithmic/iterative designs. I am very excited for the future.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Euro Banking Association (EBA) has published two reports on Digital Customer Service Interfaces (DCSI) and crypto-technologies, with the intention of detailing the electronic payments landscape of the future. The reports have been announced at the EBAday payments conference in Amsterdam, Finextra reports.\n\nThe Euro Banking Association is a practitioners’ body for banks and other service providers supporting a pan-European vision for payments, with membership including more than 180 institutions from across Europe and beyond. Its mission is to provide payment professionals with a country-neutral forum for driving and contributing to the delivery of pan-European co-operative payment initiatives and business practices.\n\nThe reports, produced by the EBA’s Working Group on Electronic Alternative Payments (e-AP WG), are intended to help financial institutions (FIs) navigate the changing payments landscape. The publication of the EBA reports follows closely the EU Commission’s “Blockchain and Digital Currencies Workshop” on April 27.\n\nAccording to the EBA, digital currencies such as bitcoin or ripple have the ability to disrupt the payment and banking landscape and assist in the fight against cyber-criminals.\n\nThe opinion paper on Digital Customer Service Interfaces focuses in particular on a ‘virtual layer’ on top of the existing single euro payments area (SEPA) transfer and card payment infrastructure, referencing the EBA’s MyBank offering that is seeking to become a ‘one stop shop’ e-commerce transaction platform.\n\nThe crypto-technologies paper, titled “Cryptotechnologies, a major IT innovation and catalyst for change,” is an information paper for transaction banking and payments professionals. It details four categories (currencies, asset registry, application stack, asset centric), applications such as remittances and real-time payments and scenarios, and describes the respective potential for these different categories of applications to have a major short-term impact on the architecture of systems and processes in a number of digital transaction-based industries. It also details four use cases for the most promising category. It concludes by setting forth four different scenarios of how organizations in transaction banking and payments could position themselves with regard to these new technologies.\n\n“Cryptotechnologies are a key subject for further study for transaction banking and payment professionals, especially against the background of evolving financial infrastructures,” said Vincent Brennan, deputy chairman of the Euro Banking Association and chair of the EBA e-AP WG. “The information paper put together by the e-AP Working Group provides a hands-on introduction to this topic, which specifically focuses on the practical potential and related implications of cryptotechnologies for the transaction banking and payments area in the short to medium term.”\n\nThe four scenarios analyzed by the paper reflect different degrees (high and low) of cooperation between banks and the crypto-community, and crypto-adoption by banks. The four scenarios are dubbed:\n\n“Out in the cold” – the creation of a separate cryptoconomy.\n\n“First amongst equals” – an approach where individual payment service providers (PSPs) strive to position themselves as developers of cryptotechnology applications.\n\n“Awake and aware” – a collaborative approach based on constant dialogue and possible partnerships in selective areas.\n\n“United we stand” – a collaborative approach based on partnerships between PSPs and the cryptotechnology community embracing a successful integration of processes.\n\nFidor Bank, a bitcoin-friendly German bank that makes extensive use of social media, is presented as a technology innovator and an example of a bank that leverages the latest regulation to provide cryptotechnology-powered services to its customers.', ""For true devotees of Bitcoin, the price of the digital currency is almost irrelevant. They believe in its inherent value or, more frequently, cannot see any value at all in the alternative of government issued fiat currency. Price is therefore not a concern. At the other end of the spectrum, for those that harbor what appears to be an irrational hatred of Bitcoin and anything to do with it, the exchange rate also matters little. They were screaming that it was all worthless when the price was at over $1000, and somehow convince themselves that an exchange rate of over 200 times what it was before that bubble proves their point. For the vast majority of people somewhere in the middle, however, the price of the currency in Dollar, Euro, Yuan or whatever terms is important.\n\nMany hold out hope that over time Bitcoin will perform as it should in theory and become a store of value, while others simply cannot bear the thought of losing purchasing power in the short term. Even if their motivation for buying crypto-currency in the first place was convenience or just curiosity they can’t stop themselves looking at it as an investment. Whatever the reason, if you see Bitcoin purely as a currency, price matters.\n\nThere are other, more subtle ways in which price matters as well. At the start of this year I wrote that I expected Bitcoin, following a short continuation of volatility, to settle into a tighter range. In that respect it is no different to any other commodity or currency; volatility following a bubble is normal (think gold on the way down or, more recently the Euro) but eventually it subsides. The potential advantage that I saw then was that when that happened it was likely that at least one of the major companies toying with Bitcoin would commit fully, and begin keeping the coin received in payment rather than immediately converting to Dollars. Over the last couple of months we have experienced relative calm on the exchanges and while that transition hasn't happened yet, the calm has at least cut down on the number of uninformed “It’s all a scam!” stories in the mainstream media.\n\nThat in turn has probably been a contributing factor in two very important developments this quarter. Yesterday it was announced that the Princeton professor Ed Felten will join the White House Office of Science and Technology. Of course there is nothing new in a Princeton professor becoming a White House advisor, but this particular one is known to be somewhat “bitcoin friendly.” That probably had little to do with his appointment but it certainly won’t hurt to have somebody in the White House who both understands and appreciates Bitcoin and the technology surrounding it. If the price of Bitcoin hadn't stabilized to some degree, however, his association with the currency would probably have made the appointment less likely.\n\nSimilarly, some degree of stability also helps when academic institutions seek to expand their study of crypto currencies, and Bitcoin in particular. Is it likely that MIT would have been able to offer a home to three Bitcoin core developers if we were in the midst of a full on crash or another bubble-like spike? Given the politics that is ever present in academia, probably not. The fact that MIT has a Digital Currency Initiative at all should say a lot to Bitcoin’s critics, but the fact that its director Brian Forde thought it important to give these developers a place to continue their work after the Bitcoin Foundation ran out of funds speaks volumes.\n\nLike it or not, if Bitcoin is to really fulfill its potential, it has to achieve some degree of mainstream acceptance. The events of the last few months have shown that that is far more likely if the price is at least relatively stable. If for no other reason than that, whatever those on the extremes may say, price does matter."", 'Despite several setbacks, the bitcoin industry is continuing to grow across the world as people in more countries take notice of the digital currency\'s benefits.\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency is still far from becoming a mainstream payment method, European regulators are beginning to follow in the footsteps of the Bank of England by planning ahead and evaluating how to integrate the cryptocurrency into the region\'s financial system.\n\nEBA Review\n\nOn Monday, the European Banking Association issued a report detailing its findings on the use of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe report stated that, although bitcoin still has a long way to go before it can be considered a viable currency, digital currencies are an important issue worth paying attention to in the future.\n\nRelated Link: NASDAQ Interested In Blockchain\n\nBlockchain As A Viable Opportunity\n\nThe EBA acknowledged that despite bitcoin\'s volatility and security concerns, the technology that powers it could be applied to several different industries to improve their operations.\n\nThe report commended blockchain\'s ability to make processes faster and simpler, saying that it would be useful in fields like IT and contract law.\n\nMore Bitcoin Exposure\n\nShortly after the EBA\'s release, bitcoin platform Coinify announced that it was expanding throughout the eurozone to allow 34 European countries to buy and sell bitcoins.\n\nCoinify is using the Single Euro Payments Area, or the bloc\'s payment integration scheme, in order to carry out the expansion.\n\nRelated Link: ItBit Became The First Cryptocurrency Exchange To Receive A Banking License\n\nMaking Europe Part Of The Digital Payment Revolution\n\nCoinify\'s expansion is expected to put Europe in a position to take advantage of the growing popularity of digital currencies.

Onename plans on eventually using it as a sort of digital key to your identity, potentially replacing passwords, the keys to your house and even your passport.\n\nOnename takes advantage of Bitcoin’s distributed ledger, the blockchain, which is used to record and verify bitcoin transactions. It is what enables the digital currency to properly function and can also be used to record any kind of information in a public ledger.\n\n“Passcards are a digital form of identity and access control designed to initially replace passwords, and in the future, replace forms of physical identification like passports and driver’s licenses. You’ll be able to use it to enter your apartment or your office and when asked to present identification in an in-person context. The future of identity is here,” read the company’s blog post.\n\nYour access to everything\n\nPasscards will expand upon the company’s earlier blockchain identity product, which was just a onename.io-hosted profile, by creating a fuller identity, allowing users to post their Passcard on websites, such as a blog or company website.\n\nThe move in is preparation of enabling blockchain profiles to be used to log into websites and apps. That will give the product its first real use case and actual utility.\n\n“Currently, passwords help you access your online life just like your wallet and keys help you access your physical life. At a high level, passwords, identity cards, and keys are all forms of access control. Want to enter a bar? Show an identity card that says that you’re over 21. Want to access your Twitter account? Login with the username/password that you used to signup. Want to enter your home? Use the key that unlocks the door,” read a public statement.\n\nPasscard can be seen in use on the blog of Onename investor Fred Wilson and the team page of decentralized marketplace project OpenBazaar. To get your own passcard, you can sign up at a registrar such as Onename.io or Namecoin.info. Onename also created Passcard.info, which serves as a portal for the new product and hosts a list of registrars.\n\nPasscard uses a technology called Blockchain Name System (BNS), formerly called Onename, which, according to the company’s founders, Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea, is similar to Domain Name System (DNS), but offers more security as there are “no trusted third parties or servers.”\n\nThe startup will be announcing more about BNS and will launch the app login feature soon.\n\nOnename was founded in March 2014. The company raised a $1.5 million seed round from Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, Fred Wilson through Union Square Ventures, AngelList CEO and co-founder Naval Ravikant and investment firm SV Angel.', ""A curious user recently asked members of the Bitcoin subreddit how they spend their bitcoins on an everyday basis. Because Reddit is a global community, it's likely that their responses are reflective of overall patterns.\n\nHere's how the bits are flowing today:\n\n1. Coffee and Food Delivery – Couture coffee got a whole lot cheaper the day that Foldapp started offering 20% off Starbucks purchases. Redditors also use bitcoins for food delivery services like Foodler, Magic and Thuisbezorgd (Netherlands).\n\nWord on the street is that Foldapp will soon add both Whole Foods and Target to its 20 % off list, making grocery store food as bitcoin-friendly as restaurant food.\n\n2. Electronics and Phone Bills – Electronics retailers were among the first merchants to accept bitcoin. AdaFruit, Newegg, TigerDirect, Dell and FastTech are just a few.\n\nRedditors also pay their phone bills with bitcoins using BitRefill or Neteller (the bitcoins-to-Mastercard service).\n\n3. Overstock, Rakuten and Amazon – These online big-box stores substantially expand what's available for bitcoin. Overstock and Rakuten accept the cryptocurrency directly, while redditors use Purse.io to order through Amazon at a discount.\n\n4. Flights and Hotels – AirBaltic accepts bitcoins directly for flights. Otherwise, flights on any major airline can be purchased through BTCTrip or Cheapair.\n\nRedditors also use both Expedia and Cheapair to book hotel rooms.\n\n5. Poker and Betting – One of bitcoin's first major uses was in online betting. Primedice, Seals with Clubs, and BitDice are among redditors' favorites. Betting and gaming have fused together with Leetcoin, where players wager on the outcomes of their League of Legends and Counter-Strike games.\n\n6. Gyft and eGifter – Hundreds of retailers become accessible when you turn bitcoins into gift cards. Gyft and eGifter are used by redditors to purchase eBay, Groupon, and even American Airline gift cards. Both companies offer 3% back on all purchases.\n\n7. Gaming – Xbox, Steam, Twitch.tv, and Eve Time Code games are among redditors' favorites. Discounts are frequently offered for purchases made in bitcoin.\n\n8. Charity and Tipping – ChangeTip supports tipping on ten social networks: YouTube, Reddit, Disqus, and Twitter are among them. Redditors also report making donations to Wikipedia, Red Cross, Edward Snowden, AntiWar, and relief efforts such as the Nepal Great Quake.\n\n9. Precious Metals – Sound money begets sound money, so many crypto users like their gold and silver, too. There are numerous ways to not only purchase physical metals for bitcoin, but to hold and trade them remotely, too.\n\n10. Website Services and VPNs – Namecheap and DirectNic both offer domain name registration and website hosting for bitcoin. Redditors also report that they regularly purchase VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) from companies like Boleh, Mullvad, and Private Internet Access.\n\nAside from dropping their bits on the above options, many redditors also report saving the majority of their holdings. Lifestyle funding, retirement, and big purchases (like a Tesla Model S) were reported as the primary goals of saving.\n\nHow do you spend your bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies? Share below.""]"

But The BitGive Foundation, which describes itself as the world’s first Bitcoin nonprofit, turns this stereotype directly on its head.\n\nThe organization partners with nonprofits like Save The Children and The Water Project, explains founder and executive director, Connie Gallippi, and harnesses Bitcoin’s benefits -- namely cheaper, faster and more secure transactions -- in order to raise charitable funds.\n\nIn March, BitGive unveiled a water well at a girls’ school in Western Kenya funded entirely with $11,000 in Bitcoin donations culled from members of the Bitcoin community. The well serves 500 Kenyans who wouldn’t otherwise have access to water, says Gallippi, who spoke to Entrepreneur at this year’s Inside Bitcoins conference in New York City. “It has made a huge impact.”\n\nFor more from Gallippi about the altruistic prospects of the cryptocurrency, check out this short video.\n\nRelated: New York Just Issued Its First-Ever Bitcoin Banking License', 'Coinify, a Danish bitcoin exchange and bitcoin payment processing platform is expanding its platform to all 36 EU member states under the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) including Monaco, Malta, Iceland and Croatia.\n\nThe SEPA project was initiated in February of 2014, with an aim to make cross-border Euro transfers equivalent to a domestic transfer in a country. Exact description of the project is “To improve the efficiency of cross-border payments and turn the fragmented national markets for euro payments into a single domestic one.”\n\nCoinify plans to expand its services to the countries under the SEPA project to make it even cheaper for those needing to make cross-border remittances/transfers, with 0% transaction fees.\n\nThe Danish bitcoin startup completed an early multi-million seed funding led by SEED Capital, the largest tech-focused VC firm in the nation, hoping to be the leading bitcoin startup in Denmark’s cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe investment from SEED Capital and Accelerance allowed Coinify to acquire one of the earliest European bitcoin exchange, Bitcoin Broker Bitcoin Nordic. Due to the acquisition, the bitcoin exchange of Bitcoin Nordic began to operate as a core service of Coinify, with the founder Lasse Birk Olesen appointed as the Chief Product Officer.\n\nCoinify later acquired the intellectual properties and all merchant relationships of one of the largest payment solution providers and payment gateway developer within Europe, Bitcoin Internet Payment System. Kris Henriksen, founder of Bitcoin Internet Payment System, said the company will now focus on technological innovations.\n\nPrior to the funding led by SEED Capital, Coinify was supporting more than 6,000 merchants and 7,000 just from Europe. Moreover, Coinify’s exchange satisfied over 7,000 European users.\n\nWith their bitcoin exchange and merchant services solidified, Coinify began to grow its platform and targeted markets including Sweden, the UK, Norway and Denmark and to establish their presence throughout the European region. Coinify specifically targeted Germany and the UK, due to the countries’ large e-commerce markets.\n\nAs of now, Coinify plans to seek for investments in the second half of 2015, as Chief Financial Officer Christian Larson stated “We expect to raise a significant amount to make sure that Europe will be playing a leading role in this new payment space. We believe that our strategy on providing the traditional payment service providers with dedicated service is our way in to the market.”\n\nAs Coinify expands its service to 36 European countries listed under SEPA, the bitcoin startup hopes to see an increase of trading volume in their exchange and to facilitate more individuals to send cross-border payments throughout Europe.', 'May 14, 2015 | By Alec\n\nThe necklace with a QR code ingraved on one side.\n\nWhile we here at 3ders regularly come across beautiful and original 3D printed jewelry that seeks to redefine the jewelry industry itself, we rarely see necklaces or rings that are given a whole new function. But that’s exactly what Singapore-based jewelry designers Polymchemy have done, and I’m not just talking about a ring that also functions as a bottle opener. Instead, they have brought 21rst century technology into the jewelry world by using 3D printing to engrave necklaces with Bitcoin addresses. Effectively, this turns these necklaces into Bitcoin wallets or debit cards, that can be scanned to make a payment.\n\nThis very cool feature fits perfectly with the goals of this young, but exciting team of jewelry designers. Founded in 2012 in Singapore by a group of artists and programmers, their goal has always been to design cool accessories for fashion and technology conscious consumers. Marrying style and technology has thus basically become their signature work. As the young founder Aaron Issac told reporters, ‘The Jewelry industry has always focused their efforts on brick & mortar stores,’ he says. ‘Selling online and ecommerce has not always been their priority. Many jewelry companies are still selling through traditional means and have poor online strategies. With more and more people purchasing jewelry online, it’s time the jewelry industry adapt with the evolving trends.’ And what’s more fashionable than bitcoins?\n\nJust an example of what Polychemy does: rings with custom names or words engraved on them\n\nThese bitcoin QR codes are thus effectively just the result of the highly customizable design process Polychemy has perfected over the years. In a nutshell, the key is to ensure that every product they sell has been meticulously designed to suit to wearer’s preferences. When ordering, customers can even personalize their own jewelry straight in the web browser, and see the results in real time 3D before completing the order. Customers can choose from a whole selection of premade jewelry and customize metals, colors, gems, and even texts.\n\nAs you might expect, 3D printing plays a key role in transforming those personal touches to the real thing. Polychemy turns to 3D files into 3D printed wax molds, which are used to cast the metal (and jems) into. ‘The technology we have developed here at polychemy really opens up a whole new world of design to us. I believe we will see more personalized designs & algorithmic/iterative designs. I am very excited for the future,’ Issac says.\n\nA ring with custom braille.\n\nIn that respect storing data, through URLs or QR codes, was the logical next step. Theoretically, this means they can turn any accessory into a scanable container of data, such as a link to your Bitcoin account. ‘Polychemy QR Code Necklaces allows our customers to engrave any-type of QR code data unto the surface of the pendant.

The report discusses how Bitcoin ATMs are used and how the various ways in which they can be used may or may not be considered “money transmitting” under international standards. Translated from German, the report reads:"", 'Xapo has officially relocated its corporate headquarters to Zurich, Switzerland, citing the country\'s long history of neutrality and stability.\n\nThe bitcoin services and security firm said the transition was put in motion three months ago at the request of customers, and that now, Xapo\'s operations in Palo Alto are in the process of being reduced. As part of the transition, Xapo will hire new finance and legal staff in the central European nation while still keeping a small US presence.\n\nIn interview, Xapo CEO Wences Casares sought to position the move as one that would appeal to customers who remain worried about oversight of their bitcoin holdings and transactions.\n\nXapo indicated that its company representatives would now face potential fines and prison time for revealing customer information without consent in all but select circumstances.\n\nCasares told CoinDesk:\n\n""This is not to facilitate crime, this is to protect privacy. There are some customers that will bring more balances if we do this and there are some customers who have said we will work with you if you do this.""\n\nCasares said that previous attempts by the company to associate with Switzerland were perhaps not enough to encourage these customers. Xapo moved its deep cold storage vault servers to an unspecified location in the European nation in January, but continued to face pressure from customers for more privacy guarantees, Casares said.\n\n""We decided to do what they had been asking us to do for a while, move our main company to Switzerland and benefit from the safeguards,"" Casares explained.\n\nCommitment to security\n\nWhile Casares suggested that Xapo was primarily interested in promoting user privacy, he noted that the company must still follow Swiss law. This includes monitoring transactions for potential money laundering, illegal transactions and terrorist financing.\n\n""If we cannot prove who you are, we won\'t open an account for you, and if you do anything that looks suspicious, we will report you,"" Casares said.\n\nStill, Casares indicated that Xapo\'s customers are most often using its accounts primarily for storage and security. He noted that many of its clientele have ""never made a bitcoin payment"", meaning its holdings are primarily long-term bets of high net-worth customers and family offices.\n\n""Ninety-six percent of the coins that we hold in custody are in the hands of people who are keeping those coins as an investment,"" Casares continued.\n\nThe move to Switzerland will not coincide with any significant technical upgrades to Xapo\'s vault storage offering, which would still utilize security practices such as multisig and offline private key generation.\n\nPiggy bank image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Following the multi-million dollar funding round, the Bitcoin startup plans to expand throughout Europe and introduce tier-one financial services to connect traditional regulated financial markets to the “blockchain economy.”\n\nManaging Partner at White Star Capital, Eric Martineau-Fortin, explained that the investment into Cryex will allow the Bitcoin startup to pull “financial institutions into the digital currency ecosystem.”\n\nMartineau-Fortin showed strong enthusiasm for Cryex’s experienced financial industry team, with banking and exchange executives and investment and asset management veterans. He stated:\n\n“We are delighted to be involved in delivering a truly innovative solution where Blockchain technology meets tier one exchange and clearing technology in a regulated environment, finally attracting financial institutions into the digital currencies ecosystem.”\n\nSimon Nathanson, Chairman of Cryex Clearing AB, explained, “Cryex has a unique model to clearing and settlement and has all the necessary components in place; financial-grade architecture and technology partners, a seasoned team and a number of high profile strategic investors from the financial sector.”\n\nAlthough the “new blockchain product” expected to connect traditional regulated financial markets with blockchain “economy” has not yet been released, Cryex explains that the new product will allow “regulated market participants” to trade derivative products in a highly secure and regulated environment.\n\nPär-Jörgen Pärson from Northzone added, “CRYEX will transform crypto currencies from small, unconnected niche markets into a full monetary ecosystem and settlement network.”\n\nBitcoin Startups Expanding Across Europe\n\nWith the investment, Cryex plans to compete with the well-established Bitcoin startups including Coinbase, Safello, Coinzone and Bitpay.\n\nCoinbase, Safello and Coinzone have all expanded throughout Europe in 2015, to support European merchants and to provide each European country with specific features, including local bank support and the ability to deposit or withdraw via bank wiring.\n\nCoinzone, Coinbase and Safello\n\nIn an attempt to expand its service all throughout Europe, Bitcoin payment gateway and mobile point-of-sale solution provider Coinzone launched a bitcoin wallet for its European customers and merchants for both mobile platforms and web browsers. The wallet is just a simple bitcoin wallet with country specific features which allows users to deposit or withdraw through the local banks.\n\nIn April of 2015, Coinbase expanded its services to the UK to allow users based in the UK to trade on Coinbase exchange and to buy and sell BTCs with GBP in the Coinbase wallet.\n\nAlong with the UK-specific features, Coinbase also allowed its users to credit euros via SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area), British pounds and U.S. dollars (via wire transfer) to purchase BTCs using the Coinbase wallet or to trade on the Coinbase exchange.\n\nIn January of 2015, Swedish bitcoin exchange Safello, backed by Eric Voorhees and Roger Ver, expanded its exchange to Norway and Denmark, with local bank transfers to allow Norwegian users to deposit or withdraw through local banks. Safello entered the Norwegian digital currency market after DNB, Norway’s largest financial institution pulled its support of the country’s largest exchange JustCoin, forcing it to shut down operations. Safello launched its services in Norway to fill this gap.\n\nWith many of the well-established Bitcoin startups including Safello, Coinbase and Coinzone expanding throughout Europe, Cryex plans to join the competition by connecting the traditional regulated financial markets with the “blockchain economy,” and also expand into Europe. Although the platform hasn’t been released yet, Cryex will allow users to trade derivative products, which Pärson believes will transform cryptocurrencies from small, unconnected niche markets into a full monetary ecosystem and settlement network.', ""The newly patched “Venom” vulnerability in virtualization software is “perfect” for any organization targeting bitcoin wallets, private keys and forum passwords, according to Robert Graham, chief executive officer of security firm Errata.\n\nResearchers first discovered the bug through the security firm CrowdStrike, which described Venom as a security vulnerability in the virtual floppy drive code used by computer virtualization platforms. They said:\n\n“This vulnerability may allow an attacker to escape from the confines of an affected virtual machine (VM) guest and potentially obtain code-execution access to the host.” “Absent mitigation, this VM escape could open access to the host system and all other VMs running on that host, potentially giving adversaries significant elevated access to the host’s local network and adjacent systems.”\n\nCrowdStrike went on to say that the Venom vulnerability could expose access to corporate intellectual property (IP), as well as personal information, potentially impacting the ”thousands of organizations and millions of end users that rely on affected VMs for the allocation of shared computing resources, as well as connectivity, storage, security, and privacy”.\n\nGraham said the now patched bug was a menace, as attackers would find it easy to exploit, often to lucrative effect. He said it would be a “perfect” bug for an organization such as the National Security Agency (NSA):\n\n“This is a hypervisor privilege escalation bug. To exploit this, you'd sign up with one of the zillions of VPS [virtual private server] providers and get a Linux instance. You'd then, likely, replace the floppy driver in the Linux kernel with a custom driver that exploits this bug. You have root access to your own kernel, of course, which you are going to escalate to root access of the hypervisor. “Once you gained control of the host, you'd then of course gain access to any of the other instances. This would be a perfect bug for the NSA. Bitcoin wallets, RSA private keys, forum passwords, and the like are easily found searching raw memory. Once you've popped the host, reading memory of other hosted virtual machines is undetectable.”\n\nGraham said it was possible the NSA could buy multiple US$10 VPS instances around the world for US$100K before running the search.\n\n“All sorts of great information would fall out of such an effort -- you'd probably make your money back from discovered Bitcoin alone,” he said."", 'The 250 million immigrants scattered around the globe will send an estimated $586 billion to their countries of origin in 2015, in the largest and most effective foreign aid program ever conceived. All told, 8 percent of that massive flow of cash, or a staggering $47 billion dollars, will go to pay the fees of firms like Western Union and MoneyGram. Immigrants from the poorest countries pay the most because they\'re sending money to places that don\'t have functional banking systems.\n\nTech entrepreneur Bill Barhydt (pronounced ""BAR-hite"") has an innovative plan to use Bitcoin to slash the cost of sending money to Third World countries. Last summer, he started a company called Abra to put his ideas into action. Several other firms are trying to do the same thing—there are 27 Bitcoin remittance startups by one count—but Barhydt\'s venture is especially promising.\n\nBitcoin, a system of digital currency, has the potential to take the friction out of sending money abroad, but delivering on that potential isn\'t easy. A conventional money transfer carried out by a bank is a complicated process that take days to complete; Bitcoin utilizes a cryptographically secure ledger called a blockchain that\'s virtually free to use and clears transactions within minutes. And it\'s converging with another major trend in technology: In five years, an estimated 80 percent of the world\'s adults will own a smartphone, allowing them to send and receive digital money without a traditional bank account. Just as cell phones leapfrogged landlines, Bitcoin and smartphones together could make traditional banking networks unnecessary.\n\nBut how do you graft Bitcoin onto the mess of a global monetary system that currently exists?\n\nIn theory, a Bitcoin remittance system would be as simple as an immigrant in the U.S. using his smartphone to instantly transfer Bitcoin to his wife\'s smartphone in Mexico. The problem is that most of the world\'s poor deal in cash, and they\'re far too savvy to store what little money they have in a highly volatile digital asset that most people have never heard of.\n\nBarhydt set out to build a mobile Bitcoin wallet that addresses these problems. His first goal was to make it so that Abra users don\'t need to know what Bitcoin is. So when the Abra app is open, all a user sees on the screen is the current value of his Bitcoin account denominated in local currency. That\'s the easy part; the real trick is keeping that account balance perfectly stable even as the price of Bitcoin goes up and down.\n\nHow does Abra accomplish this? By selling the risk of a price fluctuation to third-party speculators through a classic maneuver known in the commodity futures and options markets as hedging. If the screen in the Abra app says the account balance is $200, that means the Abra user has locked in a price of $200 for his bitcoins, in much the same way a holder of crude oil locks in a price through hedging. The company is partnering with a derivatives company (Barhydt won\'t name the firm) that will make these hedges available to Abra users.\n\nThis asset portfolio—a mix of bitcoins and hedges—is tucked under the hood of the smartphone, and a user never needs to know what\'s in his portfolios. All he or she sees on the screen is the total account value. The goal is utter simplicity. ""If I were Prada and I were designing a mobile cash wallet, Abra is what it would look like,"" says Barhydt.\n\nNow comes the really hard part. Recipients of the funds at the other end need a convenient way to withdraw cash from the Abra app. But building a comprehensive network of bricks-and-mortar exchanges is prohibitively expensive.\n\n""I had been pooh-poohing a lot of Bitcoin remittance services because they don\'t know how to address the last mile problem,"" says Barhydt. After observing the success of sharing economy firms like Uber and Airbnb, he came up with an idea.\n\nBarhydt is building a peer-to-peer network of independent ""human ATMs,"" as he calls them. Here\'s how it works: Let\'s say a woman in the U.S. wants to send $50 to her brother in the Philippines. First, she buys $50 in the app using her debit card, and then transfers the money to her brother\'s Abra wallet. After receiving the funds, the brother opens the app and pulls up a map that shows the location of the closest Abra teller.\n\nThe brother and the Abra teller meet in person, and the teller scans a QR code off the brother\'s phone, which transfers $50 to his Abra wallet. In exchange, the teller gives the brother cash on the spot minus a fee that Barhydt says will be significantly lower than the 8 percent a traditional money transfer service would collect. If the teller charges a 3 percent fee, in this case he would pocket $1.50. (Watch Bill Barhydt give a demo of Abra at the Launch Festival Awards in March.)\n\nTo get these local networks up and running, Barhydt is reaching out to delivery services, taxi companies, mobile airtime resellers, and other existing outfits that already handle lots of cash in his target countries. But anyone with the Abra app installed and cash on hand can serve as a teller.\n\nLuis Buenaventura, the founder and CEO of Rebit, a Bitcoin remittance service based in the Philippines, says he\'s doubtful that a fee of around 2 or 3 percent will be enough to entice people to participate in the Abra network. Earning enough to get by on such a low fee requires processing lots of transactions, but Abra distributes the exchange business among many individuals. ""The remittance industry tends to benefit more from consolidation than from diffusion,"" Buenaventura says. (Buenaventura has spent the last year building a centralized Bitcoin exchange in the Philippines.)\n\nBarhydt counters that Buenaventura doesn\'t appreciate the fact that mom and pop stores in all-cash economies earn a living by recycling the same currency over and over again for different services. ""If they sell a bottle of Coke and then use that money to process a withdrawal, they\'ve profited on that same cash twice,"" he says. Or an Abra teller might process a stream of deposits and withdrawals in a single day, earning 3 percent twice by paying in and out the very same cash. While international remittances tend to flow one direction from the First World to the Third, Barhydt hopes his product will also catch on as a local payment system.\n\nAbra also provides a way for small businesses to earn money doing something they otherwise might pay for: converting the cash they accumulate into digital form. If the Abra network scales, a grocery store owner could potentially keep his money in Abra, using his wallet balance to pay rent or restock his shelves. But what if at the end of the day he wants to exit the system and convert the money he\'s collected to local currency? Barhydt says Abra is ""aggregating every Bitcoin exchange in the world into a single network"" so a user will be able to trade his wallet balance for local currency within the app and deposit it into a traditional bank account.\n\nThroughout this process, Abra never touches customers\' money. Its system is entirely peer-to-peer, as if the equivalent of a fully functioning branch of Western Union were jammed into the phone itself.\n\nWhy is Abra designed this way? Primarily so the company can avoid dealing with the maddeningly complex regulatory system for remittance firms in the United States. Forty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and three territories issue their own money transmitter licenses, meaning companies have to deal with 51 different government agencies before they\'re allowed to accept money transfers anywhere in the country. Each state has its own application processes with different requirements, timetables, and fee schedules. Remittance firms also have to comply with federal regulations imposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen).\n\nThis regulatory maze is making life very difficult for Bitcoin entrepreneurs. Megan Burton, CEO and founder of the Bitcoin exchange CoinX, revealed at a public hearing last year that some of her company\'s state money transmitter applications had been pending for over a year. ""We\'re unable to determine the path forward, as it\'s not a clear process,"" she said. In some states, the highest profile ventures get special treatment. ""If you’re a $100 million funded company, your license will come screaming through the door,"" says Faisal Khan, a banking and payments consultant.\n\nBut even the best funded cryptocurrency startups are struggling with this process. Fred Ehrsam, the cofounder of the leading Bitcoin wallet company Coinbase, recently revealed that his company has spent two years and $2 million navigating the money transmitter rules in just half the states.\n\nBarhydt says because Abra is a software company that never touches its customers\' money, it won\'t need to bother with state money transmitter licenses, FinCen, the CFPB—or the BitLicense, which is yet another regulatory regime that will soon be in place in New York State. ""If there\'s no middleman, there\'s no one to regulate,"" he says.\n\nJudith Rinearson, a partner at the law firm Bryan Cave who specializes in payment technologies, says Abra\'s approach is ""clever,"" but that regulators ""will find a way,"" even if it means creating a totally new framework. Attorney Amor Sexton, an Australia-based attorney and the global strategy director for the Bitcoin exchange network Igot.com, agrees with Rinearson. ""None of these laws were written for peer-to-peer transactions, and the big question is can you apply existing frameworks to a completely distributed model?"" she says. The bottom line is that ""at the end of the day, somebody is going to regulate it.""\n\nBarhydt says we should all fear a scenario in which the government attempts such regulatory overreach.\n\nAbra has raised $2.4 million in seed funding to date, and it aims to launch by the end of the summer. In March, the Mountain View, California-based company won the Launch Festival Awards, a prestigious annual competition for tech startups. ""It\'s a fantastic app from a technology perspective,"" says attorney Amor Sexton. ""Finally someone has figured out how to use Bitcoin in real life,"" the hosts of the TechCraft Podcast said in a recent discussion of the technology.\n\n""Bill Barhydt is the sort of person you want to bet on,"" says Brock Pierce, a managing partner at Blockchain Capital. Pierce says he\'s ""highly interested"" in participating in the company\'s second round of financing.\n\nBy taking a peer-to-peer approach to payments, Abra faces another potential hazard: Its success could be its undoing. Barhydt\'s system of human ATMs and derivative portfolios to stabilize the value of its users\' wallets are just a bridge between the fiat money system and a future world in which Bitcoin is a widely accepted digital currency for buying goods and services. Integrating Bitcoin into today\'s global monetary system is a messy task, but if Bitcoin becomes ubiquitous, all that messiness would be erased.\n\nIn the company\'s second phase, Barhydt anticipates allowing users to make purchases online directly from their wallets, instead of going through a credit card company that charges high interchange fees. At that point, why not just use Bitcoin? A scenario in which Bitcoin becomes widely adopted in a developing country isn\'t so far fetched. In Kenya, for example, it would replace M-Pesa, a system of using mobile phone minutes as digital currency, which has fast become the primary way that Kenyans pay for goods and services in the absence of a viable banking sector.\n\nAbra is perhaps best understood in the context of the brewing battle between Bitcoin, which is an open system for digital money that nobody controls, and closed systems owned and operated by large firms. Mobile phones, encryption, and near field communication, among other technologies, will change the way consumers pay for things over the next few years. Silicon-Valley heavyweights like Apple, Facebook, and Paypal are refining their own proprietary payment networks. In the Third World, M-Pesa was launched by the cellphone provider Safaricom, and its impoverished customers pay significant fees to use its network.\n\nThis world\'s poorest people will benefit the most from Bitcoin because they\'ll save a fortune in fees and end up with a decentralized banking system that\'s far superior to what\'s currently in place in the First World. That\'s why we should all be cheering for the success of ventures like Abra.', 'The World Table, a startup company in Orem, Utah, is building a quantified reputation system to aggregate reputation data and report trust scores for individuals and organizations. The system is built upon Open Reputation, an open source decentralized reputation platform under development, sponsored by The World Table, which maps identity and reputation onto the Internet-of-things (IoT).\n\nThe Open Reputation concept is open and flexible, able to accommodate diverse applications and usage patterns, from user reputation and “karma” in online discussion spaces to automatic reputation-based agreements between agents in IoT networks of independent connected devices. Open Reputation models a universe of relations between entities and agents, anything in the IoT, each of which has an identity and may have a reputation. The initial Open Reputation source code is expected to be available before the end of 2015.\n\n“Everyone and everything [in the reputation web] will have at least a public pseudonymous identity, created at the moment of interaction with any other part of the web,” states the Open Reputation High Level Whitepaper. “Everyone and everything may also have an encrypted shareable reputation, reflecting each of its transactions with any other part of the web. Some will choose to aggregate and share more reputation. Others will choose less. And our trust will flow accordingly.”\n\nThe High Level Whitepaper mentions a wide range of use cases. Software companies could improve virus and spam detection, web content filtering and software updates, as well as Internet commenting, reviewing, sharing and advertising. Electronics companies could make fully autonomous systems that contract for their own maintenance and supplies. Social and financial qualifications could merge into a reputation economy that improves renting, sharing, purchasing, lending, insuring, interviewing and dating. Biotech firms could enhance big data projects with behavioral correlations. Governments could facilitate administration of voting and social services.\n\nIdentities, reputations, and relations persist in a decentralized public database anchored to a decentralized public ledger – the Open Reputation blockchain – both of which compensate participants via a cryptocurrency dubbed Cred. The Open Reputation platform uses a Byzantine agreement algorithm, detailed in the Open Reputation Low Level Whitepaper, to maintain consensus across hosts while supporting higher transaction rates than legacy blockchains. Cred tokens, which, according to the World Table team, will be exchangeable like other cryptocurrencies, will be paid by agents who perform transactions and earned by operators of computers that process the transactions and store related data.\n\nThe first product built on the Open Reputation platform will be a comment system for major media sites that will increase the quality of online engagement, boost ad revenues, and create brand lift.\n\n“When our reputations are on the line, most of us choose to behave better – and that also happens to translate into more valuable web properties,” said World Table CTO and EVP of products Lincoln Cannon. The company’s pilot programs showed dramatic increases in “good” behavior when people understood that they were being assessed by their peers. The company describes this feedback model as “adding trust to the Internet.”\n\n“With this announcement, we’re making it clear that a whole class of online interactions are due for a major upgrade,” said World Table CEO Bryan Hall. Patheos, one of the 200 largest content sites in the United States, is expected to begin testing the product in July. When fully deployed, The World Table comment system will be embedded in 20 million page views per month at Patheos alone.\n\n“We’re creating an open-source platform so we can all see and understand how reputations are being formed from the data stream, and we’re using a blockchain architecture to ensure that trust is distributed,” added Cannon. “No central authority will have control over the information used to create your reputation.”\n\nThe World Table, which has raised approximately $700,000 to date, is about to launch a seed financing offering for an additional $1.3 million on Angel List.']"
05/15/2015,"[""It may be impossible to prove Satoshi’s identity until the person or people behind Bitcoin’s curtain decide to come forward and prove ownership of Satoshi’s old electronic accounts. At this point, the creator’s identity is no longer important to Bitcoin’s future. Since Satoshi stopped contributing to the project in 2011, most of the open-source code has been rewritten by a group of programmers whose identities are known.\n\nBut Mr. Szabo’s story provides insight into often misunderstood elements of Bitcoin’s creation. The software was not a bolt out of the blue, as is sometimes assumed, but was instead built on the ideas of multiple people over several decades.\n\nThis history is more than just a matter of curiosity. The software has come to be viewed in academic and financial circles as a significant computer science breakthrough that may reshape the way money looks and moves. Recently, banks like Goldman Sachs have taken the first steps toward embracing the technology.\n\nMr. Szabo himself has continued to be quietly involved in the work. In the beginning of 2014, Mr. Szabo joined Vaurum, a Bitcoin start-up based in Palo Alto, Calif., that was operating in stealth mode and that aimed to build a better Bitcoin exchange. After his arrival, Mr. Szabo helped reorient the company to take advantage of the Bitcoin software’s capability for so-called smart contracts, which enable self-executing financial transactions, according to people briefed on the company’s operations who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAfter Mr. Szabo led the company in a new direction, it was renamed Mirror, and it recently raised $12.5 million from several prominent venture capitalists, these people said. The company declined to comment for this article.\n\nMr. Szabo’s role at Vaurum has been kept a secret because of his desire for privacy, and he left in late 2014 after becoming nervous about public exposure, according to the people briefed on the company’s operations. While he was still there, though, the array of arcane skills and knowledge at his command led several colleagues to conclude that Mr. Szabo was most likely involved in the creation of Bitcoin, even if he didn’t do it all himself.\n\nI met Mr. Szabo, a large bearded man, in March 2014 at a Bitcoin event at the Lake Tahoe vacation home of Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs executive who now runs a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, Pantera Capital. Mr. Szabo worked for Vaurum at the time. Mr. Morehead and other hedge fund executives in attendance dressed in expensive loafers and slim-cut jeans; Mr. Szabo, his bald pate encircled by a ring of salt-and-pepper hair, wore beat-up black sneakers and an untucked striped shirt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile he kept to himself, I managed to corner him in the kitchen during the cocktail hour. He was notably reserved and deflected questions about where he lived and had worked, but he bristled when I cited what was being said about him on the Internet — including that he was a law professor at George Washington University — and the notion that he had created Bitcoin.\n\n“Well, I will say this, in the hope of setting the record straight,” he said acidly. “I’m not Satoshi, and I’m not a college professor. In fact, I never was a college professor.”\n\nThe conversation grew less heated when I asked about the origin of the many complicated pieces of code and cryptography that went into the Bitcoin software, and about the small number of people who would have had the expertise to put them together. Mr. Szabo mentioned bit gold, saying it harnessed many of the same obscure concepts, like secure property titles and digital time stamps, that made Bitcoin possible.\n\n“There are a whole bunch of parallels,” he told me. “I mean, the reason people tag me is because you can go through secure property titles and bit gold — there are so many parallels between that and Bitcoin that you can’t find anywhere else.”\n\nWhen I asked if he believed that Satoshi had been familiar with his work, Mr. Szabo said he understood why there was so much speculation about his own role: “All I’m saying is, there are all these parallels, and it looks funny to me, and looks funny to a lot of other people.”\n\nDinner began, interrupting the conversation, and I never got another chance to talk to Mr. Szabo.\n\nWhen I emailed him on Wednesday, he repeated his denial: “As I’ve stated many times before, all this speculation is flattering, but wrong — I am not Satoshi.”\n\nVideo\n\nMany concepts central to Bitcoin were developed in an online community known as the Cypherpunks, a loosely organized group of digital privacy activists. As part of their mission, they set out to create digital money that would be as anonymous as physical cash. Mr. Szabo was a member, and in 1993, he wrote a message to fellow Cypherpunks describing the diverse motivations of attendees at a group meeting that had just taken place. Some people, he wrote, “are libertarians who want government out of our lives, others are liberals fighting the N.S.A., others find it great fun to ding people in power with cool hacks.”\n\nMr. Szabo had a libertarian mind-set. He was drawn to those ideas partly, he told me, because of his father, who fought the communists in Hungary in the 1950s before coming to the United States, where Mr. Szabo was born 51 years ago. Reared in Washington State, Mr. Szabo studied computer science at the University of Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral experiments in digital cash circulated on the Cypherpunk lists in the 1990s. Adam Back, a British researcher, created one called hashcash that later became a central component of Bitcoin. Another, called b money, was designed by an intensely private computer engineer named Wei Dai.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhen these experiments failed to take off, many Cypherpunks lost interest. But not Mr. Szabo. He worked for six months as a consultant for a company called DigiCash, he has written on his blog. In 1998, he sent the outline for his own version of digital money, which he called bit gold, to a small group that was still pursuing the project, including Mr. Dai and Hal Finney, a programmer based in Santa Barbara, Calif., who tried to create a working version of bit gold.\n\nThe concept behind bit gold was very similar to Bitcoin: It included a digital token that was scarce, like gold, and could be sent electronically without needing to pass through a central authority like a bank.\n\nThis history points to the important role that Mr. Szabo and several others played in developing the building blocks that went into Bitcoin. When Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper describing Bitcoin appeared in the fall of 2008, it cited Mr. Back’s hashcash. The first people Satoshi emailed privately were Mr. Back and Mr. Dai, both men have said. And Mr. Finney, who recently died, helped Satoshi improve the Bitcoin software in the fall of 2008, before it was publicly released, according to emails shared with me by Mr. Finney and his family.\n\nIt is, though, Mr. Szabo’s activity in 2008, as Bitcoin emerged into the world, that has generated much of the suspicion about his role in the project. That spring, before anyone had ever heard of Satoshi Nakamoto or Bitcoin, Mr. Szabo revived his bit gold idea on his personal blog, and in an online conversation about creating a live version of the virtual currency, he asked his readers: “Anybody want to help me code one up?”\n\nAfter Bitcoin appeared, Mr. Szabo reposted the item on his blog in a way that changed the date at the top and made it appear as though it was written after Bitcoin’s release, archived versions of the website show.\n\nMr. Szabo’s writing about bit gold from that time contains many striking parallels with Satoshi’s description of Bitcoin, including similar phrasings and even common writing mannerisms. In 2014, researchers at Aston University, in England, compared the writing of several people who have been suspected to be Satoshi and found that none matched up nearly as well as Mr. Szabo’s. The similarity was “uncanny,” said Jack Grieve, the lecturer who led the effort.\n\nWhen I went back and read Mr. Szabo’s online writings, it was obvious that in the year before Satoshi appeared on the scene and released Bitcoin, Mr. Szabo was again thinking seriously about digital money.\n\nHe wrote frequently, over several months, about the concepts involved in digital money, including those smart contracts, a concept so specialized that Mr. Szabo is often given credit for inventing the term. Smart contracts later showed up as an essential piece of the Bitcoin software.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Szabo’s blog explained why he was examining these issues with such passion: The global financial crisis then underway suggested to him that the monetary system was broken and in need of replacement.\n\n“For those who love our once and future freedoms, now is the time to strike,” Mr. Szabo wrote in an item on his blog in late 2007 endorsing the libertarian Ron Paul’s bid for the presidency, in part because of Mr. Paul’s views on the financial system.\n\nFor many Bitcoin watchers, just as notable as what Mr. Szabo wrote in that period was his silence once Bitcoin appeared in October 2008. After all, the virtual currency was an experiment in everything he had been writing about for years. Unlike Mr. Dai, Mr. Finney and Mr. Back, Mr. Szabo has not released any correspondence from Satoshi from this period or acknowledged communicating with him.\n\nMr. Szabo first made brief mention of Bitcoin on his blog in mid-2009, and in 2011, when the currency was still struggling to gain traction, he wrote about it again at greater length, noting the similarity between bit gold and Bitcoin. He acknowledged that few people would have had the expertise and the instinct to create either of them:\n\n“Myself, Wei Dai and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai’s case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).”\n\nThat item, in May 2011, was one of the last posts Mr. Szabo made before he went on a lengthy hiatus to work, he said later, on a new concept he called temporal programming.\n\nMay 2011 was also the last time Satoshi communicated privately with other Bitcoin contributors. In an email that month to Martti Malmi, one of the earliest participants, Satoshi wrote, “I’ve moved on to other things and probably won’t be around in the future.”\n\nWhoever it is, the real Satoshi Nakamoto has many good reasons for wanting to stay anonymous. Perhaps the most obvious is potential danger. Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine researcher, has concluded that Satoshi Nakamoto most likely collected nearly a million Bitcoins during the system’s first year. Given that each Bitcoin is now worth about $240, the stash could be worth more than $200 million. That could make Satoshi a target.\n\nWith his modest clothes and unassuming manner, Mr. Szabo could be the kind of person who could have a fortune and not spend any of it — or even throw away the keys to the bank. People who know him say he drives a car from the 1990s.\n\nThat modest outward appearance hasn’t diminished the deference toward him among Bitcoin cognoscenti. Potential employees were drawn to Vaurum when they heard that Mr. Szabo worked there, people who interviewed at the company said. They wanted to work alongside the person they suspected could be Satoshi Nakamoto — or who at least participated in Bitcoin’s invention."", 'Henry Sanderson MAY 15, 2015 41 Anthem Blanchard grew up with gold. His father was such a dedicated goldbug that he flew a biplane towing a 50-foot sign declaring LEGALIZE GOLD! at President Richard Nixon’s second inauguration to promote the idea that ordinary Americans should be allowed to buy it. The biplane was chased away by the US Secret Service, but James Blanchard III’s wish ultimately came true: in December 1974, Americans were allowed to buy the metal after a 40-year moratorium. The younger Mr Blanchard inherited his father’s passion. After finishing his studies in the early 2000s he went to work for GoldMoney, one of the first online gold companies. And now he plans to take gold further into the digital era, launching a gold-backed digital currency that he calls the Hayek, after Friedrich Hayek, the Austrian economist and free-market hero. Hayek also happens to be Anthem Blanchard’s middle name. His first name was inspired by a story by Ayn Rand, patron saint of libertarianism. His company, Anthem Vault, is one of a number of businesses that aim to turn gold from a traditional safe haven investment into the basis of a new digital currency — and in the process correct what some consider to be the original sin of monetary policy: the abolition of the gold standard in 1971. The concept is a perfect meld of ideals from two generations of libertarianism: the older “hard money” crowd who distrusts currencies printed by central banks and the adherents of bitcoin, the world’s most widely used digital currency. “We are a renaissance. Gold is the oldest form of value. We’re just coupling it with the newest, most innovative medium of exchange,” the 35-year-old Mr Blanchard says. “We want to really coalesce with the bitcoin community. That’s the idea.” The financial crisis and years of loose central bank policies have spawned a new generation of libertarians who doubt the value of paper currencies. They have turned to gold, like their predecessors, who advocated holding precious metals after Nixon severed the link between the dollar and the metal. The sort of people who like bitcoin tend to share similar world views as those of gold Many have found that the libertarian ideals that underpinned the founding of bitcoin in 2008 mesh perfectly with those that have long supported the gold market. While attempts to create gold-backed currencies have failed before, advocates say regulations are now more supportive as governments realise the potential of payment technologies, such as the underlying software used to authenticate transactions in bitcoin. “The sort of people who like bitcoin tend to share similar world views as those of gold,” says Adam Cleary, founder of Bullion Bitcoin and director of the UK Digital Currency Association. “Bitcoin is a challenger system: it says we want a system that allows for the private dissemination of currency and the existing establishment model is that we should have central banks issuing currency,” he says. “In an age when you have negative interest rates and Grexit you have to wonder if central banks really have everything under control.” Signs of clarity on regulations from governments are allowing many digital-currency based businesses to move out of the shadows. Guidance issued by the US Treasury in 2013 clarified requirements to register as money services businesses. The UK government also said this year it is looking at regulating digital currencies for the first time. In depth Bitcoin As interest in bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currency  Further reading “The evolution of cryptocurrency allows a new method of exchange that’s incredibly cost-efficient and time-efficient,” Mr Blanchard says. The new ventures will have to overcome the history of past failures such as e-Gold, one of the first attempts to start a gold-backed digital currency in the late 1990s. After it grew to more than 4m accounts and over $60m in deposits, Douglas Jackson, its founder and an oncologist from Florida, pleaded guilty in 2008 to running an illegal money transmitting business. Federal investigators charged that “criminals of every stripe gravitated to e-gold as a place to move their money with impunity”. The company identified 12,869 accounts containing funds connected to criminal acts including child pornography, credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud and the sale of stolen or non-existent goods, the DoJ said. Advances in software make doing a full background check on customers easier now, says Roy Sebag, a former hedge fund manager who set up Toronto-based BitGold with an ex-Goldman Sachs metals strategist. Companies like Jumio, started in 2010 and backed by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, promise to verify credentials issued by more than 120 countries. Who would want a gold-backed cryptocurrency when you can just buy gold? BitGold wants to create a platform similar to PayPal for gold, allowing users to set up an account in minutes and buy gold, which it can transfer to anyone with a mobile phone or email address. The gold can be bought with a credit card or bitcoin. It has raised around $12m from outside investors, including Soros Brothers Investments, run by George Soros’ son, and Canadian asset manager Sprott. Mr Sebag says the financial crisis had a deep impact on him: it led him to close his hedge fund in Israel and move to Canada. It also spurred his interest in gold. “It was so odd for me to see everything I’ve learned about markets and how they were supposed to function be untrue,” he says about his experience in 2008. “It was a crazy period. I was looking to protect my portfolio, my investors’ portfolio, and asking people, my mentors, people in markets, and the thing that kept coming up was gold, gold, gold.” Mr Blanchard says the Hayek is backed by 1g of gold and is cleared and transmitted through the bitcoin “blockchain”, the digital currency’s public ledger, used to confirm transactions. The gold is purchased through his company’s accounts. But there are doubters. Backing a digital currency with gold means there still needs to be a centralised system to manage and record who holds the metal. In contrast, bitcoin was designed in a way that eliminated the need to trust a central authority to confirm ownership. One of bitcoin’s strengths is its use of a dispersed network of computers to confirm transactions. “They have come together because they are snake oil salesmen who are looking to sell this to the gullible public,” says Jeffrey Robinson, author of Bitcon: The Naked Truth about Bitcoin. “Who would want a gold-backed cryptocurrency when you can just buy gold?” The volatility of bitcoin has put off many gold investors, who want nothing to do with digital currencies. After soaring to over $1,200 in November 2013, bitcoin prices have collapsed and now trade below $250. “Most investors in gold are looking for the reassurance of a tangible asset, and no crypto-anything,” says Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of American Precious Metals Advisors. “These are typically long-term investors seeking risk reduction and insurance against all sorts of risks — hardly the profile of bitcoin users. This is even more true of investors across Asia where the lion’s share of physical investment [in gold] now occurs.” Still, both the gold and bitcoin communities find common ground in their dislike of government-issued currencies. “The young people can identify with the hard-money crowd, the more traditional gold crowd because they both see clear evidence that modern central banking and money management is not serving the broader interest of society,” says John Butler, managing partner at Amphora Capital who used to work at Lehman Brothers. “Everyone is wondering where the money comes from in a way they didn’t pre-2008, and 1971 was the same.” Stephen Macaskill, who runs Amagi Metals, a Denver-based precious metals seller, says when they first started accepting bitcoin, goldbugs gave him a hard time, saying it was a Ponzi scheme. Now they are a lot more accepting. “We have a unique message which is: preserve your wealth in gold and use bitcoin to spend money,” says Mr Macaskill, whose father was a friend of James Blanchard. “You’re not helping out bankers that have been bailed out.” For the younger Mr Blanchard, his business is a fulfilment of his father’s love of Austrian economics and belief that governments have never been able to manage money or currency. He hopes his father would have seen the advantages of the technology that allows for a decentralised system that will exist as long as there is a computer connected to a server. “I think he’d be sceptical of the technology at first. It wasn’t something familiar to him,” he says. “But I think that with the combination of the two of us he would be really excited about it\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009being able to see his love of Hayek’s vision and of the Austrian economic vision be realised. I think that’s what he would have really appreciated and loved.” Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT', ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the Americas, has agreed to use a Texas-based company to build a permanent and secure land title record system using the underlying technology behind bitcoin, a company official said late Thursday.\n\nA bitcoin sticker is seen in the window of the 'Vape Lab' cafe, where it is possible to both use and purchase the bitcoin currency, in London March 24, 2015. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/Files\n\nFactom, a U.S. blockchain technology company based in Austin, Texas, will provide the service to the government of Honduras, the firm’s president, Peter Kirby, said. The company is doing the project with Epigraph, a title software company that uses blockchain technology, also based in Austin.\n\nFactom would not reveal the cost of the project. Honduras would become only the second government to use blockchain, which increases transparency in a transaction, to manage government data, after reports that the Isle of Man would test a government-run blockchain project.\n\n“In the past, Honduras has struggled with land title fraud,” said Kirby. “The country’s database was basically hacked. So bureaucrats could get in there and they could get themselves beachfront properties.”\n\nEbal Jair Díaz Lupian, the Honduran government’s chief of staff, did not respond to several attempts from Reuters to contact him via email and telephone.\n\nBy building an immutable title record, backed by blockchain, Honduras can leapfrog systems built in the developed world, Kirby said. He added that this would allow for more secure mortgages, contracts, and mineral rights.\n\n“This also gives owners of the nearly 60 percent of undocumented land, an incentive to register their property officially.”\n\nThe blockchain is a ledger of all of a digital currency’s transactions and is viewed as bitcoin’s main technological innovation. The technology is evolving beyond the digital currency, though, to applications like title databases and data verification systems.\n\nKirby said Factom started negotiations in January. The pilot project should be completed by the end of the year, with the goal of eventually putting all of the government’s land titles on the blockchain, he added.\n\nHonduras, a country of about 8 million people, has the world’s highest murder rate, fuelling a surge in child migration to the United States. The country’s GDP per capita in 2013 was estimated at $1,577, according to the World Bank, making it one of the poorer countries in the Western hemisphere.\n\nThe government’s debt has more than quadrupled since 2008 amid sluggish growth."", 'Xapo, a provider of secure bitcoin wallet and vault storage solutions deemed “the Fort Knox of bitcoin,” announced that it is relocating its corporate headquarters to Zurich, Switzerland. The company will retain a small presence in its previous home base in Palo Alto, California to serve U.S. customers, but its main operations will move to the new home base.\n\nXapo’s primary deep cold storage vault is already located in Switzerland (the precise location hasn’t been disclosed), with additional secure sites deployed around the globe.\n\n“[A]t the request of our expanding global customer base, now is the time to bring our center of operations closer to the heart of our security infrastructure,” the announcement reads. “The country’s regulatory stability, international neutrality and its deep-seated tradition in global finance also factored into the decision.”\n\nXapo’s deep cold storage servers are housed in radio wave-blocking Faraday cages and secured behind military-grade security controls deep within reinforced underground bunkers. All vaults utilize multi-signature transaction authorization, and withdrawals must be signed by at least three of five deep cold storage sites around the world. For extra physical security, Xapo has partnered with satellite surveillance service provider Satellogic.\n\nIn August 2014, Xapo became the first Bitcoin services company to complete a Service Organization Control 2 (SOC2) Type I audit, a widely recognized auditing standard against which service providers are able to report and validate their internal security controls. Customers’ funds are covered by two separate insurance policies against cyber-theft, hacking attacks, physical break-ins and employee dishonesty.\n\nThat shows how Xapo wants to take all measures to protect its current and future customers’ funds from all risks and threats.\n\n“[O]ur fiduciaries are protected by our vault, which uses private keys that never touch the client or the Internet and are buried deep within geographically dispersed, heavily guarded locations with multi-signature technology for transaction signing,” notes the announcement. “We have customized security protocols to reduce the likelihood of theft through social engineering, phishing or brute force hacks, and offer full insurance in the unlikely event that these systems are compromised.”\n\nThough not explicitly stated in the announcement, it seems evident that Xapo needs to protect its key customers from the possibility that the political climate in the United States might become unfriendly to crypto-currencies, and therefore decided to move to a country with strong privacy and banking secrecy traditions. The linked page “Why Switzerland?” is more explicit:\n\n“Switzerland has a long tradition of protecting both personal and financial privacy. The fundamental right to personal privacy is established as part of Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution, and the protection of personal financial information is still maintained today by the provisions of the Swiss Banking Law of 1934.”\n\nThe page also notes that the Swiss spirit of independence endures, with Switzerland remaining apart from the European Union, and deciding participation in any non-governmental organization by popular referendum. The country protects its multiple borders, and national sovereignty, with an active military force of professional soldiers and civilian reservists.\n\n“This is not to facilitate crime, this is to protect privacy,” Xapo CEO Wences Casares told CoinDesk. “There are some customers that will bring more balances if we do this and there are some customers who have said we will work with you if you do this.”', ""As Bitcoin has become a prominent alternative currency, there has been demand for an exchange-traded vehicle where investors can gain exposure to the crypto currency through their brokerage accounts. Grayscale Investments recently brought the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX:GBTC) to market and it now trades on the OTCQX market in the US. Although not reporting to the SEC, the Bitcoin Investment Trust follows the OTC Market's alternative reporting standards. After the recent commencement of trading on the OTCQX market, the Bitcoin Investment Trust has seen large levels of volatility in its shares. As this is the first and only publicly traded investment vehicle that gives investors access to Bitcoins, it has seen strong investor demand. On Thursday, shares of the trust closed at $45/share while NAV stood at only $22.39/share. This represents a market price premium of 101% to NAV and creates the very real possibility of a meaningful share price drop. In addition to the low current liquidity in this investment vehicle, these factors pose a meaningful risk to investors in the trust and given the current prices, prudent public investors should avoid the trust.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin Investment Trust is an interesting investment vehicle, it does charge 2% annual fees and has AUM in the low $30 million range of Bitcoin value which could limit the liquidity and scale of the trust in the public market. This size would also likely limit the investment of institutional investors at least to be begin with. Initially created to represent 1/10 of a Bitcoin, fees are taken from this balance and as such, the number of Bitcoins held per share has also fallen. Given the high profile nature of Bitcoins and the desire for an accessible retail investment vehicle, there others have been vying to bring such an ETF to market. Twin entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have filed documents with the SEC to bring the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (Pending:COIN) to market. With a similar idea to that of Grayscale Investment's Bitcoin Investment Trust, this would vehicle would likely drawn significant attention as well.\n\nWhile shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust currently trade at a massive premium to NAV, accredited investors are offered an avenue to gain access to the trust through purchasing shares at NAV. With a minimum investment of $25k, accredited investors can buy restricted shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust at NAV. Of course, these shares face transfer and resale restrictions so this option should only be considered by investors who plan on holding on to the trust's shares for the long term. The significantly limits the arbitrage opportunity with the large discrepancy between the trust's market price and NAV. While shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust trade at a 101% premium to NAV and its underlying performance is dependent on that of the Bitcoin crypto currency, prudent investors should avoid it as this creates an opportunity for shares of the trust to fall meaningfully as it moves to converge with NAV over the long term. For investors who would be interested in shorting this vehicle, at this point in its existence it may be difficult, expensive or impossible to do in light of its limited trading history and low level of liquidity.\n\nDisclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nThe author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

Just before they had left for Ibiza, they had leased an office in Manhattan for Winklevoss Capital.\n\nWhile lounging at Blue Marlin, one of the trendy island’s most famous beach clubs, a compact, boxer of a man with a shaved head, approached the brothers and introduced himself as David Azar, mentioning a friend they had in common in New York.\n\nCameron knew how to extract himself from this sort of situation, but before he did, Azar asked Cameron if he had heard about Bitcoin, the virtual currency. When Cameron said no, what Azar told him was enough to create a faint stirring of interest, and Cameron asked him to follow up with more.\n\nAt their family beach house on Long Island the next weekend, Cameron read over the articles David sent along. Both brothers had majored in economics at Harvard and, after just a bit of reading on his laptop, Cameron called his brother over.\n\n??????????“You’ve got to come over here and check this out,” Cameron said to Tyler.\n\nTyler always played the right-handed, rational check to his more dreamy, left-handed brother. But as Tyler began reading, he saw what his brother was talking about. Both realized this was either a scam or a big deal—but worth exploring. A virtual currency that was both a sort of scarce, digital gold, and a way to send money around the world cheaply and nearly instantly.\n\nWhen they got Azar on the phone, he told the twins about a Bitcoin startup he was preparing to invest in–BitInstant–and offered to connect them with the two young men who were running it, Charlie Shrem and Erik Voorhees, with the clear implication that the brothers might want to invest in it as well.\n\nThe twins spent the entire ride back into the city, from the Hamptons, talking on the phone with Shrem and Voorhees about Bitcoin. The next day, Cameron arrived at BitInstant’s headquarters, just a few blocks from the Winklevoss Capital offices, and folded his big frame into the office of Shrem, BitInstant’s energetic 22-year old chief executive.\n\nThe conversation lasted for two hours, with Cameron asking all his questions about how Bitcoin worked and what value BitInstant brought to the table. Cameron was particularly impressed by Voorhees’ decision to take his entire salary from BitInstant in Bitcoin and to keep his savings in the virtual currency.\n\nWithin a few days, the twins let Azar know that they were prepared to invest in BitInstant and set up a dinner to work out the terms. With Shrem and Voorhees, they opened up a jokey banter by e-mail as the twins went back and forth about the basics of Bitcoin and the nature of money.\n\nCameron: “Money does have some intrinsic value, for example if you were freezing on top of a mountain and all you had was cash you could burn it to keep warm a la Cliffhanger.”\n\nShrem: “Anything is valued differently in different circumstance. . . . A dollar bill to a coke head is worth more than a dollar bill to you and I.”\n\n??????????Cameron: “What about a dollar bill to a stripper?”\n\nIn the conversation with the twins, though, Shrem did not mention that he and Voorhees and their biggest investor to date, Roger Ver, were also considering taking an investment from a pair of New York venture capitalists. Ver and Voorhees were leaning toward the venture capitalists, but Shrem, who had the final say, was drawn to David Azar and the Winklevoss twins.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins had a glamour that was hard for Shrem to resist. He was a short kid who had always been the last one picked for dodgeball, and the tall blond Olympians promised not just money, but a life in which he could no longer be ignored. Meanwhile, the twins partner, David Azar, had experience in the check-cashing business, which was likely to help BitInstant deal with legal issues as they grew. Shrem finally prevailed upon the others to take the money from Azar and the twins.\n\nThe agreement–inked in October 2012–gave Maguire ?????Ventures, the investment entity created by Azar and the Winklevoss twins, 22% of BitInstant for $880,000. By the time the final contract was signed, Shrem was already reaping the most immediate benefit of the deal: he was serving as a personal Bitcoin guide for the Winklevoss twins. He began buying them coins and helped them use Bitcoin to pay a Ukrainian programmer for work on the Winklevoss Capital website.\n\nShrem and Voorhees also set up a time to sit down with the twins and give them a more in-depth Bitcoin tutorial at their offices. They deliberately scheduled the meeting on a Saturday evening, when the conversation might bleed into a night of partying with the brothers, and the twins didn’t disappoint them.\n\nAfter a session on Bitcoin, leavened with alcohol, Cameron invited Shrem and Voorhees to join him for a night out. Girls the twins knew showed up and the crew headed to a party in a loft downtown, followed by a visit to a speakeasy. Shrem got so drunk on shots of rum that he threw up on his shoes in the middle of the bar. He still managed to end up back at Cameron’s apartment with a girl–though Shrem ruefully reported that it didn’t go anywhere.\n\n“What a night,” Cameron wrote to Shrem and Voorhees the next morning. “I trust u guys made it home in one piece.”\n\n“That was a blast,” Voorhees wrote back. “I had to peace out before I drowned in liquor.”\n\nIt wasn’t just Shrem and Voorhees who found all of this thrilling. For the twins, despite their past successes, investing in Bitcoin at this point still felt like getting in on the ground floor of something huge, before anybody else had even heard about it.\n\nFrom Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money by Nathaniel Popper Copyright © 2015 by Nathaniel Popper. Reprinted courtesy of Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers.', 'Businesses are always looking for ways to add new revenue streams, stay on the cutting-edge of the latest technologies, and reduce operating expenses. As companies like PayPal, Microsoft, and Dell Computers have already discovered, Bitcoin accomplishes all three, and would be an asset to any modern business model.

Our compliance team was uber impressed with the thoughtfulness and thoroughness of the DerbyJackpot compliance program, that they were a natural fit for GoCoin,” he added.\n\nHigh Demand for Bitcoin Integration\n\nDerbyJackpot.com told Bitcoin Magazine they chose to accept bitcoin due to frequent requests from customers. The integration comes during the height of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing season, one of the most active times of the year for the sport. DerbyJackpot.com users will be able to bet bitcoin on races at the Preakness this weekend, the Belmont Stakes on June 6, and hundreds of other horse races.\n\nLaunched in 2012, the gambling startup has pioneered the growing industry of online betting for horse races. According to DerbyJackpot’sCrunchBase profile, the company has raised more than $6.5 in capital and includes Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Bullpen Capital Managing Director Paul Martino among its advisers and investors.\n\nGoCoin also provided bitcoin payments for the first regulated Bitcoin gambling website in the United Kingdom. In October of last year, the company partnered with iGaming operator Cozy Games to enable dogecoin, litecoin and bitcoin payments for the mobile gambling company’s apps. Cozy was the first regulated gambling company to accept Bitcoin in the UK and the world.', 'Two of the largest Hong Kong banks were targeted with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks earlier this week by unknown parties demanding bitcoin ransoms.\n\nRegional newspaper The Standard reported that the Bank of China (Hong Kong) and the Bank of East Asia were hit by the attacks last weekend. A representative for Bank of China confirmed that the attack took place on 9th May, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“With our constant monitoring mechanism and contingency measures in place to ensure the security and operation of the Company\'s website, our services and customer information have not been affected by the incident. The case was reported to the Hong Kong Police.""\n\nThe Bank of East Asia did not respond to requests for comment by press time.\n\nA police spokesperson told The Standard that those behind the attack demanded payment in bitcoin following an initial DDoS attack, during which a website is flooded with significant amounts of fake traffic in order to disrupt access for other users.\n\nThe police spokesperson said the threats included promises of future attacks.\n\nThe reports come days after the extortion group DD4BC was blamed for a series of DDoS attacks against organizations in Switzerland, New Zealand and Australia, prompting a direct warning by a Swiss government agency.\n\nDD4BC was cited as the source of a wave of attacks against some of the world\'s largest bitcoin mining pools earlier this year, as well a variety of websites and services related to digital currency.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While billions of dollars have been lost due to bank failures and hackings, the Bitcoin protocol itself has never been hacked.\n\nEric Voorhees, the founder of Shapeshift, tweeted recently:\n\nCan we take a moment to reflect on the fact that the Bitcoin protocol STILL hasn't been hacked? One of the greatest comp sci accomplishments — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) May 13, 2015\n\nSince 2009 through 2013, bank failures resulted in a total loss of at least US$65 billion, according to the FDIC. The largest bank failure in the history of the U.S. was the collapse of savings bank holding company Washington Mutual, which fell in 2008, taking with it over US$22 billion in losses. At the time, Bloomberg reported that “Washington Mutual, nicknamed WaMu, will lose about $21.7 billion from mortgages through 2011, more than the US$12 billion to US$19 billion that the company forecasted.”\n\nBankrate.com stated that the FDIC closes more banks each week. The number of bank failures have exponentially increased and have resulted in more than US$100 billion in losses over the last decade.\n\nIn February of 2015, international software security group Kaspersky Lab investigated a recent bank-security failure that resulted in US$1 billion in losses. Kaspersky reported that a cybergang called Carbanak hacked into 100 different financial institutions and stole up to US$10 million in each raid.\n\nThe cybergang used spear-phishing tactics to infect the computers of employees within well-established financial institutions. After months of surveillance, the hackers used their Carbanak malware to gain control of the banks’ internal networks and access the computers of administrators. They achieved access to bank operations and records, and they replicated the database accessible by employees in order to “mimic staff activity to transfer money and cash out.”\n\nBitcoin to Disrupt the Banking Systems\n\nAlthough banking systems have continued to collapse and fail over the last decade, the protocol of Bitcoin has not been hacked since its launch in 2008.\n\nBitcoin mining is decentralized and the security of the Bitcoin network purely depends on it. For an individual or an organization to corrupt the Bitcoin blockchain or initiate an attack, they must gain control of over 50% of the network’s mining power, achieving what is known as a “51% attack.”\n\nIn June of 2014, a mining pool called Ghash.io’s hashing rate reached almost 51%, which according to Andreas Antonopoulos could have allowed Ghash.io to “execute a double-spend” for a couple of blocks. Not long afterward, Ghash.io’s hashing rate returned to around 36%.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin network has never been hacked, major wallets and exchanges, including Bitstamp and Mt. Gox, have suffered from hacking and internal failures, but these have been due to flaws internal flaws within their systems, not to flaws in the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe Bitcoin network and services built upon it continue to strengthen security through technologies such as multisignature. The numbers of bank failures and internal hackings, at the same time, are exponentially increasing.\n\nIf banks continue to crumble at such a high rate, Bitcoin will continue to have an edge in the traditional system. We will increasingly hear senior banking officials like Gareth Murphy of the Central Bank of Ireland cite Bitcoin for “[posing] new challenges to central banks’ control.”""]"
05/16/2015,"['One problem that has plagued governments for centuries is the rightful ownership of property. Revolution or displacement by war have been one cause of this problem, while bold-faced theft by government officials or gangsters has been another. One day you owned it, the next day you didn’t.\n\nHonduras has faced this problem, especially with the advent of computerized records. According to the U. S. Embassy in Honduras:\n\nHonduran laws and practices regarding real estate differ substantially from those in the United States, and fraudulent deeds and titles are common. U.S. citizens considering investing or buying real estate in Honduras should be aware that rights to such property do not enjoy the same level of protection as in the United States.\n\nEnter Factom and Epigraph\n\nFactom is a company that aims to utilize Bitcoin’s block chain for more than just value transference. CCN has reported on Factom before, where Caleb Chen said of them in November:\n\nFactom melds security, accessibility, and innovation in such a way that will undoubtedly expedite the use of blockchain technology for non-monetary purposes. While the concepts have existed in “unhashed” form for awhile, Factom will be the first large-scale project to tackle the problems of centralized record keeping and the associated wasted efficiency.\n\nFactom will be implementing a solution for the Honduran government that creates unalterable records of property ownership. This will, in practice, with a couple of caveats, invalidate the statement on the US Embassy website. After all, property disputes occasionally happen in the US. One caveat is who will have control of entering ownership data onto the block chain and whether or not it will be multi-signature. If the owner and the government each have some form of signatory control over the data, then the social engineering problem is severely reduced. Sure, you can get the corrupt government official to agree that the property belongs to you for a fraction of its value, but can you get the actual owner to agree to the same?\n\nEpigraph, a company which specializes in transparency technology, will be co-operating with Factom in this project. Factom has declined to tell the media how much the contract is worth, but certainly it’s no small potatoes. This is big news for Bitcoin technology, as it is only the second government to announce that it would make use of the block chain for any purpose. That it is a non-monetary purpose is all the better, as the utility of Bitcoin becomes further entrenched with every such agreement.\n\nAlso in Kosovo, Potentially Elsewhere\n\nOn the Factom blog, they recently mentioned a project that would be aimed at Kosovo, a way of lessening corruption through transparency. For this project, they are partnering with Bitsapphire.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'CSI Cyber, which recently aired its season finale, featured Bitcoin as a theme throughout the episode entitled “Bit By Bit.” Filled with crypto mystery, the plot is loosely based on the headlines of a teenage bitcoin trader who murders his roommate.\n\nThe cast tries to understand the concept of digital currency, but most of the time the story is better told through the technology itself. Here’s a line, for example, from one of the episode’s victims:\n\n“Ben had the idea for the bitcoin computer. I trusted my son when they implemented it and now my son is dead. How many bitcoins were there? A half million dollars.”\n\n‘Bit by Bit’\n\nCBS provides a synopsis for the show about a cyber-team investigation of a hacker who uses a power outage in Detroit to mask a jewelry store heist and murder. The show starts right off with Daniel Krumitz, a detective played by Charlie Koontz, using his computer to find the hacker.\n\nA massive power outage has occurred in Detroit 36 hours earlier, and the traffic system downtown is disabled. Meanwhile, a hacker opens a dialer vault, but viewers are kept in the dark about what he is stealing. CSI investigators the heist involves jewelry, but lo and behold, the actual thievery involves Bitcoin.\n\nThe main detectives use the blockchain as means to find the culprit. Krumitz explains the blockchain’s process and that anyone can find any transaction. He goes further into the topic of holding private keys and suggests that the person holding the keys is likely the killer. Viewers receive a long-winded explanation of how the blockchain ledger records everything. In this scene, Koontz looks as though he has done a little homework. His character says:\n\n“The biggest misconception about Bitcoin is that it’s anonymous. That’s why it’s the preferred currency in the Deep Web. It’s used to fund drug deals, hit men, human trafficking — but it’s not actually that anonymous.”\n\nThe ignorance of the jewelry store owners is particularly hilarious. They lock down their computer in a vault, yet forget to secure their Bitcoin holdings with a pass phrase. The technology focused on in most of these shots is the safe. Once the ancient tech is broken into, the newer tech is fully accessible — with absolutely no technological security, not even a simple password.\n\nWorth Watching?\n\nCSI Cyber shows display a lot of technology, but they typically don’t describe it well. This show is a perfect example. The finale episode provides a tale of how the blockchain could be used in an investigation. While the writers seemed to have some understanding of how blockchain technology works, I wonder what sources they studied before writing the show. A blockchain expert could have improved the plot. Perhaps they should have read CoinTelegraph for a solid understanding of crypto. I\'d like to invite the entire cast of CSI Cyber to my place for a lesson. Let\'s have a CryptoParty!\n\nCSI Cyber focuses mainly on Bitcoin for the first time throughout an entire episode. They use a lot of \'buzz\' crypto terms in ways that don’t make sense. It reminds me of the Simpson\'s billboard displaying the word Bitcoin:\n\nSome elements of this CSI story resemble the January murder after which it is modeled. The original headline, “Bitcoin Trader Accused of Murder,” involves a case of a young teenage stock trader whose portfolio included Bitcoin. News outlets at the time gave the impression that Bitcoin was a motivation for the killing, but the crime was not connected to cryptocurrency.\n\nThe fairly stimulating episode kept me glued to the TV. The show even contained a Bitcoin bounty hunter. It was particularly enjoyable listening to Koontz and Patricia Arquette engage in “Bitcoiner talk,” which gave me quite a chuckle. I almost expected them to refer to the digital currency as ""the Bit-Coin.""\n\nI can handle a good CSI Cyber every now and then, and the episode was certainly worth watching, for a Bitcoin enthusiast such as myself. You, however, may be disappointed. Wired describes the show’s poor attempts to connect with its target audience:\n\n""The teenagers of Dawson’s Creek may have been verbally precocious, but the experts on Cyber, which ended its first season last night, often don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, even while they are still talking.""\n\nPerhaps the laptops and cell phones featured on CSI should get more air time than the cast? The finale was better than past episodes I\'ve seen. It contained action and elements of surprise, climaxing with the violent Bitcoin bounty hunter going after the burglar. The thief had hidden the money on a digital botnet, so the bounty hunter tortured him for clues. Eventually, federal officials caught the culprit and retrieved the bitcoins.\n\nCSI may have chosen to go the crypto route in order to gain a technical edge and use the sensationalism that surrounds cryptocurrency. The hot topic seemed to give the show more views. A slew of articles came out after it aired, all making fun of the show’s ignorance. I hope the viewers learned something about Bitcoin beyond its use on the Deep Web — at the very least, an understanding of the importance of using basic security for Bitcoin accounts.', 'Ever since Dark Wallet was first announced, in September of 2013, it has hogged the spotlight as Bitcoin\'s underground wallet. Made for dark web users and those otherwise concerned with staying private online, user friendliness was one of it\'s central features. But, few people missed that this wallet was being created for the central purpose of keeping your identity as private as it possibly could while making bitcoin transactions. Instantly hailed by privacy advocates and simultaneously demonized in the press, Dark Wallet has remained the undisputed bad boy of bitcoin wallets, at least until now.\n\nIn May 2014, a full year after Dark Wallet front man Cody Wilson made international headlines for firing the world\'s first 3D printed gun, Cody and partner Amir Taaki released the open source code for the first version of their wallet, Dark Wallet Alpha. It includes some interesting features not seen in any other wallet before, such as identity profiles, a chat lobby, coin mixing and stealth wallet addresses.\n\nEight versions and three rounds of successful crowdfunding campaigns later, the wallet is more functional than ever. But, it still exists only as a Chrome Browser plugin, and is still labeled an alpha version, that clearly warns users to be careful. The website alerts users that it is not stable and you could lose all of your bitcoins at any time while using it.\n\nPerhaps sensing an opportunity in Dark Wallet\'s delay, or maybe it\'s lack of a mobile platform, a team of anonymous coding ""Samourais,"" as they call themselves, have put forth their own black-themed, privacy-centric wallet. The first version was released for android last week, on May 7. Their Samourai wallet is described as ""a bitcoin wallet made for the streets.""\n\n- Samourai\n\nBesides the French spelling of its name, the largest difference in Samourai wallet is that it appears to be just as focused on Security as it is Privacy. With never-before-seen wallet features like a stealth mode and a remote self-destruct button via SMS, it’s clearly made with personal security in mind, protecting its user\'s bitcoins against being taken by muggers, pickpocketers, the authorities, and even simply losing your phone.\n\nAlthough we know very little about the developers of Samourai wallet, other than they likely speak French, they claim to be developing it for many of the same reasons that Wilson and Taaki are making Dark wallet.\n\n- Samourai\n\nIf the two wallets existed on the same platform, you\'d likely be forgiven for mistaking Samourai for Dark Wallet, at first glance. The dark-gray-on-black color scheme is very similar to Dark Wallet\'s looks, but the similarities end there. For one, Samourai is exclusively for Android phones at this time, while Dark Wallet is only available in Chrome web browsers.\n\nCoin mixing is handled a little differently on Samourai than it was on Dark Wallet. Although the process is highly technical, a Samourai blog post describes how the coin mixing uses a trustless system, never using any 3rd parties nor servers. This ensures that the sending address is properly mixed with the change addresses, obfuscating the amount being sent in each transaction.\n\nNot only are the number and position of these change addresses randomized, but they claim that the wallet will never re-use any addresses for sending, and will never link previous change outputs in a transaction. Together, this makes tracking transactions back to users extremely difficult for anyone watching the blockchain.\n\nSamourai allows you to backup and restore your wallet, as well as choose your favorite blockchain explorer to use as a reference inside the wallet. In the future it will allow you to choose your own source of exchange rate, which is currently locked into the LocalBitcoins price. NFC payments are also available with Samourai wallet, and can be enabled in the settings menu.\n\nA lot of Samourai\'s additions involve its\' unique SMS abilities. If a smartphone is stolen, for instance, one quick SMS message with the proper command can retrieve your Hierarchical Deterministic seed phrase, allowing you to regenerate your entire wallet elsewhere. Better yet, this seed phrase is worthless without knowing your wallet password.\n\n- SamouraiWallet on Reddit\n\nAfter moving your wallet, you\'d very likely want to erase the existing wallet off of the stolen phone. Another SMS message and command will completely wipe the entire application off the phone, leaving no trace of it behind.\n\nThere is even a “switch alert” built into the wallet that will send out an SMS message automatically when a thief switches the phone\'s SIM card, and therefore phone number, before you can send your SMS. The alert will send you the new phone number, so that you can send your \'move\' and \'wipe\' SMS messages to it instead.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful new feature of Samourai wallet is its stealth mode. With one single touch you can hide Samourai on the device. Anyone picking up the smartphone afterward won\'t see its icon and searching through the installed apps list wont find any trace of it. That is until you call “**[Your PIN code]#” to reveal it again. You can also select if you\'d like the wallet to accept SMS commands or not while it is in stealth mode.\n\nEncryption of the wallet is also impressive. At installation Samourai locally encrypts itself using AES-256 encryption, protecting all of the keys inside of it. A strong passphrase is required to gain access, and all bitcoin private keys are created and stored inside the encrypted area. Although they have not integrated Multi-signature wallets yet, this level of security would seem to outshine Dark Wallet\'s encryption, based on the fact that their private keys must go off the device to an \'obelisk\' server, which hypothetically could allow for a hacker intercept during transit.\n\n- SamouraiWallet\n\nDark Wallet still has a strong lead on Samourai in these areas.They natively support multi-sig addresses, and use Stealth Addresses. These further anonymize the transactions inside Dark Wallet to a level far above coin mixing alone.\n\nBut neither service has integrated with TOR yet, the infamous anonymity network. Although both will allow you to use Virtual Private Networks, which allows some basic IP address protection, TOR has proven difficult to integrate with these wallets.\n\n- SamouraiWallet\n\nWhile both wallets claim to be in an alpha version, Dark Wallet warns people against storing large amounts of bitcoin, but their code is fully open-source. Samourai is a closed alpha, and they don’t provide any disclaimers. When asked why the source code has not been made open yet SamouraiWallet replied, ""We are open sourcing our code once we conclude closed beta.""\n\nThis makes neither wallet truly ready for their intended purpose, and perhaps it is equally as risky to keep your bitcoins in both.\n\nAlthough it\'s still too early to declare a winner in the race to be the wallet with the most privacy, it is clear that certain users will prefer one wallet to the other. For instance, if you need a private wallet for on the go, Samourai should be considered. But users that have the absolute highest needs for privacy should be looking at Dark Wallet, at least for now.', ""Sorry record labels, music does not need you anymore. ChangeTip arrived on Soundcloud this week. The prolific sound-sharing platform that attracts more than 175 million new listeners a month, according to their own data, is bringing the opportunity for an online tipping culture to the mainstream.\n\nEver since the Internet's boon into ubiquity, artists and media magnates — at least some of the really wealthy ones with stacks of royalties built on their past successes — have had serious difficulties bringing in expected profits from their art.\n\nBefore we were able to copy and paste a song “from here to China” in a matter of seconds, distribution was a much more complicated process. Songs were scarce and tied to hardware, not virtually free to duplicate.\n\nMusic labels saw this distribution problem and, throughout the 20th century, rose to the challenge of turning young talent into gold and filling each other's pockets. Record labels supported the marketing and promotion, charging hefty commissions on sales. Over time, fewer profits trickled down to the artists, raising a fair amount of resentment that arguably fuels the age of so-called piracy.\n\nThe phenomenon, a byproduct of the industrial revolution that gave us vinyls and music tapes (square CDs), created a market where very few could and would be selected by record labels. But if they were, they became stinking rich and stinking famous. Limousines, mansions, movies, you name it — the dream of the 20th century rock star was to be immortalized in the memories of international audiences.\n\nSort of like these guys:\n\nAnd then came that pesky Internet, dwindling both profits and the ability to hold copyrights over very expensive and voluntarily created productions. Thanks to Bittorrent, for example, there are no paywalls against information sharing, and this has steadily dwindled the profit margins of music labels, movie production powerhouses like Hollywood, and other pre-Internet, content-distribution industries. (Think e-books.)\n\nVarious solutions are being attempted to solve the problem of monetizing art while leveraging the Internet.\n\nLegacy Media's Solution? Policing the Internet\n\nIn an attempt to undo the “damage” done by the Internet, the rich and influential media corporations and their supporters have lobbied and lawyered up, trying to police the Internet and persecute entrepreneurs like Kim Dotcom, effectively waging a war on “piracy.” Doing so, they are waging what has been called the “war on general computing.”\n\nThis is a technological attempt to take away your control over your computer, by installing hardware such as Intel AMT chips that can keep you from copying (I mean … pirating) specific copyrighted art.\n\nOne of the names for this tech is Digital Rights Management (DRM), and while the legacy media have yet to win, they sure are putting up a fight. If they do win, you'll have to have permission from some hierarchy to copy this or that and share it, effectively breaking the Internet as we know it.\n\nThe Solutions of the Innovative\n\nOthers like 50 Cent have embraced the Internet and rolled with the punches, creating video games of himself in a gangster's paradise and most recently accepting Bitcoin for his albums.\n\nStill others have resorted to accepting the end of the industrial era's artistic gold rush, and have gone on the road selling tickets to their live performances instead, promoting their tours on social media, and any other way they can. Like in the good old days — not becoming stinking rich, but making a living.\n\nSome music artists even successfully crowdfund their album productions, like Tatiana Moroz with her own artist coin called Tatianacoin, making money after release through other promotions or just from tips.\n\nPeer Pressure\n\nSome, however, have taken to creating shaming campaigns against “pirates,” perhaps realizing that they can't win on technology, nor find a compelling enough reason for people to give them money.\n\nLike this guy:\n\nThe shocking thing to me about this attempt to convince people that copying information is a bad thing, is that it is somewhat effective, isn't it? Many people would agree that consuming a lot of artistic content without at least promoting the content or finding a way to support the artists is, well … not in line with reciprocity. However, to police, persecute and try to break the Internet is not only violent, but far from fair game. So what is one to do?\n\nThe Rise of the Bitcoin Tipping Culture\n\nTips work. Waiters and waitresses all over the Western world make a living mostly on tips. Friends cajole each other on the proper tipping etiquette — “15% dude!” The restaurant industry in the West is arguably sustained by a social etiquette that is not built on technology or law enforcement, but on a general agreement that tipping as a reward mechanism works. If you don't like the service, tip less or don't tip at all. But if you do, then please tip something.\n\nBitcoin companies like ChangeTip are making this possible. Virtually nonexistent fees and the speed of Internet transactions make micro payments a reality, and ChangeTip is without a doubt leading the charge. Thanks to their hard work, you can use almost any social media platform to tip your favorite artists, cutting out the middlemen (PayPal, Visa, music labels). You can give your money straight to the artist, while at the same time promoting Bitcoin! This is a great opportunity.\n\nThis week, ChangeTip was made available on SoundCloud, letting you send financial tokens of affection to the artists who make you shake your booty. Let's ease the frustration of artists and send them a virtual cookie — if you like what they do, of course."", 'Over the past decade, numerous of technological developments have been introduced to the world. We’ve evolved to using smartphones with apps that allow us to be connected to the entire world at any given time. Cars are driving themselves; robots are getting close to being ‘real’ humans. A lot of the key aspects in our world are still up for massive improvement. Bitcoin is one of these inventions that could be set to change the way our financial system works. Some of the world’s most renowned futurists share their view on what they think is in store for us in the next decade.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nFeelings, 3D-Printing and virtual reality\n\nProfessor theoretical physics Michio Kaku was the first to shed his light on the future. He believes we can expect a gradual progression from Internet to the ‘brain-net’. He describes it as a mental network where thoughts, emotions, feelings and memories will be instantly sent over the entire world. Scientists will be able to connect our brain to a computer and decode thoughts and memories. “It may sound very artificial, but this could mean a revolution in communication and entertainment. Think of movies that will be able to share emotions more intense than ever before. Perhaps it could even lead to reducing tension between people as everyone would be able to feel each other’s pain in a very realistic way.”\n\nNext up was computer scientist and inventor Dr. Ray Kurzweil. He claims that by 2025, 3D-printers will be able to print cheap clothing. People will be spending money for downloadable designs made by popular designers. It will be comparable to the way we pay for eBooks, music and movies right now. And Kurzweil sees 3d-printing go even further. Modified stem cells will enable 3D-printers to reproduce human organs. This would result in a vast collection of organs that would pose no threat of being rejected by the recipients’ body. Next to that, we’re going to spend time in virtual realities. We can visit, see and touch each other while being thousands of miles apart.\n\nBitcoin as a legitimate, digital economy\n\nFinally, Dr. James Canton of the Institute of Global Futures shared his view with the world. Canton is constantly thinking about future developments and has been a digital currency enthusiast since the very start of Bitcoin. He shows true belief in the future of Bitcoin.\n\n“Digital currencies like Bitcoin will have a massive impact on organizations. Companies that understand the block chain and Bitcoin could be up at a leading edge of a transformation in business. It is key for them to be in sync with the developments and not to avoid them. Don’t look at it as a currency used by a group of criminals for shady practices. Instead embrace it and learn to use it to your advantage. Digital currencies will become accepted as a payment method. They are already by a vast number of companies on the internet. This is a new challenge for the industry. Traditional money will disappear, and Bitcoin will be at the base of a legitimate, digital economy.”\n\nNext to Bitcoin, Canton also thinks artificial intelligence may become even smarter than us. “AI will be used in cars, robots, houses and hospitals. It will become a huge economy. People and robots will blend, both physically and digitally. Robot surgeons will be able to perform surgery from distances all over the world. Robodocs will treat you through your smartphone. Exciting times are ahead of us.”\n\nWhen we think back of the technology we knew in the year 2000, we must admit that we felt as if we made a giant leap forward when compared to our technology in the year 1990. That was a correct feeling. Looking at the developments over the past 15 years, we saw a similar leap. It is very exciting to think about the things technology has in store for us in the coming decade. While not every prediction may prove accurate in 2025, we can all agree that the next decade will prove to be another exciting one. What developments do you think we will see in the next ten years? Leave your thoughts and feelings in the comments.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Andrew Barisser is a software and cryptocurrency engineer at Assembly. Previously he was a grad student in biophysics at UCSB, where he says a ""gnawing fascination"" with bitcoin led him to software. In this article, he shares lessons learned from creating his own bitcoin trading bot in the ""shark infested waters"" of Coinbase\'s new exchange.\n\nI’ve recently started trading bitcoins algorithmically on the new Coinbase exchange. After reading about high-frequency trading in the book Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, I decided I’d give it a shot myself, albeit in a clumsier, more amateurish way.\n\nThe experience has been fascinating, both on a technical level, and in a strategic sense. Writing logic that controls money itself is a strange thing. Setting it loose for the first time, knowing that any bug could literally throw away cash, was terrifying.\n\nBitcoin is an incredibly open system that is particularly friendly to no-name developers. The exchanges have open API’s that allow anyone, literally anyone, to trade. There’s no premium access, no expensive trading floor credentials. It’s totally open – I love that.\n\nShark infested waters\n\nAs I’ve designed my trading bot, I’ve come to realize how much strategic depth there is to these sorts of games. The exchanges are already rife with trading bots; these are shark infested waters. Bots dance around each other in a chaotic swirl. They employ so many diverse strategies. It’s like so many microbes competing in the primordial ooze.\n\nEntering into this environment, I had to be immediately cognizant of other bots.\n\nAlgorithmic traders need to occupy a particular niche. They profit from market inefficiencies. In a perfect market, what they do would not be profitable.\n\nIt is precisely because markets, in their native state, are not ideally smooth, continuous, and well functioning, that algorithmic traders may extract any value. In rectifying the little mistakes, the little instances of slippage that occur in markets, one may eke out small profits.\n\nIf a big shark is the unrivalled force of the market itself, the little suckerfish following him, cleaning up the scraps, keeping things tidy, are the algorithmic traders. They too have their place.\n\nAnother paradox is that I cannot reveal my trading strategy without also compromising it.\n\nTo a small extent, explaining my strategy would be an invitation to competitors, for whom the marginal cost of setting up the software is very low. Much more threateningly, however, if my bot’s exact strategy were known, it could be depredated.\n\nIf you could always predict its every step, you could trick it into giving up money again and again. This is something else that keeps my paranoia alive, the fear that someone out there will observe my bot, and in the to and fro of its orders, figure out its strategy.\n\nI imagine myself coming back to my bot, seeing its balance empty, because some mastermind gamed it algorithmically, draining pennies with each cycle.\n\nMarket making 101\n\nOn the other hand, my bot’s strategy is exceedingly conservative, and would be difficult to game. It is basically a sophisticated market maker. It provides liquidity to the Coinbase exchange. This means that it looks at the order book and observes where the orders are thin. Perhaps there is very little order depth on the buy side.\n\nIt can place limit orders, like little traps, at varying depths on the buy and sell sides. It varies the exact way it does this based on recent market conditions. If a large trade is then suddenly executed, it may overwhelm the availability of offers at the best price. Such a large offer may then trigger one of my offers, lying in wait, at a more advantageous price.\n\nThis is market-making 101. It’s pretty much the least opinionated strategy out there, although I have tempered my own implementation with some additional price-prediction logic. On the whole it’s an exceedingly boring strategy.\n\nMarket-making also delivers real social utility. The deeper the liquidity provided by market makers, the more difficult it is to cause erratic spikes in price. Market makers also reduce the bid-ask spread, a concept most people aren’t even aware of: a testament to successful practitioners on Wall Street.\n\nOther bot strategies\n\nOther bots employ widely varying strategies. Some rectify the spread between separate exchanges, a strategy completely dependent on speed. If someone drops 1,000 BTC on Bitfinex, the price on Coinbase plunges in synchrony because someone raced to execute a market order.\n\nOther strategies revolve around tricking other bots, for which there are endless tactics. They often involve elaborate posturing, fooling others’ logics into fatal missteps. Still others are designed to intimidate human beings with massive buy or sell orders. I’m sure still others abound of which I have no idea.\n\nOn a practical level, my bot must be very quick. If it is delayed even by a few seconds between cancelling and placing orders, market conditions can cause the new orders to become inappropriate.\n\nThe orders I place follow a sound logic assuming that the bot has a correct understanding of the state of the order book. This assumption does not hold for long. Within a second, a flurry of significant orders could have skewed the actual order book, such that the new orders I’ve devised are now plain wrong.\n\nI must also be on the lookout for hostile bots, who may place and quickly remove large orders with the intention of tricking other bots. The faster my bot can maintain awareness of the order book, the less susceptible it will be to such tactics. My bot even has additional logic to prevent it from being tricked by fake volume walls from other bots.\n\nHuman speed vs bot speed\n\nIn the pursuit of speed, I’ve had to think about technical details I was not very familiar with. I’ve had to parallelize a lot of mundane, boring functions. I can’t cancel obsolete orders in serial, it would take too long for my JSON requests to go back and forth across the Internet.\n\nBecause Coinbase does not offer a single API endpoint to cancel all orders simultaneously, something I’ve been asking for, I cancel them with many separate requests in parallel. Similarly, Coinbase lacks an endpoint for creating multiple orders at once. So I must issue multiple requests simultaneously. A synchronous solution would take several seconds, which is far too long.\n\nIt’s funny how a human sense of time is wholly inappropriate to that of bots. Even a fraction of a second can be hopelessly long. Trying half as hard, or moving half as fast, don’t guarantee half the profits; they yield zero (or worse). Delving into algorithmic trading, one must inhabit the lifecycle of a bot, stretching one’s own concept of time to milliseconds. It is on this scale that I still see my bot as dumb and slow.\n\nAt least the bot’s awareness of the order book is very fast. It streams a websocket feed of new orders. Each item is a permutation of the order book, so I must maintain the book’s state and make little changes as they arrive.\n\nThis process is also parallelized. It’s actually amazing how fast this is, there are about 20 order permutations per second.\n\nSo my bot mainly provides liquidity. It earns a small but steady amount from this. It holds roughly equal amounts of bitcoins and dollars, so abrupt price changes can leave it with losses in a given denomination. But on the whole it is making decent profits compared to a 50/50 basket of bitcoins/USD.\n\n“Delving into algorithmic trading, one must inhabit the lifecycle of a bot, stretching one’s own concept of time to milliseconds.”\n\nMy bot performs best when volume is high, but price swings are low. As a provider of liquidity, it smoothes the erratic undulations that would otherwise occur without market makers. In this it is providing a useful function, thus high volume periods are the most lucrative. In some cases, sharp swings, back and forth, can cause my bot to persist in holding the wrong asset. Thus it is possible to lose money.\n\nI’ve found that low-volume regimes are the most dangerous. My bot seeks to estimate the trading rate and moderate the depth of its orders accordingly. This limits the risk of being caught in large swings, at the cost of having its orders executed less often.\n\nI’ve also found that there is a significant amount of noise around my balance. As the price oscillates, my bot periodically loses money. It may be losing money 45% of the time. But if it is gaining in the other 55%, it will win massively over the long run.\n\nGiven these odds, measuring the bot on a frequent basis would lead one to observe more instances of loss versus infrequent observations.\n\nIt’s like checking on your stock portfolio. If you had a guaranteed strategy returning 10% per year, but with a normal amount of noise, you’d observe losses almost 50% of the time if you observed your balance often enough, even as you employed a successful strategy. The law of large numbers only works … over longer timescales.\n\nWhile at first this bot was merely a distraction, I’ve come to realize that what it does, albeit simplistically, is really necessary. One of the biggest problems with bitcoin is the way it is traded. The illiquidity of exchanges is a huge problem.\n\nCompare bitcoin trading to that of any real financial asset, and you will observe a world of difference. Financial folks extract tremendous value in the maintenance of efficient markets in other assets.\n\nThis does not just happen magically. Bitcoin needs better functioning markets if it is to attract serious players. It’s also a profit opportunity.\n\nEven at current trading volumes, a lot of value can be captured by smoothing out market fluctuations. If bitcoin were to grow, the need for liquidity would also increase. I’ve learned that infrastructure isn’t just servers and github repos. It’s also financial middlemen who make markets work. The mere fact that I could dabble in this, as nobody, illustrates the wonderful openness of bitcoin.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Medium.

However, the previous home base in California will still function to serve U.S. clients, but the main operations will be relocated, reads Xapo’s blog.\n\nFortune states that Xapo is moving its headquarters to Zurich because of customer privacy concerns. The company had previously relocated its primary deep cold storage vault in Switzerland as well.\n\nStorage servers are housed in radio wave-blocking Faraday cages and secured behind military-grade security controls. Also, Xapo teamed up with Satellogic, satellite surveillance service provider, which is responsible for extra physical security.\n\n“…at the request of our expanding global customer base, now is the time to bring our center of operations closer to the heart of our security infrastructure. The country’s regulatory stability, international neutrality and its deep-seated tradition in global finance also factored into the decision,” states Wences Casares, Xapo founder and CEO.\n\nAlmost a year ago, Xapo completed a Service Organization Control 2 (SOC2) Type I audit. It’s an auditing standard against which service providers can validate their internal security controls. Two different insurance policies against cyber-theft, hacking attacks, physical break-ins and employee dishonesty cover clients’ funds.\n\nIn fact, it proves that Xapo aims at protecting its clients’ funds from all threats:\n\n“…our fiduciaries are protected by our vault, which uses private keys that never touch the client or the Internet and are buried deep within geographically dispersed, heavily guarded locations with multi-signature technology for transaction signing,” reads the announcement. “We have customized security protocols to reduce the likelihood of theft through social engineering, phishing or brute force hacks, and offer full insurance in the unlikely event that these systems are compromised.”\n\nThe contry’s long tradition of protecting both personal and financial privacy attracted Xapo. “The fundamental right to personal privacy is established as part of Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution, and the protection of personal financial information is still maintained today by the provisions of the Swiss Banking Law of 1934,” reads the company’s page “Why Switzerland?” explaining the reasons for such a choice.\n\nIt’s necessary to add that the page reads also about the Swiss spirit of independence which tends to endure because the country itself stays apart from the European Union. Moreover, Xapo pays attention to the fact that Switzerland protects its multiple borders, and national sovereignty with an active military.', 'Canada has long been a hotspot of Bitcoin activity, home to the world’s first Bitcoin ATM and (relatively) widespread Bitcoin adoption. Several exchanges have come and gone, but current competitors for this growing market include CoinTrader, QuadrigaCX, Taurus, and now BitNational.\n\nBitNational got their start at in West Edmonton at North America’s largest mall, where they debuted a Robocoin Bitcoin ATM. They eventually moved on to acquire Bitcoin Brains, Calgary’s oldest and most established Bitcoin brokerage, for $2.1 million. Now they’re poised to become Canada’s largest network of BTMs and brokers ever, thanks to a landmark deal with Waves Coffee House.\n\nWaves was an early supporter of cryptocurrency, being one of the first businesses signed up by the Bitcoin Co-op in addition to the location of the famous Bitcoiniacs BTM. Now, they’ve partnered with BitNational to initiate the largest storefront chain in Canada for buying food, beverages and bitcoins all in one of many convenient locations.\n\nAlthough not all of the Waves locations have BTM’s yet as of the time of this writing, all of the locations that do are now accepting Bitcoin. The growing list includes the Waves at Shelbourne, Chinook, Springborough, London Plaza, Main & 10th, Londsdale, Broadway, and an additional location soon to be announced.\n\n“We see this as the opportune moment to raise serious awareness about Bitcoin,” stated BitNational co-founder Drew Glover. “There is a rapidly expanding group of individuals around the planet beginning to comprehend the significance of this innovative technology. This is not going away anytime soon.”\n\nTo celebrate the launch of this network, a party will be held at each BTM location, every day from May 22-29. There will be draws of free Bitcoin, as well as door prizes and free coffee from the House, and a grand finale at the undisclosed location.\n\nThe announcement that has most Canadian traders excited, however, is BitNational’s promotional plan to sell bitcoins below market price. Starting May 15th, their brokerages, Edmonton ATM, and new BitAccess models being installed at Waves will all be trading at 0% fees, and undercutting all major exchanges until May 31st.\n\n“We are literally going to provide you with more digital cash than the paper cash you give us,” explained Matt Haddon, BitNational’s other co-founder based out of Calgary. This will come as a delight to those engaged in arbitrage, and if enough locals use it, it could impact the price on competing online platforms depending upon their exchange volume.', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by JP Buntinx\n\nMaking Bitcoin more accessible to everyday consumers is one of the great hurdles to overcome if we want to kickstart the digital currency revolution. In saying that, I do mean literally walking into a store and purchasing Bitcoin with local fiat currency. Chip Chap has made that dream come true for Mexican residents, as they can now buy Bitcoin at 5,000 brick-and-mortar locations.\n\nAlso read: Buy and Sell Bitcoin At 4,000 Polish ATMs With Chip Chap\n\nMexico’s Economic Situation\n\nTo put things into perspective a bit, you can not simply walk into a participating brick-and-mortar shop and purchase Bitcoin over the counter. That being said, the actual process involved is not that much different and still very user friendly. In Mexico, it is rather common for retailers to offer an E-Money converting service on their premises.\n\nMexican retailers are facing one major issue when it comes to doing business, and that is collecting revenue. As you may have seen on the news or heard on the radio, Mexico is plagued by acts of delinquency, brought upon merchants by the risk associated with cash transactions. And processing card transactions is always associated with rather high fees.\n\nBut there is also the problem of people who simply cannot or will not pay for their items. Despite best efforts by collection agencies, most of the individuals and companies remain out of reach of law enforcement. Furthermore, even though merchants can process card transactions, as mentioned before, most of the Mexican population does not even have access to a bank account.\n\nPaynet Introduces a New Payment System\n\nAnd to make it even worse for retailers who want to process bank or credit card transactions, the general population mistrusts these types of electronic payments. To come up with a proper solution, Mexican-based company Paynet integrated a tool that lets retailers provide a safe and fast payment solution to customers. And this new payment method is supported by several major commercial brand “chains”.\n\nNot only does this new payment method by Paynet allow retailers to increase their overall revenue, but it also lets customers set up a flexible payment structure. Plus, in doing so, your brand has the right tools to grab a largest market share. And it is through the Paynet infrastructure that Chip Chap now lets you buy Bitcoin from several major store chains.\n\nChip Chap Brings Bitcoin To Mexican Retailers\n\nThe process itself is very straightforward, and can be used at major retailers such as 7-Eleven, Cefemex, Tiny Market and El Asturiano. Customers can generate a barcode with the Chip Chap mobile application, which will then guide you to the nearest participating retailer where you can redeem your Bitcoins.\n\nNot only does this process make Bitcoin more attractive – and potentially popular – in Mexico, but it could also bring additional business and revenue to the participating retailers. And with 5,000 locations participating from the start, Chip Chap is off to the races to stake their claim in the South American Bitcoin space.\n\nBy the looks of it, Mexico could very well become one of the next “Bitcoin hubs” of the world. Even though we hardly see any headlines regarding digital currency in Mexico, the country houses no less than four Bitcoin ATM’s. And the most interesting fact regarding these Bitcoin ATM’s is the fact they have all been installed in 2014.\n\nGenesis Coin seems to be the market leader regarding Bitcoin ATM’s in the country, as they have manufactured three of the four machines in Mexico. Two of these machines are located at the same premises, yet one works with Mexican pesos (MXN) whereas the other one accepts US Dollar (USD).\n\nAll three of the Genesis Coin Bitcoin ATM’s are two-way machines, allowing users to convert fiat currency to Bitcoin and vice versa. The fourth and final machine is manufactured by Lamassu and acts as a one-way Bitcoin ATM for the conversion of fiat currency to Bitcoin. CoinATMRadar has the latest information regarding these Bitcoin ATM’s in Mexico.\n\nHow do you see the Bitcoin situation evolve in Mexico?

The startups will be given funding, free office space, access to business support services and a large network of industry experts and venture capitalists.\n\nThe three digital currency startups join seven other startups in the program, which are made up of peer-to-peer wallets, money management apps, a social network for financial trading and more. All of the startups will receive three months of acceleration, 24,000 Singapore dollars (about $18,000 USD) and access to pilot customers, industry data, APIs and capital from SBC partners, such as DBS Bank, MasterCard and Route 66 Ventures.\n\n“Since the beginning of the year, we have scoured the Asia Pacific and the globe for the most fascinating, innovative and promising fintech startups,” said Startupbootcamp FinTech Global COO, Markus Gnirck. “With 300 applications it shows that fintech in Asia is on the rise to tackle local problems with the potential for global scale. We have met close to 200 startups, visited 12 financial hubs across APAC and beyond. So we feel confident that the 10 teams selected showcase the very best that financial services and technology has to offer.”\n\nBlockchain Apps For Asia\n\nBy digital currency standards, Bitcoin has seen a lot of adoption in China, the Philippines and other parts of Asia, but blockchain apps have not been as prevalent in the region as they have been in places such as Silicon Valley. These startups hope to use the different uses of the blockchain to solve problems unique to the region.Created by former IT professional Roberto Capodieci, DeBuNe dreams big and aims to give Asian companies a more transparent way to conduct business by using the blockchain of alternative cryptocurrency, NXT. The startup, which is focusing on small- to medium-sized businesses, will use the transaction data stored on the blockchain to give businesses a reputation that can boost trade.\n\nCryptosigma, on the other hand, is a more conventional Bitcoin product, as it allows people to send and receive bitcoin and exchange between the digital currency and fiat money. The app does have several extra features that come with the app, such as a debit card, the ability to withdraw money at ATMs and send money to friends and family. The app hopes to give users the benefits of cryptocurrency without having to touch or hold the actual digital currency.\n\nCalling themselves the world\'s first blockchain-chartered company, Otonomos, aims to simplify the process of issuing equity for businesses in Asia. The startup will allow anyone to create company shares on the Bitcoin blockchain. Benefits include sending equity peer-to-peer, being able to crowdfund equity or add new private investors easily. Though in legally uncertain waters, their blockchain “incorporation” service is live.\n\nAll of these startups remain extremely early-stage and experimental, but Head of Emerging Payments at MasterCard Asia Pacific Raj Dhamodharan remains optimistic about the future of the startups in the acceleration program.\n\n“I have been very impressed by the overall quality of the ideas coming out of the Asia Pacific region and am really looking forward to working with these 10 startups to see how they develop over the coming months,"" Dhamodharan said. ""Staying at the forefront of developments in tech will be crucial for financial services over the coming decade.

05/17/2015,"['The Blockchain, best known as the ledger technology underlying Bitcoin transactions, is now being considered for other uses, and in one Central American country it’s about to be used for something completely new: land title tracking.\n\nThe Government of Honduras announced last week a deal with Texas-based Blockchain company Factom Inc. that will see the country implement Factom’s Land Registry Tool to track who owns what within its impoverished borders.\n\nThe deal includes another Texas company by the name of Epigraph which specializes in “extending the power of blockchain technology to build transparent, tamper-proof, next generation title registration solutions for domestic and international organizations.”\n\n“In the past, Honduras has struggled with land title fraud,” Factom President Peter Kirby told Reuters. “The country’s database was basically hacked. So bureaucrats could get in there and they could get themselves beachfront properties.”\n\nIn theory, Kirby claims that by building Blockchain title records with appropriate safeguards, Honduras will have a system that would allow for more secure mortgages, contracts, and mineral rights, without the problems experienced in the immediate past.\n\n“This also gives owners of the nearly 60 percent of undocumented land, an incentive to register their property officially.”\n\nInteresting solution\n\nWords probably don’t properly describe the level of endemic corruption in Honduras, although figures always help: according to the World Transparency Index Honduras ranked 104th in the world for corruption, a figure that is lower that large swathes of Africa.\n\nTransparency International in part makes this observation:\n\nCorruption-related challenges in the country are a result of widespread nepotism and clientelism, entrenched organised crime activities, and political corruption. Corruption takes many forms (for example, bribery, favouritism and undue influence) and affects many of the country’s sectors and institutions, such as the public administration and the education sector.\n\nSo is the Blockchain the right solution?\n\nFull details on how it will work on the ground aren’t entirely clear, with Factom saying that the pilot program will be run until the end of this year, with the ultimate goal of rolling it out in full in 2016.\n\nThat the Government of Honduras is willing to at least try using this solution is a positive step forward for the country, but will none the less need wider support than a few corruption fighters at the top of Government.\n\nWith 2FA support requiring all parties in a transaction to authenticate land transfer the potential is there for it to be a more secure solution, but in a country with the world’s highest homicide rate, that’s only as good as landholders not being tortured for key access, and you don’t have to watch a really, really badly written episode of CSI: Cyber to know that.', 'The obvious question about bitcoins is who invented them. The obvious answer – certainly obvious to me – is that it was not Satoshi Nakamoto. For sure the arcane treatise that launched the bitcoin concept was authored by a person of this Japanese-sounding name. But after nearly 27 years watching the world from a base in Tokyo, I claim some understanding of Japanese culture: my strong instinct is that Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for someone who is anything but Japanese. Japan is far too regulated for the sort of “freelance activity” involved here. And if Japanese citizens took part at a corporate or governmental level, they would present their role in quite a different manner – taking fully traceable credit if they were proud of their role.\n\nAll in all, I am convinced that Nathaniel Popper of the New York Times got it right last week in naming Nick Szabo, a Hungarian-American former student at George Washington University, as the real inventor. But this only raises further questions.\n\nHere are some of them:', 'Houman B Shadab is a professor of law at New York Law School. Here, he discusses what itBit\'s recent banking law charter means for other digital currency exchanges operating in the US and beyond.\n\nSince their inception, bitcoin exchanges have operated under a fog of legal uncertainty. Just one day after the New York-based exchange itBit announced it had obtained a banking law charter giving it the ability to operate in all 50 states, a California official called that into question.\n\nAlmost every state has its own licensing requirements for traditional money transmitters that include payment processors and money transfer firms like Western Union. The safe but costly route for bitcoin exchanges would be to obtain a license in each state that requires it for virtual currency businesses. But it\'s unclear which do.\n\nTexas, for example, stated that transmitting digital currencies like bitcoin doesn\'t require a license in its state. Other states, like New York and California, are still in the midst of passing virtual currency-specific licensing requirements, making it a question of what bitcoin exchanges should do until those licensing laws are finalized. Prominent bitcoin exchange Coinbase, for example, at least for some time operated in New York and California without a license in either state – and probably didn\'t need one.\n\nA trust charter\n\nItBit was able to bypass much of the uncertainty about being required to obtain state money transmitter licenses. It accomplished this by obtaining a trust charter under New York banking law, which is generally required of exchanges in the state.\n\nUnder New York banking law, a trust company is a type of financial institution technically distinct from a bank. A trust company has all of the powers of a bank to take deposits and make loans, alongside certain fiduciary powers such as acting as an agent for governmental bodies. Firms organized as trust companies in New York include the securities custodian The Deposity Trust Company, the wealth and asset manager Northern Trust, and the Bank of New York Mellon.\n\n“Being regulated as a bank would be too expensive and require a level of regulation and oversight ill-suited for a digital currency exchange.”\n\nItBit, in particular, is authorized as a limited purpose trust company. This means it is not allowed to make loans or take deposits.\n\nTo obtain the charter, itBit had to meet the very strict requirements of ordinary New York chartered commercial banks and subject itself to ongoing oversight.\n\nHowever, itBit is not required to obtain insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and it is subject to a much lower level of minimum capital – $2m – versus at least $50m for a commercial bank.\n\nDespite being organized under New York\'s banking law, itBit is not a bank in the ordinary sense and it not regulated by any federal banking authority such as the Federal Reserve or the FDIC. Being regulated as a bank would be too expensive and require a level of regulation and oversight ill-suited for a digital currency exchange.\n\nItBit does, however, indirectly provide FDIC insurance to its clients\' dollars by holding them at a separate FDIC-insured bank. It might be subject to some degree of FDIC oversight or compliance obligations indirectly, but that depends on how closely itBit and its banking partner work together. Bitcoin firms Coinbase and Circle similarly provide FDIC insurance to their customers\' dollar accounts.\n\nMoney transmission\n\nWith a trust charter under New York banking law, itBit is basically in the clear when it comes to needing a state license to operate as a money transmitter.\n\nUnder New York\'s traditional money transmitter statute and its pending Bitlicense, a company chartered under its banking law does not need a license. Nationwide, states generally don\'t require a firm chartered even under another state\'s banking laws to get a money transmitter license.\n\nFor example, going across the Hudson River, New Jersey excludes any federal or state chartered bank from being required to get a money transmitter license in its state, and defines a bank to include a trust company like itBit. Moving westward, things get easier: Illinois is explicit about excluding trust companies chartered in any state from needing a money transmitter license.\n\nBut it\'s when we get out to California that things get a little gnarly.\n\nCalifornia does not require a money transmitter license for trust companies authorized under California law. But unlike New Jersey or Illinois, that statutory exemption does not explicitly apply to out-of-state trusts. It\'s therefore not a surprise that a California official would question whether itBit\'s New York trust charter is enough for it to do business with California clients.\n\nThe Golden State\n\nNonetheless, itBit seems to be on solid ground to operate in the Golden State.\n\nCalifornia recognizes that out-of-state trusts may conduct business within its borders, and that out-of-state banks (which include trusts) don\'t need an office to operate in the state. As an electronic exchange, it\'s unlikely that itBit will be opening an office in California, or any other state, in the near future.\n\nLikewise, the laws that permit banks to open branches in other states through nationwide reciprocity don\'t fit the operational model of itBit.\n\nAn out-of-state trust authorized to do business in California thus likely qualifies for the money transmitter exemption that applies to trust companies generally.\n\nIndeed, there seems to be no precedent or policy reasons for requiring a regulated banking trust like itBit to obtain a money transmitter license. But it would be good to have greater certainty about the issue. Washington State seems to have a similar snag.\n\nAnd Louisiana, at least by statute, requires an out-of-state bank to be a ""federally insured depository"" institution to qualify for a licensing exemption. It\'s not clear whether itBit fits that description.\n\nItBit\'s road to obtaining a trust charter under New York banking law was long and costly. It also proved to be savvy. In one fell swoop, it gave the firm a basis to operate nationally while building confidence in the bitcoin ecosystem. Instead of getting a money transmitter license in all states that require one, chartering as a limited purpose trust in one state may be the best way for bitcoin exchanges to do business across the country and attract partnerships with traditional banks.\n\nSo it\'s no surprise that upon announcing its trust charter that itBit also disclosed a $25m round of financing. By doing so, it demonstrated the fundraising benefits of being a regulated firm and that financial institutions are not always on the hunt for minimal regulation.\n\nNonetheless, there seems to be some uncertainty about whether itBit – a banking law trust – automatically qualifies to do business without a money transmitter license in certain states. But that uncertainty should, more than anything else, lead lawmakers to reform the patchwork quilt of US state money transmitter laws.\n\nThis can be done by adopting uniform standards among states, establishing a single federal regime, or granting reciprocity for bitcoin firms licensed as a money transmitter or virtual currency business in another state.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Houman’s blog.

A six-month joint investigation between law enforcement in Australia and the United States, which involved law enforcement going undercover as weapons dealers, has resulted in 17 arrests internationally.\n\nIn September 2014, the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) identified a 33-year-old US-based dark net seller of weapons to a “worldwide client base,” according to a press release from the Australian Federal Police (AFP).\n\nThe arrest came as the result of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) providing “relevant information” to HSI, “[commencing] a covert operation using the online alias account” in order to identify users trying to buy illegal weapons.\n\nSecurity researcher Gwern Branwen has been following the investigation since April and believes he knows the user account of the arrested weapons seller that was used by HSI. His evidence was posted on DarknetMarkets Subreddit.\n\nIn April, the US Department of Justice arrested US-based Justin Moreira, 21, and charged him with the purchase of a Walther PPK/S .380 calibre pistol and a silencer from a federal undercover agent sometime after January 2015 for about $2,500 in bitcoin, according to a DoJ press release.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Moreira used the acount “jd497” to purchase the weapon.\n\nThe account was on dark net marketplace Agora, where the the username “weaponsguy,” according to Branwen, was used by law enforcement. The guns, at least according to the UPS tracking number, were shipped from Montana.\n\nHSI agents used the account to complete six sales made to addresses in Australia. 15 search warrants were received through February and March, leading to the arrest of four suspects.\n\nThe all male suspects include a 25-year-old from Liverpool, New South Wales; a 26-year-old from Gladstone, Queensland; and a 24-year-old and 25-year-old from the Australian Capital Territories, all of whom will appear in court June 25.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\n34 charges have been brought against the suspects, covering many offenses, not all weapons related.\n\n“Four illegal firearms, ammunition, two clandestine laboratories, precursor chemicals, methamphetamines, pseudoephedrine, steroids, computer equipment and mobile telephones were seized,” according to AFP.\n\n“On a global level, the operation led to 17 arrests across the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. These arrests resulted in the further seizures of firearms, ballistic armor, illicit drugs and $80,000 in bitcoins,” a Customs statement said.\n\nAn agent close to the investigation clarified to the Australian authorities commitment that they will strike down on dark net weapons sales.\n\n“HSI will maintain its unrelenting commitment to secure land borders as well as virtual borders from individuals seeking to prosper from the sale and/or purchase of firearms, drugs, and other illicit items with little regard for national security,” special agent in charge of HSI Newark Kevin Kelly said.\n\n“Anyone who mistakenly thinks that they can get away with these types of crimes by hiding in the endless depths of the internet must know that HSI will seek them out and bring them to justice.”\n\nAccording to authorities, this investigation highlights the success law enforcement can have when investigating dark net based illicit activity.\n\n“Despite this great result, Customs and Border Protection will continue to actively monitor and target illicit transnational online trade, and this operation highlights the fact that our efforts are supported by national and international law enforcement partners,” CBPS National Director Investigations, Assistant Commissioner Lancaster said.\n\n“People using these sites should not be fooled by claims of online anonymity; each transaction builds up a global web of intelligence which international partners are using to target you.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by Sergio Schout\n\nWe recently published an article about blockchain-esque technology and its uses for a couple sectors. What we mean by “blockchain-esque” is that tracking, ownership of goods, etc. can be traced through an open database. This “database”, some might call it the world’s largest filing cabinet, can be utilised by everyone. For example: If you buy a new pair of Nike’s and you want to know where they came from and if they were created ethically.\n\nAlso Read: All About: The Blockchain Part Four\n\nHowever, this kind of technology can be implemented in a lot of other sectors. Some of the obvious positive contributions this kind of system provides are: tracking products from manufacturing to destination and who buys said product, combatting fake products and creates a transparent way of doing business in general.\n\n· Insurance, cars and police force.\n\nThe blockchain offers a lot more for everyday uses and security. The blockchain technology is such a versatile tool that it can be used with every kind of database and data storage. One of these everyday uses is for insurance purposes. The blockchain-esque technology can store who has which kind of insurance or if a person has an insurance. Now some insurance types are more suitable than others. For example, it might be interesting for the insurance company to know what kind of fire insurance person X has.\n\nCar insurance is a better kind of insurance where blockchain technology could be very beneficial; especially when the person’s car and other information are linked to it. That way police can check with a couple of keystrokes if owner paid his or her car insurance and if said insurance is linked to that particular vehicle.\n\nThis kind of database will generate an additional positive aspect for the police force, who is being questioned about their profiling. With this blockchain-esque database at their disposal, they can check the car registration number and see if everything matches. If said car does not conform with the data on the blockchain, a stop would be warranted. That also negates certain profiling methods that can be viewed a racially biased. For example: pulling over a driver of a Mercedes because of “skin colour”.\n\nBy integrating these blockchain-esque technologies and also linking them together, the police will have an easier time to identify real threats. Today, the police forces have to just “go with their gut feeling” or falling back to some fairly out-dated profiling methods (which can be wrong at times). They also have access to limited data that may or may not be up-to-date. The Blockchain-like technology can enhance and better show the information.\n\nAn apt example where the blockchain could have prevented a lot of trouble for a lady in the Netherlands was during a routine police stop. According to the documentation she hadn’t paid the car insurance. The police didn’t believe her that she did pay for her car insurance; even when she showed them the bank transfer data. Nevertheless she got booked and spent a night in jail because “she was acting very aggressive toward the police”. Now if said police had access to the aforementioned blockchain-like technology, it would be quite clear that said lady did in fact paid her car insurance but that the paperwork was delayed.\n\n· Yes we can; but should we?\n\nWhistle-blowers like Snowden and others have shown us that governments have the uncanny ability to be “data hoarders”. Blockchain technology at its core promotes transparency and openness, so how do we protect certain data?\n\nOne option is to go for some kind of the so-called “multi-signature” option, where certain parties have their keys and accessibility is based on democratic principles. This means that there needs to be a majority of the group that allows access. For example: the insurance company has a key, the police have a key, you have a key, the government has a key and the company that offers their blockchain technology has a key. That way, if information is requested, every “key holder” can respond with a “yes” or “no” vote (this can be implemented in different ways).\n\nIt does seem like an elegant way of doing things but reality is a lot messier. Most of us will see a huge problem with said fictitious system. The government and police force will “work together” to get said information and maybe convince (or make some kind of law) that companies have to share said data with them unconditionally.\n\nSo some tough questions that we will face in the near future will be: We can implement said structure, or a more complex one in our everyday lives; but because we can should we do it? Aren’t we going to progress to some kind of Orwellian future where governments know everything about everybody if we aren’t careful? Who should have access to our data and should we have some kind of “veto” to deny some “party or other key holder” from accessing our data? Will that action not provoke some kind of retaliation, especially when said person denies a governmental organisation access?\n\n· Conclusion.\n\nRegardless of the possible 1984 scenario that may or may not come to pass; these are quite exciting times for Bitcoin and the blockchain technology. There are nearly infinite uses for blockchain technology in our everyday lives; from tracking your luggage to verifying the origin of products.\n\nThere are even some start-ups in the crypto community that are currently looking toward blockchain-esque solutions for all kinds of problems, like combating counterfeit products. Whatever the future may hold, we will have to answer some very hard questions concerning privacy, transparency, accessibility, openness, etc. and how all that fits in an everyday setting.\n\nHow would you address the problem between private and information sharing?\n\nImage 1 link:whatishomeimprovement.com\n\nImage 2 link: www.enhancedinsurance.com', '?? ????? ??? ????????? ?????????? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ????????? ??? ??????? - ??????????? ?? ??????? ???? ?????????? ??? «????????? ??????????» (Bitcoin) ???? ?????????? ????????? - ???????? ??? ???????? ??? ???????? ??? ??? ??????????? ??? «?????? ???????»\n\n????? ?????????: ? ???????? ??? ?. ????? ????????? ???? ??????? ????? ???

Spännande med en helt ny sorts digital valuta, men samtidigt mycket riskfyllt, enligt ekonomen Claes Hemberg.', 'More than half a year ago, I became the first citizen on the blockchain, which was the second pilot project of Bitcoin 2.0 platform Bitnation. It was invented by Chris Ellis from World Crypto Network and Bitnation founder Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, who I met at a meetup last October.\n\nCitizen of the blockchain\n\nWith a group of people from the meetup that could confirm my existence in time and space, we documented it with photos, signed it with PGP keys, time-stamped and hashed it, and put it on the blockchain. The PGP encryption and the blockchain make the ID secure.\n\nThe event made me feel honored and also responsible to promote what is possible with the blockchain, such as providing infrastructure like land registry in developing countries, comparable to how MPesa enabled people to leapfrog banks. Therefore, a few weeks afterwards, I invented Blockchain Girl, which I use to spread everything from my interaction with the blockchain to whatever else I see as important.\n\nPeople can create their own blockchain IDs themselves to mutually verify their existence. This is useful if you have some misgivings about being documented by the state or if it is not possible to do so in a normal way; for example, in war zones, for stateless people, when there is a lack of infrastructure, or - as it is up to you which data you include, like full name, address, photo etc. - for persecutes and refugees.\n\nAll tools are available and the steps of creating a blockchain ID are explained by Chris Ellis and at Bitnation`s Github. Everyone with an internet connection would have equal access to such transparent services on the blockchain, irrespective of the country they happen to be born in. The blockchain could be used to better organize libertarian or local communities like seasteading or the new Liberland state. The efficacy, accuracy and lower price to maintain this system can potentially disrupt traditional governments, similar to how Bitcoin is disrupting traditional finance.\n\nIdeally, blockchain IDs would be voluntarily created by private individuals for low cost, so people everywhere could create and mutually sign their IDs. Instead of being backed by government, the ID’s strength would be based on the social network that supports it.\n\nThe blockchain ID will form the basis of the coming Bitnation-Blocknet-Horizon platform, Bitnation Pangea: When people register, they will get a blockchain ID and are part of a reputation system on the blockchain, comparable to Ebay. People will be able to have different accounts for different aspects of life, so they can have several blockchain IDs for work, travel etc.\n\n‘Blockchain Baby’\n\nIn the meantime, there has been another blockchain ID created to serve as the birth certificate for the founder’s nephew, “Blockchain Baby” Sion.\n\nSusanne Tarkowski Tempelhof explained:\n\n“My brother and I were born in the same country, to the same parents. Yet, we had different nationalities - and now - 30 years on - we still have different nationalities. It boggled my mind that these arbitrary lines drawn in the sand would dictate what rights we had in life. Hence, being able to create a birth certificate for my brother’s son, and my Godson, baby Sion, on the blockchain was a significant event - at last a solution that treats every person as equal, regardless for where in the world they’ve been born.""\n\nIf you are further interested, you can look into the other blockchain projects at Github, see how the blockchain can be useful for your country, join our ambassador network, and meet me at the many blockchain related meetups in London.', 'Enigma lui Satoshi Nakamoto si a nasterii Bitcoin este unul din marile mistere ale erei digitale, spune Nathaniel Popper, cel care in ultimul an a lucrat la o carte pe acest subiect.\n\nCautarea lui Satoshi Nakamoto, misteriosul creator al Bitcoin, i-a captivat captivat chiar si pe cei care cred ca moneda virtuala este doar un fel de schema piramidala.\n\nLegenda a pornit de la doar cateva lucruri certe: Cineva care a folosit numele Satoshi Nakamoto a lansat software-ul pentru Bitcoin la inceputul anului 2009 si a comunicat cu userii monedei digitale ce prindea atunci viata prin email, niciodata prin telefon sau in persoana.\n\nApoi, in 2011, chiar cand Bitcoin capata tot mai multa atentie, emailurile s-au oprit.\n\nBrusc, Satoshi a disparut, dar povestile s-au amplificat.\n\nIn ultimul an, lucrand la o carte despre istoria Bitcoin, povesteste, in New York Times , Nathaniel Popper, a fost dificil sa nu fiu prins in sarada mistica a identitatii lui Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nChiar cand Popper isi incepea lucrul la cartea sa, revista Newsweek a facut valuri cu un articol in martie 2014 in care sustinea ca Satoshi este un inginer de peste 60 de ani ce traieste in suburbiile orasului Los Angeles.\n\nDupa o zi de la publicare, mai toti cei initiati din lumea Bitcoin au ajuns la concluzia ca revista indica spre persoana gresita.\n\nMulti din comunitatea Bitcoin spun ca, pentru a respecta dorinta clara a creatorului Bitcoin de a ramane anonim, nu vor ca acest vrajitor digital sa fie demascat.\n\nDar, chiar si printre cei care spun acest lucru, putini sunt care rezista fara sa dezbata indiciile lasate in urma de fondatorul Bitcoin.\n\nIn timp ce aveam discutii despre acesta cu programatori si intreprinzatori puternic implicati in Bitcoin, spune Popper, am intalnit o credinta raspandita, dar putin promovata, ca cele mai convingatoare dovezi duc la un american retras, de origine ungara, pe nume Nick Szabo.\n\nSzabo este aproape la fel de misterios ca si Satoshi. Dar, in decursul cercetarilor, Popper a gasit noi indicii, si chiar a dat peste Szabo la o intalnire privata a antreprenorilor si programatorilor.\n\nLa acel eveniment, Szabo a negat ca ar fi Satoshi, la fel cum a facut-o si in alte comunicari pe mail cu Popper.\n\nDar a recunoscut ca nu exista nicio indoiala ca, in trecut, a fost parte a micului grup de oameni ce, timp de decenii, lucrand impreuna sau in competitie, au pregatit fundatia monedei Bitcoin si au creat multe componente ce au ajuns mai tarziu in Bitcoin.\n\nCea mai importanta contributie a lui Szabo a fost un predecesor al Bitcoin cunoscut ca „bit gold” ce a reusit lucruri similare cu Bitcoin folosind instrumente matematice si criptografice similare.\n\nProbabil este imposibil de dovedit identitatea lui Satoshi pana cand persoana (sau persoanele) din spatele cortinei Bitcoin decid sa iasa la lumina si sa dovedeasca detinerea conturilor electronice vechi ale lui Satoshi, spune Popper.\n\nDar, in acest moment, identitatea creatorului nu mai este importanta pentru viitorul Bitcoin.

The emerging financial tech industry, dubbed fintech, now threatens to grab $4.7 trillion in revenue and $470 billion in profits from traditional Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs recently predicted.\n\nThe good news for Silicon Valley is that deep-pocketed Wall Street firms will seek to stave off the competition by throwing money at the space through investments and acquisitions, experts said.\n\nAberdeen Asset Management, which manages $500 billion in assets, recently tasked its board\'s innovation committee to study the problem and to scout for financial technologies to buy, said co-founder and CEO Martin Gilbert.\n\n""My point is, let\'s not be complacent about this,"" Gilbert said. ""Let\'s not assume that Google is not going to enter asset management because it\'s a regulated industry.""\n\nAberdeen is not alone. In January, the New York Stock Exchange announced a strategic investment in Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet provider. And last month, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that ""Silicon Valley is coming"" in a letter to shareholders.\n\n""There are hundreds of start-ups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking,"" Dimon wrote in the letter, which sought to reassure investors that the behemoth bank is prepared to deal with the problem.\n\nAnand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights, which researches private companies for interested investors, predicts Wall Street investments and acquisitions in financial technology start-ups will take off in the next ""18 months and beyond.""\n\n""Right now we\'re in the awareness phase,"" Sanwal said. Companies that fail to act risk ""death by a thousand cuts,"" he added.\n\nGilbert said Aberdeen is interested in technologies that will allow clients to manage their portfolios and trade electronically. Other technologies that have piqued Wall Street\'s interest include newfangled lending platforms, such as LendingClub, electronic payment systems, such as bitcoin, and computer-generated investing advice, such as Wealthfront.\n\n*Alternative lending platforms, which often match non-bank lenders to borrowers, are doing well in part because they are popular with small-business owners, which can have a tough time borrowing from banks. In January, for example, alternative lenders generated 62% of all small-business loans, compared to just 21% by big banks, Goldman said in a recent series of reports about the impact emerging technologies on the financial services industry.\n\n*New payments systems like bitcoin threaten traditional banking because they allow people to transfer money faster and with lower fees than banks. The industry could cost banks $84 billion, Goldman said in the same research series.\n\n*Start-ups like Wealthfront and Betterment compete with brokers and wealth managers by providing cheaper, computer-generated investment advice. The two companies collectively boast more than $3 billion in assets under management.\n\nCast members of TV\'s ""Silicon Valley"": Zach Woods, left, T.J.

Today, Bitcoin Tracker One started trading on Nasdaq Stockholm.\n\n“NASDAQ OMX Stockholm decides to officially list 1 Exchange Traded Note issued by XBT Provider AB with effect from 2015-05-18,” announced XBT Provider AB on Friday. “We are proud to offer the world’s first “Bitcoin tracker” to be traded on a regulated exchange,” states the XBT Provider website. “By enabling this easy and secure way to invest in Bitcoin we hope to have eliminated the boundaries that earlier prevented individuals and companies from being able to actively invest in what we believe to be the future of money.”\n\n“The world’s first Bitcoin-based security on a regulated exchange has been launched in Sweden,” notes the Swedish edition of the English language news site The Local. “The digital currency began trading on the Stockholm market on Monday.”\n\nBitcoin Tracker One is an “Exchange Traded Note” (ETN) designed to provide investors with convenient access to the returns of the underlying asset, U.S. dollar (USD) per bitcoin, less investor fees. The average dollar exchange rate of bitcoin from the exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp and OKCoin provides the underlying reference price. A detailed breakdown of the value of Bitcoin Tracker One is given here.\n\n“Young guys will probably buy it. Bitcoin stands for a new digital world, free from the banking system. It’s almost somewhat political,” savings analyst Claes Hemberg of the Avanza bank told Swedish news wire TT.\n\nThe ETN could become an attractive investment option for those traditional investors who want to speculate on the dollar exchange rate of bitcoin with traditional investment vehicles, rather than going through the hassle of buying and holding bitcoin directly. In particular, traditional financial instruments such as Bitcoin Tracker One offer easy ways to short bitcoin and profit from price drops. However, all investments are risky, and this is no exception.\n\n“You shouldn’t put more money towards bitcoin than you would bet on a horse race. You can win, but also lose everything,” Hemberg warned.\n\nOther similar bitcoin investment vehicles are Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), now trading on the OTC Markets Group’s OTCQX exchange with the symbol GBTC, and the upcoming Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), which will be available to investors on NASDAQ with the ticker COIN.\n\nXBT Provider AB (publ) is a public limited liability company formed in Sweden and incorporated under Swedish law, with statutory seat in Stockholm. The XBT Provider website states that the company is backed and guaranteed by bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer and service provider KnCGroup.

The record-holder for the most well-financed Bitcoin company in history, 21 Inc.’s $116 million venture capital treasure chest is now starting to bear fruit. Today, 21 Inc. has released plans for their new and revolutionary Bitcoin mining chip called the 21 BitShare, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Age of Mobile Mining is About to Begin\n\n21 Inc has a very innovative view of the future called “embedded mining”. In this company model, consumer devices like smartphones will be mining Bitcoin silently in the background while receiving small distributions from a managed pool of bitcoin earnings. This evolving vision of the future leads to a new “infinite stream of digital currency,” creating a growth of micro-transactions. This model will facilitate a new form of digital commerce and interconnectivity that the current traditional financial system can only dream of.\n\n“Bitcoin will ultimately be seen as a fundamental system resource on par with CPU, bandwidth, hard drive space and RAM,” states Mr. Srinivasan in the company’s blog. It’s a notion of “Bitcoin for convenience, not profit.”\n\nAlso read: IBM and Federal Reserve Want to Create a Bitcoin Knock-Off\n\nThe company looks to make the bulk of its profits from chip sales, but also sees a model where they share the mining profits with users. A profit-sharing program can work as a subsidy for users over the long-term, helping to pay for expensive technology.\n\n“The iPhone’s subsidy model allowed a reduced upfront price point, allowing millions of people to get started with a smartphone without a down-payment. We believe the 21 BitShare chip will enable a new generation of bitcoin-subsidized devices to help get the next 1 billion online,” said a 21 Inc. spokesperson.\n\nIn other news, 21 Inc., is also announcing that former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.

We are the 99%, right? Maybe in more ways than one, as the table would go on to show. It makes it all seem very clear to me that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Rumor has it that Bitcoin’s original creator, the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto himself, collected the first one million Bitcoins for himself. This would leave a mere 20 million available to the rest of us. And current Bitcoin moguls The Winklevoss Twins have said that they own about 1% of all the bitcoins in existence, as of 2013. That may give you a window into how the bitcoin wealth tends to get distributed.\n\n99% of the Bitcoin Addresses have no Bitcoin Wealth\n\nThe table below is a snapshot of where the Bitcoin community, based upon all of the bitcoin addresses ever created, is when seen through the distribution of total bitcoin wealth. That it is so precise about the overall wallet content of Bitcoin community is somewhat startling, but a publicly distributed digital ledger should do that fairly well, I reckon. Anyway, this economic community photograph comes from around March 31st of 2015. That was when the amount of Bitcoin was set to pass the 14 million mark, which is exactly 2/3 of all of the bitcoins that will ever be created.\n\nAs you can see, this shows how top-heavy the Bitcoin community is. First, there are a lot of bitcoin addresses that are either dead, abandoned or lost due to forgetting passwords/keys/usernames/, etc. Or just tens of millions of test addresses that are empty and never were destined to hold bitcoin, just to exist. Almost 99% of all the bitcoin addresses have less than one-tenth of a bitcoin, which is less than $24 USD worth at present. This is pretty startling to see if you aren’t expecting it. It is hard to compare to any other store of value easily or fairly since most do not have a finite unit count built-in.\n\nAlso read: Vaultoro Opens Swiss Gold Vaults to Bitcoiners\n\nThe U.S. Government has no problem making trillions of brand new U.S. Dollars every year since the inflation is spread throughout the global economy. Being the “global reserve currency” certainly has its advantages, mainly you have an unlimited credit card the rest of the world’s economies help you pay off every day. Exporting inflation is so sweet! Should anything that has lost over 98% of its value over the last century be considered a “store of value?” Gold also does not have a finite limit in its mining, and there are several mining operations worldwide working on producing more 24 hours a day, seven days a week. How much gold there is also is unknown. So how much concern there should be about such an imbalance is questionable.\n\nFunny thing is this table also may help debunk the rumor of Nakamoto holding 1 million Bitcoins. The three addresses at the top of the Bitcoin address mountain have less than half of a million BTC held. Therefore, he would have to spread that large cache across several addresses, which may or may not be the case. This at least makes the rumor slightly less likely, but we may never know.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nBitcoin hoarding is common since many believe Bitcoin value is only a fraction of what it will be in future years, as production slows and demand increases over time. The amount of Bitcoin out there versus the amount of daily transactions of BTC shows this fairly clearly. The mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin has been slow if still progressing steadily. These numbers may indeed change greatly as more fiat currencies crumble under the weight of their own debt, more merchants integrate with Bitcoin, and its convenience improves in the marketplace.\n\nThe lack of Bitcoin funds issue is not an Australian problem, as I’ve reported before. Australia’s bitcoin market is so strong that every Australian, numbering almost 25 million strong, could have $15 in bitcoin if the market were spread throughout the citizenry. The people in Australia, who are into bitcoin, aren’t just giving lip service to it. They are putting their money where their mouth is. The rest of us need to look in the mirror on this one.\n\nAre Satoshi Nakamoto and The Winklevoss Twins the three addresses at the top of the Bitcoin wealth mountain? Will the next bull market change these numbers dramatically? Will the Bitcoin community experience a trickle-down economic windfall down the road when the heavy hitters have hoarded enough of a profit for being early adopters, and sell off their fortunes? Stay tuned.\n\nI don’t know what to make of it, but I hope the future has a less centralized collection of wealth for the world’s leading centralized digital currency. The carpet doesn’t match the drapes.\n\nImage provided by Quora and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nShould we all have more invested in a Bitcoin address than $24? What does this mean to you?

This comes just months after Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) revealed that its subsidiary, the New York Stock Exchange, had invested in Bitcoin wallet and platform Coinbase. NYSE is expected to make a related announcement soon regarding advancements in the arena.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that was created in 2009. Unlike government-issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority, and no physical bitcoins exist. Balances of the currency are kept using public and private keys (long strings of numbers and letters), and all transactions are stored on public ledgers called blockchains.\n\nSince its creation, Bitcoin has developed a rather poor reputation in the media and among investors. It has often been associated with illegal activity and theft and has proven extremely volatile. The currency was priced at about $1,000 per bitcoin at the start of 2014, and by the end of the year, it had fallen to $300.\n\n""So much of the conversation surrounding digital currency to date has centered on its use in criminal activity, but the narrative seems to be shifting now, with people realizing there is real potential for the technology to improve company operations and customer experience,"" said Emily Spaven, managing editor of CoinDesk, a news platform focused on digital currency.\n\nNasdaq has honed in on the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin in its endeavors. The blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions that have ever been made. It is entirely unalterable and, according to Duke University economist Campbell Harvey, the ""most secure"" blockchain there is. ""It\'s different than a database, where you can edit. There\'s no editing of the entries into the ledger,"" he said. ""Blockchain technology has the potential to replace stock exchanges as we know them.""\n\nNasdaq will pilot the project in Nasdaq Private Market, a marketplace launched in 2014 to handle pre-IPO trading among private companies. The Wall Street Journal reports the platform has more than 75 companies signed up. ""This is an experiment, but they see the viability of the technology,"" Harvey said.\n\nThe technology will create an equity management capability that allows private companies to facilitate the issuance and transfer of securities. It will provide pre-IPO companies a complete visualization of who has shares and at what valuation, potentially replacing traditional systems of record keeping that are typically performed manually using certificates and often outsourced to third parties.\n\nNasdaq\'s trials are in the very early stages; however, they are part of an enterprise-wide initiative that could have bigger implications later down the line. The firm\'s technologies power one in 10 of the world\'s securities transactions, meaning success in blockchain could have an impact not only on its own exchanges but on trades all over the world.', 'In late January 2014, Wences Casares, the Argentinian entrepreneur, pulled his white Subaru Outback into an elegant, understated strip mall off Woodside Avenue, one of the main roads winding down out of the hills above Palo Alto. Wences was looking forward to an early breakfast at Woodside Bakery and Cafe, a favorite spot for Silicon Valley deal making that provided a bit more seclusion than the restaurants down in Palo Alto.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe man waiting for him inside was often referred to as the most well connected person in the Valley, and not just because he had cofounded LinkedIn, the business-networking site. Reid Hoffman’s girth and bearing hinted at his larger-than-life character. After studying at Oxford, on the elite Marshall Scholarship, Reid had been brought on by Pete Thiel to help build PayPal—Thiel called him the “firefighter-in-chief.” Reid later introduced Thiel to Mark Zuckerberg, which led to Thiel making the first major investment in Facebook. By that point, Reid had already begun building LinkedIn with some colleagues from an earlier startup. Reid Hoffman Photo: Flickr user Joi Ito When Wences first met Reid, not long after arriving in Silicon Valley, Reid was looking for new investments and serving on the boards of startups. The breakfast at Woodside Cafe was one of their periodic check-ins. Wences, who had founded the digital wallet company Lemon, was finalizing the investments in his new Bitcoin wallet and storage company, Xapo, and was eager to tell Reid about his plans. Hoffman, an expert on social networks, had been captivated by arguments he’d been hearing about the power of the incentives built into Bitcoin—primarily through the mining process—that encouraged new users to join the decentralized network while also encouraging powerful miners to do what was best for the system so as not to see their holdings lose value. “That’s actually super important,” Hoffman would say later. “That makes it less of a pure technological marvel and more of a potential social movement.” Hoffman didn’t see too many consumers complaining about their credit cards failing them. If that wouldn’t get people using this new kind of network, he wondered, what would? But Hoffman had remained skeptical and was particularly put off by the suggestion that Bitcoin would replace credit cards—the possibility that all the bank research reports were talking about. Credit cards seemed to work pretty well in Hoffman’s estimation. Despite the security risks and costs to merchants, he didn’t see too many consumers complaining about their credit cards failing them. If that wouldn’t get people using this new kind of network, Reid wondered, what would?\n\nadvertisement\n\nHoffman had finally gotten a satisfying answer to this at a dinner with Wences and Paypal CEO David Marcus and a few other Valley power players late in 2013. Wences agreed with Hoffman that Bitcoin was unlikely to be catch on as a payment method anytime soon. But for now, Wences believed that Bitcoin would first gain popularity as a globally available asset, similar to gold. Like gold, which was also not used in everyday transactions, Bitcoin’s value was as a digital asset where people could store wealth. This was enough to get Hoffman to go home and ask his wealth adviser—the Valley’s most prominent money manager, Divesh Makan—to buy some Bitcoins for his portfolio. When Wences sat down for breakfast with Reid at Woodside Cafe, he told him about the progress he was making with Xapo. “Just to be clear, I’d be super interested in investing,” Reid told Wences. Wences paused, a bit chagrined. “I wish you’d told me that the last time we talked,” he said. “You told me you weren’t interested in venture investing,” Reid shot back. Wences explained that things had changed since they last talked, and that he had decided to take on investors and had struck a deal with Benchmark Capital. “I just don’t think I can include you in that,” Wences said. “It wouldn’t be the honorable thing to do.” Reid was not so easily deterred. He told Wences he was going to go home to figure out a way they could make it work. Wences said he would do the same.\n\nadvertisement\n\nReid’s newfound enthusiasm was part of a broader passion for Bitcoin and its underlying technology that was sweeping Silicon Valley in early 2014. These views were crystallized, and projected to a much broader audience, the day after Wences’s breakfast with Reid, when Marc Andreessen, cofounder of the investment firm that had put $25 million into Coinbase, published a lengthy cri de coeur on the New York Times website. Like many Valley firms, Andreessen’s was thinking about intelligent robots, and Bitcoin seemed to like a perfect medium of exchange for two machines that needed to pay each other for services. Beyond all that, though, the decentralized ledger underlying Bitcoin was a fundamentally new kind of network—like the Internet—with possibilities that still hadn’t been dreamed up, Andreessen said. From Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money, by Nathaniel Popper He went on: Far from a mere libertarian fairy tale or a simple Silicon Valley exercise in hype, Bitcoin offers a sweeping vista of opportunity to reimagine how the financial system can and should work in the Internet era, and a catalyst to reshape that system in ways that are more powerful for individuals and businesses alike. Andressen was already investing his own money into the unpublicized Bitcoin mining company, 21e6, created by the Stanford wunderkind Balaji Srinivasan. His firm, Andreessen Horowitz, had also made a secret $25 million investment in 21e6, helping make it the best funded Bitcoin company in the world. For Wences, the more immediate indication of how quickly this was all moving came in an email from Reid not long after their breakfast. Reid had talked with a friend at the venture capital firm Index Ventures, and together they were prepared to offer Wences another $20 million for Xapo. He could still take the $20 million he already had as a series A, but this could be a quick follow on—a series A1. And while Wences’s first investors had valued Xapo at $50 million, Reid and his partner were ready to value it at $100 million. In little more than a month, Wences had doubled the value of his company.

Some fear that the network, as it’s currently designed, could become overwhelmed as early as next year.\n\nThe answer will help determine the form Bitcoin’s network takes as it matures. But the loose-knit community of Bitcoin users is not in agreement over how it should proceed, and the nature of Bitcoin, a technology neither owned nor controlled by any one person or entity, could make the impending decision-making process challenging. At the very least it represents a cloud of uncertainty hanging over Bitcoin’s long-term future.\n\nThe technical problem, which most agree is solvable, is that Bitcoin’s network now has a fixed capacity for transactions. Before he or she disappeared, Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, limited the size of a “block,” or group of transactions, to one megabyte. The technology underlying Bitcoin works because a network of thousands of computers contribute the computational power needed to confirm every transaction and record them all in a permanent, publicly accessible ledger called the blockchain (see “What Bitcoin Is and Why It Matters”). Every 10 minutes, an operator of one of those computers wins the chance to add a new block to the chain and receives freshly minted bitcoins as a reward. That process is called mining.\n\nUnder the one-megabyte-per-block limit, the network can process only about three transactions per second. If Bitcoin becomes a mainstream payment system, or even a platform for all kinds of other online business besides payments (see “Why Bitcoin Could Be Much More Than a Currency”), it’s going to have to process a lot more. Visa, by comparison, says its network can process more than 24,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe developers in charge of maintaining Bitcoin’s core software have been aware of this impending problem for a while. Gavin Andresen, who has led work on Bitcoin’s core code since Nakamoto handed him the reins in 2010, told MIT Technology Review last August that his favored solution to the problem is to increase the maximum block size (see “The Man Who Really Built Bitcoin”). Earlier this month, Andresen got more specific, proposing that the maximum block size be increased to 20 megabytes starting in March 2016, calling this the “simplest possible set of changes that will work.” In a subsequent post on his blog, Andresen called the need for the change “urgent,” noting that the network would likely become unreliable if it were allowed to reach the current limit.\n\nMike Hearn, a former Google software engineer who has contributed to Bitcoin’s development, has calculated that at the current rate of transaction growth, the limit will be hit sometime in 2016. “Because upgrades take time, we need to prepare for this now,” Hearn writes in his own recent post on the issue.\n\nThe problem is that a consensus is required to make a change as consequential as the one Andresen suggests, which would substantially alter the requirements for mining. And not everyone in the community of users of the Bitcoin software—which includes miners, developers, and a growing number of startups—agrees that Andresen’s proposal is the best path forward.\n\nA popular argument against the change is that it would favor bigger, richer mining operations that could afford the increased costs that go along with processing and storing bigger blocks. That could lead to a dangerous “centralization” within the mining community, says Arvind Narayanan, a professor of computer science at Princeton University (see “Rise of Powerful Mining Pools Forces Rethink of Bitcoin’s Design”). Another, more ideological argument is that Bitcoin was never supposed to change this drastically from Nakamoto’s original design. Some even argue that the limit doesn’t need to increase at all, as long as the developers make smaller adjustments to prevent the network from buckling when it reaches it—though that could make it more expensive to get transactions confirmed without delays.\n\nThe growing commercial ecosystem around Bitcoin is at stake. If the limit remains fixed, businesses hoping to store lots of transactions on the blockchain could be out of luck. And such interest is only increasing—earlier this month, the Nasdaq stock exchange said it was testing Bitcoin’s blockchain for transactions in its private market subsidiary. If the test is successful, the exchange says, it could use the technology for all Nasdaq trades in the public market.\n\nWill Bitcoin be able to handle that? Pieter Wuille, another of Bitcoin’s five core developers, says right now there are just too many unknowns about the consequences of increasing the block size to 20 megabytes. In addition to significantly raising the cost of validating transactions, which could force out smaller players, he says, there may be “things we don’t even know of that could break.” Wuille is in favor of increasing the block size “in general,” but says a smaller increase at first would be less risky.\n\nFor now, the debate will continue to play out on the Bitcoin development mailing list, a forum that includes the core developers as well as the many others who contribute code.\n\nUltimately, though, the decision-making process “really comes down to how the core developers feel about it,” says Narayanan, since they are the only ones with the power to change the code. Complicating things even further is the fact that it’s not exactly clear how they would solicit input from all the stakeholders, many of whom may prefer to remain anonymous. The core developers could eventually find it necessary to take matters into their own hands.\n\nAt least one of them thinks that would be a bad idea, though. That would set an “incredibly dangerous precedent,” says Wuille.', 'African Bitcoin startup BitPesa launched its remittance service in Tanzania today. The service previously was available only in Kenya, where the company is headquartered. It hopes to undercut the fees charged by incumbents’ remittance services.\n\nBitPesa launched its international money transfer in Kenya last year with the goal of expanding the service to the rest of Africa, something the company has slowly been working toward. Besides its remittance product, the company operates an exchange in Kenya and Ghana but Tanzania is the first country the startup has expanded its international money transfer service into.\n\nLike Kenya, Tanzania is a mobile money hotspot and an ideal country for BitPesa. The nation has a population of more than 43 million people, and, according to a2014 study by industry group Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA), has 31.8 million registered mobile money accounts. Tanzania received $317 million in remittances, $15 million of which came from Kenya, in 2012, according to a World Bank study.\n\nBitPesa’s service allows anyone to send money to any Tanzanian phone number and charges a flat 3 percent on all its transfers. The service also promises the money will arrive instantly.\n\nA Competitive Market\n\nBitPesa will be joining a number of other companies that offer domestic (from city to rural) and international remittances in the country. Tanzania already has more than six mobile money operators who offer money transfer services to anyone in the country, and operators such as M-Pesa, who have partnered with Western Union, offer international mobile remittances.\n\nDue to a lack of studies and research about remittance fees in Tanzania, it is unclear whether BitPesa will have a cost advantage, but it is certainly likely, especially for inter-Africa remittances. A 2013 World Bank press release said that Tanzania, alongside South Africa and Ghana, were the most expensive African countries to remit money to. Fees reportedly could get as high as 20 percent.\n\nBitPesa’s low flat rate might turn out be an attractive option for Tanzanians in Kenya remitting money back home, which is a smaller corridor and usually has higher fees. The same might hold true for Tanzanians living in Uganda when the Bitcoin startup expands there later this year. The service will of course allow people from anywhere in the world (excluding the United States) to remit money to the small African country as well.\n\nA more likely candidate for the service however, are businesses operating in Kenya, Tanzania and countries such as the United Kingdom, who have to send money to and from the African nation. BitPesa has already pivoted their service to better accommodate businesses’ needs after finding a large interest in the service from the group late last year.\n\nImage via BitPesa.co.', 'Editor’s note: The following is an edited excerpt from Nathaniel Popper’s book, Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\n\nIn the winter of 2013, several executives from one of the nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo (WFC), traveled from San Francisco to New York for a meeting at the headquarters of one of the nation’s largest hedge funds, Fortress Investment Group, to talk about a very controversial potential project: creating the nation’s first regulated Bitcoin exchange.\n\nFortress put aside a grand conference room on the 47th floor of its Manhattan headquarters and executives from several divisions of Wells Fargo showed up. Fortress brought along its own team, including some of the Silicon Valley luminaries who had gotten behind Bitcoin. Once the dozen or so people were gathered around the conference room, the co-chairman of Fortress, Pete Briger, stood up to give his pitch for the project.\n\nBriger explained why the Fortress team was so intrigued by the Bitcoin technology – which was both a sort of digital gold, and a new way to send money around the world cheaply and almost instantly. He hinted that Wells Fargo should be keeping up with Bitcoin, given the potential for the new network to challenge some of the basic services, like payment networks, that the bank was providing. Briger closed by talking about the lack of an American-based regulated exchange for Bitcoin — something that Fortress and Wells Fargo could provide together.\n\nThe meeting ended inconclusively, and Wells Fargo ultimately demurred after Bitcoin was hit by yet another crisis, leading Fortress to scale back its engagement with Bitcoin. The plans for the exchange, meanwhile, were never made public. But the conversation between the two financial giants – and the way that Fortress’s interest developed – provides a window into the long but slow process through which Wall Street has gotten comfortable with this renegade new technology.\n\nBriger’s interest in Bitcoin began, in earnest, in January of 2013 at a heli-skiing trip in the Canadian Rockies. Briger had invited several other financiers and entrepreneurs to a lodge that was owned by a company that was owned by Fortress. Among the guests was an Argentinian, Wences Casares, who had already started and sold a number of successful startups.\n\nAfter long days of skiing, Casares regaled Briger and the other men with explanations of how Bitcoin worked, and why it mattered. At the time, Bitcoin was a fringe technology, most famous as the resident currency of the Silk Road online drug bazaar. But Casares explained it was much more than that – it was, in fact, a new kind of network that could allow people to move money anywhere in the world, instantaneously—something that these financiers, who were frequently moving millions between banks in different countries, could surely appreciate.\n\n“You can call someone in Jakarta on Skype,” Casares told them. “You can see them and you can hear them and there’s a synchronous connection with a lot of bandwidth. There’s a ton of magic happening, which is incredible. And you hang up and you want to send them one cent and that’s not possible. That’s ridiculous. It should be a lot easier to send a cent than to see video and audio.”\n\nBriger had a habit of taking long, anxiety-inducing pauses before responding to anything, and his first questions for Wences were distinctly skeptical. But his subsequent questions suggested that something was clicking. Pete’s job as an investor in distressed companies made him good at spotting broken systems, and the more he thought about it, the more broken the current methods of moving money around the world seemed to him.\n\nFrom the ski lodge, Pete e-mailed one of his most trusted lieutenants at Fortress, Bill Tanona, and asked what Bill knew about Bitcoin. When he got back to San Francisco he opened a Mt. Gox account and quickly built up his own $100,000 position in Bit- coin. At work, he started talking with Tanona and a few other colleagues about how Fortress could get involved in this new market.\n\nBy the summer of 2013, Briger had invited an old classmate from Princeton and colleague from his days at Goldman Sachs (GS), Dan Morehead, to help Fortress look full- time at a range of virtual-currency opportunities. Morehead took up a desk at Fortress’s offices in a skyscraper near the Embarcadero in downtown San Francisco. He soon hired the first professional traders to buy Bitcoins for a fund he hoped to set up, which would make Bitcoin more easily available to big investors.\n\nBut Briger quickly ran into how hard it was to win acceptance for this controversial new asset. Briger managed to set up a first meeting with top executives at Wells Fargo during the summer of 2013. He got the meeting, but Wells Fargo quickly declined any partnership. It had been only a few months since Wells Fargo had had to deal with federal agents seizing the Wells Fargo bank accounts of the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt. Gox.\n\nThat fall, though, American law enforcement officials appeared at a Senate hearing on Bitcoin and suggested that they viewed Bitcoin as an important technology that could be used to legitimate ends. After the hearings, Briger got a call from the Wells Fargo executives who wanted to revisit the idea of working with Fortress on a Bitcoin project, which soon led to the meeting at Fortress’s Manhattan headquarters.\n\nThe possibility of one of America’s biggest banks, and one of the country’s largest hedge fund managers jointly setting up a Bitcoin exchange ultimately died soon after the arrest of Charlie Shrem, a young Bitcoin entrepreneur and the vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, on charges of money laundering. Not long after Shrem’s arrest, Briger heard from Wells Fargo that the bank would not be able to move forward with the joint project. Soon after that, Briger let Morehead know that his Bitcoin hedge fund would have to move out of Fortress’s offices. One of Bitcoin’s most significant opportunities to move into the mainstream had been lost. But Wall Street’s awkward dance with Bitcoin was only beginning.\n\nNathaniel Popper is a reporter for The New York Times.

However, it is the first official company in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) to allow customers in Egypt to purchase BTC with the Egyptian Pound.\n\nA ‘tough market’\n\nYellow is the first bitcoin exchange type business to be introduced in Egypt since the launch of Kipochi in Africa back in 2013. Kipochi is a bitcoin wallet service based in the UK which partnered with M-PESA in 2013 to introduce the first bitcoin wallet in Africa.\n\nAccording to Yellow, 70% of the 15 countries in the Middle East are either unbanked or have poor payment system infrastructures. Moreover, merchants usually pay around 5% in transaction and processing fees.\n\nThe Bitcoin startup recognizes Egypt’s low credit card acceptance rate, high merchant fees, expensive payment solutions and also the fact that Egypt does not have an established bitcoin exchange despite the rapid growth in Egypt’s e-commerce industry.\n\nWamda, a platform of programs and networks for entrepreneurs in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) reported that only 10% of the country’s population holds bank accounts and less than 2% of the population has credit cards. Later in the report, Wamda stated:\n\n“In general, Egypt is a tough market, due to high computer illiteracy, a poor telecoms infrastructure, and weakened economic conditions.”\n\nDespite Egypt’s poor payment infrastructure, Yellow still launched the bitcoin voucher service as it believes that “Bitcoin can revolutionize payments in the region.” Yellow’s founder, David El Achkar, explained that “We’re seeing some activity in Kuwait, but it’s still low. We’re also starting to see a growing interest in KSA, Tunisia, and Egypt.”\n\nEgypt’s fledgling Bitcoin industry began showing signs of life in 2014 with the announcement of an Australian bitcoin exchange Igot to expand its services to Egypt and AMECO, the largest disposable syringe and hypodermic needle manufacturer in the Middle East (based in Cairo) beginning to accept BTC. Unfortunately, there has been no significant progress since last year in Egypt as AMECO is still the only business in the entire country to accept bitcoin.', 'On May 9, an international group of hackers launched distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on two of the largest financial institutions in Hong Kong. Hong Kong police confirmed that they have received reports from the Bank of China and the Bank of East Asia claiming that the hackers demanded payments in bitcoin.\n\n“The two institutions later received emails demanding payments in bitcoins, or there would be another round of attacks,” a spokesman said.\n\nAccording to The Standard Hong Kong, the hackers overwhelmed the websites of the two banks with traffic from multiple sources, causing irregular spikes in Internet traffic and forcing some of the websites’ resources to be unavailable.\n\nHowever, both banks stressed that none of its data and customer accounts were compromised.\n\nFinance Magnets reported that the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau has classified the case as “blackmail” and has begun an investigation.\n\nThe attack imposed on the two banks is similar to the DDoS attacks launched on the official corporate websites of banks in China and Hong Kong, most notably the People’s Bank of China in late 2013. The investigators at the time believed that the attacks were a result of the issuance of new rules which prohibited financial institutions from dealing with bitcoin.\n\nThe State media reported that they believed “bitcoin fans” have initiated the attack, as a response to prohibiting the use of digital currencies in China.\n\nThe local media began to speculate that the recent attack initiated on the Bank of China and the Bank of East Asia might have been launched by a group of hackers known as DD4BC. The group is currently listed on Bitcoin Bounty Hunter and has attacked several websites, including Finnish Bitcoin wallet and exchange Bitalo and Bitcoin sports betting platform Nitrogensports.\n\n“DD4BC threatens the Bitcoin Community with DDoS extortion, blackmailing and slander,” Bitcoin Bountry Hunter explained. “Famous Bitcoin services like Bitalo.com and Nitrogensports.com were attacked and blackmailed.”\n\nThe banks declined to release information of the emails received by the hackers and the amount of BTC demanded.\n\nIf the DDoS attacks are continuing, the two banks may lose up to $100,000 an hour, American Banker reports. AMR (American Banker Reports) stated that “the average bandwidth consumed by a DDoS attack increased to 7.39 gigabits per second, according to Verisign’s analysis of DDoS attacks in the fourth quarter of 2014.”\n\nA few days have passed since the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau began investigating the case, but the case hasn’t showed any progress.']"

""The NYSE Bitcoin suite of indices is anticipated to grow, with new indices introduced over time.""\n\nGrowing interest on Wall Street\n\nThe move comes after the Wall Street stock exchange invested in Coinbase\'s $75m Series C funding round, which closed in January this year.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk following the announcement, Farley said: ""With this investment, we are tapping into a new asset class by teaming up with a leading platform that is bringing transparency, security and confidence to an important growth market.""\n\nThe NYSE is not the only firm on Wall Street investing in the digital currency.\n\nMultinational banking giant Goldman Sachs recently participated in a $50m funding round raised by bitcoin financial services startup Circle.\n\nJust last month, developers at the Bank of New York Mellon Corp were revealed to be experimenting with bitcoin\'s open-source code on the bank\'s new corporate recognition program.\n\nNew York Stock Exchange image via Songquan Deng / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The underlying technology may change how business is done, they say, but the system itself isn\'t long for this world.\n\nNow the Nasdaq stock exchange is challenging that conventional wisdom by not only testing Bitcoin\'s much-vaunted blockchain technology, but doing so on the Bitcoin network.\n\nLast week Nasdaq announced plans to use Bitcoin\'s blockchain \x96 a real-time public ledger of transactions \x96 with the exchange\'s private markets platform, designated for firms preparing for initial public offerings. Users will be able to issue and transfer securities on the blockchain via the Open Assets protocol, which uses specific units of bitcoin as tokens to represent ownership of equity shares or other assets. These tokens are referred to as ""colored coins."" If all goes well, Nasdaq may expand its use of blockchain technology to other businesses, including its central counterparty clearinghouses and central security depositories, according to a person familiar with the company\'s thinking.\n\nThe shift to the blockchain represents a leap into the digital age for Nasdaq. Most stock exchanges use an outdated record-keeping system that relies on paper certificates. Bitcoin\'s distributed ledger will improve the auditability of Nasdaq\'s records and allow officials to keep better track of ownership of assets as they change hands, according to the person familiar with the decision.\n\nNasdaq is far from the only big-name firm to proclaim interest in using distributed-ledger technology to facilitate speedier, cheaper and more auditable transactions. But financial firms have typically dismissed Bitcoin itself as too risky for mainstream use.\n\nCryptocurrency researcher Tim Swanson explained this hesitancy in a report earlier this year, writing that banks were unlikely to adopt Bitcoin\'s ""permissionless ledger"" because the anonymity of blockchain users would make it hard to hold anyone accountable in instances of fraud or other transactions gone awry.\n\nBut now the financial industry has a ""brand-name firm experimenting for real"" with the Bitcoin blockchain, as Richard Gendal Brown, IBM UK\'s executive architect for innovation in banking and financial markets, wrote in a blog post last week. Nasdaq\'s move lends credence to the idea of using ""the inherent security and open-access of the Bitcoin system to \'carry\' representations of real-world assets,"" Brown wrote. ""Dismissing [Bitcoin] entirely could be a big mistake.""\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin\'s status as the most popular blockchain around may have made it the most logical choice for Nasdaq, according to some experts in the digital currency community.\n\n""Some advantages of using Bitcoin include that it has been tested fairly well and there is a dedicated community of developers supporting it, so the technological risk may be lower and deployment may move faster than some alternatives,"" Susan Athey, a senior fellow at Stanford University\'s Institute for Economics Policy Research and an advisor to digital currency firm Ripple Labs, wrote in an email.\n\nA number of factors may have informed Nasdaq\'s decision to experiment with the Bitcoin blockchain, according to experts in the digital currency community.\n\n""The advantage of the main chain is that it\'s very secure"" because of Bitcoin\'s decentralized structure, said Flavien Charlon, who helped develop the Open Assets protocol. Miners, who record transactions into the ledger, must demonstrate ""proof of work"" by using computing power to solve a difficult math problem in order to collect their bounty. The fact that there is no single point of failure for validating transactions makes the blockchain difficult to compromise. ""It\'s really expensive to attack the main network, and it\'s also very auditable because it\'s completely public.""\n\nWhile some financial institutions have expressed concerns about the dangers of using a public blockchain like Bitcoin\x92s, ""there are ways to make it more of a semi-closed loop,"" Charlon said. Bitcoin\'s protocol is designed to be flexible, which means that ""Nasdaq could prevent transactions they don\'t want to happen"" by using a multisignature feature that requires several different private keys to independently approve a transaction. (Think of the scene in ""WarGames"" where two people must turn separate keys to launch a missile.)\n\nCharlon, who is also the founder of Coinprism, a wallet service for storing colored coins, argues that treating bitcoins as representations of assets helps to safeguard mainstream financial institutions. Since bitcoins serve as tokens under the protocol rather than as a currency, companies that use the option are largely protected from the price volatility associated with money untethered to a central bank or government. Under a colored coin system, small fractions of bitcoin can be designated to represent much larger values. Users need to purchase some amount of bitcoins in order to move them, but bitcoins are divisible to eight decimal places. With the bitcoin exchange rate around $230 today, an issuer could purchase a thousandth of one for less than 25 cents and subdivide it into smaller pieces for distribution to investors.\n\nSome industry insiders cautioned that Nasdaq\'s move should not be taken as a sign that the entire stock exchange\x97and other financial firms\x97will shift to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe securities industry needs a ledger that the legal system will treat as an authoritative account of the ownership of assets, Robert Sams, founder and chief executive of Clearmatics, wrote in a blog post Monday. A ""permissionless"" ledger that anyone can use anonymously wouldn\'t hold up in court, according to Sams, whose company offers its own distributed-ledger technology system for clearing and settling over-the-counter derivatives.\n\n""The law will not treat a ledger record as authoritative if everyone knows that the current longest chain contains blocks generated by an anonymous attacker who replaced a bit of history that was chronologically prior,"" he wrote.\n\nUsing the Bitcoin blockchain on a broad scale poses additional challenges, according to Preston Byrne, co-founder and chief operating officer of Eris Industries, which offers its own blockchain platform targeted at mainstream companies.\n\n""For the process of developing a full-on, blockchain-based exchange that can satisfy commercial requirements and [sanctions] requirements, you wouldn\x92t want to use Bitcoin because you can\x92t get the controls you need,"" said Byrne.\n\nThe issue lies in the fact that Bitcoin is designed to resist interference, according to Byrne. This is useful for warding off hackers but makes it difficult to reverse transactions. If Nasdaq needed to rescind a fraudulent sale or otherwise intervene with the Bitcoin blockchain, it could run into a problem, he speculated. The stock exchange might also have difficulty configuring the blockchain to prevent the transfer of shares to countries like Iran and Syria that are sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, according to Byrne.\n\nRegardless of these challenges, it\'s clear that big-name firms are starting to get serious about putting blockchains into action. The online retailer Overstock.com, for example, announced in an April filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was considering issuing up to $500 million in ""digital securities"" using distributed ledger technology.\n\nSmaller financial institutions are also testing the waters. Cross River Bank in Teaneck, N.J., and CBW Bank in Weir, Kan., last year became the first banks to use Ripple Labs\' distributed ledger to facilitate cross-border transactions.\n\nNot to be left out, the New York Stock Exchange announced the launch of a bitcoin pricing index Tuesday that will use data from transactions on the Bitcoin exchange Coinbase. The NYSE participated in Coinbase\'s $75 million funding round earlier this year.\n\nSuch moves suggest that the fast-clearing transactions and precise records offered by blockchain technology will become a new standard in the financial industry, according to industry insiders.\n\n""In the future, we should expect that the settlement of asset transfers (including fiat currency as well as securities) should be roughly instantaneous and there should be an auditable digital trail,"" Athey wrote in an email. This change would ""reduce the need for companies and financial institutions to tie up capital while assets are in transit.""\n\nAs one of the first big companies to make use of the blockchain, Nasdaq could help this future come about a little faster.\n\nNasdaq\'s move ""shows a natural progression toward a greater understanding of the financial community around the power of the blockchain,"" said Peter Shiau, chief operating officer of Bitcoin security technology provider CryptoCorp. He also suggested that there\'s plenty of room in the world for both permissioned ledgers that use legal entities to authorize transactions and Bitcoin\'s ""permissionless"" blockchain.\n\n""I can envision a world in which the public Bitcoin blockchain is going to have a fundamental role to play in how financial services are delivered,"" Shiau said, ""and we\'ll also have a bunch of private blockchains that different institutions can use with each other.""', ""First floated by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2008, Bitcoin is a virtual currency which uses a 'blockchain' of sashes to validate its transactions. Each Bitcoin is given out based on proof-of-work to systems which find hashes for the blockchain, providing the peer-to-peer technology with the processing power it needs. The value of individual Bitcoins has risen from fractions of a pence to hundreds of pounds, but the rise is matched by an increase in the difficulty of mining said Bitcoins. These days, mining a Bitcoin is only profitable on an industrial scale using low-cost - or stolen - electricity supplies and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) dedicated to the cause.Bitcoin mining hardware is typically extremely power hungry, but startup 21 Inc. has announced plans to bring the technology to smartphones. According to the Wall Street Journal , the company has already raised $116 million in private funding before announcing its plans in a blog post this week. '' explained 21's Balaji Srinivasan. 'Pre-empting the argument that the purpose of a Bitcoin mining device is simply to get rich, something a low-power embedded version will never offer thanks to its low performance, Srinivasan had prepared some example use-cases: micropayments using Bitcoin; massively-distributed mining through adding the BitShare chip to existing devices such as set-top boxes or VoIP handsets; device authentication via the blockchain; and even Bitcoin-subsidised devices for the developing world.' claimed Srinivasan. 'The company is actively seeking developers via its web site , and claims to be releasing a development kit shortly."", ""Many are describing Bitcoin as the Internet of money. But digital currency's development is in such an early stage, it’s currently similar to the Internet in 1994.\n\nThe new technology's short, turbulent history makes for a riveting book, “Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money,” by Nathaniel Popper, a New York Times reporter covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Wall Street.\n\n“It would have been very hard in 1994 to know who were going to be the big Internet players in the future,” says Popper. “Companies that were big then disappeared and most companies big now didn’t appear for years after that. That’s why I wrote the book as a history of the technology. It’s an effort to look at not who was going to be important but how Bitcoin got here and who were the important people in bringing it here. That’s very instructive as with the early years of the Internet, in terms of how innovation happened.”\n\n“Digital Gold” details Bitcoin’s colorful journey, beginning with its mysterious creation in November 2008 by a still-unknown figure who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The book tracks the currency through its geek phase, when it was a pet project of programmers, its libertarian period, when some of the biggest promoters were people captivated by the idea of a financial system not under government control, and its outlaw stage, during which a large volume of the transactions in Bitcoin were drug deals on the underground market Silk Road.\n\nPopper also chronicles some of its early debacles, such as when the first major Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, lost about $460 million in Bitcoins and declared bankruptcy. But slowly and gradually, Bitcoin becomes embraced by the masters of the Silicon Valley universe. In the last chapter, several of them convene, along with a select but still motley crew of the original Bitcoin misfits, at the Lake Tahoe vacation home of Dan Morehead, head of Pantera Capital, a digital currency-focused venture capital firm. By March 2014, the book's ending point, Bitcoin startups launch with big funding, like Xapo, which raised $20 million from LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and Paypal cofounder Max Levchin, and Xapo founder Wences Casares scores a minor victory in convincing Bill Gates to consider using digital currencies in his work getting people in developing countries financially connected.\n\nI won’t spoil the book for you by telling you anymore than that. I spoke with Popper about Bitcoin and digital currencies and what role they may play in our financial future. Here’s is an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nWhat are the main benefits you see to digital currency over how our money is handled today?\n\nThis is money that can, in itself, be transferred very quickly anywhere very cheaply without needing to go through a central institution that can say yes or no or screw up or add security risk into the equation.\n\nIt’s good for transmitting either very large or very small amounts of money either over very large distances or very small distances — like transferring money to a friend across the table, or to someone in China rather than through existing systems. People think of this as replacing cash, but I think that’s not one of the places where you see much uptake — partially because cash already does a pretty good job. The idea behind the creation of this was to create something that could serve as cash in the digital world.\n\nHas Bitcoin outgrown its outlaw phase?\n\nBecause of its openness, Bitcoin will continue to be used by shady actors. In some ways, the good comparison is cash. Bitcoiners love saying the main medium for illicit transactions is still probably $100 bills because it can be an anonymous form of transacting that’s untraceable, and Bitcoin still has that quality as well. Just like cash, illegal stuff will become a small part of the ecosystem. But early on, that illegal illicit stuff was important to the progression of Bitcoin. It really played a big role in it taking off, which a lot of people nowadays want to downplay.\n\nCould another digital currency become more dominant?\n\nThe potential vulnerability of this network that supports Bitcoin is something the banks are looking into these days. It seems exciting to a lot of them but it also has some issues that they haven’t figured out how to solve — around security and being able to trust the other computers holding up the network. The Bitcoin miners — the people mining new Bitcoins — are the people keeping this system alive, and right now more than 50% of that computer power is in China with people we don’t know, and another big part of it is a company started by a Ukrainian guy called BitFury. A company like Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan is hesitant to rely or work with a financial network in which the people keeping it alive are essentially anonymous figures who live where they’re not affected by the same set of laws. For the 50% of the mining power in China, the government there could suddenly seize that and tell them to turn off all transactions from Goldman Sachs or this Bitcoin address. I’m not saying that’s a fatal flaw, but it’s an issue for companies looking at using this.\n\nWhether other currencies gain traction, that’s a basic issue about money: Money succeeds when they believe other people will take it, trust it and believe in it — the so-called network effect. Bitcoin has been successful at developing a network of people willing to use it. Bitcoin's first-mover advantage will be really difficult for any other currency to surmount. If another one took off, it would be because Bitcoin failed, which might make it hard for another one to take off.\n\nIs Bitcoin at a disadvantage because the transactions are anonymous but “know your customer”/anti-money laundering laws require financial institutions to know who the parties in a transaction are?\n\nBanks are front line in stopping money-laundering transactions. Banks have to know who’s transacting and flag it if someone suspicious is involved in the transaction. That’s why banks say they don’t work with Bitcoin — it’s hard to know who is on both sides of the transaction. But it’s quite easy in Bitcoin to have an identity tied to an address in a way that would make a bank feel comfortable. A Bitcoin address is essentially numbers and letters, but you can sign up at an address and say, this address is mine, and all this money in it is mine. If you were going through a bank, both sides in a transaction could have their identities tied to their wallets, so you could know where all the money was coming from and going to. Police could say, if you do a transaction, you have to know both sides of the transaction. That’s already happening with the big Bitcoin companies in the United States. You can have it be public on both sides and still get the speed and cheapness of Bitcoin and just lose that anonymity.\n\nWhat’s the biggest hurdle to adoption?\n\nPublic confidence and willingness of people to use it. The various crises have affected people’s willingness to give it a try. The other obstacle is that to use it properly, it can be quite complicated. You have to store these private keys that make it secure in an offline place so they’re not vulnerable to hackers, and if you rely on a third-party service, you don’t get all the benefits of it. So people are trying work through the complexity of it but that’s a real stumbling block to people who might want to use it but feel put off by the technology.\n\nSome have said that the history of Bitcoin has proven it’s not a good store of value, so I was surprised to see that some entrepreneurs, like Wences Casares of the Bitcoin wallet Xapo, are focusing their Bitcoin startups on the idea that it will be a store of value. What do you think?\n\nIt’s certainly the case that there’s a significant divide among the ardent followers of Bitcoin, among those who view it first and foremost as a store of value. Wences, as you noticed, is the leader in that camp, saying, this is valuable as digital commodity, essentially as digital gold, that that’s the easiest thing to grasp and use about Bitcoin. He’s coming from this Argentinian context where people have been dealing with the Argentinian peso, whose value has been depreciated constantly by inflation, so people in Argentina are looking for a stable place to keep their money, such as the dollar, real estate or gold. And there’s been a certain number of people have been wiling to treat Bitcoin that way. The issue is that it hasn’t served as a stable store of value, so people who bought it at $1,000 now have something worth $250. That’s as bad or probably much worse than the Argentinian peso. So people are certainly willing to use it that way and to a certain degree, it needs to be a store of value to be usable. If people stopped viewing it that way, I don’t know if the system would keep working well, so a certain number of people need to be using it that way for it to operate. To become a more significant technology, it will have to progress beyond that and that will have to be a smaller part.\n\nHow do you envision this technology will be integrated into our financial system?\n\nThe place it may disappoint is how long it takes for it to be integrated. Even the big boosters who believe in this tend to say this will take a lot longer than people want it to or think it will. It needs much greater uptake among people and public confidence needs to improve. That will take a long time to happen. There’s disappointment among people who want this to happen in the next one or two years and others talk about the next 10 or 20 years. The thing that may survive from this — and this is what you hear from people in Silicon Valley and Wall Street — is not necessarily or primarily the currency but the technology underneath this, which is the blockchain, the network that allows a database of Bitcoin transactions to be maintained communally.\n\nThe banks are trying to figure out ways to use it. Some of them are talking about creating their own blockchain that is separate from Bitcoin. It’s attractive to them because they don’t want to rely on payment networks and have payments suspended midair three or four days at a time. It could be that financial transactions will happen on the Bitcoin network or a network like Bitcoin but consumers won’t be aware that Bitcoin is powering it. It could be the case that Bitcoin takes off in a way that isn’t visible to ordinary people who using it or benefiting from it.\n\nWhat will be the first ways consumers notice Bitcoin in their lives?\n\nFirst, international transfers, like moving money to Mexico, Latin America, Africa. That’s not something a lot of Americans do frequently so that will affect people already making those payments. Second, domestically, we’ll notice peer-to-peer payments, so payments between friends, or Venmo-like services. There are a lot of people trying to figure out how to make small payments online to tip people online but also just to quickly pay back a friend and have that money end up immediately in their wallet and not have to go through the banking system, which can take quite a while.\n\nBitcoin is often said to be better for merchants, because, with Bitcoin, there are no chargebacks — customers can’t claim a charge as fraudulent and have their money refunded. But how is Bitcoin better for consumers who already love their credit cards and credit card rewards?\n\nI don’t think there’s much. You have pointed out exactly the reason it hasn’t taken off with consumers. For making ordinary purchases, our credit card system works really well. Most people like that there’s insurance and if there’s fraud, they can get their money back. So I don’t see American consumers switching to this unless merchants give them a big discount for doing so. Even then, the consumer generally has to hold Bitcoin, but I frankly don’t see consumers giving up their credit cards any time soon. I think it’s likely to take off in other ways and doing things credit cards don’t do, like sending tips or sending money internationally.\n\nDo you have any tips for consumers interested in using Bitcoin?\n\nThere are services that are already out there, like Circle and Coinbase, that have significant names behind them that insure your money if you are holding it with them. That is not the pure way to use Bitcoin. The pure way is to use it is when you know your Bitcoin address and your private key and you are the only person who can access that money. No other service can do it. If you lose your private key, that money’s gone. That’s one of the big dangers people find with Bitcoin. At the bank, if you lose your password, they’ll just give you a new password. Using it in that pure way comes with real risks, but it is, in some ways, if you want to understand Bitcoin, the way to do it. You are in charge and you can send it to anyone with a Bitcoin address anywhere.\n\nIf you want to use it with one of these services, you can see some of the novel elements of Bitcoin, but not all of them. These are generally reputable companies that are insured, like Circle and Coinbase and Xapo, and they’re unlikely to disappear in the middle of the night. Bitcoin is still very much something where you should only put in money that you’re willing to lose because the value of bitcoin could go to zero tomorrow. At the same time, it’s more fun to explore than a stock. You own a stock, you can either sell that stock or hold it. With Bitcoin, there are fun things you can do with it to experiment and see how it works.\n\nIs there anything else you want to say?\n\nThe people in Bitcoin are what turned me onto this story. To see how people threw their old lives behind to make Bitcoin work is just amazing. You can’t find many other technologies that people have given their lives to. That’s what turned me onto this story and what made it so fascinating — what is it that people were so drawn to, that spoke to them on this visceral, almost spiritual level? It’s not just one thing — it’s a different thing in every place it’s been used — China, Europe, Argentina, and it’s a real window into our times to understand why people are so passionate about it.\n\nIn the United States, financial transactions are a very intimate thing. Your personality comes out in your credit card bill — where you shopped, how you shop, how much you spent. There is a reason when people are lost, the first thing you look for is their financial records, because that tells you where they are, what they’ve been doing. Right now, it’s something financial intermediaries have control over. The idea of reclaiming control over all that information and being able to spend money where you’re the only person that has power to do that -- people’s access to their own money is something that runs very deep and the potential sense of freedom that Bitcoin promises is, on the most basic level, what people have responded to."", 'Bitcoin Shop, Inc.

As reported by Reuters, the Honduras government has agreed to use “a permanent and secure land title record system using the underlying technology behind bitcoin.”\n\nThe idea to use the blockchain to record land ownership in underdeveloped countries was a use case Factom had in mind since it went live late last year. According to a video by Factom, nearly 70 percent of Latin America’s land is unregistered, leaving the poor, who have most of their wealth in land, vulnerable.\n\n“In the past, Honduras has struggled with land title fraud,” Factom President Peter Kirby told Reuters. “The country’s database was basically hacked. So bureaucrats could get in there and they could get themselves beachfront properties.”\n\nThe details of the project remain scarce, and despite Reuters reaching out multiple times to the Honduran government to comment on the partnership, the publication did not get a response. The cost of the project or to what degree the government will be using the blockchain for land registry remains unclear.\n\nThe project makes Honduras the second government to use the blockchain to record government data. Earlier this month, Isle of Man’s Department of Economic Development announced it would begin to record the number of digital currency businesses located on the island with the blockchain of the proof-of-stake digital currency Credits. The small country has been the focus of Bitcoin startups because of its business-friendly environment and has 25 cryptocurrency companies located there.\n\nViolent land disputes\n\nAccording to Factom, the company will be able to solve the country’s land registry problems by recording ownership on the incorruptible blockchain. Bitcoin technology does have potential to be a better store of record than existing options, but, even so, it seems up in the air whether the technology will be able to solve the country’s brutal land issues.\n\nThe roots of Honduras’ land conflicts began in the 1970s and ’80s when the government redistributed land, an estimated 120,000 hectares, to poor peasants. In the 1990s the land reform was reversed and, according to local farmers, much of the land was “sold’ to large businesses and politicians through methods of bribery, threats and coercion.\n\nToday, with 79 murders per 100,000 people, Honduras is considered one of the world’s most dangerous countries, and according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, the most unequal country in Latin America. Things have only gotten worse for the country since democratically elected Manuel Zelaya was ousted from power by businessman Roberto Micheletti. Micheletti has reportedly encouraged the oppression of farmers and peasants through “death squads.”', ""This article is excerpted and adapted from “Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money” by Nathaniel Popper.\n\nCharlie Shrem sits in prison in central Pennsylvania, the cautionary face of the futuristic movement that developed around the virtual currency Bitcoin.\n\nThis can seem a rather unlikely position for a 25-year-old college graduate who grew up in the cloistered world of the Syrian Jewish community in Brooklyn and kept a copy of the Israeli Declaration of Independence on his bedroom wall. But his past was, in fact, an integral part of the journey that has left him in USP Lewisburg Satellite Camp.\n\nShrem first discovered Bitcoin in the summer of 2011, when he saw a story on Gawker about the online drug bazaar, Silk Road, where Bitcoin was the resident currency.\n\nAt the time, Shrem was a senior at Brooklyn College, still living in the basement of his parents home in Midwood. He had been born cross-eyed and, after surgery to fix the problem, had to wear thick glasses. He was almost always the shortest one in his classes. As with so many other techies, Shrem’s real-world struggles led him to cultivate an active life online, where he knew many of his friends by their screen names.\n\nBut a surprising confidence lurked beneath Shrem’s anxious exterior. As the oldest child and only son in a family with four sisters, he was treated like a prince by his mother. He had discovered that while other kids could be difficult to win over, grown-ups were generally an easier audience. He was the one kid at his synagogue who would go up and shake the rabbi’s hand after services and his energy and good spirit generally appealed to adults. As he grew up, he found his personality lent itself naturally to business, which was highly valued in his community and in his family; his parents each ran their own jewelry businesses. When he was a freshman at Brooklyn College, he and a few friends had founded an online deals site, somewhat like Groupon.\n\nShrem stumbled upon Bitcoin two-and-a-half years after it had been released by its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin software promised a currency that was independent of any government, and that could be moved without going through a bank or any other central authority. As a result, in its early years Bitcoin had largely appealed to libertarians and other anti-government activists who wanted to escape the government.\n\nShrem was a departure from the idealists who had been driving Bitcoin development. His first-ever post on the Bitcoin forum was not about the power of decentralization but was instead an offer to sell JetBlue airline vouchers for Bitcoins.\n\nCopyright 2015 by Nathaniel Popper, reprinted courtesy of HarperCollins This article is excerpted and adapted from 'Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money' by Nathaniel Popper. Share\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nIt turned out that Shrem’s willingness to throw things at the wall, to see if they would stick, was not a bad thing at this point. The idealists who had been driving the Bitcoin world often got caught up in what they wanted the world to look like, rather than figuring out how to provide the world with something it would want.\n\nShrem quickly hit upon an immediately useful business model – providing an easy way for Americans to buy Bitcoins online. The business he created with a Welsh man he met online, which they called BitInstant, got its first $10,000 investment from Shrem’s mother.\n\nShrem’s confidence also came with a recklessness that would become a liability. On the Bitcoin online forums, Shrem advertised his love of marijuana and offered Silk Road users help and advice. Less publicly, he began working with a Florida man who helped Silk Road users get Bitcoins to buy drugs – work that would later help put him in jail.\n\nBut for now, Shrem’s boldness helped him to turn BitInstant into a significant enterprise, moving hundreds of thousands of dollars a month by the beginning of 2012, requiring him to bring on employees. And when the company needed a new injection of funds, Shrem’s business acumen helped him find not one, but two potential investors from his Syrian Jewish community.\n\nThe first potential investors who approached him were two men from his neighborhood who had experience in the export-import business. They knew how hard it was to move money over international borders and they thought Bitcoin might provide a faster and cheaper alternative.\n\nSoon after they offered to invest nearly a million dollars in BitInstant, the son of Shrem’s childhood dentist, David Azar, heard about the company and aggressively moved to make the investment himself.\n\nAzar, who ran a chain of check cashing businesses, wowed Shrem with his own confidence, and stole the deal from Shrem’s first potential investors. But Azar delayed in closing the deal over the summer of 2012, and he nearly lost the investment himself when Shrem was approached by a pair of New York’s most experienced venture capitalists.\n\nAzar managed to save his place in the deal after he met the Winklevoss twins, who were famous from their legal tussles with Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. The twins quickly agreed to invest alongside Azar. The deal now had a glamour that was hard for Shrem to resist. To someone like Shrem who had always been the last one picked for dodgeball, the tall blond Olympians promised not just money, but a life in which he could no longer be ignored.\n\nBut Azar also had something more important than any of that: he was part of Shrem’s tight-knit Syrian Jewish community. Members of the that community generally viewed themselves as having more responsibility to each other than to the outside world. This was an insular community in which even marrying a Jew from Europe or Turkey was considered intermarriage. Shrem was terrified that he would become a persona non grata in his neighborhood if he backed out of his deal. Shrem’s business partners tried to explain the “cultural pressure” that Shrem was feeling to favor the venture capitalists.\n\nIn the end, Shrem brought the others involved in BitInstant around to the deal with Azar and the twins, in part by offering them a piece of his own stake in the company. The deal was finalized on the porch of Azar’s lawyer’s house, not far from where Shrem grew up. The agreement gave Maguire Ventures, the investment entity created by Azar and the Winklevoss twins, 22% of BitInstant for $880,000.\n\nUltimately, Shrem and nearly everyone else would regret that he made the decision he did. By the time he was arrested in early 2014, for aiding and abetting unlicensed money transmission, BitInstant had acrimoniously fallen apart. Before that happened, though, the deal would help turn Shrem into a minor celebrity and help make Bitcoin into a global phenomenon.\n\nNathaniel Popper, a former reporter at the Forward, is now a reporter at The New York Times."", 'AlphaPoint has just announced that it is integrating two-factor authentication service Clef into its platform, making it convenient to login securely to more than 20 exchanges that depend on its digital currency exchange technology.\n\nAccording to the company, AlphaPoint “offers a white label solution that allows clients to launch their own digital currency exchange in under 20 days.” AlphaPoint has also recently partnered with IdentityMind to solve know-your-customer and anti-money laundering compliance issues.\n\nNo more passwords, no more tokens\n\nSecurity has always been an important focus in the digital currency world, but high-profile hacks of several exchanges have only heightened these concerns. Clef, which has already integrated its authentication service into more than 64,500 websites, also works with Apple’s Touch ID technology on iOS devices. This allows users to sign in using biometric authentication, increasing the difficulty to compromise an account secured this way.\n\nTypically, two-factor authentication (2FA) requires users to remember a number shown to them through an app or device and enter it into a login page. Clef automates this process by using the phone’s camera and an animation called the Clef Wave; the phone seamlessly syncs with the computer and logs the user in. The service is readily available for iOS and Android, and can be downloaded for free on the App Store or Google Play.\n\n“We take security extremely seriously and are always looking to leverage the latest solutions for our exchanges and their users,” said AlphaPoint CTO Joe Ventura. “We’re very excited to offer Clef’s robust, intuitive solution and believe it will help ensure more traders use 2FA to protect their accounts.”\n\n2FA from the future\n\nWhile relatively new in the digital currency ecosystem, Clef has already announced deals with major players such as Koinify, a marketplace for decentralized applications, and Ziftr, a service that allows shoppers to use credit cards and bitcoin seamlessly. When asked about AlphaPoint, Clef CEO Brennen Byrne said, “They also have huge reach into bitcoin so it’s exciting to work with them and help make 2FA on their client exchanges more accessible and user-friendly.”\n\nIt is this ease of use that is Clef’s major advantage over other 2FA solutions such as receiving a second code via SMS. Traditional forms of 2FA see fewer than 1 percent of users opt in to protect their accounts, but Clef claims that sites using its service have seen more than 50 percent of their users opt in to safer login.\n\nThe company offers five packages for security, ranging from a free service without premium features for unlimited logins and users to an enterprise solution with fraud and usage metrics and dedicated support.\n\nMeXBT, a Mexican-based exchange, will be the first AlphaPoint exchange to use the new integration, followed by Brazilian FlowBTC and Barbados-based Bitt.', 'As a result of a six-month joint investigation between the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS), law enforcement agencies charged four Australians with attempts to purchase illegal firearms and arrested 17 Dark Web buyers and merchants across Europe and North America.\n\nFollowing the arrests from the undercover operation, all firearms, ballistic armor, and illicit drugs were seized and around $80,000 USD worth of bitcoin was confiscated.\n\nIn September of 2014, the joint investigation between the law enforcement agencies in the United States and Australia focused on the illicit trade of firearms via the Dark Web which led to the identification of an online alias account for a 33-year-old man in Montana.\n\nThe operation officially began as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security received relevant information from the ACBPS. In the same month as the investigation, HIS initiated a secret operation with an online alias account. HIS was able to identify Australian suspects attempting to engage in illicit trading of firearms.\n\nTwo months after, AFP partnered with HIS to instigate another secret operation targeting the Australian suspects.\n\nAs a part of the operation, HIS and AFP manipulated the secret account to complete six deals over Dark Web markets, which allowed them to identify the addresses of the buyers.\n\nAfter identifying the addresses, HIS and AFP received 15 search warrants in February and March of 2015, and seized most of the items in the addresses including four illegal firearms, ammunition, steroids, computer equipment and mobile telephones. Supported by the Queensland Police Service and Australian State and Territory Law Enforcements, the operation filed 34 charges against the individuals involved.\n\n“Disrupting the supply of illegal firearms remains a priority for the AFP, and the success of this operation is another example of the results that can be achieved through cross-agency collaboration,” said Steve Lancaster, ACBPS national director of investigations and assistant commissioner. This secret operation was the most successful Dark Web investigation in the history of Australia, he added.\n\n“People using these sites should not be fooled by claims of online anonymity,” he said. “Each transaction builds up a global web of intelligence which international partners are using to target you.”\n\nDue to the success in the recent secret operation, Australian law enforcement will continue to target illicit online trades, especially firearms, with a strong support from national and international law enforcement partners.', 'Overstock.com has purchased a 25-percent stake in government-regulated trading company PRO Securities, advancing its plan to offer a ""digital security""—company stock overseen by the type of technology that underpins the bitcoin digital currency.\n\nBased in New Jersey, PRO Securities is what\'s known as an alternative trading system, an alternative to central stock exchanges—such as the NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange, and others—that\'s regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Overstock purchased its stake in the company last fall, and in a government filing earlier this year, PRO Securities amended its charter to say it may handle trades in digital securities overseen by technology related to the ""blockchain,"" the online public ledger that tracks the movement of bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, his company has built blockchain-related technology atop the electronic system operated by PRO Securities and is ready to demonstrate this technology to regulators. Earlier this month, Overstock filed a prospectus with the SEC saying it may issue a digital security through an alternative trading system. But it did not specify PRO Securities.\n\nThe hope is that blockchain technology can provide a truly independent, more reliable, and more transparent way of managing trades.\n\nConsidering that PRO Securities is registered with the SEC and plugged into the National Market System—the network of exchanges and other organizations that oversee equity trading in the US—the news indicates Overstock is wholly prepared to offer a digital security should it receive SEC approval. It could also use the system to offer private securities without that approval—an echo of what Nasdaq OMX is hoping to do with bitcoin technology inside its Nasdaq Private Market.\n\nOverstock and Nasdaq OMX are part of a growing effort to reinvent financial markets using the blockchain and blockchain-like technology. A company called Digital Asset Holdings is developing a blockchain-based system for the trading of securities, as is Symbiont, an outfit that includes coders who previously worked on Overstock\'s project.\n\nTransparency Versus Efficiency\n\nThe hope is that blockchain technology can provide a truly independent, more reliable, and more transparent way of managing trades. The blockchain runs across a worldwide network of independent machines that mathematically validate each bitcoin payment, and though those who use bitcoin can choose to remain anonymous, this online ledger is public. Developers can apply this same system to securities.\n\nThrough PRO Securities, Overstock aims to reinvent the public stock market using blockchain-like technology. According to an SEC filing, it could issue as much as $500 million in Overstock shares on the public market.\n\nAdam Krellenstein, a founder of Symbiont, which is addressing financial trading outside of the public equity markets, argues the blockchain is ill-suited to these markets, saying its highly distributed technology couldn\'t keep up with the demands of today\'s high-speed public-equity trading. ""Distributed systems—because they are distributed—trade efficiency and speed for transparency and security,"" he says.\n\nBut although trades can happen nearly instantly on today\'s public equities markets, the current system doesn\'t officially settle these trades for as many as three days. This can tie up market dollars for long stretches, and Byrne claims the delay creates a loophole in the market that can be exploited by traders. Using bitcoin technology, Overstock aims to close this loophole.\n\nThe rub, says James Angel, a professor of finance at Georgetown University, is that investors may have little incentive to adopt Overstock cryptosecurity. They are likely to remain on more traditional systems because that\'s where they have always done their trading. But with so many others pushing in the same direction as Overstock, this inertia may eventually give way.']"

By comparison, many other companies in the Bitcoin world are still in the venture capital funding phases of their progression.\n\nSpondoolies’ integration with Bitcoin Shop will focus largely on developing a seamless Bitcoin mining platform, using hardware developed by Spondoolies. Spondoolies-Tech Bitcoin mining hardware is widely respected as industry standard. In November, CCN reviewed their 1.7 TH/s SP20 rig as being 4.7 out of 5 stars.\n\nA press release from Spondoolies notes that while the exchange rate of bitcoins to dollars has steadily declined, the company has seen constant gains. They also noted that the biggest reason for the overwhelming cost of mining is the consumption of electricity, and that their next, third generation ASIC miner product will go a long way to improving this situation for customers.\n\nThe transaction verification industry is heavily impacted by electricity consumption and the bitcoin to U.S.D exchange rate. Spondoolies-Tech is currently deep in the development stage of its third generation ASIC. The new ASIC will allow Spondoolies to create units that are significantly more efficient than competitors’ offerings. It is anticipated that the 3rd generation ASIC will allow Spondoolies to have a break even return on investment even if market conditions worsen and dive below $100 per BTC.\n\nBitcoin Shop and Cloud Mining\n\nBitcoin Shop, the company Spondoolies is merging with, is presently developing a cloud mining center in North Carolina. One of the nicer things about the way they’re approaching this situation is that they are actually buying the hardware from people in the community, which is one way to be sure that the hardware is actually there, operating. Of course, that’s if working with an actual hardware manufacturer, Spondoolies, is not enough evidence for the doubtful among us.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Shop Inc. Invests $1.5 M In Bitcoin Mining Company Spondoolies-Tech\n\nPresumably, Spondoolies itself will be providing a great deal of the hardware going into this facility, but the company is also accepting (in batches of 50 TH/s or more) other brands, including the overwhelmingly popular Antminer S4/S5 and the Terraminer.\n\nThe merger is scheduled to happen in 2015, with Spondoolies currently undergoing a full audit of its books and inventory in preparation. Also in preparation, earlier this week Bitcoin Shop invested 1.5 million dollars into Spondoolies. CCN will stay alert of any developments in this story.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) launched the first exchange-calculated and disseminated Bitcoin index, called NYXBT.\n\nThe new NYXBT index will represent the US dollar value of one BTC based upon actual transactions occurring on selected cryptocurrency exchanges. These platforms have been previously valuated by the NYSE, a member of the Intercontinental Exchange, the American network of exchanges and clearing houses for financial and commodity markets.\n\nInitially, the NYSE Bitcoin index will feature data from leading US-based crypto exchange Coinbase. The choice is not surprising, as NYSE made a minority investment in the Bitcoin company this year.\n\nThis new index will allow Bitcoiners and also non-cryptocurrency users to track the price of Bitcoin on the New York Stock Exchange based on reliable data.\n\nNYXBT works thanks to a unique methodology that relies on rules-based logic to analyze a dataset of matched transactions and verify the integrity of the data. This process ultimately generates an objective and fair daily value for one BTC in US dollars as of 16:00, London time.\n\nThe users can then access the information within a short period of that time via the widely-distributed NYSE Global Index Feed (GIF). However, the index will be made publicly available for an initial period on the NYSE index page.\n\nMajor financial institutions like the New York Stock Exchange are increasingly realizing the potential of Bitcoin, according to NYSE Group President Thomas Farley. “Bitcoin values are quickly becoming a data point that our customers want to follow as they consider transacting, trading or investing with this emerging asset class,” he said.\n\n“As a global index leader and administrator of ICE LIBOR, ICE Futures US Dollar Index and many other notable benchmarks, we are pleased to bring transparency to this market. By combining our technology infrastructure with our expertise in index calculation and data management, we will continue to launch complementary products based on our rigorous standards and proprietary index methodology.”\n\nThe new index will be supervised by NYSE’s Index Committee. The organization will oversee the rules and methodology behind the benchmark, “working to ensure it continuously reflects the current nature of the evolving Bitcoin market.”\n\nThe committee will also be in charge of identifying and reviewing the data sources for the index calculation process as further exchanges are added to the mix. According to a press release, “the NYSE Bitcoin suite of indices is anticipated to grow, with new indices introduced over time.”', 'May 20, 2015 | By Alec\n\nGetting married is expensive, and we’re not even talking about the wedding itself. Rings quickly cost thousands, especially if your fiancé dreams of a diamond. And then you can better start praying that it isn’t a blood diamond or that the ring falls into the sewer the next day. But what if there was another way of expressing that love in money without easily losing it and without exploiting African miners?\n\nAnd that is, in a nutshell, the concept behind the 3D printable BTC ring, developed by Seb Neumayer and his Bitcoin-crazed friends over at thebtcring.com. They have developed a 3D printable ring that can be made of any material, but that features a QR code linking to a Bitcoin Blockchain. Instead of spending the money on a blood diamond, you pour the funds into the Blockchain, which can be easily checked for value instead of trusting some jeweler.\n\nAs the team behind the BTC ring write on their website, this enables prospective brides to really see how much they are loved (if that’s something that can only be expressed in a dollar figure). ‘Lookup the value of your BTC ring using our android app ,’ they write. ‘Diamonds are shiny, but then your friends don\'t know how much was spent on you. With a BTC ring, the bling is in the code.’ However, the advantages of not losing the ring, the possibitity of adding more to the value at a later date and deciding together what to do with it are also mentioned as advantages, as becomes apparent from the promo clip below (which features excellent acting).\n\nBut perhaps the best thing about the BTC ring is the option to include inscriptions in the blockchain, enabling you to almost engrave the ring with a written testimony of your love. ‘Personalized ""blockchain inscriptions"" not only make the ring more sentimental, but also prevent “relationship double spends” (e.g. Bob can’t give a loaded up ring with a blockchain inscription “Bob Loves Alice” to a girl named Cindy),’ they explain. ‘To inscribe messages at your special address, simply send some Bitcoin from your special address to the address that is the BASE58 encoding of your message (plus the header and checksum).’\n\nWhat’s more, the 3D printable nature of these BTC rings means you are in complete control of design. To design on, download the OpenSCAD file here, and be sure to add the Bitcoin address you would like on the ring. ‘Then simply ""compile and render"" and then export an .stl file for 3D printing your special components.’ Optionally, this means you can even give your partner a metal ring using Shapeways 3D printing services!\n\nPosted in 3D Printing Applications\n\nMaybe you also like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus Fucking Christ wrote at 5/21/2015 1:28:37 AM:what the fuck is this dumb fucking shit are you kidding me in what reality do you liveAnon wrote at 5/20/2015 9:22:02 PM:le gentlesirs can woo all m\'ladies with such a fine piece of jeweleryKWHudson wrote at 5/20/2015 4:01:45 PM:Could someone scan, then use your bitcoin?\n\n\n\n', 'Police in Thailand have raided 13 rooms in a Bangkok apartment complex in connection with an alleged Ponzi scheme called UFUN that may have promoted a fraudulent type of digital currency.\n\nThe raid, reported by local source The Star, follows a number of searches and arrests across the Asia-Pacific region as part of a crackdown on UFUN led by Thailand\'s assistant police chief Suwira Songmetta.\n\nThe group\'s controversial business model focuses on UToken, a so-called bitcoin rival that UFUN claimed was backed by a ""gold reserve system"" alongside several multibillion-dollar companies. However, it remains unclear whether the UToken actually existed given the circumstances.\n\nA similar organisation, MyCoin, made headlines in February following reports its founders had disappeared with up to $387m in bitcoin. It was later revealed that the organisation, which marketed itself as a bitcoin exchange, was unlikely to have handled the digital currency at all.\n\nLast month Songmetta estimated that about 120,000 people were affected by the scheme. Losses could reach as high as 38bn Thai bhat ($1.13bn), he said.\n\nSo far over 110 victims have filed complaints with the police.', 'The Salt Lake City-based online retailer Overstock is working on a revolutionary new development: a new independent stock exchange dubbed Medici, powered by Bitcoin technology. The new stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet.\n\nIn a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 24, Overstock indicated that it may issue up to $500 million in stock or other securities through an alternative trading system built upon blockchain technology that powers bitcoin. Overstock’s CEO Patrick Byrne is confident that the SEC will approve the filing eventually: “I wouldn’t have taken all the time and trouble and expense to do this if I didn’t plan on using it someday soon,” he told Wired.\n\nNow Wired reveals that last fall Overstock purchased a 25 percent stake in government-regulated trading company PRO Securities. The firm, formed in California in 2002 and now based in New Jersey, manages the buying and selling of securities on behalf of its clients, acting as a registered agent between traders and exchanges. In a government filing earlier this year, PRO Securities amended its charter to say it may handle trades in digital securities overseen by technology related to the “blockchain,” the online public ledger that tracks the movement of bitcoin.\n\nAccording Byrne, his company has built blockchain-related technology atop the electronic system operated by PRO Securities and is ready to demonstrate this technology to regulators.\n\n“The prospect of using a blockchain-like public ledger to hold securities or other assets is quite exciting and one that should be explored,” said Georgetown University professor of finance James Angel. He thinks investors will not immediately adopt new blockchain-based trading systems, preferring instead to continue operating with the traditional systems they are familiar with. However, the inevitable inertia may be overcome if Overstock’s and other similar initiatives gain sufficient momentum.\n\nIn fact, momentum is building. On May 11, Nasdaq announced that it would begin to leverage the colored coin protocol Open Assets to expand and enhance the equity management capabilities offered by its Nasdaq Private Market platform.\n\n“Utilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,” said Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld. “Our initial application of Nasdaq’s blockchain technology-enabled offering will modernize, streamline and secure typically cumbersome administrative functions, and will simplify the overwhelming challenges private companies face with manual ledger record-keeping.”\n\nThis vote of confidence by Nasdaq, a prestigious stock exchange and leading financial institution, is bound to have a deep impact on the acceptance of blockchain-based technologies by the financial mainstream. According to Overstock’s Director of Communications Judd Bagley, the Nasdaq initiative will help in overcoming the hurdle of market acceptance of Medici.\n\nOther companies expected to play a leading role in developing and deploying blockchain-based security exchanges are Digital Asset Holdings, headed by former JPMorgan superstar Blythe Masters, and Symbiont, a new digital fintech company focused on fostering the symbiotic relationship between traditional financial markets and cryptographic blockchain technology.\n\nSymbiont was co-founded by the founders of Counterparty, whose technology was initially selected by Overstock as the main software backbone of Medici.', 'Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Bitcoin is supported by a long list of past transactions that cannot be amended after being recorded\n\nFor Bitcoin, 2014 was not a good year. The virtual currency\'s value slumped as scandal after scandal struck, resulting in many people losing significant amounts of money.\n\nOver recent months the ""cryptocurrency"" has stabilised, however it is still worth less than a quarter of its peak value against the dollar.\n\nBut while Bitcoin\'s long-term prospects may remain in doubt, some are suggesting that its underlying technology - the Blockchain - has a bright future.\n\nWhat\'s their business model?\n\nBlockchain businesses take the technology that underpins Bitcoin - the Blockchain - and use it for things the virtual currency\'s unidentified creator, ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", never envisaged when he first published his system for a ""truly peer-to-peer electronic cash system"".\n\nIn Bitcoin, the Blockchain is used to store financial transactions.\n\nThe emerging Blockchain companies believe it can be used for much more.\n\nThe new projects have been dubbed ""Bitcoin 2.0"" - but some Blockchain evangelists are wary of the term because of negative associations with Bitcoin.\n\nOK. So, what is a Blockchain?\n\nIn Bitcoin the Blockchain is a ledger.\n\nImagine walking into the head office of a bank some 80 years ago. Arranged along shelves are a number of hefty, leather-bound books.\n\nYou take one down, blow the dust from the cover and open it up. This is the ledger, and each page contains a number of lines, and on each line is listed a transaction: a credit here, a debit there.\n\nThe Blockchain is simply a representation of this ledger in the form of an ever-expanding computer file. You can think of a block in the Blockchain representing a page in the ledger.\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption A Blockchain can be viewed as the modern equivalent of a ledger, but without the need for an accountant\n\nOther characteristics of the Blockchain are:\n\nThe Blockchain is split up and distributed over thousands of computers all over the world\n\nThese computers compete to be the one to add the next block to the Blockchain\n\nClever cryptography ensures each block is digitally signed in such a way that changing or altering an entry invalidates every other entry preceding it going right the way back to Block 1. This is what makes each entry in the Blockchain immutable\n\nThe uncoordinated nature of the network is what keeps it honest.\n\nTo corrupt the system - in other words to hack it - you would have to commandeer more than 50% of the computers on the system. More on this later.\n\nThis file must get pretty big?\n\nIt does.\n\n""Blockchain bloat"" is a problem the Bitcoin community is already trying to address.\n\nAt the time of writing, the current size of the Blockchain is a touch under 36GB.\n\nFor comparisons sake, that\'s more storage than many smartphones provide, and enough to fill more than 50 standard CD-Roms.\n\nOther than payments, what else can the Blockchain be used for?\n\nJust about any kind of data you can think of that is transactional in nature and requires immutability - ie information that absolutely cannot be changed after it has been created.\n\nA good example is land titles.\n\nTexas-based Factom is working with a Central American client to try to get their system for registering land titles into a Blockchain.\n\nAccording to Factom president Peter Kirby, this country had ""built a database of all their land title records and some bureaucrats got hold of that and they started giving themselves beachfront property"".\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption It is alleged that officials have misused current land record systems to reward themselves with properties\n\nHe added: ""With Blockchain technology, you could create a truly tamper-proof record system. Those land title records can go into the Blockchain in a way that I know if anybody tries to change it.""\n\nOther candidates for insertion into the Blockchain include contracts, royalty payments, certificates for authenticating art and even government budgets.\n\nCan I look at a Blockchain?\n\nYes you can.\n\nYou can download the Bitcoin Blockchain at any time and view transactions in near real-time.\n\nImage copyright Blockexplorer Image caption The Bitcoin Blockchain can be inspected by anyone\n\nAlternatively visit www.blockexplorer.com and use its simplified interface. Just type in a random block number to view the transactions contained within that block.\n\nThat\'s pretty transparent\n\nSure is.\n\nAnd for many this is the most crucial point of all: the Blockchain lacks a central, controlling authority.\n\nWith banks, it\'s the bank that acts as the sole arbiter of the validity of the ledger.\n\nWith land, it\'s the officials controlling the registry.\n\nBoth are examples of what techies are fond of calling a single point of failure.\n\nAnti-corruption group Transparency International says there is great potential in a Blockchain\'s ability to bypass the need for such traditional ""gatekeepers"".\n\n""Corruption appears when you have a monopoly, somebody with discretionality to decide and when you have opacity,"" Alejandro Sales, the body\'s regional director for the Americas tells the BBC.\n\nSo, how would I get my government to put its data through a Blockchain?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nThe Blockchain\'s distributed nature and the ability for anyone in the world with a powerful enough computer to participate is both its strength and weakness.\n\nAccording to the theory, so long as nodes - programs that validate transactions and blocks - don\'t cooperate to break the system, all goes to plan.\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption The Bitcoin Blockchain is trustworthy as no single party controls the computing system supporting it\n\nBut when it comes to putting all this into practice, one Harvard internet law professor thinks he has spotted a flaw.\n\n""Why would we assume that now and forever no one entity could command more than half of the computing power of the people mining a Blockchain?"" asks Prof Jonathan Zittrain.\n\n""I haven\'t really heard a satisfying answer to that.""', 'Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services and architect of the BitLicense, is leaving the government.\n\nSomewhere in a co-working space New York City, a bitcoin startup founder is cheering. In his four years at the post, Lawsky, a former federal prosecutor, has led cases involving BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, and other banking giants. The New York Times says that he “shook up the sleepy world of financial regulation in New York.” Bloomberg Businessweek wrote that Lawsky “elbowed his way to global prominence.” In 2013, the Village Voice ran a cover illustration that depicted Lawsky in a cowboy hat and called him “Johnny Lawsky.”\n\nBut it has been Lawsky’s work on the difficult task of regulating digital currency businesses that, arguably, pushed him into the limelight more than ever before. Lawsky spent the past year revising and re-revising the BitLicense—New York State’s official regulatory guidelines that govern digital money transmitters. BitLicense is the first set of regulations devoted to digital currency business from any state. While New York was first out the gate in this regard, it also has been subject to scrutiny and criticism from those in the bitcoin community who fear that BitLicense is too stringent and goes too far, mistakenly restricting businesses that say they shouldn’t be covered by these rules.\n\nThe fears over BitLicense turned Lawsky into something of a villain in the bitcoin community; at a recent breakfast panel in Manhattan, bitcoin CEOs, policy pundits, and other leaders gathered specifically to discuss the problems with the most recent version of the BitLicense. The venture capitalist Fred Wilson, founder of the firm Union Square Ventures, railed that New York could “lose the next Wall Street” to Silicon Valley, Estonia, North Carolina (which has looser digital currency regulations) or somewhere else.\n\nOne company, the digital wallet provider Xapo, even relocated its global headquarters from Palo Alto to Zurich—perhaps as a way to flee the laws of Lawsky. (The company said its move did not have to do with BitLicense, but it nonetheless adds credibility to Wilson’s claim that Lawsky’s new regulations will cause bitcoin innovators to leave New York.)\n\nLawsky’s departure could mean a friendlier environment in New York for digital currency businesses. Or, depending on his replacement’s attitudes, it could get worse for them.\n\nWhere is Lawsky headed, meanwhile? He plans to open his own firm, according to the Times, and to begin lecturing at Stanford. In other words, Lawsky is leaving Wall Street and heading closer to Sand Hill Road. Perhaps he’ll end up getting involved with the very companies he targeted from his government perch.', ""Advocates say that Bitcoin could democratize finance. Case in point, the founder of peer-to-peer lending service ProudSource Joe McKinney is building a company that aims to connect underbanked populations to capital so that they can build businesses or fund an education. The attitude can be summed up as so: Why should only the wealthy fulfill their business dreams? McKinney said over Skype:\n\n“If you add microfinancing, you are reaching anyone with a [friggin’] cell phone who wants a [friggin’] loan.”\n\nMcKinney explained how bitcoin — or other cryptocurrencies — along with microfinancing, and mobile technology could form a new platform that would make it easier to dole out loans and charity.\n\nMicrofinancing\n\nToday more than 10,000 microfinancing institutions hand out loans to the disadvantaged. Lenders can browse websites like Kiva and choose who to fund a woman looking to launch a business or a farmer facing a rough patch.\n\nBitcoin advocates that the cryptocurrency is a new way to approach the classic idea. So while services like Kiva act as an intermediary with agents on the ground who manage loans, bitcoin allows for peer-to-peer lending. In doing so, Bitcoin slashes the typical transactions costs. Lenders and borrowers can connect peer-to-peer, like over the ProudSource platform. And it can all be done by phone.\n\n“In the future, loans and repayments will be made instantly and on a peer-to-peer basis with the terms broadcast on a blockchain,” Bitcoin Microfinance founder Ben Jones told CoinTelegraph, referencing the “blockchain,” which shows every bitcoin transaction ever made. He added:\n\n“Middle men will be made redundant and borrowers’ credit history will be publicly available.”\n\nAnd some companies are already taking advantage of that. BTCJam and BitLendingClub are paving the way for peer-to-peer microlending in bitcoin.\n\nCase study: ProudSource\n\nProudSource (website not yet available) starts with a straightforward application process. Any low-income entrepreneur can apply on the online application and then the borrower must be vetted and endorsed by a trustee.\n\nThe name ProudSource is pinched from the French philosopher Pierre Proudhon, who pioneered the idea of a mutualist bank, hypothetical banks that lend to the poor at a low interest rate. Boiled down, the idea behind ProudSource is to offer a private-market safety net.\n\nOnce up and running, ProudSource will offer its own brand of microfinancing—“not traditional” as McKinney called it. The inner workings are a bit complicated. The investment structure is a loan and venture capital hybrid, called Progressive Return on Capital Investment (PROCI), which is friendly to borrowers because there are no interest rates and borrowers only pay back the loan if they are profitable. Venture capitalists who invest in the company effectively buy a share of the projects backed by the loans.\n\nHold on a second\n\nJones doesn't think that bitcoin microfinance will take off right away. He and Bitcoin Microfinance are researching Beam Remit, a startup that facilitates cheap and quick remittances in Ghana. Even if there is tremendous potential, we have a ways to go before peer-to-peer loans are an everyday tool—especially in the developing countries where the infrastructure is lacking. His bet is that remittances will come first.\n\nCompanies like BitPesa are building the tools for remittances in Africa. These will make these next-generation tools like microfinance possible down the line, however, according to Jones:"", 'The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP), has released a report on 10 leading Bitcoin wallets, setting standards for privacy that they argue are much needed in the space. The Bitcoin wallets in the report include Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Mycelium, Darkwallet, Airbitz, Armory, Electrum, Bitcoin Wallet and Multibit Classic.\n\nAccording to the report, Darkwallet is the most privacy-concerned wallet, while Coinbase falls on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nOBPP is a Bitcoin privacy research organization lead by prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, including Kristov Atlas, a well-known privacy researcher; software designer Justus Ranvier; engineer Daniel Krawisz at Monetas; technical illustrator Samuel Peterson, and others.\n\nThe researchers looked at various aspects of wallet software, including where public addresses are generated, whether clients (such as light wallets) need to ask trusted servers for the balance of their accounts, whether users are protected from blockchain observers through the use of coin mixers or stealth addresses.\n\nAll off the test results added up to three categories of testing: usability, quality and feedback. These three add up for a total privacy score of up to 100 points. All wallet providers were sent a questionnaire and given a chance to review the research results before publishing. Almost half of the wallet developers did not respond to the questionnaire.\n\nThe three lowest ranked wallets for privacy: Coinbase, Multibit, Blockchain.info,\n\nCoinbase is a leading U.S. Bitcoin company that provides exchange and payment processing services as well as wallet services. Both of these wallets provide custodial services to users and keep control over their private keys, with the exception of Coinbase Vault’s support for multi-signature wallets. OBPP focused on the classic version, which keeps full control over their user’s private keys. It did not fare well under their tests.\n\n“Because of the custodial nature of Coinbase’s wallet, users are afforded low privacy. Private keys are generated and held server-side, and the service retains detailed information about incoming and outgoing transactions. Customers must undergo a stringent identification process in order to use the service. The wallet generates new Bitcoin addresses for change, but employs few other basic controls to protect privacy on the blockchain,” said the authors of the OBPP report.\n\nThe authors also point out that Coinbase can improve these privacy vulnerabilities and remain compliant with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules by discouraging address reuse and providing better feedback to users about actions that will degrade their privacy.\n\nThe Coinbase wallet scored only 11 out of 100 possible points for privacy. Only a few points above Coinbase was the Blockchain.info wallet. Blockchain.info is one of the oldest companies in the Bitcoin wallet space and were the first to advocate full user control over private keys, a standard that set the bar for all wallet providers.\n\nAs early leaders in the Bitcoin wallet race, their web and mobile wallets quickly became the most widely used, with nearly 3.4 million wallets in existence, according to OBPP.\n\nWhile Blockchain.info has made efforts toward improving user privacy, including the launch of their CoinJoin bitcoin mixing technology, they have fallen behind by not implementing hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. This generally means that users must manually create new addresses for each transaction for maximum privacy and continuously update their backups, instead of new addresses being automatically generate for each transaction from a common seed.\n\nAccording to the OBPP report, Blockchain.info’s web and mobile wallets function so differently that they analyzed each individually, and they received scores of 22 and 14 out of 100 respectively, leaving them at above only Coinbase in the rankings.\n\nKristov Atlas told Bitcoin Magazine that “The single biggest differentiator for the spring 2015 rankings was whether the wallet was [hierarchical deterministic]”\n\nFirst place: Darkwallet\n\nAt the top of the rankings is Darkwallet, a Google Chrome extension wallet. Darkwallet made international headlines over the past two years as an anonymity and anti-surveillance software initiative founded by activists Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson. Its objective is to make Bitcoin finance “go dark.”\n\nThe Darkwallet project has been noticeably absent from the media in the past months but the development build of the wallet put it at the lead as far as total privacy with a score of 54.\n\n“Darkwallet in the only wallet we’ve considered so far which includes automatic CoinJoin mixing and ECDH stealth addresses. Another notable feature in Darkwallet is an automatic P2P network for messaging between users,” according to the OBPP report.\n\nDarkwallet is indeed the only major Bitcoin wallet with stealth addresses (SA) natively supported for recipients and senders. Some wallets, such as Electrum, support sending, but not receiving, SA transactions. Because of the nature of SA, it is essential that other wallets support the technology to enhance its utility and standardization.\n\nTwo of the weaknesses of Darkwallet were its dependence on “Obelisk servers which have the ability to de-anonymize users,” coupled with low user activity, which makes it much harder to find others to mix up your transactions with, particularly with significant amounts of bitcoin.\n\nSince Darkwallet is still in alpha development, future growth of the user base could alleviate the liquidity problems of their mixing process. Nevertheless, the OBPP researchers expressed uncertainty about the future of the project given that has not released a stable build yet and no development activity has occurred since February 2015. The Darkwallet developers did not respond to the OBPP questionnaire.\n\nDesktop wallets: Armory, Electrum, Multibit\n\nTaking second-place in overall privacy ranking is Armory, the full-node Bitcoin vault that provides wallet security software for the intermediate and advanced Bitcoin users and enterprise customers. Armory is available for Linux, Windows and OSX and is among the more resource-intensive wallets, in part because it’s designed to run a full bitcoin node. It had a total privacy score of 54, tying it for first place with Darkwallet.\n\nArmory was praised for supporting with hierarchical deterministic (HD) address generation and not reusing addresses by default, as well as supporting TOR connections with minimal configuration.\n\nThe researchers suggest that Armory can improve privacy protections for users by supporting a mixing protocol such as CoinJoin as well as by informing users when they are making choices that compromise their privacy, a common criticism leveled at most the wallets included in the report.\n\nElectrum followed the desktop wallets with a score of 46, tying it for fifth place with the mobile Bitcoin Wallet. It earned that ranking for its support of HD addresses, using a 12-word seed for a one-time backup, as well as its default generation of new addresses per transaction. But most noticeably, Electrum was praised for being included in the privacy-centric Tails operating system, as well as its easy compatibility with TOR connections.\n\nElectrum’s largest weakness, according to OBPP, was its reliance in a federated network of Electrum servers which connect it to the Bitcoin network. The researcher suggest Electrum could improve its score by adding support for stealth addresses and CoinJoin.\n\nThe most private mobile wallets: Mycelium, Bitcoin Wallet, Electrum, AirBitz\n\nTaking third place with a score of 50 was Mycelium, the Android and iOS Bitcoin wallet which regularly earns praise for its privacy features. Mycelium ranked highly for its use of HD wallets and its easy support for TOR connections.\n\nHowever, it was criticized for relying on the Mycelium servers rather than Bitcoin peers to connect to the Bitcoin network. This weakness, they argue, allows the company to gather information on users. This weakness was common among most Bitcoin wallets, except those running a full node, such as Armory.\n\nFollowing Mycelium were Bitcoin Wallet, Electrum and Airbitz, all with scores of 45 or 46 out of 100.\n\nThese mid-ranked wallets generally suffered from the same weaknesses: reliance on central servers to connect to the Bitcoin network, no support of stealth addresses, and no graphic user interface warnings informing users about choices that compromise their privacy. Among the four mobile wallets, only Mycelium and Airbitz responded to the questionnaire provided by the OBPP.\n\nInterested parties can read the full report here and contribute to the OBPP efforts at their website.', 'Bitnation, the blockchain-based Governance 2.0 initiative led by charismatic founder Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, released a first alpha of its Bitnation Pangea collaborative platform for DIY Governance. The release is tagged alpha 0.1.0, which makes it clear that it isn’t yet stable or full-featured. However, the roadmap is nothing short of revolutionary and could have a significant impact.\n\n“Bitnation is a Governance 2.0 Operating System, designed to disrupt the nation-state oligopoly through offering more convenient, secure and cost-efficient governance services,” Tarkowski Tempelhof, a Swedish thinker and activist who spent years working as a contractor in various conflict zones , told Bitcoin Magazine. “As the world progressively moves away from the current geographical nation state paradigm due to globalization, it leaves room for a brand new solution to rise from its ashes, one where governance service providers compete through offering better services, rather than through maintaining a geographical monopoly using violence.”\n\nBitnation Pangea wants to be the world’s first blockchain powered Virtual Nation, able to provide all services that traditional governments provide and replace the nation state system with a voluntary form of governance. Bitnation’s ultimate aim is to create a new world where everyone can choose the nation they prefer, several nations, or none at all, and even create their own nation on the Bitnation platform.\n\n“The alternative the world is currently pivoting towards is U.N.-style global organizations, which would be an even worse ‘one-fit-all’ type governance model than what we currently have,” says Tarkowski Tempelhof. “Bitnation aims to prevent that, through setting a precedent for voluntary competing service providers, powered by the Bitcoin blockchain technology, effectively creating an open source cryptonation protocol.”\n\nThe backbone of the platform consists of the ID and Reputation System (The Bitnation Passport), the Dispute Resolution System, the Public Notary and a DIY Governance (D)App Library where others can create, upload, share or sell their own Governance (D)Apps. Planned services include marriage, wills, childcare contracts, birth certificates, land titles, corporate incorporation and equity trade, unemployment insurance, pensions, health care insurance, security and diplomacy.\n\nThe alpha release, which is updated in realtime in response to user feedback on the Bitnation discussion groups, already includes some interesting features, such as the possibility to register and timestamp a document on the blockchain.\n\nPrevious Bitnation pathfinders and proofs of concept include the first marriage registered on the blockchain and the first blockchain passport. Bitnation also developed and tested workable DIY land titles recorded on the blockchain in Ghana, where 70 percent of land lacks proper titles, preventing investing in and borrowing against land.\n\nBitnation, after surveying many blockchain-based protocols, has teamed up with Horizon and Blocknet to develop the first implementation of Pangea. While the Horizon blockchain is used in the alpha release, Blocknet technology will enable Pangea to support other blockchains. According to Tarkowski Tempelhof, future releases of Pangea will not be limited to altcoins but able to use the Bitcoin blockchain itself, which bids well for the future of the project.\n\n“Bitnation is a groundbreaking concept, and we’re very excited to provide a platform for it to be developed upon,” said Blocknet core team member Arlyn Culwick. “We believe that the Blocknet, by enabling open ended inter-chain services, unlocks the full potential of blockchain-based technology.”\n\n“Bitnation is a revolutionary idea, an idea which we believe will radically change the world for the better,” said Tarkowski Tempelhof in a previous press release. “However, being the first in the world to challenge the nation-state construct head-on through providing better services using blockchain technology, it is not always easy to implement.”\n\nOf course, one of the main challenges is funding. Therefore the Bitnation team, which so far has mostly relied on volunteers, is looking for a moderate amount of angel funding to put its operations on more solid ground.']"

In order to circumvent the costly fees associated with transferring money internationally, as well as the time it takes for such funds to move from bank to bank, payments made via Bitcoin can save both money and time for employers and employees alike, explains Bitwage’s founder and COO, Jonathan Chester.\n\n“By using technologies like Blockchain,” says Chester -- a public, chronological ledger of all Bitcoin transactions -- “you can actually see exactly where the money is throughout the process.”\n\nRelated: How the World's First Bitcoin Charity Is Harnessing the Cryptocurrency to Change Lives (VIDEO)\n\nThe Bitwage platform can receive wages from employers and then pay these wages to employees in each of their respective local currencies, Chester added, using Bitcoin as a kind of temporary middleman to rapidly facilitate the transfer.\n\nA handful of businesses already using the service include Wisconsin-based coffee company Colectivo and real-time Internet marketing company Rockerbox, but Bitwage envisions itself eventually servicing multitudes -- from unbanked workers in developing countries to the world’s biggest earners.\n\nFor more about Bitwage, check out this short video.\n\nRelated: Why Billionaire Investor Reid Hoffman Is Betting Big on Bitcoin"", 'Digital BTC, an Australian Bitcoin company that is publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) as Digital CC Limited has secured a $3.5 million AUD funding round by a group of institutional and individual investors to launch a remittance-focused product, AirPocket.\n\nCEO and founder Zhenya Tsvetnenko specifically explained that the funds from the “investment will be used accelerate the rollout and commercialization of AirPocket in Latin America and Caribbean.”\n\nThe company was originally seeking for a $3 million AUD funding round, until the demand from local investors rose and the company had to enlarge the funding round with another $500,000 AUD. The increased funding round raised the company’s cash to over $6 million.\n\nThe product soon to be launched in Latin America and the Caribbean is a smartphone app which “effectively allows anyone to act as a small Western Union outlet.” Users are provided with a map interface which displays other agents called AirAgents in another country who passes the money to the recipient. Every transaction established on AirPocket will be recorded on the bitcoin blockchain, which allows the ledger to be viewed by anyone anywhere. This model is similar to Bitcoin remittance app Abra, which was unveiled earlier this year.\n\nTsvetnenko explained “Our platform is unique in that it makes remittances easier by leveraging the sharing economy pioneered by Uber and Airbnb.”\n\nAccording to Proactive Investors Australia, the beta version of AirPocket will be launched in June of 2015 and the commercial version is set to be launched for the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nDigitalBTC holds a minimum 75 percent interest of AirPocket and the other 25 percent is divided within the investors including William Witenberg, Juan Carlos Barrera and Sanjay Santhanam.\n\nDigital BTC CEO Zhenya Tsvetnenko stated “The quality of the joint venture team provides strong validation of the commercial potential for AirPocket and I’m confident they are the right people to execute the business strategy in Latin America and the Caribbean and capitalize on the huge potential to disrupt the multi-billion dollar remittance market.”\n\nCompany’s Loss in 2014\n\nThe Australian bitcoin company Digital BTC traded on the Australian Securities Exchange as Digital CC limited reported a total net loss of $2.3 million in the second half of 2014.\n\nAfter a substantially large loss, digitalBTC still holds net assets worth $6.87 million, in which over $740,000 are bitcoins and the remaining are cash.\n\nAs the global adoption of digital currencies including bitcoin is increasing as a system of payment, digital BTC aims to target the remittance markets in regions with poor banking systems and financial infrastructure such as Latin America and the Caribbean.', 'Bitcoin payment processor and storage provider Coinapult is now seeking customers in the US market following a services integration with Crypto Capital.\n\nThe bitcoin firm did previously offer its bitcoin wallet service to US customers but said that the country\'s users were blocked from its website in July last year as the company was not a licensed money transmitter.\n\nBy opening an account with Crypto Capital, a licensed money transmitter in Panama, Coinapult will now allow its users to deposit, withdraw and transfer fiat currency.\n\nA Coinapult spokesperson told CoinDesk:\n\n""Coinapult is not a licensed money transmitter business, and as such, we did not offer our services to the US market.

The recipients get the funds immediately on their MasterCard or other cards, into mobile money and bank accounts or via cash agent outlets.\n\n“This unique platform will enable disbursements and person-to-person (P2P) payments to and from virtually any U.S. debit card account, including non-MasterCard debit cards,” notes the MasterCard announcement. “MasterCard Send is the only personal payments service that can reach virtually all U.S. debit card accounts and enable funds to be sent and received typically within seconds – far superior to existing solutions that either limit transfers within a closed-loop network or involve ACH [Automated Clearing House], which can take several days for funds to be received.”\n\nMasterCard Send payments are routed through the MasterCard network. Some news outlets quickly remarked that a centralized payment solution can’t be P2P. In fact, MasterCard is using “P2P” in the sense of person-to-person, not peer-to-peer, so the claim seems technically correct. However, MasterCard Send is not P2P in the sense of BitTorrent or Bitcoin.\n\n“Through MasterCard Send, we have enabled a breakthrough solution that takes the pain out of the system, provides faster clearing of payments, and delivers a better user experience for senders and receivers alike,” said MasterCard chief emerging payments officer Ed McLaughlin. “MasterCard Send is addressing a real need that exists in today’s digital world to enable consumers, businesses, governments and more to have a safe, simple and secure way to transfer and receive funds quickly.”\n\nBarb King, a group head in the MasterCard Payment Systems Integrity Group, described the service to PYMNTS as “a breakthrough platform in the industry.” She said that that the service is being marketed to companies and institutions, rather than directly to consumers, and mentioned B2C (business-to-consumer) and G2C (government-to-consumer) use cases. The MasterCard announcement notes that insurance claims, rebates, e-marketplace payouts, social benefits and tax refunds can now be sent in real-time. However, nothing seems to prevent individuals from using the platform to send payments and remittances to other consumers.\n\nMasterCard Send emulates one of the two main advantages of bitcoin payments – fast transactions that take minutes instead of days. Details on the business model and economics were not disclosed, so it isn’t clear if MasterCard plans to emulate the other mainstream advantage of bitcoin payments – cheap transactions.\n\nThe MasterCard announcement doesn’t mention Bitcoin, but King told PYMNTS that “consumers are much more comfortable giving their personal details to their financial institution than they are to many other types of entities,” and that is a big reason why she believes MasterCard Send is more appealing than the bitcoin protocol.\n\nIt’s clear that traditional payment processors won’t let bitcoin payments eat their lunch without a fight. Currently, MasterCard Send seems a strong competitor to centralized operators such as PayPal and Venmo, but not a competitor to peer-to-peer, decentralized bitcoin payments.\n\nPhoto: Credit card of future / CC BY 2.0', 'Bitcoin has been subject to a lot of fraudulent activity, owing partly to the decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions. In addition to hacking attacks and bitcoin wallet theft, the digital currency has also been used as a means of money transfer in Ponzi investment schemes.\n\nIn Thailand, local news reports showed that the police have conducted a raid on a condominium building at Ratchadaphisek Road on allegations that an investment scheme was being conducted in the area. The suspect, who is Malaysian, has been blocked access to 13 rooms in the building.\n\nBitcoin Ponzi Scheme Operations\n\nApparently, the controversial UFun investment scheme has been running for quite some time already, under Kevin Lai, a manager of UDBP Management in Thailand. This was promoted openly as a commercial bank but not registered as one with the Bank of Thailand.\n\nThe rooms had allegedly been used to host members of the UFun management and diplomats from Vanuatu until the government got wind of fraudulent activities being conducted in the building. Since then, the Foreign Ministry refused to accept Vanuatu government’s request to recognise Lai as a special envoy, as he held diplomatic status for the Micronesian country of Nauru in 2005 but was discharged from the post in 2011.\n\nThe scam involves UToken, a so-called bitcoin rival that UFun claimed was backed by a gold reserve system. This is similar to the MyCoin scam, which had owners marketing themselves as a bitcoin exchange company. Back in February, its founders disappeared with approximately $400 million in bitcoin.\n\nThailand’s assistant police chief Suwira Songmetta mentioned that around 120,000 people have been victim to the UFun scam, with losses potentially reaching $1.13 billion. So far, only 110 people have filed official complaints. The raid followed a recent discovery by police that UFun Store Co Ltd, an affiliate of UFun, deposited $10 million under UDBP Management.', 'A few hours after Newsweek released its story about the man it alleged to be Satoshi Nakamoto, in March 2014, four men took the stage at an auditorium in the New York headquarters of the Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs to talk about Satoshi\'s creation.\n\nThis was a private conference for some of the bank\'s most powerful hedge fund clients. In addition to appearances from former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, the former head of the Bank of England, and the former president of the World Bank, Goldman had put together a four-person panel to educate its clients on virtual currencies. The panel, according to several attendees, was led by the co-head of technology at Goldman, a tall, bald physics PhD named Paul Walker. He opened the fireside chat by describing the two things about Bitcoin that everyone seemed to be able to agree on: ""It\'s something on the Internet that seems to be worth money, and it seems to have been invented by a mysterious person."" But, Walker said, in a joking reference to the morning\'s story from Newsweek, ""the last part may no longer be true.""\n\nSitting next to Walker were Barry Silbert, Bitcoin\'s biggest advocate in the New York financial community, and Chris Larsen, the chief executive of a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency startup, Ripple Labs. Most men in the room were wearing ties, but in true Silicon Valley style, Larsen and Silbert were not. The fourth member of the panel was the former head of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or Fincen, James Freis.\n\nSilbert asked how many people in the room were skeptical about virtual currencies, and a good majority of them put their hands up. Silbert noted how different this gathering was from the elite circles on the West Coast, where at recent events he\'d attended a minority of the participants had expressed skepticism. Silbert said it reminded him of the early days of the Internet when everyone in the tech industry was leaving good jobs to try to cash in on the new idea.\n\n""It\'s either going to change everything, or nothing,"" Silbert said.\n\nTo appeal to all the financial minds in the room, Larsen said that all the early problems surrounding Bitcoin had obscured the fact that the technology underlying it made something possible that had never been possible before.\n\n""The world now knows how to confirm financial transactions without a central operator,"" he said.\n\nIt was, though, Walker, the high-ranking Goldman executive, who provided the most encouraging comments about the technology. He said the conceptual advances made by Bitcoin weren\'t just clever; they were useful in ways that could influence the future financial system. He had obviously been spending a lot of time studying this and was clearly impressed by what he saw. He suggested that Goldman was not planning to buy or sell bitcoins, but he indicated that the bank was taking a hard look at how the blockchain might be used to change basic things about how banks do business.\n\nIt currently took the bank three or so days to settle stock trades. What if that could happen instantly and be recorded on a blockchain for everyone to see?\n\nBarry Silbert and Chris Larsen were beaming. Few things could help a financial cause more than getting the imprimatur of the firm known as ""the smartest on Wall Street,"" a bank renowned for always seeing what was coming around the next corner and making the right bets. Walker wasn\'t making any official announcements, but everyone could see the Goldman executive was into this.\n\nWalker reflected an increasingly widespread fascination in financial circles with the blockchain concept underlying the Bitcoin technology. Many bankers had begun to understand what Gavin Andresen, the longtime Bitcoin software developer, had seen back in 2010 when he first became entranced by the idea of a financial network with no single point of failure. For banks that were terrified of cyber attacks, the idea of a payment network that could keep running even if one player, or one set of servers, got taken out was incredibly attractive. More broadly, the banks were waking up to several increasingly viable efforts to decentralize finance and take business that had belonged to the big banks. Crowdfunding companies like Kickstarter, and marketplace lending services like Lending Club, were trying to directly connect borrowers with savers and investors, so that a bank was not necessary. The blockchain seemed to present a decentralized alternative to an even more basic part of the banking industry\'s business \x97 payments.\n\nThe banks were notably not becoming any more friendly toward working with Bitcoin the currency. JPMorgan Chase\'s operating committee, led by Jamie Dimon, decided in the spring of 2014 that it would not work with any Bitcoin companies. At events in California with tech moguls, Dimon spoke derisively about Bitcoin and the ambitions of Silicon Valley to take over Wall Street\'s business, according to people who attended the meetings. Dimon said that JPMorgan and the other banks weren\'t going to go down without a fight. At one point, JPMorgan threatened to stop providing services even to other banks that had Bitcoin companies as customers \x97 like the European bank working with Bitstamp, according to a person involved in the discussions. [Editor\'s note: JPMorgan did not comment on the record after repeated requests from American Banker.] Other American banks went so far as to close down the accounts of individuals who transferred money to Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBut inside almost all these banks, there were people who loved the concept of a decentralized financial system like Bitcoin. JPMorgan maintained a so-called Bitcoin Working Group, with about two dozen members from across the bank and around the world, which was led by the bank\'s head of strategy and which was looking at how the ideas behind Bitcoin might be harnessed by the financial industry.\n\nThis JPMorgan group began confidentially working with other major banks in the country that belong to The Clearing House, on an experimental effort to imagine a new blockchain that would be jointly run by the computers of the largest banks and serve as the backbone for a new, instant payment system that might replace Visa, MasterCard, and wire transfers. Such a blockchain would not need to rely on the anonymous miners powering the Bitcoin blockchain. But it could ensure there would no longer be a single point of failure in the payment network. If Visa\'s systems came under attack, all the stores using Visa were screwed. But if one bank maintaining a blockchain came under attack, all the other banks could keep the blockchain going.\n\nFor many technology experts at banks, the most valuable potential use of the blockchain was not small payments but very large ones, which are responsible for the vast majority of the money moving between banks each day. In the stock trading business, for example, the lengthy settlement and clearing process means that the money and shares are all but frozen for three days. Given the sums involved, even the few days that the money is in transit carry significant costs and risks. As a result, various banks began looking at ways they could use the blockchain technology to make these sorts of large transfers quickly and securely. For many banks, the biggest stumbling block was the inherent unreliability of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is, of course, powered by thousands of unvetted computers around the world, all of which could stop supporting the blockchain at any moment. This increased the desire to find a way to create blockchains independent of Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve had its own people looking at how to harness the blockchain technology and potentially even Bitcoin itself.\n\nMany in the existing Bitcoin community scoffed at the idea that the blockchain concept could be separated from the currency. As they viewed it, the currency, and the mining of the currency, was what gave users the incentive to join and power the blockchain. Given that a blockchain could be taken over and subverted if an attacker controlled more than 50% of the computing power on the network, a blockchain was only as secure as the amount of computing power hooked into the network. A blockchain run by a few dozen banks would be much easier to overwhelm than the Bitcoin network, which now commanded more raw computing power than all the major supercomputers combined.\n\nA year after the Goldman conference, the firm invested in Circle Internet Financial, a startup that sells and stores bitcoins for consumers, and the Nasdaq disclosed a pilot test of the Bitcoin blockchain for trading securities.\n\nNathaniel Popper is a reporter at The New York Times.

And it\'s probably faster to use one of the services below than it is to mail a check, enter credit card information, or go through PayPal, anyway. Fees for the services mentioned below range from 0.5 % - 3 %.\n\nTake a world tour with these bill pay providers:\n\nCanada\n\nBylls – Residents of Canada can pay essentially any bill using Bylls – users need not limit themselves to utilities. ""Unverified"" users – those who choose not to submit government papers – can use Bylls to pay up to CAN$1,000 worth of bills per month. ""Verified"" users can pay up to CAN$5,000 per month.\n\nMexico\n\nVolabit or Pademobile – Volabit recently integrated a digital assistant from Whatsapp named Jaime. Using Jaime, users can pay both utility and phone bills in Mexico with Bitcoin.\n\nPademobile offers services to both Mexico and the U.S., but its utility and phone bill pay services are more geared to Mexico. It behaves much like Kenya\'s mPesa, allowing users to send anyone money via a simple text message. But unlike mPesa, Pademobile uses Bitcoin, not fiat.\n\nPakistan or Malaysia\n\nPayBill – Residents of either of these regions can use PayBill to pay gas, electricity, cell phone, landline or Internet bills. No account creation or document submission is needed.\n\nPayBill accepts bitcoin, litecoin, and dogecoin and hopes to expand its services to more regions soon.\n\nAustralia\n\nLiving Room of Satoshi or Noghi – Living Room of Satoshi was among the first Bitcoin-to-bill-pay services to emerge. After temporarily shutting down while deciding whether or not a Bitcoin tax applied to them, Living Room of Satoshi re-opened for business last year.\n\nLike Living Room of Satoshi, the company Noghi uses the BPay network (the organization that centralizes utility billing in Australia) to offer users the ability to pay all BPay bills with crypto instead.\n\nArgentina\n\nenBitcoins – During the last few months as the Argentinian peso has undergone rapid inflation, enBitcoins has been offering bill payments with the more stable bitcoin. No government papers are needed to use the service.\n\nThailand\n\nCoins.co.th – This company functions similarly to Mexico\'s Pademobile – it\'s a wallet that offers utility and phone bill pay services.\n\nCoins also acts as an exchange for both buying and selling bitcoins, making it far easier for Thai residents new to Bitcoin to get their hands on some.\n\nPhilippines\n\nThe Bills Ninja will pay your Filipino bills while kicking and punching. No government papers are needed to use the service, and users can create an account for personal recording-keeping, or just go account-less.\n\nCoins.ph is the Filipino branch of Coins.co.th. They offer the same services as their Thai counterpart -- phone top-up, money transfer, and bill pay.\n\nItaly\n\nNordOvest Energie is an Italian gas and electric company. They began accepting bitcoins for payment only this month, using payment processor Tinkl.it. This made them the second utility company in Europe to add cryptocurrency to their list of accepted currencies.\n\nNetherlands\n\nBas Nederland was the first European utility company to accept bitcoins directly, beginning in early 2014. They provide an interesting option to customers called “path to zero,” which apparently provides residents with self-run, power-generating tools in exchange for the long-term cost savings they provide.\n\nDon\'t Live There?\n\nLive somewhere other than the regions listed above, but still want to pay your bills with Bitcoin? Never fear.\n\nThe company Bitwala is a crypto-to-SEPA service, which means they\'ll make a bank transfer on your behalf in exchange for bitcoins. This service, of course, can be used to pay bills.\n\nBankymoon, on the other hand, will enable you not only to pay your South-African utility bills, but to top off the meters of anyone else in the world.\n\nLastly, the company 12Charge processes cell phone top-ups and utility payments for over 110 countries – essentially globally.

Some have chosen to ban outright the currency while others see it as an opportunity for domestic economic growth & as a tax revenue stream for the nation-state. Sweden has recently instituted new regulations that at least show it is not going to be banned anytime soon. Or will it?\n\nSweden Creates Bitcoin Mining Tax Regulations\n\nIn the country of Sweden, how they tax your income can be done in three different ways, depending upon its category of origin. You can be taxed on income from the economic activity, or a hobby. Bitcoin, or any digital currency, mining operations do not fall under this income sector due to the relatively high cost of equipment and the low potential for potential for profit. If you become good at mining, it will fall under this income outline, as outlined by Sweden’s Tax Authority in this way:\n\n“…..carries out the mining in a professional and cost-efficient manner over a longer period with appropriate equipment,” or if “the activity is expected to create a surplus as measured over the full financial calculation period” and “the computing capacity can be expected to generate more than 25 bitcoins a year (or the equivalent value in form of transactional fees or other virtual currency)…..”\n\nAlso read: Sweden and Norway to add Bitcoin VAT – Norway to implement Bitcoin tax\n\nBitcoin does not seem to be deemed as “capital”, so bitcoin will not be taxed as income derived from capital. It is rare that hobby activities generate a taxable income, and tax deductions are available up to five years in advance, so bitcoin mining in Sweden will commonly fall under the tax of income from employment. Employment is the default tax sector for anything that doesn’t easily fit into a tax of economic activity or tax on capital. So Sweden has set up some laws as a baseline, which is a start.\n\nA problem with bitcoin comes in the form of a new ban against using bitcoin to buy or sell scrap metal or “waste products”. The ban dovetails with the ban of using cash to buy or sell scrap metal and other industries that is becoming popular throughout European governments. Cash is not very traceable, and bitcoin is not considered traceable (the block chain ledger of bitcoin transactions notwithstanding), so it will also be banned in Sweden under certain situations.\n\nThe bans on cash are questionable in effectiveness, at best, and only hurt the average consumer, or a small business, not a criminal. These certainly help build a “Police State,” where every transaction must be “traceable” and monitored, presumably under the guise of “fighting terrorism”, not that Sweden is a hotbed of terrorist activity. Similar cash bans are being tested in the United States as well. If that is the end goal or result, this ban may be indicative of a bigger problem in Europe than a person buying scrap metal in bitcoin.\n\nWhat do you think of the Swedish tax code for miners and the new Bitcoin ban joining a new cash ban? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'California officials briefly raised hopes among digital currency proponents Friday by releasing a statement that they would drop plans to regulate digital currency businesses and instead defer to the legislature.\n\nBut the Department of Business Oversight quickly retracted the statement, saying it had been sent prematurely.\n\n""The statement that we sent out is inoperative,"" said Tom Dresslar, the department\'s deputy commissioner for policy and planning. ""It was sent in error. The reality is we\'re still assessing the extent to which, if at all, we want to regulate virtual currencies under existing California law.""\n\nA decision to refrain from applying money transmitter licensing requirements and other regulations to Bitcoin and other digital currency firms would have been a welcome surprise for the young industry. According to Carol van Cleef, a partner at the law firm of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, until now the department was widely expected to provide a legal opinion saying digital currencies fit under California\'s statute, that Bitcoin has some monetary value and as a result, anyone transferring bitcoin would be subject to licensing requirements.\n\nDespite being home to Silicon Valley, a hotbed for digital currency and other fintech startups, California has been fairly quiet on how to regulate them. By contrast, New York\'s Department of Financial Services has worked for months to produce the Bitlicense, which aims to regulate Bitcoin businesses without stifling innovation. The final version of departing Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky\'s regulation is expected at the end of the month.\n\nThe California agency\'s original statement read:\n\nThe California Department of Business Oversight has decided to not subject virtual currency businesses to licensure and regulation under either the state\'s existing Money Transmission Act, or banking or trust company laws. The DBO will work with the Legislature to craft a virtual currency regulatory structure that has as its first priority consumer protection.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether bitcoin and the virtual currency industry will fulfill the growth prospects forecast by backers. We believe prudence dictates we take a deliberate approach and let the market further develop. That will better ensure any regulatory regime California ultimately adopts works effectively for consumers, businesses and the market.\n\nThe department would not discuss the matter further.\n\nEven before the statement was retracted, legal experts cautioned not to read too much into it, saying the department hadn\'t really shown its hand yet.\n\n""All that\'s happening is they\'re going to wait before they start regulating digital currency businesses,"" said Marco Santori, legal counsel at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. ""The upshot is that they won\'t be regulating digital currency businesses under existing money transmission law, they\'ll wait for the [virtual currency] amendment to come through"" in the legislature.\n\nVan Cleef said the process could take months.\n\n""What this means is that companies in this space should be able to operate within the state without concern about operating in violation of state law,"" she said. ""This does not mean they don\'t have to be registered as a money services business [with the Treasury\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network] or that licenses will not be required by other states to offer services to residents in other states.""', 'The first fund to offer bitcoin investment as part of a bespoke portfolio has launched on global derivatives trading platform IG, the UK\'s largest forex provider.\n\nLaunched in late 2014, funding platform Invest Your Way (IYW) will enable traders to invest in bitcoin via contract for differences (CFDs), a form of futures contract where trades are settled in cash as opposed to physical goods.\n\nIn this case, the CFD will mimic bitcoin – the underlying asset – providing returns based on the digital currency\'s price.\n\nIYW CEO Michael Newell told CoinDesk:\n\n""We actively work with clients to expand this range and the most highly requested product since launch has been bitcoin.

This includes, most importantly, the millennial generation\'s desire for alternative financial products.\n\nThe director went on to forecast a future in which a new generation of startups will chip away at traditional financial revenue streams slowly, but surely.\n\nRobinson stated that he sees Silicon Valley taking the lead on this transition:\n\n""You can teach engineers finance, but you can\'t teach the finance industry technology.""\n\nThe role bitcoin and blockchain technologies will play in this larger narrative featured in five of the day\'s 24 presentations.\n\nPerhaps most notable of these was the surprise announcement by Romanian payment processor Netopia mobilPay that it intends to launch a sister bitcoin exchange, BTKO.in.\n\nNetopia is well established as an online payment processor, serving more than 6,000 retailers and processing more than 800,000 transactions in Q1 2014.\n\nElsewhere, authentication, security, analytics, the cloud and big data were technologies up for discussion. Bluink Ltd took the top prize in the FinTech category for Injector, an app that uses bluetooth and speech to replace passwords.\n\nWhile no bitcoin-first startups prevailed, Retail category winner Pinn nodded to the digital currency\'s future in the mainstream retail experience.\n\n""You can either link your bank account using your online banking credentials or you can use your bitcoin wallet,"" CEO Will Summerlin told CoinDesk, adding that he expects bitcoin usage to rise in the coming years.\n\nElsewhere, startups seeking to build the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem held their own onstage with compelling ideas that illustrated why they were selected from over 800 applicants.\n\nBTKO.in\n\n""We are not a startup. We are the biggest payment gateway in Romania.""\n\nWith these bold words, Netopia mobilPay CEO Antonio Eram introduced BTKO.io, a Romania-based bitcoin exchange platform that was the only startup to present not listed on the official schedule.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Eram clarified that BTKO.in is a spin-off from Netopia that will be supported by its sister company through shared development and management resources – a relationship not always clear in the presentation.\n\n""We keep it separately since we have investors interested exclusively in this project,"" Eram explained.\n\nThough unexpected, the announcement follows Netopia\'s decision to integrate bitcoin payments in December. Netopia previously entered into a partnership with defunct bitcoin exchange BTCXchange, which went offline in late 2014 following security issues.\n\nBTKO.in is not yet online, but Eram told CoinDesk he has big plans for the project, adding:\n\n""We want to build an entire bitcoin ecosystem in eastern Europe.""\n\n37coins\n\nThe first bitcoin startup of the day was beta-only SMS bitcoin wallet provider 37coins.\n\nCOO Jonathan Zobro explained how the startup aims to use low-cost cell phone technology to make mobile money international and carrier-independent for consumers in the developing world.\n\n""Onboarding is as simple as knowing your friend\'s phone number,"" he explained.\n\nZobro went on to state that he sees 37coins as a company focused on onboarding the 2.5 billion underbanked consumers worldwide.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Zobro said the startup will now focus on adding multisig and HD wallet security to its platform.\n\n""We have to make the best security compromises ... we\'ve made the conscious decision to split up the keys and make the most secure version that we can,"" he added.\n\nGazebo\n\nFormerly known as Pavilion when it launched at the fall 2014 DEMO conference, blockchain startup Gazebo is now setting its sights on the global trade finance market.\n\n""Exports and importers have been moving away from debt and paper. Bank revenues in trade finance have been declining for the first time in a while,"" founder and CEO Jamie Young said, rifling through facts and figures on inadequacies in this market.\n\nGazebo is seeking to use the blockchain\'s open ledger system to create products for treasury and trade solutions (TTS) and global transaction services (GTS) specialists who need to transport and manage supply chains of physical goods\n\nUsing the blockchain and escrow services, Gazebo aims to manage the movement of fiat dollars on behalf of clients, validating shipments and releasing funds to the relevant parties.\n\nThe demonstration represented an evolution of the product from its November iteration, which focused on offering escrow services to larger e-commerce companies such as eBay, Amazon and Alibaba.\n\nBitWage\n\nYet another startup focused on how bitcoin and the blockchain could permeate international money transfer was payroll startup BitWage.\n\nLaunched in late 2014, BitWage offers employees the ability to be paid in bitcoin without the need for employers to integrate the service.\n\nOften billed as a solution for diehard bitcoin users, BitWage COO Jonathan Chester\'s presentation demonstrated that he\'s willing to think big about how the startup could solve real problems for those outside the current community.\n\n""Uber is paying contractors in 58 countries worldwide. They build banking relationships in all those countries and deal with those regulations. The cost is high and the time to market is slow,"" he said.\n\nEmployees and contractors, Chester continued, have to deal with high foreign exchange costs and large transfer times, creating more pain and friction in this system.\n\nStill, Chester was able to go beyond identifying problems, showcasing that BitWage has a specific blueprint for how its solution can fit into this larger puzzle.\n\nThe next stage for BitWage, his presentation inferred, will be seeking out large multinational companies that could cut costs by offering the technology.\n\nChangeTip\n\nOne of the more tenured startups in the program, having raised $3.5m in venture capital, ChangeTip CEO Nick Sullivan gave an entertaining if uninspired overview of how the company enables micropayments, what he called the ""first real interesting use case for bitcoin"".\n\n""We call it a \'love button\' for the Internet,"" he said. ""There\'s a fairly established \'like\' economy. We call this a love button because this is for content that you love.""\n\nThe CEO went on to showcase how ChangeTip users can use its platform to send small amounts of money over popular social networks and content platforms.\n\n""What if you could have donated 10 cents by favoriting or liking posts for the Ice Bucket Challenge?"" he asked.\n\nHe also charted a course for how micropayments could evolve beyond their current niche audience to become more widespread, even if it was perhaps unclear to the audience the role ChangeTip could play in this transition.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Jonathan Chester was CEO of BitWage. He is acting COO at the bitcoin payroll startup.\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The launch of Streamium was announced via Reddit yesterday.\n\nThe new application from Manuel Aráoz and company was created to build a direct connection between video streamers and their viewers. Video streaming is dealt with on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis via WebRTC, and payments for viewing a stream are made possible through the use of bitcoin and payment channels.\n\nA stream of small, off-chain payments are made to the broadcaster every second as the viewer continues to watch a stream, and all of those micropayments are then combined into one larger payment that is made via the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe P2P nature of the Streamium platform has the potential to disrupt many different types of video streaming businesses currently found on the Internet due to the fact that it is now much easier to broadcast directly to an audience rather than going through a middleman.\n\nStill, there is still plenty of work to be done when it comes to scaling the software up to handle larger audiences. For now, a broadcaster is limited by his or her own available bandwidth. In any case, here are five types of people who could benefit from trying out Streamium for the first time.\n\nCam Girls\n\nThe most obvious area where Streamium can be helpful is in the adult entertainment industry, especially when it comes to live cam shows. The adult industry has faced financial censorship from both PayPal and the legacy banking system, which is why many adult entertainment sites have turned to the blockchain for payments.\n\nLive cam sites can sometimes take a large percentage of a performer’s profits, which is why the direct payment from the audience to the entertainer on Streamium could be rather helpful. Of course, it would also make sense if the viewers were able to also tip performers for certain requests.\n\nLive Sports Pirates\n\nBitcoin isn’t necessarily entirely about illegal activity, but those sorts of profit opportunities seem to be where new technologies take off first. Most sports fans are familiar with free online streams that are usually hosted by shady individuals at a rather low resolution.\n\nViewers are usually bombarded with advertisements when viewing these unlicensed streams, and it also feels like viruses and malware are right around the corner on these kinds of sites. Due to the P2P nature of Streamium, new streaming sports pirates may decide to offer a premium version of sporting events in higher quality without all of the downsides currently found in the black market industry.\n\nDoctors, Lawyers, and Other On-Demand Professionals\n\nA variety of “professional-on-demand” services have popped up over the past few years. These are the kinds of websites or apps where you’re able to talk to a doctor (Doctor on Demand), lawyer (LAWfone) or some other professional for a flat fee.\n\nAlthough these services were a move in the right direction when it comes to cutting costs, they aren’t completely necessary in a world of Streamium and social media. Closely associated with this sort of 1-on-1 streaming activity is also the ability to be a freelance consultant on basically any topic without a middleman. Of course, it should be remembered middlemen still have value in these sorts of freelance operations for marketing purposes.\n\nProfessional Gamers and Gaming Personalities\n\nThe magnitude of online video game streaming may not have become apparent to the general public until Twitch was bought by Amazon for nearly $1 billion, but the large number of young people turning to the video game streaming platform for full-time employment is now becoming hard to ignore. Professional gamers and gaming personalities could use Streamium in a few different ways to improve their overall profits.\n\nAlthough completely replacing Twitch may not be in the cards, streamers could turn to Streamium as a vehicle for pay-per-view events. Whether it is two famous CS:GO teams playing a friendly game or a training session with one of the best StarCraft players in the world, there are a variety of ways in which pro gamers can use Streamium to their advantage.\n\nTeachers\n\nPrivate teachers already exist, but what if those teachers were also able to livestream their lectures to outsiders at a fixed rate?\n\n“Teacher” is also used as a rather broad term here as it could be anyone who is able to explain a specific topic to someone else. For example, well-known bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos could start a class that can be viewed by anyone via Streamium. Perhaps there would also be a small fee for asking a question at the end of a lecture or presentation.\n\nStreamium could allow new students to attend a class without doing anything else besides showing up and opening a payment channel (assuming that they already have some bitcoin.) Perhaps the platform would also be useful for 1-on-1 tutoring sessions between students.\n\nLong Story Short\n\nIn reality, no one really knows how people are going to end up using this new platform. Like many other innovative applications, it is up to the users to figure out how to best use this new tool. Perhaps we’ll see bitcoin conferences or video podcasts on Streamium in the future, but the team behind this new project will need to figure out how to scale the technology – perhaps through webtorrent – before there are any mass events streamed with it.', 'Conversation about bitcoin and the blockchain was seemingly everywhere this week, though a closer look at the bylines reveals this was mostly the work of one journalist – New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper.\n\nCoinDesk, Fast Company, Forbes, TechCrunch and Vice were just some of the publications this week that either ran interviews with Popper or exclusive excerpts of his new book, Digital Gold, the product of six months of research on the technology.\n\nPopper\'s excerpts generated headlines and social media buzz for their revelations regarding industry activity, with portions devoted to reexamining some of the community\'s most mainstream stories and subjects.\n\nHowever, the New York Times wasn\'t the only media outlet focusing on bitcoin this week, with Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal devoting their share of articles to the emerging technology.\n\nNathaniel Popper\'s bitcoin tour\n\nLeading the charge was perhaps Popper\'s most provocative story, his account of his personal search for Satoshi Nakamoto, the still-anonymous author of the bitcoin white paper and its assumed creator. The trial, as we explored last week, led him to cryptographer Nick Szabo.\n\nThe report was widely covered into last weekend, though most articles aimed for clicks in ways that suggested the author had broken new ground on the Nakamoto mystery. More sensational headlines included ""Did the New York Times Find Satoshi?"" and ""The New York Times Thinks It\'s Identified Mysterious Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto"", though these were only a few of many.\n\nJust as interesting, however, were new revelations provided in detailed narratives on the untimely demise of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox that added new perspective to the situation surrounding its February 2014 insolvency.\n\nNew information was also provided on 21 Inc, the startup that until last week\'s CoinDesk report was bitcoin\'s best-kept secret. In his account, Popper explained how 21\'s mining operations effectively allowed Silicon Valley\'s elite ""to invest without needing to come out as public supporters of bitcoin"". Popper shed further light on the company\'s funding rounds, indicating it has paid back most of its original investors.\n\nAdditional reports illustrated Wells Fargo\'s early interest in bitcoin as well as the early days of BitInstant, one of the first major venture backed companies in the bitcoin space.\n\nBloomberg\'s deep dive\n\nBoasting contributions from bitcoin industry luminaries such as Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert and Coin Center director Jerry Brito was a Bloomberg special report on bitcoin, a deep dive into topics such as global regulation, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and the viability of bitcoin\'s mining sector.\n\nBitGo CEO Mike Belshe, Boston University professor Mark T Williams and Wedbush Securities managing director Gil Luria were among the industry participants featured in Q&A segments of the report.\n\nAmong the most interesting observations, though, were the report\'s attempts to tie bitcoin to the rise of mobile banking. Cited therein were figures that suggest 23% of merchant acquirers and independent sales organisations surveyed have plans to ""start accepting bitcoin within the next two years"", a development Bloomberg suggested would spur wider merchant adoption.\n\nThe conclusion notably clashes with findings from CoinDesk\'s Q1 State of Bitcoin report, which found that merchant adoption growth is on the decline.\n\nElsewhere, Bloomberg tried to connect bitcoin swaps trading with its price volatility and took aim at itBit\'s assertion that its New York banking charter would allow it to serve customers in all 50 US states, claims it continues to evoke in the media.\n\nPaul Hastings LLP partner Chris Daniel told the report:\n\n“While itBit may have engaged in this exercise already, it will require a state-by-state approach to determine whether other states agree that a trust company is the right regulated structure to engage in commercial cryptocurrency exchange activity in their state.""\n\nSponsored by SolidX and Xapo and featuring ads from Blockchain, Nadex and the Bitcoin Investment Trust, the report was just as much a showcase of the range of bitcoin companies seeking to reach Bloomberg\'s influential audience.\n\nWSJ\'s bitcoin pizza party\n\nThis week also brought signs that bitcoin continues to hold a place in the larger pop culture consciousness in the US.\n\nSeveral notable news outlets (including CoinDesk) issued tributes to bitcoin\'s homegrown holiday, Bitcoin Pizza Day. Held on 22nd May, the celebration commemorates the first purchase of a physical good with bitcoin by developer Laszlo Hanyecz.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, The Wall Street Journal was the most vocal on the subject, running two separate (albeit somewhat overlapping) reports on Bitcoin Pizza Day both in its BitBeat column and in a separate video.\n\nStill, WSJ reporter Paul Vigna used the lighthearted event as a way to express the larger narratives around bitcoin.\n\nIn the video, this was highlighted through explanations of how the event helped prove the digital currency could be used in finance, while in print he noted that influential representatives from Wall Street are now taking bitcoin seriously, silly holidays and all.\n\nVigna wrote:\n\n""The growing opinion on Wall Street — and this is just what we’re gleaning from the people we talk to — is that this technology is not simply an online scam, even if it’s not exactly the epoch-shaking disruptive force its most fervent adherents want it to be. Its future will somewhere between those two extremes.""\n\nNathaniel Popper is scheduled to appear at Consensus 2015, CoinDesk\'s flagship conference to be held 10th September.\n\nNewspaper image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

My recent post - The Bitcoin Blockchain Just Might Save The Music Industry...If Only We Could Understand It – discussed how Bitcoin could potentially prove to be an effective tool for tracking the rights and transactions surrounding musical intellectual property. However, in my quixotic rush towards some form of musical utopia in which every transaction can be tracked and the appropriate rights holders compensated, I lost track of the very thing that nearly always frustrates this type of progress.\n\nFortunately for me, an astute reader pointed out this omission via Twitter:\n\nI’ve spoken to the author of this tweet, Aston Motes - the first hire at Dropbox and now an advisor to many music related startups and entrepreneur in the music space - a few times over the years, and was unsurprised, given his experience and background, that he made such a spot-on comment.\n\nHis comment tracks directly with something I’ve talked and written about over the years. Bluntly: the parties who benefit most from the lack of transparency are the ones who will resist anything that ends the lack transparency.\n\nOf course, the parties who benefit the most from lack of transparency in the music industry are the labels, publishers, and streaming services. The record industry was built upon a firmament of information asymmetry – that is, the labels/publishers have more knowledge than those signing the contracts. Given this, they are able to exploit this information imbalance to their benefit. At the extreme end, this meant blatantly lying to artists who were under-educated, under-represented, under-experienced (or all of the above) to strip them - often, forever - of their rights. At a slightly more benign level, these labels and others create agreements and “reporting” so byzantine in nature that only the most experienced (and expensive) lawyers can parse them, which forces many artists who don’t have the resources for such representation to accept the deals/reports prima facie.\n\nYesterday I Skyped with Mr. Motes, and he elaborated on his tweet, “Even indie labels – it’s not clear that they’d be willing to disclose who makes what, and what people sell. The whole industry is driven on smoke and mirrors.”\n\nHe continued down a path that I’ve been harping on for what seems like forever: the idea that these services could provide more than just economic value – but he tied this to Crypto Currency.""]"
05/23/2015,"[""Bitcoin: it’s at a crucially important crossroads; it’s approaching a crisis that threatens its very existence; it has never been more likely to erupt into enormous global importance. Which? Don’t be ridiculous. It is all those things at once, of course, as usual. I only wish I was joking.\n\nIf you’re dumb enough to judge Bitcoin purely by its exchange rate, you might be fooled into thinking it has entered a period of remarkable stability, hovering around US$225 through all of 2015. But actually quite a lot has happened in the last few months. Let’s itemize a few of those things:\n\nA controversial change to the Bitcoin protocol is under discussion, and some in the field are prophesying utter disaster in the not-too-distant future if it does not happen.\n\nI mean the mooted increase in Bitcoin’s block size. A brief recap: Bitcoin is built upon a decentralized data structure known as the blockchain. A “block” is a group of hundreds of verified transactions; each block points to its predecessor, hence “blockchain.” At present, the block size is capped at 1 megabyte, which effectively limits Bitcoin to (roughly) 7 transactions per second, worldwide. If the network hits its maximum rate, it is argued that the cryptocurrency equivalent of a nuclear meltdown could well ensue.\n\nAnd yet, increasing the blocksize is a contentious issue in the Bitcoin community — because many of the “miners,” the entities who verify Bitcoin transactions (and are paid in Bitcoin for doing so) may well suffer from this change. This in turn has raised the larger issue of Bitcoin governance, and/or the lack thereof. See this post in Michael Casey’s excellent Wall Street Journal cryptocurrency column BitBeat for further details.\n\nPreviously mysterious (and extremely well-funded) Bitcoin startup 21 unveiled its plans for world domination.\n\nI expected Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan to do something audacious with his $116 million startup, and I wasn’t disappointed. His objective: to put “a bitcoin miner in every hand.” 21 is developing custom Bitcoin mining chips, with the expectation that they’ll be included in next-generation devices from servers to phones. “We believe that embedded mining will ultimately establish bitcoin as a fundamental system resource on par with CPU, bandwidth, hard drive space, and RAM,” he writes. That’s nothing if not audacious. Hats off.\n\n…But this audacity has been met with a considerable amount of skepticism:\n\nThe economics of 21 chip adoption. The diseconomy of scale & centralization seem huge issues. https://t.co/SoUEcRWd7Y — Startup L. Jackson (@StartupLJackson) May 19, 2015\n\nand not without reason. Bitcoin mining is power-intensive, which makes it a dubious feature for mobile devices. Srinivasan writes: “Embedded mining means that any device can authenticate itself to the network by sending one Satoshi to a specified address,” but a quirk of the standard Bitcoin protocol implementation means that, at least at the moment, such transactions will probably not be processed. And it’s worth noting that this model is apparently a pivot from 21.co’s original business model, after “the company ended up running up against the difficulty of making money in the cut-throat business of Bitcoin mining.”\n\nStill, there’s a lot to celebrate here. Bitcoin believers talk excitedly, if vaguely, about the limitless, because ill-defined, possibilities of “machine-to-machine micro-transactions.” (I’m not being dismissive: I’m vaguely excited about those possibilities too.) But until 21’s announcement it was always unclear how we actually got to a world in which millions of devices actually had Bitcoin at their disposal for … whatever they might transact.\n\n(You might be thinking: couldn’t you just mine at a central hub with cheap electricity, and distribute cryptocurrency to your devices using software wallets instead of hardware mining chips? Well, yes. But mining is a far more resilient and decentralized means of distributing a regular trickle of currency to an arbitrary number of devices — especially if you could construct autonomous mining pools that don’t require any central hub.)\n\nSomeone finally launched the first Bitcoin app with universal appeal.\n\nFor years people have been waiting for a Bitcoin app whose use is apparent even to nonbelievers. One has finally arisen, and, of course, it is absurdly simple — that sound you hear is that of a thousand Bitcoin developers smacking themselves on the forehead while chanting “Why didn’t I think of that?”\n\nIn the wake of Meerkat and Periscope, I give you Streamium: “Stream Live Video And Get Paid.” Just provide the address of any Bitcoin wallet, and voila, you can charge anyone in the world to watch, without having to deal with PayPal or a bank or credit-card verification or, well, any middlemen at all.\n\nWill most people ever do this? Of course not. But most people will understand the appeal of this, and be able to envision a hypothetical situation where it might be handy, eg remote tutoring, or suddenly finding oneself on-scene at a major breaking news event. No esoteric technical knowledge required.\n\n(It’s probably not a coincidence that Streamium comes from Argentina, the nation where Bitcoin has enjoyed the closest thing to mainstream acceptance it’s seen anywhere so far.)\n\nWall Street is dipping its toes into Bitcoin’s waters.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange has launched a Bitcoin Index. The NASDAQ has announced plans to “leverage blockchain technology.” Goldman Sachs joined a $50 million funding round for Bitcoin startup Circle. Votes of confidence, all. But at the same time…\n\nBitcoin mining remains Bitcoin’s chief anchor and primary headache.\n\nI am no cryptocurrency Pollyanna. Bitcoin faces an uncertain future, and several potential disasters; and what these have in common is Bitcoin mining.\n\n@rezendi Nor I. For bitcoin fans, the whole point is not to have to rely on incentives. Otherwise it's just a lesser known CitiBank. — Jonathan Zittrain (@zittrain) May 20, 2015\n\nMining is quite surreal, if you think about it. To some extent, like Wikipedia, “it doesn’t work in theory, it only works in practice.” Scattered datacenters around the world are packed full of racks of custom-built chips, working furiously to perform quadrillions of Hashcash calculations every second, to maintain the Bitcoin network — in exchange for regular payouts of newly minted cryptocurrency.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin is continuing to navigate between the Scylla of overly centralized mining and the Charybdis of miners blocking important protocol evolution. This makes mining sound like Bitcoin’s Achilles heel, but (pardon the now extremely mixed classical metaphor) it’s actually Bitcoin’s Achilles; its hero with a fatal flaw. Mining is Bitcoin’s fundamental engine. It what makes the network so computationally powerful. Mining incentives are what caused the Bitcoin network to grow from a deeply weird software experiment running on a single computer to a massive global network of cryptocurrency whose values is measured billions of dollars.\n\n(Also — and this is what interests me most about Bitcoin and its ilk — a network that serves as an example of a powerful and viable fully decentralized system; a notion which is by no means limited to electronic money, but which, alas, has few other successes to cite to date.)\n\nSatoshi's Law: All centralized systems eventually become corrupted and are replaced with decentralized systems. e.g.: http://t.co/aU63w1Da01 — Ryan X. Charles (@ryanxcharles) May 21, 2015\n\nBut, at the same time, “Mining does keep me up at night,” admitted Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell at a conference I attended last year. To some degree, at least, he and his fellow core developers are trying to keep innovating to treat Bitcoin’s growing pains, but Bitcoin miners have become anchors holding them back. Let’s hope they don’t drag down the whole network. Interesting times indeed."", 'Banking Is Necessary, Banks Are Not\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending is positioned to reach US$77 billion this year, a 15-fold increase from 2012. It\'s the fastest-growing asset in finance, claims Bloomberg. Many institutions are heavily investing, but some analysts wonder whether the growth is natural, or a bubble about to pop.\n\nMany P2P lenders are selling interest from their loans using a method called securitization, which involves raising capital by selling loan interest to investors in order to get the loans off their spreadsheets. This may be a tell-tale sign of a pump, which — along with the sale of securities — makes some speculate about red flags being raised with P2P lending practices.\n\nPeer-to-peer lending, the practice of lending to peers without going through traditional financial institutions — making banks less necessary — allows anyone online to borrow cash if they have a verified account. There are three problems peer-to-peer lending tries to solve in the investment world. First, investors want indifferent involvement, putting less time and hands-on activity into loans. Second, small investors do not have large sums to commit to loans. Finally, investors want to fund their projects through ready access to less restrictive lending sources.\n\nA Club for Lenders\n\nU.S.-based Lending Club is the largest peer lender in history. The company started on Facebook for one of its first applications. The business received US$10 million from investors in its first year and then developed into a full scale P2P lender. Co-founder Soul Htite later moved to China to start Dianrong.com, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai. Both companies catapulted into P2P lending giants.\n\n""It\'s a tough world out there. The common theme among our clients is that they want to generate yield."" — Lending Club CEO Renaud Laplanche\n\nThe decisive component for Lending Club’s prosperity and that of the entire peer-to-peer industry is the character of the loans. Sure, the loans have a US$77 billion profit margin, but that figure doesn’t factor in unseen defaults. The mortgage market pre-2008 showed early signs of loans that would never be paid, with the banking system making predatory loans to people who lacked the income to pay them.\n\nLending Club believes it can avoid this problem by requiring borrowers to have a high credit score. They presently require borrowers to have a score over 660. The problem with credit scores, however, is that they are based on past consumer behavior rather than cash flow. Lending Club is still showing signs that it is strong. They began partnering with smaller banks in order to streamline small-loan operations, which were showing signs of weakness, even while the company\'s growth had increased by 118% since its launch in 2013.\n\nPeer-to-Peer lenders are now leaning more heavily on the securities game. In February, BlackRock disclosed the first investment-grade-rated package of P2P consumer loans worth US$$281 million. Moody\'s Investors Service announced that it granted a portion totalling US$281 million — including Class A notes — with an investment-grade rating of Baa3.\n\n“Loans take time to season and go bad, and Wall Street loves to package and pass along risk. The music will stop — it always does — and this will not end well.” — Tania Modic, Western Investments Capital\n\nOnline Loans Made Easy\n\nThe digital currency ecosystem is familiar with P2P lending. Quite a few Bitcoin businesses offer the service. BTCJam is an online investing and personal loan service. They offer personal Bitcoin loans at an APR of 6.7% to those with a good credit rating. The company claims investors have lent out over 48,000 bitcoins since the company’s inception.\n\nBitBond, a German P2P lender, offers loan services to small businesses that are unable to get credit approval. Via peer-to-peer lending, borrowers and lenders meet directly, cutting costs. Its services include the ability to borrow bitcoins at 7% APR and to earn interest by lending. The company\'s website states, “We\'ve originated over 600 loans with borrowers and lenders from over 120 countries.” So far, the company has secured €600,000 from angel investors.\n\nBitLendingClub is another Bitcoin lender, which allows you to be verified through Facebook, or Coinbase. It offers low-interest rates on its loans (8%) and express funding. The international platform is partnered with Genesis Mining, CoinOutlet, BitXatm and BTCPoint. Their loan volume was 4,396 BTC in November of 2014. Their volume of listings is low, however, compared to BTCJam. BitBond, on the other hand, carries a substantial amount of lending opportunities. All platforms show a small quantity of loans, as the market demand is not yet there.\n\nWill the Bubble Burst?\n\n""The high interest rates [of return that P2P loans] offer are a red flag. If you\'re getting something that seems too good to be true, it probably is."" — Lowell Lombardini-Parker, Merriman LLC\n\nEconomic bubbles burst in 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its pre-recession, all-time high on October 9, 2007, closing at 14,164.43 points. Less than 18 months later, it had fallen more than 50% to 6,594.44 on March 5, 2009. Economists believe the crash was due to predatory lending practices in the housing market. Roughly seven years later, we are seeing signs of another bubble in the P2P finance sector.\n\nOnline lending has changed the criteria of loans, versus those made in the past. Since the crash of 2008, it has been increasingly harder to secure loans from financial institutions. Banks are in the business to lend, but today they are floundering beneath their P2P counterparts. Investors are betting that the speed and efficiency of the Internet will change the game for good. Most P2P lenders deny subprime applicants. Zopa, a 10-year-old British firm that has issued more than £800 million to its customers, claiming they approve only one out of five applicants.\n\nWith P2P lending’s sizable growth in the industry, many are scrutinizing the phenomenon and some see the early signs of a bubble. They say the asset class may be too good to be true. Peer-to-peer lenders are still young, and many investors are wary of the projections for loan defaults.', 'When the banking system went into meltdown in 2008, an intriguing glimpse of an alternative future appeared. On 31 October, an unknown cryptographer who went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto launched what he described as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer to peer, with no trusted third party”. The name he assigned to this new currency was bitcoin.\n\nSince then, the world has been divided into three camps: those who think that bitcoin must be a scam; those who think it’s one of the most interesting technological developments in decades; and (the vast majority) those who have no idea what the fuss is about.\n\nI belong in the second camp, but I can see why others see it differently. Those of the scam persuasion, for example, see the absence of any central authority, the wild fluctuations in the value of bitcoins (they were worth more than $1,000 in November 2013, around $235 at the moment), the mysterious collapse of one of the big bitcoin exchanges, the hacking of some of the digital “wallets” in which people keep their bitcoins and so on. And if the sceptics had any doubts, the news that Rand Paul, the libertarian US politician now running for president, is willing to take campaign contributions in bitcoins tends to confirm their suspicions that it’s just a fantasy.\n\nBut I can also see why laypeople are baffled by bitcoin because the thing that makes it work – the “blockchain” – is based on the kind of arcane cryptography that, like the peace of God in the Bible, passeth all understanding. As such, it looks like a species of black magic and something that is therefore best avoided.\n\nAll of which is understandable but unfortunate, because the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin may turn out to be both transformational and benign in ways that we are just beginning to appreciate.\n\nWhy? Well, in essence a blockchain is really a way of using cryptography to certify that a particular token is the property of, or is inextricably connected to, a particular entity. In this particular case, the token is a bitcoin (or part thereof) and the entity is an individual (or an organisation). The blockchain is a dynamic (ie continuously updated) database of who owns (or is connected with) what.\n\nIn the real, physical world, we have lots of such databases – think of bank accounts or land registries – but they are records maintained by agencies and organisations, which means that they can be altered, corrupted or lost. So we have to trust the institutions that maintain them, which means trusting outfits like the banks that have just been fined £3.7bn for rigging foreign exchange markets. A blockchain, in contrast, is a public database that is continually maintained and updated by software running on thousands of computers all over the world. And since every change of ownership is publicly logged, the need to trust a (centralised) institution is replaced by the need to trust a highly decentralised network.\n\nIn the beginning, the blockchain was used to enable transactions in bitcoins and to ensure that a coin could not be spent and re-spent by its original owner. But as awareness of the currency spread, people have realised that the blockchain idea could be applied in other areas where trustworthy and transparent records of ownership are lacking. The most interesting case I’ve seen so far surfaced the other day when the state of Honduras, one of the poorest countries in Latin America, announced that it was going to use a blockchain to build a permanent and secure land title registry. This is significant because one of the problems that bedevil many – if not most – developing countries is the absence of reliable or uncorrupt land registries.\n\nAnother intriguing example is provided by ascribe, a startup that enables artists to register a legal claim to the copyright on digital works they have created. The company time-stamps those claims on to the bitcoin blockchain. When artists transfer, their rights (eg by selling the work) the blockchain confirms that they are transferring the copyright (in the form of a licence) to the new owner.\n\nAt the moment, it’s difficult to say what the future of bitcoin will be. These new applications of the blockchain idea suggest that, in the long view of history, the project’s main contribution to society may not be currency reform but as a powerful enabler of other vital economic, legal and social processes. In the meantime, I’m saving up to buy my first bitcoin.', 'Josh Blatchford is CMO of London-based bitcoin startup BTC.sx.\n\nLast week in the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party was re-elected into power. This article explores what their plans to regulate bitcoin might look like and whether they are capable of creating a bitcoin hub in the UK.\n\nThe last government unveiled its stance on bitcoin back in April. Along with a call for information, it stated: ""The government intends to apply anti-money laundering regulation to digital currency exchanges in the UK, to support innovation and prevent criminal use. The government will formally consult on the proposed regulatory approach early in the next parliament.""\n\nEntrepreneurs need not run for the hills – or silicon valleys. Although \'regulation\' is not always the most friendly of words, the government does appear to have a light-touch approach thus far.\n\nFurthermore, the Bank of England (BoE) has taken a cautiously optimistic viewpoint on digital currencies. In February, its One Bank Research Agenda came to the following conclusion:\n\n""While existing private digital currencies have economic flaws which make them volatile, the distributed ledger technology that their payment systems rely on may have considerable promise""\n\nThe BoE also outlined the potential to create its own government-issued currency based on bitcoin technology.\n\nThe BoE is supposed to support the economic policies of whatever party gains power. However, the BoE and the Conservative Party share the same optimism for bitcoin.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the BoE\'s report, tweeting:\n\nGood that @bankofengland looking into digital currencies – need to ensure UK customers benefit from new tech and #Fintech firms flourish — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) February 25, 2015\n\nAll in all, the government has set high expectations that incoming regulation should be favourable.\n\nPredicting bitcoin regulation\n\nWith the new Parliament formed this week, we can expect a formal consultation, originally promised by the government, sometime this summer. Until then, we are left to guess what bitcoin regulation will look like.\n\nGiven the past comments the government has made and the responses given in the call for information, we can confidently expect the following:\n\nRegulation will initially apply to exchanges, which trade fiat and digital currencies.\n\nKnow-your-customer requirements will be necessary to make bitcoin less anonymous.\n\nExisting anti-money laundering frameworks are likely to be used.\n\nLaw enforcement will have the ability to confiscate bitcoin used for criminal purposes.\n\nA regulatory \'sandbox\' will be formed by HM Treasury for FinTech startups to experiment with.\n\nThe government aims to develop \'pioneering voluntary standards for consumer protection\'.\n\nSupporting bitcoin innovation\n\nA major promise from the government is the creation of standards for consumer protection. To date, consumers buying products and services have forgone their rights usually covered by the Consumer Rights Act.\n\nA set of similar standards for bitcoin would be the first of its kind. Admittedly, this is unlikely to make a significant difference in consumer adoption of bitcoin. But it may encourage existing bitcoin users to choose to do business with UK-based startups over others abroad. This would give Tech City another competitive advantage over Silicon Valley.\n\nThis is a view shared by Marco Santori, global policy counsel at Blockchain and a leading expert on bitcoin law:\n\n""Blockchain has great hope for the UK as a digital currency-friendly jurisdiction. We see the UK authorities learning from mistakes and successes from across the pond. In particular, the clarity and research evident in the Treasury\'s recent publication on digital currencies demonstrates its true desire to get the details right, and to learn along with the industry in the process.""\n\nThe regulatory sandbox should also be positive for bitcoin startups in the UK. The biggest regulatory concern among most bitcoin startups is that banks can wield greater influence in shaping specific policies. However, the sandbox will play an important role in ensuring these policies are not too draconian.\n\nIt will only be the FinTech startups interacting with customers in bitcoin that can truly test these policies. Ultimately, if implemented well, a sandbox should filter out impractical policies for startups.\n\nThe last and most important opportunity for the UK FinTech industry can be for the government to \'one-up\' US regulators. New York\'s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and its superintendent Benjamin Lawsky have proposed a \'BitLicense\'.\n\nThis BitLicense has been heavily criticised for being prohibitive. For example, the following information is required for every bitcoin transaction: ""The identity and physical addresses of the parties involved, the amount or value of the transaction, including in what denomination purchased, sold, or transferred, the method of payment, the date(s) on which the transaction was initiated and completed, and a description of the transaction.""\n\nAdam Draper, CEO of Boost VC, heavily criticised the proposals, stating: ""The rules don’t include a significantly flexible on-ramp for small startups to build and innovate their products, killing potentially disruptive technology before it can even start.""\n\nAdam also estimated that the cost of compliance for a startup is $2m.\n\nThe final draft of the BitLicense is set to be published later this month. If the UK government truly wishes to ""create a world-leading environment"", it would make sense for it to monitor the reception the BitLicense receives. They might even go as far as deliberately under-cutting the NYDFS\' requirements to attract more bitcoin startups to the UK.\n\nTom Robinson, Elliptic COO, has a slightly different perspective. He believes the cost of doing business is not the only regulatory issue to consider:\n\n""I believe that there is a real intent from the government to foster innovation in digital currency and blockchain technologies, but the critical question for our industry is what exactly does a world-leading environment looks like? Light touch regulation might make it easier and cheaper to run a digital currency business, but without the rubber stamp of full regulatory oversight it could remain challenging to gain the trust of banking partners and consumers.""\n\nOverall, while the government\'s proposals to date sound good, they do leave many unaddressed issues.\n\nThe unaddressed issues\n\nBank accounts are a nightmare for bitcoin users and startups in the UK. There are plenty of stories about personal accounts being closed down and business accounts being rejected for being associated with bitcoin. The main reason for this, banks often say, is \'reputational risk\'. Whether they have a reputation worth protecting is another debate. However, in their defence, at least part of the problem is a lack of regulation. Banks simply will not touch bitcoin for the time being.\n\nA bitcoin entrepreneur, who did not wish to be identified, describes the issue as critical:\n\n""Banks in the UK are unwilling to bank any company trading bitcoins but more importantly if you have the word \'bitcoin\' in your business plan you are effectively written off without any consideration. This has been a huge issue for bitcoin entrepreneurs in the UK and is stifling growth and investment in this market.""\n\nThese were all issues highlighted in the call for information. Despite this, the government has not made any response on this topic. There needs to be a push from the government to prevent banks applying a blanket ban on bitcoin. Instead, they must a have a system of verifying whether any fraud has occurred or will occur. It does not matter how favourable regulation is if banks make it impossible for bitcoin to gain traction.\n\nDespite its best efforts, the UK government\'s plans may be hindered by US regulation. UK banks, which conduct business internationally, must also comply, as much as possible, with international regulation. In particular, UK banks do not want to risk losing US banking licenses. As of right now, the bitcoin industry is still so small it is not worth the risk of losing their licenses to get involved.\n\nAll of this means UK banks might look towards the BitLicense requirements, instead of the UK regulation, to craft anti-money laundering procedures. Naturally, if they are compliant with stringent NYDFS regulations, they are very likely to comply with UK regulation. The BitLicense may also gain a first mover advantage – by being first, it may become the standard.\n\nThe government said it hopes to give law enforcement the ability to confiscate bitcoin. This is an unclear statement. One of the key differences between the bitcoin network and traditional payment networks is that, if you own the private keys to your wallet, no one has the ability to take bitcoin away from you.\n\nFor now it can be assumed that prosecuted criminals will be incentivised to give-up their bitcoin, as was the case with Charlie Shrem. This confiscation plan does raise concerns that the government might neglect the differences between bitcoin and traditional money.\n\nGreat potential\n\nFollowing the re-election of the Conservative Party, the UK is in a great position to potentially become a global bitcoin hub. This stems from a strong FinTech industry and promising regulation proposals from the government. However, bitcoin enthusiasts should not celebrate too early. The regulatory challenges of integrating bitcoin with traditional finance, in a global sense, may be a major pitfall.\n\nParliament image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Their distinct habits and preferences will be responsible for reshaping the global economy in the decades to come.\n\nMillennials are the largest generation in the U.S. and the fastest growing demographic in the world. Organizations and corporations worldwide are trying to figure out how to engage this generation whose brand relationships and patterns of consumption are distinctive from those of generations past. Young people think differently, consume differently and use traditional services differently. Companies who successfully unlock the keys to the habits of Millennials will reap major profits.\n\nThe banking space has felt the effects of this more than any other industry to date. It is pretty safe to say that millennials hate traditional banking. The Millennial Disruption Index is a three-year study based on extensive interviews with over 10,000 respondents who answered questions about which industries were most likely to be disrupted in the coming decades. Key findings include:\n\nMillennials believe banking is at the highest risk of disruption out of all the industries in the survey.\n\n53% think their banks offer nothing different from other banks.\n\n71% would prefer to go to a dentist than listen to what banks are saying.\n\n1 in 3 are open to switching banks in the next 90 days.\n\nFour leading banks — JP Morgan, Citibank, Bank of America and Wells Fargo — are among their least favorite brands.\n\nThey also have big ideas on the future of money and finance:\n\n68% believe accessing money will be different in five years.\n\n70% believe paying for things will be different in five years.\n\n33% believe banks aren’t needed at all.\n\n50% believe startups will change the way banks works.\n\n73% would be more excited about a new offering in financial services from Google, Apple, Amazon, Paypal and Square than a nationwide bank.\n\nIt’s no wonder that banks may feel threatened and that the executives at these banks believe they could be facing increasing profit-margin pressure and outright disintermediation, as highlighted in a recent Accenture report.\n\nDemographics and Characteristics\n\nGoldman Sachs put out a report on the demographics and characteristics of the Millennials titled “Millennials Coming of Age.” Millennials were born between the years 1980 and 2000 and are considered the largest generation in American history at 92 million. For comparison, Generation X has 61 million and the Baby Boomers have 77 million.\n\nGoldman recognizes five defining characteristics of this generation:\n\nThey are the first digital natives — the first generation that has grown up fully connected to smartphones and the Internet. They have use social media in a profound way and are completely “connected.” They have less money to spend.\n\nThey are encumbered in debt, mostly in the form of student loans.\n\nThey have different priorities. Owning a home and getting married are not very high, mainly due to lower incomes and increasing debt.\n\nAs a result, Millennials use technology differently, especially financial technology. People who carry huge debts and make and save less money can’t get traditional loans and don’t have the same access to capital markets as generations past. They have poor credit. All this shapes their buying decisions and how they look at the future, particularly in relation to home ownership, getting married and having children.\n\nCompanies like Lending Club have taken off because they provide peer-to-peer lending for those left out of the banking system. Peer to peer in finance is just a natural extension of the “sharing economy” which has shaped the way Millennials think. They are looking for access, not ownership. This generation is reluctant to buy and own goods. Think Uber and AirBnb, for example.\n\nTraditional asset management is also changing due to other Millennial values: low fees and transparency. Companies such as Betterment, Wealthfront, Stockspot and Robinhood have stepped in to offer services for free, or at very low rates, allowing anyone access to owning many different varieties of assets.\n\nPlatforms like AngelList, SeedInvest and Fundersclub are allowing people to invest in private companies and startups in a way that has never been done before. Realty Mogul is an example of crowdfunding for real estate.\n\nThe emergence of these FinTech companies happened in the wake of the Great Recession, as investment behaviors were dramatically altered. For example, Millennials who have money keep 52% in cash and 28% in stocks, whereas older people keep 23% in cash and 46% in stocks, according to a UBS survey.\n\nMillennials blame banks (rightly so) for the 2008 crisis that left them scarred and underemployed, while saddled with huge debts. The banking scandals that have gone unprosecuted has also led to young people’s ire against traditional banking. The list includes Libor, the “London Whale”, the PPI Scandal, money laundering scandals, and the list goes on and on.\n\nThis has given rise to challenger banks, which are defined as ones that provide competition to the traditional banks. Examples include Virgin Money, Metro, Aldermore, Shawbrook and Paragon. BankMobile may be the beginning of the future for banking. It has no physical presence (it’s mobile only), and its transaction fees are zero.\n\nAll this has also coincided with the rise of digital currencies like Bitcoin and the transformation of assets, in general, to the digital space.\n\nElite Daily Study: Findings on the Millennial Consumer\n\nElite Daily did a study on the enigmatic Millennial consumer habits. Companies that want to tap into the largest generation ever should be making its findings a part of their strategy for customer acquisition. Some of the key findings:\n\nMillennials aren’t influenced by advertising. They review blogs before making purchases. They value authenticity as more important than content. They want to engage with brands on social networks. They want to co-create products with companies. They use multiple tech devices. They expect brands and corporations to give back to society.\n\nTraditional banking seems oblivious about trying to draw this generation in, and this is a good thing. As more and more products and services are shaped for these new consumers, society as a whole will benefit. Lower fees, quicker payments and settlements, more transparency, more options, and most importantly more access to the financial system for everyone.\n\nYou can also check out adetailed presentation here.', 'This is a guest post by Joe Ciccolo, DCC Member and CEO of BitAML.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Ripple Labs settlement agreement, the first civil enforcement action brought against a digital currency exchange, demonstrates the perils of piecemeal AML compliance and delayed implementation. Last week, Ripple Labs, the popular payment system, currency exchange and remittance network, reached a settlement with FinCEN and the US DOJ in which it acknowledged AML compliance violations and agreed to fines in excess of $1.1 million. And that’s just the beginning. (More on the true financial and operational cost to Ripple Labs in a moment.) So what happened? And how can we learn from this enforcement action?\n\nAnalysis\n\nWhen Ripple Labs began blazing its trail in the world of digital currency, there were no true “rules of engagement”, and certainly nothing in the way of the AML compliance requirements that exist today. In fact, its founding predated the March 18, 2013 FinCEN guidance which applied Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations to digital currency exchanges and administrators by defining them as money transmitters, a type of money services business (MSB). As detailed in the settlement agreement, Ripple Labs did not immediately register its already existing business with FinCEN when the guidance was issued. Rather, they ultimately registered a subsidiary later that same year. Thus, the company operated an unregistered money services business (MSB). Simply put, this is one of the easiest violations for a regulator to prove. It is perhaps the lowest of the proverbial low hanging fruit.\n\nBoth prior and subsequent to registering as an MSB, regulators determined that Ripple Labs did not implement an effective BSA/AML program. (Note the italicized text added for emphasis.) Lest one think they can simply delay BSA/AML compliance by postponing FinCEN MSB registration, regulators reminded digital currency entities in the settlement agreement that “…regardless of whether they have registered, as required, MSBs are subject to certain additional requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations.” So bottom line…if you’re operational, you must have an effective BSA/AML program already in place. Waiting until you reach some predetermined company milestone before building out compliance functionality is not only a regulatory violation, as FinCEN and the US DOJ proved, but a very costly business strategy.\n\nEqually damning is the idea of cobbling together bits and pieces of your compliance program as you grow. Digital currency exchanges and administrators must be strategic and very deliberate about investments in the area of compliance. While it’s a tall order to be sure, especially for a startup or small venture, the single best approach is to lay the foundation of your program using the “four pillars” of BSA/AML compliance (1. Designation of a Compliance Officer; 2. Development of internal policies, procedures and controls; 3. Ongoing, relevant training of employees; and, 4. Independent testing and review). With few exceptions, any investments you make in the area of compliance will fall into one or more of these four buckets. The importance of developing and investing in the vitality of the four pillars cannot be understated. Within the settlement itself, regulators took the opportunity to remind digital currency exchanges and administrators that they are required to implement an AML program that, at minimum, contains each of the four pillars. While investments in compliance – a non-revenue generating function of one’s business – may seem costly, the cost of not developing and effectively implementing a strategic approach from day one is exponentially higher.\n\nRecall earlier in this article, I alluded to the $1.1 million aggregate fine as only the beginning of the true cost. Now the real work begins! In “Attachment B: Remedial Framework”, the settlement agreement provides a detailed list of cumbersome, time-sensitive requirements and deliverables that must be turned over on an extremely tight schedule. Among these, Ripple Labs must create and implement a training program; secure an independent party to review its AML program; enhance its protocol; implement transaction monitoring systems; and, perform a “look back” for potential suspicious activity. Further, not captured in the resource cost of remediating these items is the potential loss of revenue from new or existing customers that may question their faith in the company or losses attributable to engaging regulators rather than the marketplace. Moreover, business will now be conducted on the regulator’s terms, not the company’s terms. As you may well grasp from the partial list of required remedial fixes and indirect costs, the monetary penalty is only the beginning of the financial and operational pain.\n\nThe news, however, is not all bad. In fact, regulators devoted several detailed sentences at the very beginning of the settlement agreement to applauding Ripple Labs’ cooperation and commitment to maintaining an effective AML program. This was not by accident, nor should it be overlooked. When determining monetary fines and other forfeitures, regulators generally take into consideration the level of cooperation; self-disclosures made upfront; and, past violations, if any. The acknowledgement of these proactive efforts was just as much a call to shape future interactions with other digital currency exchanges and administrators, as it was a recognition of Ripple Labs’ progress and initiative.\n\nSummary\n\nThe settlement agreement between regulators and Ripple Labs, the first civil enforcement action against any digital currency exchange, offers a valuable learning opportunity. The speed of innovation and marketplace disruption have never met a countering forcing quite like financial regulation. Digital currency exchanges and administrators have had to make changes while in motion. Some have been forced to suspend services (temporarily or indefinitely), while others still have struggled to adapt to a system of regulation that never really seems to fit quite right. Regardless of your past experiences or current circumstances, regulation is here to stay. The Ripple Labs settlement illustrates the importance of executing a comprehensive and cohesive AML compliance strategy that begins on day one of operations. It also teaches us that proactively mending previous regulatory transgressions, owning up to compliance faults, and pursuing a course of action to make thing right can soften the blow. So, if you haven’t already begun to invest time and resources into the build out of your AML compliance program, today is the day to get started. For those that have begun, it’s imperative that you move forward by staying on top of developments in the compliance world and never look back.\n\nThe Ripple Labs settlement must be embraced as a learning opportunity. It’s just a shame that this promising venture will be held back from advancing the pace of innovation in our industry due to early AML compliance missteps.\n\nLearn more about Joe Ciccolo, CEO of BitAML at his DCC Member Profile.', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by Nuno Menezes\n\nAllied Control is a Hong Kong-based technology company that specializes in building immersion cooling systems for supercomputing and data center applications. Allied Control has won the prestigious Green Innovations Award; the head of Hong Kong government even recognized the company for innovation in finding environmentally friendly industry solutions.\n\nBitFury, a leading Bitcoin infrastructure provider and Blockchain transaction processing company, recently acquired Allied Control with the intention of using the company’s immersion cooling technologies to help it reduce its energy footprint. Immersion cooled data center technology enables cloud data centers, supercomputers, and HPC applications to drastically save electricity and reduce water consumption.\n\nValery Vavilov BitFury CEO said:\n\n“We take environmental concerns seriously. Our proprietary technology is highly energy efficient. We are committed to growing our transaction processing infrastructure with the smallest carbon footprint, continuing to rely solely on renewable energy sources.”\n\nData centers usually require not only a lot of electricity, but also a lot of water using evaporative cooling towers and water chillers.\n\nAllied Control has developed its third generation immersion cooling system utilizing 3M™ Novec™ Engineered Fluids to create energy-saving data center cooling systems for high-performance computing applications. With a PUE of less than 1.01, more than 99% of the electricity used for cooling can be saved even in hot and humid Asia while barely wasting any precious water.\n\nAbout Allied Control\n\nAllied Control builds award-winning immersion cooling systems and data cente r infrastructure to cool the world’s hottest supercomputers. The Hong Kong-based tech startup is known for its efficient systems. The company’s modular and containerized DataTank™ data centers allows inexpensive, efficient, and rapid deployment of infrastructure for the supercomputer, HPC, and cryptocurrency applications at unprecedented power densities. Allied Control’s innovative data center designs have recently won prestigious awards such as the Best Green ICT Award for Most Efficient Data Center and the DataCenterDynamics Award for “Future Thinking & Design Concept”.\n\nIn California, some companies have moved their data centers out of state, to colder climates. However, the key reason why many US companies and international internet giants like Alibaba are moving a considerable amount of their cloud data center operations to California is to utilize the high-tech talent pool and already existing infrastructure in and around Silicon Valley.\n\nKar-Wing Lau, VP of Operations at Allied Control commented:\n\n“With California being in its fourth consecutive drought year and regulators proposing mandatory reduction of up to 35% in urban water consumption, Allied Control’s immersion cooling technology might offer an effective solution to cool down the many data centers serving the hungry and ever-growing demand of cloud services and other Silicon Valley applications. In our standard configuration, the closed loop cooling units do not use evaporative water towers, and as a result, the water usage effectiveness is close to zero (WUE <0.003 L/kWh).”\n\nCompared to traditional cooling sources, Allied Control’s passive process apparently uses much less energy and consumes less water. Two-phase immersion cooling is up to 4000 times more efficient at removing heat from chips than air.\n\nBitFury Group is one of the leading Bitcoin infrastructure providers and Blockchain transaction processing companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem. BitFury derives sustainable advantage through its custom-made application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), optimized to achieve the lowest power consumption. Now, with this move BitFury is most certainly aiming to deliver the world’s most energy efficient mining datacenters.\n\nWhat do you think about this type of environmentally friendly solutions? Let us know on the comment section below!\n\nPress Release and Images provided by Allied Control', '(OroyFinanzas.com) – El teorema regresivo de Mises intenta explicar cómo una moneda adquiere valor, basándose en dos ideas. El dinero es un proceso evolutivo de mercado, como sostuvo Carl Menger y las monedas debían probar que poseían unas utilidades no monetarias valoradas por el mercado (tales como la ornamental e industrial), antes de ser reconocidas como moneda.\n\n¿Puede aplicarse el teorema regresivo del dinero de Mises a Bitcoin?\n\nSe trata de una de las escasas explicaciones aportadas desde la teoría económica al origen del valor de las monedas. Con la aparición de las monedas criptográficas, este teorema se ha integrado en el intenso debate intelectual generado que pretende sustentar la base teórica de estas monedas. ¿Se puede aplicar este teorema al Bitcoin? ¿Cuál es su utilidad no monetaria? ¿Qué respalda el valor del Bitcoin y del resto de monedas criptográficas o criptomonedas?\n\nLas monedas criptográficas son un fenómeno poco comprendido, porque es un fenómeno complicado. Reúne un innovador concepto de técnicas criptográficas, el intercambio seguro no replicable de datos digitales y la ingeniería de software entre pares. Además, se trata de una moneda voluntaria en los inicios de su proceso de monetización, que está experimentando fluctuaciones en el precio bastante significativas. Por ello, hay un interés en explorar qué motiva a los distintos actores a demandar esta moneda y en entender qué sustenta su valor.\n\nEl teorema regresivo de Mises se utiliza tanto por defensores como detractores de las monedas criptográficas\n\nAlgunos detractores se acogen a este teorema para confirmar que, como Bitcoin solo se usa como moneda de intercambio, como solo tiene una utilidad estrictamente monetaria, su valor intrínseco necesariamente tenderá a ser inexistente. Aducen que es un sistema que está construido sobre bases endebles, se asemeja a un castillo de naipes cuya fragilidad está amenazada por miles de hackers con incentivos para quebrar su sistema de seguridad, y por Gobiernos que tarde o temprano tendrán la tentación de controlar un sistema monetario libre que socava las mismas bases de su poder.\n\nAlgunos defensores confirman la validez de este teorema regresivo, aduciendo que el Bitcoin es ‘mucho más que una moneda’. Además de su utilidad propiamente monetaria como forma de intercambio, tiene muchos otros usos no monetarios. Así, puede ser un activo de riesgo con el que se pueden conseguir rentabilidades muy altas. Puede ser un activo a largo plazo, cuyo valor viene dado por el alto volumen de capital riesgo (y de ingenieros) que está aterrizando en este ecosistema, con nuevas aplicaciones y oportunidades de negocio. O bien, invertir en Bitcoins puede tener una carga ideológica de peso, de rechazo al ‘dinero monopolístico impuesto desde arriba’.\n\nOtros defensores consideran que su fuente de valor fundamental no monetaria está en integrar un sistema de pagos a la moneda. La cadena de bloques constituiría así una red de pagos innovadora, que permite comerciar sin tener que confiar en intermediarios, y que le aporta un valor añadido a la moneda. Su naturaleza criptográfica, descentralizada y pseudo-anónima se pudo poner a prueba durante diez meses con éxito antes de que se le otorgara un valor por primera vez en la página web New Liberty Standard (de 1 USD = 1309,03 BTC).\n\nLos numerosos beneficios para los usuarios (que se ahorran el pago de comisiones a los intermediarios financieros) y para los comerciantes (que se evitan las incómodas devoluciones de los cargos de las tarjetas), y el paulatino efecto contagio en su utilización, permite olvidar a muchos usuarios sus suspicacias e incomodidades en su funcionamiento según otros defensores.\n\nAlgunos defensores de las monedas criptográficas son, sin embargo, muy críticos con el teorema regresivo. El hecho de que el Bitcoin haya adquirido un valor significativo plantea dudas sobre la relevancia del teorema, pues no llega a explicar bien por qué un dinero tiene valor. Su argumento es que el valor de cualquier bien viene determinado fundamentalmente por su utilidad. Igual que valoramos un alimento por su utilidad nutritiva, estimamos que una moneda tiene valor si tiene una utilidad monetaria alta (al ser fácilmente transportable, divisible, difícil de falsificar, escasa…). Si el Bitcoin ha conseguido un valor muy alto es porque tiene unas buenas propiedades monetarias, y por ende, una excelente utilidad monetaria.\n\nCualquiera que sea el origen del valor del Bitcoin, esta moneda digital voluntaria y libre se va creando su propia senda, moldeada por los errores y los aciertos de sus actores. La apuesta firme por el Bitcoin de centros de innovación tecnológica como el de Silicon Valley, puede dar una idea de la magnitud de los cambios que podrían estar por llegar al sistema financiero actual.\n\npor Carlos Castro Prieto\n\n© OroyFinanzas.com', 'Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, created and held electronically. However, it is a currency not controlled by a central source. Bitcoins aren’t printed, like dollars or euros – they’re produced by people, and increasingly businesses, running computers all around the world, using software that solves mathematical problems. It is the first example of a growing category of money known as cryptocurrency. Bitcoin …', 'The Los Angeles City Council this week voted 14-1 to pass a $15 minimum wage for the city. The hike, which will go into effect over the next five years, further solidifies the $15 minimum as the new national standard.\n\nNew York City seems poised to follow suit. This month, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to convene a panel to consider a wage increase for the fast-food industry, a change that can become law without a vote in the legislature.\n\nThere are plenty of arguments against this high of a minimum wage, including one made by Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett on Friday, in which he called for an expanded earned income tax credit rather than a $15 per hour wage. But like it or not, the $15 per hour train is gaining steam. It had already made stops in Seattle and San Francisco before pulling into L.A. Should others follow suit? That question prompted Fortune to examine which U.S. city residents would benefit the most from a $15 per hour minimum wage. We asked David Cooper, an economic analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, for help.\n\nWe first wanted to determine which cities had the largest share of sub-$15 per hour earners, where a minimum wage boost to $15 would presumably have the biggest direct effect, not in absolute numbers but by percentage of the working population. (One caveat here: we used the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ data for metropolitan statistical areas—geographical areas with high population density and consistent economies that don’t necessarily contain just one city and might reach beyond a city’s official limits.)\n\nIt turns out that there are plenty of metropolitan areas—especially in the South—where 45%, 50%, and even 55% of the working population earn less than $15 per hour. (Another caveat, because of the size of some of these areas, some percentages have margins of error up to 4.3%.) For example, in the part of Texas that encompasses McAllen, Edinburg, and Pharr, which is located in the state’s southeast corner near the Mexican border, just over 68% of its workforce earns less than $15 per hour.\n\nBut when you examine how much it costs to live in that region—which Cooper measured using regional price parity, the price of goods and services in that area versus the national average—you get a different picture. The RPP there is 85, on a scale where the overall national RPP is equal to 100, which means goods and services in that area are cheaper than the national average. To take that factor into account, we looked at the most expensive places to live, as measured by RPP, and used the U.S.’s average share of sub-$15 per hour earners—42.4%—as a cutoff for the share of low-wage workers.\n\nThe map above shows the metropolitan areas that turned up. L.A., which will soon have a $15 per hour minimum wage when Mayor Eric Garcetti signs the recently passed measure into law, makes the list. It’s one of five California areas in the top 10.\n\nThe list picks up on the fact that there’s “greater inequality in cities where there’s a high cost of living and where wages are low,” says Chris Tilly, director of the UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment.\n\nIn the old, rust belt wage structure, there was a healthy population of middle wage income earners. Men worked in manufacturing; women held clerical jobs. But the bottom has dropped out of the middle class, in part, because of the reduction in traditional manufacturing jobs. As cities begin to orient themselves to newer, techonology-driven economies, there’s very little middle ground. You either work in high tech (engineers, etc.,) and its ecosystem (lawyers, accountants) or you’re left at the bottom, Tilly says. Cities with large immigrant populations also tend to have a wide disconnect between the cost of living and wages.\n\nMissing from this list is, notably, New York City. The metropolitan statistical area that includes New York (plus parts of New Jersey and Long Island) has the second highest regional price parity on our list—122.2, behind only Honolulu’s 122.9. But the New York area’s share of sub-$15 per hour workers is 36%, considerably lower than the the national average of 42.4%. Then again, with a national average as high as 42.4%, it sounds like there’s plenty of room for improvement all across the U.S.']"
05/24/2015,"['An “angel investor” is someone who individually bankrolls an investment for a new company or business venture. They usually invest on a smaller scale than a “venture capitalist”, but aren’t looking to take a start-up public to reap huge rewards. An “angel” may invest more in the idea or the person leading the new venture than the expected financial returns, or the ability for the business to “go public”. Well, Roger Ver is to angel investors what Phil Jackson is to NBA coaching success. He has had a hand in a long string of bitcoin success stories, and for bringing many people into the cryptocurrency revolution. His passion and dedication to bitcoin’s growth has definitely been a driving force in its early success.\n\nRoger Ver has a Problem\n\nRoger Ver has been in the news lately due to a legal issue with Chinese bitcoin exchange company OKCoin. In this exclusive interview, CCN talks to Roger Ver about his conflict with OKCoin. Also, how he got started with bitcoin, what he’s done to promote bitcoin, and where Bitcoin is going in the future.\n\nFor those who don’t know you that well, Roger, can you give a summary of your Bitcoin background and your aspirations in this space.\n\nI was the first person to start investing in the Bitcoin ecosystem in any substantial way. I was the first investor in such companies as Blockchain.info, Bitinstant, Ripple, Bitpay, BitcoinStore, and many more. Nathaniel Popper’s new book “Digital Gold” does a great job of covering it.\n\nYou have become commonly known in the media as the “Bitcoin Jesus”. Who coined the phrase? Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Do you like it or dislike it?\n\nI’m not sure who started that. It somehow came due to my constant evangelizing about bitcoin before anyone else was in any major way. I never set out to become “Bitcoin Jesus”, and my life would likely be easier if that hadn’t happened.\n\nWhen did you get started in bitcoin? How did you get turned on to it?\n\nI heard about it on FreeTalkLive.com’s podcast in early 2011 and jumped in with both feet.\n\nAlso read: Roger Ver Denied US Entry to Attend Bitcoin Conference\n\nOf your accomplishments, what are you most proud of in your time working and investing in Bitcoin?\n\nWe all know that libertarians played a very big role early on. I think I helped bring them on board more than anyone else. I ran national radio ads advertising Bitcoin on more than 100 radio stations. I attended libertarian conferences to spread the good news about bitcoin. I gave away more bitcoins to libertarians than I can count. I would estimate over 10,000. I think getting the libertarians behind Bitcoin in the early days was what allowed Bitcoin to come as far as it has in such a short amount of time.\n\nRegarding your issue with OKCoin, can you give your side of the conflict? What is the basic problem here? How did you and OKCoin connect to begin with? I know they received ownership of the bitcoin.com domain from Blockchain.Info\n\nThe short version is that the CEO of OKCoin forged a contract and then forged my name onto it. PGP cryptographic signatures have proven it to be a forgery and for him to be a liar beyond any doubt. The only reason I can think of for him to go to such extremes to get out of a $10,000 a month payment is if his company is already insolvent and doesn’t have the money. I really think we should demand a full proof of reserves audit of OKCoin at this point.\n\nHow surprised were you to see them make it a public matter?\n\nI was shocked that they would make it public when anyone with two eyes can see that they are the liars and cheaters in this situation. I suppose they just wanted to get their side of the story out first, or they would have had no chance at all in the court of public opinion.\n\nHow should this issue be resolved, to your satisfaction?\n\nI’m not sure at this point. The CEO of OKcoin has proven himself to be a liar and a contract counterfeiter. They already broke their agreement with me, wasted several days of my time, hurt the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. If they are actually solvent, I suppose they should pay me some fee for the damages they have caused by breaching the contract. Firstly I would like to see an audit, so we know we aren’t dealing with MTGOX part 2.\n\nThe year is 2020. What is bitcoin to the world five years from now? What is a realistic expectation of its growth and development? What is Bitcoin’s 5-year plan?\n\nIf Bitcoin grows at about the same pace as the last five years, it will be about $50,000 per BTC with about 1,000,000,000 people will be using it. If you look at how far Bitcoin has come in the last five years, that isn’t unreasonable at all.\n\nBesides the resolution of this OKCoin conflict, what else can we expect from you in 2015? What’s left on the “To Do List”?\n\nThere is another semi-secret project that I have been funding for close to a year now. The alpha version of the software is ready, and the white paper is undergoing some reviews from Andrew Poelstra, a co-author of the side chains white paper, and others. If it is successful, it will be the most important invention since Bitcoin itself.\n\nRoger Ver is one of the busiest men in the bitcoin community, and it looks like his next big project is almost ready to come to fruition. Sounds like things are going to get very interesting in the bitcoin community once Roger gets over this bump in the road. There never is a boring day in the world of bitcoin these days. Stay tuned.\n\nImages courtesy of Roger Ver.', ""Centralization and Blockchain Control\n\nOne of the driving factors behind cryptocurrency is the fact that it is decentralized, meaning that no individual or group controls it. Instead, it is controlled by everyone participating in the particular cryptocurrency's network. The more people in the network, the more resistant it is to different kinds of attacks.\n\nA cryptocurrency itself has no “single point of failure,” as it would be said in the computer security world. This means that in order for someone to compromise a cryptocurrency as a whole, they would need to compromise more than one aspect of it.\n\nFor example, let's say that someone managed to break into a single Bitcoin wallet; they have not compromised the network and they have not compromised every Bitcoin wallet. They have only compromised that one Bitcoin wallet and nothing else; the Bitcoin network stays strong! That is the beauty of cryptocurrency!\n\nCentralization in Proof-of-Work: 51% Attack\n\nUnfortunately for Bitcoin and other Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies, people figured out that if they “pool” their computing power together for the sake of mining, they can make money faster.\n\nI am all for working together, but when it comes to mining a cryptocurrency, only one person can mine a new block at a time; if you attempt to split the reward for mining a new block among multiple miners through the blockchain, you need some proof of their work on the blockchain, which leads to blockchain bloat that nobody wants.\n\nSo, to effectively pool mining power together in a PoW system, everyone who wants to pool together needs to give control of their mining power to a central wallet, which claims the reward for all the blocks the pool mines and whose owner (hopefully) splits it among the miners based on their contribution.\n\nAside from the obvious trust issue involved with this kind of centralization, there is another major issue: the whole blockchain could become centralized!\n\nMost cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, follow a “Longest Valid Blockchain” rule. This means that if two blocks are competing for the same position in the blockchain, the network will adopt whichever block has the most blocks attached after it, so long as the block is valid. Because of this, if any individual or group can get enough mining power to mine faster than the rest of the network combined (more than 50% of the total mining power), then they can modify a block and make a new blockchain based on it, which is longer than the original blockchain.\n\nIf their modified blockchain is longer than the original blockchain, then it becomes accepted by the network. If they can do this repeatedly, then they can modify the blockchain at will and have complete control over it; the blockchain becomes centralized. This is the infamous “Greater Than 50%” or “51%” attack.\n\nBefore people started pooling their mining power, this type of attack was infeasible. But now, with pools, it has become possible for pool owners to collude and break that 50% barrier. The last I checked (May 5, 2015), there are four major Bitcoin pools each controlling at least 10% of the mining power and up to 19% of the mining power. Together, they control 58% of the mining power. That means that if the four individuals operating these pools decided to work together, they could rewrite the Bitcoin blockchain!\n\nCentralization in Proof-of-Stake: Rich Get Richer\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS), when it was first released by Peercoin and then used by Nxt, seemed to be a solution. In Proof-of-Stake, someone's chance of getting a block depends on how much stake they have so in order for someone to get more than 50% of the forging power (“forging” is the process by which new blocks are made just like “mining” but the exact method in PoS is different so it was given a different name for Nxt), they would need to control more than 50% of the coins in existence.\n\nThis seems even more infeasible than controlling 50% of the mining power in a PoW currency! Further, members of the Nxt community boast that Nxt will still be safe for up to 90% of the forging power upon full implementation of a new feature called “Transparent Forging!”\n\nThis being said, even if a PoS currency is safe for up to 99.9999999999999999999999999%, someone will eventually get enough stake to manipulate the blockchain.\n\nHere is why:\n\nIn Proof-of-stake, the rich get gradually richer.\n\nIf the rich are more likely to get a block, they are more likely to collect the reward for the block. Every block they get, the richer they become. The richer they become, the more likely they are to collect the reward for a block.\n\nThis keeps going on for the life to the cryptocurrency and if the cryptocurrency lives long enough, it will see 51% stake holders, or 91% stake holders, or even 99.91% stake holders. It is only a matter of time.\n\nA Mathematical Example with NXT\n\nSpeaking of time, how long will this take? The current top stake holder of Nxt is account NXT-THLJ-CYAL-JQST-6FNS5 with a balance of 50,020,753.04 NXT. The current average transaction fees (which make up the block reward in its entirety) per day is 6,207.25 NXT. Assuming that all 1,000,000,000 NXT is being used to forge and that stake is directly proportional to the percentage of blocks forged, then this account gets about 5.002075% of the 6,207.25 NXT today. This is 310.4913 NXT. Tomorrow, this account will get even more: 5.002106% of 6,207.25 NXT. This is 310.493225 NXT. It follows this equation:\n\nIn this equation s i is the current day's stake as a percentage of the total amount of coins in existence, t days is the number of days, including today, that have passed, p i is the previous days profit, and p 0 is 0 NXT. To figure out at how long it will take for s i to exceed the acceptable limit, we simply find when t days at which this happens.\n\nHow Long NXT Can Last\n\nTo simplify this I wrote a quick JavaScript program to crunch the numbers to tell me how many days NXT can last. I ran it on an online code tester from webtoolkitonline.com. I found out that it was only 370,887 days for claiming over 50% of the total stake and 465,581 days for claiming over 90% of the total stake.\n\nIf that is the case, this user should control 50% of the stake in about 1,015 years and 90% of the stake in 1,275 years. In reality, it is probably less because not everyone stakes but that gives a rough idea about how long NXT can potentially last.\n\nAlternative Algorithm Options\n\nThankfully, Nxt's PoS algorithm is very adaptable to other types proof. It works by making a “target” value for every account, which is a multiple of its balance and the number of seconds that have passed and a universal “base target” value, which applies to all accounts that I will ignore for the sake of simplicity. Every account also gets a single “hit” value, which is unique to the account but based on the signature of the previous block. When the account's “target” value exceeds its “hit” value, the account earns the right to make the next block and claim the transaction fees it contains.\n\nAll one has to do in order to adapt this algorithm is pick a value unique to each account other than its balance! The rest of the algorithm can stay the same! Of course, there may be more unique ways to do this by creating an algorithm from scratch that may offer additional security. That is a good thing to think about for the more technically inclined, but for the time being, let's focus on some options using this algorithm as a base.\n\nProof of Hodl (PoH)\n\nWhat about using the number of blocks an account has gone without making a transaction instead of its balance? This value may be pretty uniform across accounts at the beginning but is likely to change quite a bit over time. A coin like this would appear to make a nice long term investment and might be pricey to buy because no one would want to spend it and reset their hodl count to zero. The only real problem with this is that in order for an economy to thrive, people need to use their money to buy things. Without spending, an economy can't improve; it can't get worse either but who wants to live in a “so-so” economy? Let's consider the opposite.\n\nProof of Use (PoU)\n\nWhat if generating new blocks was based on how many transactions someone has made and/or received over a certain number of blocks? This certainly encourages people to spend and/or buy! This may, however, be unfair to those who can't afford to make many transactions due to transaction fees and the fees would have to be high enough to prevent people from spamming the blockchain with transactions to accounts they own. The fees for using it would have to outweigh the benefit gained by spending that would change every block so fees would have to be variable, which requires some math.\n\nProof of Stake-Time (PoST)\n\nVericoin has recently implemented a new algorithm they call Proof-of-Stake-Time or PoST. It is very similar to a variant of PoS used in Peercoin which multiplies the stake by its age. Peercoin calls this “PoS” but I would classify it under the title “PoST” because mining is based off of an account's Stake and the Time for which it has belonged to the account so really, Vericoin is just the first to use the term PoST. That being said, Vericoin's PoST has a wildly different effect on the network than Peercoin's PoST despite their similarities!\n\nThe biggest difference is that Vericoin adds a fractional multiplier to the transaction's age. The math is a little complicated, but what you need to know is that the larger portion of the entire network weight that the value of the number of coins multiplied by their age takes up, the sooner the probability to mine a block starts to drop. If not active, everyone's chance of mining a block will eventually start to drop rather than grow.\n\nFor the rich this happens sooner and for the poor this happens later but it will happen to everyone if they aren't active. The effect, as it is said in the Vericoin PoST whitepaper is that you get the “active rich” against the “vested poor” as opposed to the “rich ruling” the poor or “poor attacking” the rich. This still isn't the ideal outcome but it is a much better situation than you get with regular PoS.\n\nProof of Minimum Aged Stake (PoMAS)\n\nWhat if the right to make the next block was based only on the fact that an account has some minimum balance rather than how much balance they have? As long as an account has had some minimum balance for a period of time a multiplier for the “target” value could be chosen in a similar way the “hit” value is chosen: a way that is unpredictable but verifiable. This certainly seems fair as every account meeting those requirements has an equal chance for winning the next block.\n\nThe problem is that people with large stakes can split it among multiple accounts to improve their odds so there needs to be a way to discourage this behavior. Fees for funding an account with zero balance would have to outweigh the benefit gained by having multiple accounts and that would depend on how many accounts have balances above zero.\n\nThis, however, allows miners to manipulate the block to maximize their “target” value multiplier and “hit” value if they can still get it in fast enough. Plus, there is still the problem of finding another value that is unpredictable but verifiable. For these reasons, a second block signer who can sign the block but not make other changes to it can be used. This provides a second signature to be used that neither miner can manipulate so it is fit to be used for either the “target” value multiplier or the “hit” value, but it cannot be used for both.\n\nSo, in this version of PoMAS, a third block signer is necessary to provide the basis for the other value. This is kind of like adding two extra transactions to every block, even empty ones, so it could lead to block-chain bloat.\n\nI have actually have been working to design a version of PoMAS that has no “target” value so it only requires two signatures. It is not complete and the details are beyond the scope of this article. I just wanted everyone to know that something like this might show up in the cryptocurrency world one day and it was originally my idea.\n\nFull disclosure: the author of this article, Colin Lacina, is a former member of NXT Organization\n\nEditor's note: This article was modified to include Peercoin as the original PoS cryptocurrency."", 'In addition to all this, though, Ross’s ability to get Silk Road up and running was a product of his sheer desperation at a difficult moment in his life.

Moving forward, however, the company believes that switching to a peer-to-peer model will allow them to offer a much faster and pleasant buying experience to customers.\n\nDue to banks taking an “unfriendly” approach to doing business with crypto companies in the UK, CryptoMate believes that switching to a P2P system will allow it to have a bit more control over their future and ensure that it does not have a single point of failure, as is currently the case with many exchanges.\n\n“Using our network of trusted bitcoin and altcoin vendors and having them compete to fulfill customer orders, we allow for smoother and most importantly faster transactions,” said CryptoMate founder William Thomas to CoinTelegraph. “Customers in the UK with access to online banking can have their coins in their wallets in just a few minutes.”\n\nThe company will not hold any fiat or private keys to crypto coins on its servers, as customers will be able to buy directly from its vendors instead of from CryptoMate the company.\n\n“Unless the banks change their approach soon, British [bitcoin] buyers and sellers will move towards peer-to-peer platforms.” — CryptoMate Founder William Thomas\n\nCoinTelegraph: With so many crypto startups and exchanges, in particular, why did you decide to launch CryptoMate in the UK?\n\nWilliam Thomas: Historically, the British have always been on the forefront of new technologies, and thanks to the “wait and see” attitude the current government has shown to our industry, we believe that the UK is currently one of the best startup environments in the world today.\n\nWe have not reinvented the wheel with our new exchange platform. We make buying cryptocurrencies available via bank transfer — as do a number of other services. Where we differ from our competition is our ease of use and order fulfillment speed. Customers can buy some bitcoin (or seven other cryptocurrencies) and have the coins in their wallet within five minutes, without the normal headaches that they would typically experience with other British exchanges.\n\nWe believe that the UK is one of the best countries to do business in the cryptocurrency space right now — in the Western world that is. What we do could not be directly exported to North America or Europe due to their banking systems, so we’re thankful that British banks have helped us out in that regard, no matter how unintentional.\n\n“Punishing the majority over a small minority of bad apples will stunt the growth of digital currency in the UK.”\n\nCT: What is the maximum that customers can buy without proof of identity?\n\nWT: We allow customers to buy up to £250 without proof of identity, with verification for those who wish to purchase more than £250. Our aim is to bring cryptocurrency to the masses, and forcing our customers to jump through hoops is not going achieve that. We use as much fraud-protection software and best practices as possible, which of course is imperfect, but is there any industry that doesn’t suffer from fraud? Punishing the majority over a small minority of bad apples will stunt the growth of digital currency in the UK.\n\nCT: You are planning to shift toward a P2P exchange system, effectively decentralizing the buying and selling of crypto. How will this platform be different from your current offering?\n\nWT: Currently CryptoMate sells coins directly to customers, which works fine, but much like the coins we sell, our aim is to become as “decentralized” as possible as a platform. We want to make buying bitcoin and other coins as easy as possible for customers — and selling them as easy as possible for vendors.\n\nWe will go public with version 2.0 of CryptoMate on June 15. This will be the upgraded and peer-to-peer enabled system. Customers make their payments directly to our trusted vendors; this means we do not accept or hold any bitcoin or GBP during or after the transaction.\n\nCT: So CryptoMate will be essentially a matchmaking service for buyers and sellers?\n\nWT: Yes, simply put, we are a matchmaking service for buyers and sellers of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We will connect buyers with online banking access to live vendors who have coins they wish to sell.\n\nCT: And how do you verify which vendors are trusted?\n\nWT: We do this by having an invite system where we will only accept new vendors that we either know personally or who have proven their trust to us in the past. We also ask new vendors to provide us with their proof of ID and address, as well as paying a safety deposit (in BTC) before they can accept orders, which gets returned on closure of the account, depending on account standing.\n\nIn matters of dispute, we ask to live-screenshare with the vendor to verify that the funds have or have not been received. There are a few more practices we use to ensure our vendors are trusted, but we are unable to share these publicly at this point.\n\n“Since we, as an exchange, hold no funds in cryptocurrency or GBP, we feel that we have had a huge weight taken off our shoulders.”\n\nCT: Do you think this decentralized model will become standard for crypto exchanges?\n\nWT: The decision for CryptoMate to switch from a direct seller of coins to a peer-2-peer system came as a result of British banks unwillingness to work with us. We have seen many British exchanges rise and fall in the past couple of years, and one thing is clear, the banks in the UK don't want to play ball.\n\nSo unless the banks change their approach soon (we don't think they will), British buyers and sellers will move towards peer-to-peer platforms like CryptoMate. Who knows what the future holds for the sector as a whole, but our long-term plans are to be as decentralized as possible and provide a valuable service for the crypto ecosystem within the UK.\n\nCT: Are you planning to create a decentralized application (Dapp)?\n\nWT: We have spoken about the concept, but nothing solid is planned (during the next 12 months anyway). Our main goal right now is to attract new users, gain funding, and work on expanding into the rest of Europe.\n\nCT: With the recent hack of BitFinex’s hot wallet, among others, custodial accounts are quickly becoming a major security concern. Do you think decentralized exchanges (that do not hold customer funds) will instill greater confidence in Bitcoin for current and future users?\n\nWT: I was as surprised as anyone to hear about BitFinex, having always thought their security would be rock solid for such a large company. Since we, as an exchange, hold no funds in cryptocurrency or GBP, we feel that we have had a huge weight taken off our shoulders. We know that security is still imperative, as customer details (emails, etc.) need to be kept safe, which is why we employ experienced security experts to meticulously pen test before public deployment.\n\nCT: What kind of altcoins do you expect to support in the future?\n\nWT: We plan on adding more alt coins to our selection in the next three months. Which coins has not yet been decided. I think we have to review each coin and see if there’s enough public demand and an active team behind it.\n\nCT: Are you planning to hold a funding round?\n\nWT: We are currently seeking round 1 seed investment from within UK or possibly EU. We have a lot of big future plans for CryptoMate and only funding will help us achieve them, so anyone reading who wants to get involved, please reach out to us via email.\n\nCT: What do you think is the biggest challenge for Bitcoin and crypto startups right now?\n\nWT: Banks and fraudsters, sometimes the same people."", '?? ???????: ??????? ??????? ? ??????????????? ???????????\n\n?????: ??????? ??????? 25 ??? 2015\n\n???????? ?????? ?

Otherwise it’s just a lesser known CitiBank.\n\n— Jonathan Zittrain (@zittrain) May 20, 2015', 'In a bold move, BitGold has just acquired Goldmoney.com for CA$51.9 million (US$42.3 million), incorporating more than 135K of the website’s “gold bugs,” or gold-hoarding enthusiasts.\n\nGoldmoney is a service that allows users to trade and safely store their gold assets, controlling over CA$1.5 billion worth of precious metals in their storage facilities. These assets will be virtually moved to the Aurum ledger, the backbone behind BitGold’s trade engine.\n\nThen and Now\n\nFounded in 2001 by James Turk, GoldMoney’s “low cost storage” fees for gold ranged between 0.12% and 0.18% per year, deducted on a monthly basis from users’ accounts. BitGold, however, seems to feature a simpler and more lucrative pricing. Users can store their gold for free in the company’s vaults. With BitGold, users only pay a flat 1% fee for gold purchases, invoicing and redemptions.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be finalized in less than 60 days. BitGold has gone a long way, from shares valued at 3.3 cents last year, to 701,000 shares trading last Friday at 4.14 CAD. The merger has added a strong shareholder base and three GoldMoney directors to the combined board of directors.\n\nRoy Sebag, BitGold CEO, said:\n\n“With the technology of the BitGold platform, we can expand the GoldMoney legacy of trust, security, and a client centric purpose to new markets, growing from a much stronger base and benefiting all stakeholders. Combining the first global e-marketplace for gold with the latest and most innovative, we instantly become the world’s largest and most active bullion money service.”\n\nA Libertarian’s Paradise\n\nBitGold, which is backed by big players such as Sandstorm Gold and Dundee Capital Market, has upgraded Goldmoney’s “nonphysical currency” service by relying on the blockchain as opposed to a centralized ledger.\n\nBy merging both services, users will be able to trade their gold for the currency of their choice — yes, including bitcoin — and have proceeds wired directly to their bank account. Those who do not wish to depend on fiat or digital currency can have their gold shipped directly to their doorsteps at appropriate fees and quantities.\n\nPreviously, Goldmoney users were allowed to transfer funds directly to one another. After the E-Gold money-laundering drama in 2008, however, it became less and less sensible for Goldmoney to continue the service, and it was completely shut down in 2012 subsequent to excessive regulatory complications.\n\nWith BitGold carefully taking note of know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, libertarians who do not wish to touch fiat with a 10-foot pole will be able to “spend their gold” conveniently at traditional points of sale via a specialized gold debit, negating the need to depend on cash.\n\nThe Paypal of Gold\n\nThe ability to purchase everyday goods directly with gold is hardly a new one. Peter Schiff’s book Crash Proof: How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse, published in 2007, explained in detail the need for gold to become a standard of paying, thus bypassing otherwise usurious debit card fees. With BitGold, users will be able to transfer to anyone with a mobile phone or email address.\n\nAccording to BitGold, users can already “spend gold with the BitGold DebitCard, [which is] accepted anywhere globally that accepts major credit cards, including ATM machines to withdraw local currency.”\n\nBitcoin may be volatile, but gold is not. The ability to withdraw money from ATMs using gold bars tucked safely thousands of miles away is not only fascinating, it’s downright futuristic.', 'James Temperton\n\nBerlin-based Kiwi wants to bring keyless entry systems to millions of apartment blocks and do away with keys for good. The startup recently raised €4m (£2.8m) in funding and is currently used on 1,300 doors in the German capital. ""Opening doors remotely and hands free is nothing new, but it\'s not out there for residential homes,"" Karsten Nölling, head of sales at Kiwi tells WIRED.co.uk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company\'s system is similar to those found in cars and offices, relying on a RFID key fob and electronic door entry system. Where Kiwi\'s system differs is that it can easily be retrofitted into the sprawling apartment blocks that cover Berlin and other cities throughout the world. It can also be used to open doors remotely with a smartphone app. The fob doesn\'t even need to be touched on the door -- with a range of three metres it\'ll open the door when someone walks up to it with the fob in their bag or pocket.\n\nNölling explains the technology takes about 20 minutes to install, with a business card-sized sensor being placed behind the electronic door entry system at the front of an apartment block. An additional mobile gateway and SIM card, which uses the Deutsche Telekom network in Germany, means the system can be updated remotely and allows for smartphone entry.\n\nFounded in 2012, Kiwi is currently installed on around 1,300 doors in Berlin. A rollout in Hamburg will add another 400 doors later his year. In the past month alone more than 140,000 door openings have been made using the technology. The company is already working with the likes of Deutsche Post, Allianz and Berlin\'s fire department to roll out the system more widely.\n\nRead next Xenophobia on Twitter: tracking abuse in the wake of Brexit Xenophobia on Twitter: tracking abuse in the wake of Brexit\n\nNölling says Kiwi is about much more than just letting people get into their apartments without needing to find their keys. It could also be used by couriers, refuse collectors, cleaning companies and the emergency services to get access to properties without needing to carry around a huge bunch of keys or antiquated master key.\n\nJames Temperton\n\n""Right now we\'re really a hardware company"", co-founder Claudia Nagel says. The idea had been to use existing hardware, but Nagel explains the technology was expensive, not scaleable and vulnerable to hackers. To find a solution, the team at Kiwi worked with white hats to create their own secure system. Nagel claims Kiwi\'s technology is more secure than existing keyless entry systems used in cars and offices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe smartphone app allows users to open connected doors from anywhere in the world. Nölling gives the example of opening the door for a friend who is staying for the weekend or a cleaner who has forgotten their key. While not an intended use, the system is also an ""obvious, natural fit for Airbnb hosts"", he claims.\n\nKiwi charges between €1 (£0.70) and €5 (£3.55) per month for the system depending on how many people need to be added to a subscription. A family subscription for up to eight people costs €5, for example. Each fob costs €25 although once subscribed entry through the smartphone app is free of charge.\n\nNölling says the system is best suited for large apartment blocks, with German real estate firm Degewo already signed-up to install it on all its 75,000 apartments in Berlin. In some cases landlords are including the Kiwi subscription in rental agreements.\n\nThe access each key fob or account has aren\'t tracked by Kiwi, with the company creating ""user profiles, not use profiles"". That means no tracking, no logging and no profiles of who opens what door and when. This, Kiwi explains, was key to the technology being adopted by postal workers who don\'t want to be tracked on their routes.\n\nKiwi is also working on a system to open internal front doors. The technology, which fits a sizeable motorised add-on to a lock, could be used on any door, regardless of whether it is connected to an electronic door entry system or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWIRED spent the past week is in Germany to get the bigger picture on the UK\'s impending in/out referendum on EU. What, if anything, does the UK risk leaving behind? Read more of our coverage here.\n\nThis article originally stated Kiwi was used by 1,300 people in Berlin, it is used on 1,300 doors. We also stated Kiwi creates ""use profiles, not user profiles"". This should have read ""user profiles, not use profiles"".']"
05/25/2015,"['Students at Simon Fraser University (SFU) looking to buy books for the summer semester have one more payment option available to them.\n\nSFU is unveiling three Bitcoin ATMs — or automated vending machines (AVMs) — May 26 at campus bookstores in Burnaby, Surrey and downtown Vancouver.\n\nMike Yeung, founder of the SFU Bitcoin club, said this is the first time he knows of a Canadian university partnering up with an AVM supplier to get the machines installed on campus.\n\nThe student union at the B.C. Institute of Technology (BCIT) installed a machine on its Burnaby campus a year ago. And Yeung hopes by getting the SFU administration involved officially, the AVMs will eventually spread beyond the bookstores and catch on with students still unsure about using cryptocurrency.\n\n“A lot of them are quite curious and unfortunately, there isn’t at this time too many ways for them to get their hands on bitcoins,” he told Business in Vancouver.\n\n“And even if they get them, they don’t know how to spend them.”\n\nYeung worked with SFU Ancillary Services for about a year to get AVMs from Toronto’s BitSent installed at the bookstores.\n\nThe outlets have been equipped with iPads that can accept the virtual currency and staff have been trained to help students use the AVMs.\n\nWhile banks’ ATMs conjure up images of people swiping banking cards to withdraw cash, people will use the AVMs to purchase bitcoins with cash.\n\nBefore doing so, they must have a Bitcoin wallet — similar to an email address — linked to their smartphones. The AVM machine then scans a QR code on the smartphone that links to the Bitcoin wallet and allow users to buy the cryptocurrency with cash they insert in the machine.\n\nStudents are then able to purchase products at the bookstore using their bitcoins, just as they would with a debit card or cash.\n\nBanks and ATM providers typically pay retail outlets a fee to have their machine installed on a property.\n\nYeung said SFU and BitSent reached an agreement where students will be charged to buy bitcoins from the machine, while the school and the AVM provider split the profit.\n\nBitcoin’s value is derived from its limited supply, usefulness and its peer-to-peer payment system that requires no transaction fees between merchants and consumers.\n\nThis stands in contrast to debit and credit card companies that charge merchants fees when customers use those options to make payments.\n\n“If people adopt Bitcoin, and try it out and use it more often, one of the benefits is that the retailer can opt to make a discount for people making purchases in Bitcoin,” Yeung said.\n\nHe’s still working with SFU to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem, which could include making food and coffee purchases across other campus businesses sometime in the near future.\n\n“Once that expands a little bit, there will be opportunities, perhaps, to cut down on prices for retail purchases.”\n\nSFU Ancillary Services executive director Mark McLaughlin told Business in Vancouver he wants to take a “phased approach” to expanding Bitcoin on campus.\n\n“Our plan at this point is to expand it to other retail locations on campus, namely dining services, the restaurants, over the course of the next year,” he said.\n\nAs for the profit-splitting arrangement, McLaughlin said the school isn’t looking to make money off students who buy bitcoins. Rather, the “minimal” commission it brings in mostly just covers the cost of the machine’s electricity bill.\n\n“Bitcoin is really considered the cash of the Internet, so we want to give our students an opportunity to try it first-hand.”\n\ntorton@biv.com', 'One of the most recognizable bitcoin-related domain names is at the heart of a dispute between Chinese bitcoin exchange OKCoin and bitcoin entrepreneur Roger Ver.\n\nThe issue stems from the management of the Bitcoin.com domain, after the two sides struck a five-year deal last December to control the property. Under the agreement, OKCoin was set to redesign the site and pay Ver a percentage of the revenue generated each month, with a minimum of $10,000 per month.\n\nThe latest developments, which have seen Ver accuse OKCoin of fabricating legal documents and the exchange in turn alleging that Ver is intentionally seeking to smear its name, come after months of increasingly antagonistic back-and-forth over the direction of the site and the advertising plans that were supposed to drive the effort.\n\nOKCoin has released an official statement on the dispute, stating it would no longer manage the domain name. The company cited a recent action taken by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) against Ripple Labs, which referenced Ver in its agreement with Ripple earlier this month, as its chief justification for stopping payments related to Bitcoin.com.\n\nOKCoin also characterized the agreement regarding the domain as invalid because the entity named in the documents is not representative of the actual company, essentially laying the blame on former chief technology officer Changpeng Zhao, who signed the initial agreement with Ver. Zhao departed OKCoin earlier this year.\n\nThe company said it is “currently investigating the actions of the former employee for misconduct and other possibilities for the discrepancy” in its blog post, but did not name Zhao directly. In an interview, OKCoin VP Jack Liu confirmed the company was investigating Zhao for wrongdoing.\n\nThe company blog post was published hours after Ver accused OKCoin of creating fabricated documents and fraudulently including his signature.\n\nAlleged forgery\n\nIn a 22nd May email addressed to several OKCoin staff members and copied to CoinDesk, Ver accused the company of fabricating the document and fraudulently using his signature in order to affect the outcome of the negotiations. This email, according to Ver, was copied to a list of OKCoin investors including Tim Draper.\n\nBoth Ver and OKCoin claim to have the definitive version of the agreement, copies of which were provided to CoinDesk for review.\n\nVer later posted copies of the documents to a Dropbox account. Included with Ver’s email and the Dropbox posting was an independent analysis of the documents produced by IT security consultant J. Maurice, who wrote: “I can conclude that Document #4 [OKCoin’s version] was produced by someone who copied Document #1 [Ver’s version] after Roger signed it.”\n\nThis analysis looked at the dispute documents in question, as well as Zhao’s signature on Ver’s version and OKCoin’s version.\n\nVer’s version, entitled “Bitcoin.com_v7”, includes signatures from both himself and Changpeng Zhao. Ver’s digital signature is timestamped 15th December 2014, at 10:34:43 - 04’00’. Zhao’s signature is not timestamped and is written alongside print versions of his name, title and email address.\n\nVer provided CoinDesk with PGP-signed emails between him and Zhao in which copies of the agreement were exchanged. The email exchange took place on 16th December, during which time the agreement claimed by Ver as genuine was signed and counter-signed by Zhao.\n\nOKCoin’s copy, entitled “Bitcoin.com_v8”, is nearly identical to the earliest. Notably, it includes an additional clause at the end stating that “OKCoin may cancel the contract by givin [sic] Roger 6 months advanced notice”, a stipulation written at the end of the document. The copy bears Ver’s signature with the timestamp from Ver’s version, alongside a signature that is said to have been written by Zhao but does not feature a printed version of his name, title or email.\n\nThe \'signature\' for Ver on version 8 is problematic: it bears the exact same timestamp, to the second, as the one on version 7 and appears to be a scan, not an embedded digital signature. It would be impossible to have two legitimate digital signatures recorded at the same second on two separate documents, especially if one of those documents has been altered.\n\nWhen asked for evidence showing that OKCoin’s copy had been provided by Ver, OKCoin\'s Liu said he and the company\'s CEO Star Xu were not involved in those discussions and neither was anyone else apart from Zhao. It was only upon later investigation, he said, that the discrepancies were discovered.\n\n“I don’t recall a version 8,” Zhao said by email, who went on to allege that his signature has been used by OKCoin on other occasions.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“OKCoin has used my signature a few times with bank transfers in Mozambique bank account, without my knowledge, after I left. I have asked for my name to be removed from OKCoin legal entities around the world for three months. And OKCoin is dragging their feet. OKCoin also owe me roughly $40k USD in salary, which Star have refused to pay [sic].”\n\nSlow-burning dispute\n\nAccording to the emails, the dispute dates back to January, when disagreement first surfaced over the operation of the Bitcoin.com domain name. Ver wrote to Xu at the time that he “felt a bit mistreated regarding the deal” and asked about OKCoin’s plans for the site.\n\nXu wrote in response that the initial plan was to build advertising support but that “this turned out not to be easy”. The new plan, he continued, was to “build a community website that everyone can be proud of” that he anticipated would bring in more revenue than was then possible.\n\nVer responded by saying that ad space purchased by companies, naming Safello specifically, had never been deployed. In the same email, he recommended using Bitcoin.com in place of Oklink.com, which currently links to OKCoin’s Superwallet digital wallet service, and asked when the aforementioned plan would be be implemented.\n\nVer sent additional emails to OKCoin in March and April regarding both the development of the site as well as messages about late monthly payments. In early April, Liu suggested that payments be made to Ver in the form of US dollars instead of bitcoins.\n\nEntity questions\n\nAs part of its campaign to have the contract nullified, OKCoin is claiming the signed documents do not use its legal name.\n\nThe contract refers to Ver\'s counterparty as both \'OKCoin\' and \'OK coin\', but does not give the full name of the company\'s China and Singapore-registered entities, which are OKCoin Limited, OKCoin Co LTD, and OKCoin PTE LTD.\n\nThe company uses \'OKCoin\' as its brand name, with its registered company in mainland China handling the domestic market, and uses the Singapore-registered version for international business.\n\nLegal escalation\n\nOKCoin later introduced to the conversation its legal counsel, an individual named Yajun Li. Writing from an OKCoin.com address, Li initially requested correspondence in Chinese, despite the contract and related documents being in English.\n\nLi\'s subsequent tone led Ver\'s legal representative, Daniel Kelman, to question whether Li was actually a lawyer – or even a real person. Zhao added that the company had never had internal legal staff during his time of employment.\n\nWhile maintaining that the six months\' notice clause had not been in the contract Ver signed, Kelman said it was irrelevant as OKCoin had not provided six months notice that it wished to terminate the agreement.\n\nVer\'s team is claiming the contract, if continued over the five-year minimum term stipulated, is worth $550,000 and would be prepared to pursue that amount in damages.\n\nThe team is willing, however, to settle for $200,000.\n\nReddit battles\n\nSince OKCoin\'s blog post detailing its side of the argument, and Ver\'s release of the contract and email conversations, both sides have engaged in heated debates on social media.\n\nOKCoin has offered a $20,000 reward to ""anyone with authentication skills confirming that the digital and hardcopy of v8 are genuine and signed from December of 2014 by our former employee"".\n\nThe issue has even broadened to include other claims not directly related to the current contract dispute, with former OKCoin employees entering the fray to speak against their old company.\n\nImage via manaemedia/Shutterstock.com.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report inaccurately said OKCoin\'s bounty sought proof that the v8 document ""is the true and legal version of the document.""

Indeed, bitcoin relies on a P2P network of computers to proceed money transfers. Each part of the network works to create new bitcoins (‘mining’), keep the network alive and validate transactions.\n\nAll the transactions are registered in the blockchain that is used to validate a transaction using cryptography technology: it ensures that you can’t use a bitcoin you don’t own or you don’t use the same bitcoin more than once. This last action previously required a third party, but with bitcoin this is not the case anymore: the network replaces financial institutions and banks.\n\nThen, money transfers are almost in real time as the network is responsible for validating transactions. Currently you need only 10 minutes to get your money transfer approved.\n\nAs there is no third party the transfer is almost free. Miners are the only ones to be rewarded to issue new bitcoins. They also collect fees to integrate a new transaction into the blockchain, then validate a transfer. Currently a typical fee costs 0.0001 bitcoin (BTC) per transaction.\n\nThe remittance market is huge and moving swiftly to digital\n\nRemittance was a $582 billion market in 2014 according to the World Bank. Most of all it is dominated by transfers from developed countries to developing ones. In 2014, China received $64 billion through remittance and India $71 billion. Philippines received $25 billion, Mexico $22 billion, Nigeria $21 billion, Egypt $17 billion and Vietnam $11 billion in 2013.\n\nSo far most transactions are made through brick and mortar networks; in 2014 only 5% were digital transactions. These networks like Western Union or MoneyGram charge high fees to finance their deep local presence worldwide. A typical money transfer costs up to 10% fees.\n\nBut as mobile phones are spreading across the world, even in emerging countries, money transfers are shifting to digital. And mobile/digital remittance services are booming as they offer reduced fees mainly thanks to lower-fixed costs (maintaining a mobile app is much cheaper than operating a retail network).\n\nMost of the digital remittance operators claim they are at least 45% cheaper than physical networks. Some of these new companies are operating under a P2P model: connecting buyers and sellers to arrange currency exchanges.\n\nBitcoin allows several operating models\n\nEven through digital, remittance remains deeply dependent on third parties: banks are still validating money transfers from senders to the remittance operator and again to recipients.\n\nThen Bitcoin could even lower fees thanks to its decentralized network and through three different operating models that could be shaped:\n\nFull bitcoin: The sender owns bitcoins he sends to the recipient who can directly use them. This requires the owner to get bitcoin, which is easy in developed countries thanks to e-wallets and exchange platforms like Coinbase in the U.S. But it also requires the recipient either to be able to exchange them in fiat currency or to use bitcoins to pay for goods or services which is not that easy so far.\n\nThe sender owns bitcoins he sends to the recipient who can directly use them. This requires the owner to get bitcoin, which is easy in developed countries thanks to e-wallets and exchange platforms like Coinbase in the U.S. But it also requires the recipient either to be able to exchange them in fiat currency or to use bitcoins to pay for goods or services which is not that easy so far. From bitcoin to fiat currency: The sender have an easy access to bitcoins he sends to the remittance operator that sends fiat to the recipient. This model considers developing countries have an easy access to bitcoins wallets but paying with bitcoins is very limited especially in developing countries.\n\nThe sender have an easy access to bitcoins he sends to the remittance operator that sends fiat to the recipient. This model considers developing countries have an easy access to bitcoins wallets but paying with bitcoins is very limited especially in developing countries. From fiat currency to fiat currency: The sender pays its local money to the remittance operator that sends fiat to the recipient, using bitcoins to transfer money from one currency to another.\n\nA few startups are already operating on the bitcoin/remittance market\n\nEven at the early beginning this market has already attracted entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThough far from Transferwise, a mobile remittance company that has a valuation over $1 billion and uses a P2P model to facilitate easy money transfers and currency exchanges, BitPesa has recently raised $1.1 million to ease bitcoins transfer from the UK to Africa.\n\nAbra raised a seed round and launched its service a few weeks ago in San-Francisco to ease money transfers based both on P2P and bitcoin technologies.\n\nIn emerging countries, Rebit is developing its remittance service to send money to the Philippines through bitcoin, ArtaBit develops a service to Indonesia and Coincove to Latin America.\n\nRisks and threats\n\nWhereas bitcoin is an open-source technology, it has long been regulated and constrained by banks and states. Because it relies on a P2P network to operate, bitcoin is seen as a threat to financial markets and states. Based on a combination of public and private key the technology is seen as an anonymous way to transfer money then easing traffic and money whitening. Then, for instance China forbids Chinese’s financial institutions from handling bitcoin transactions.\n\nCompanies that are operating bitcoin transfers also need to get a regulation approval to operate in developed markets as financial institutions request every actor to confirm it operates under transparent processes.\n\nThe bitcoin currency has also been very volatile, as its value moved from a few dollars for 1BTC at inception to over $1,000 for 1BTC at the end of 2013 and is now around $230 for 1BTC. This is a threat for bitcoin/remittance operators as they need to be very quick at exchanging currencies to make sure they will not keep bitcoins for a too long time. Protecting against currency exchange rates is the main issue for these companies.\n\nSecurity is another issue for the Bitcoin industry as a few platforms have been hacked and bitcoin wallets have been closed making millions of BTC disappear without any counterpart for their owners. Then bitcoin/remittance companies need to ensure customers they will not lose the money they upload on their platforms.\n\nFinally, bitcoin technology has a lot of property to attract digital remittance operators, starting with its decentralized technology, and some money has been invested in this market as the remittance industry is quickly shifting to digital. Bitcoin also seems to have been introduced to manage remittance to developing countries thanks to it low-cost operating structure, especially as a lot of money is currently lost in fees along the remittance process.', 'SatoshiPoint is a company operating Bitcoin ATMs in multiple locations across the UK.

Share above, comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""The sudden death of John Nash, an icon of 20th century mathematics, has prompted speculation about his work on the concept of “money” and his possible role in the emergence of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Nobel prizewinner and his wife were killed in a taxi crash in New Jersey on Saturday.\n\nNash, who was 86, had had a distinguished career, perhaps more accurately defined as two career phases surrounding several decades battling mental illness. His breakthroughs in economics and mathematical theory are cited by many of his contemporaries as having changed the way of thinking in the field.\n\nFollowing his seemingly accidental death, the nature of which poignantly jars with his life spent in pursuit of logic and reason, cryptocurrency commentators are considering the implications of Nash’s work for decentralized money. Parallels between Nash’s work and the creation of Bitcoin are being made frequently, while some even suggest Nash could be Satoshi Nakamoto himself.\n\nRumors which began on Bitcointalk last year focus on Nash’s theory of “ideal money” as a mechanism for supporting the generation of a decentralized cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. Bitcoin, users suggest, accurately fits the profile for a solution to central governments’ conflicting goals for their fiat currencies.\n\nIt has also been contemplated that the timeline of Nash’s own career is apt to present him as the creator of Bitcoin itself. One Bitcointalk user writes that “he got over his schizophrenia in the mid 1970’s by diving into computers, game theory and devising a perfect decentralized currency called ‘Ideal Money.’”\n\nWhen asked directly about Bitcoin, however, Nash was less forthcoming. In a Q&A session following a speech at the Oxford Union debating society in Oxford, UK, Nash acknowledged the power behind Bitcoin, drawing in the roles of silver and gold over the ages, but did not consider its potential economic role in detail:\n\nIn what is perhaps a less savory reaction to Nash’s death, some Reddit members are accusing the National Security Agency, which tweeted about the event, of “foul play” and being otherwise implicated in the reportedly accidental crash.\n\n“You're a fool if you don't believe there was foul play involved,” one user commented, while another wrote that the news “doesn't seem suspicious at all.”"", 'It’s one of those things you think about, but never consider a reality. It’s one of those things people laugh at you for talking about in mixed company. It’s one of those things that shouldn’t be real in a free country, but is, and happens to the tune of millions of dollars per year in the United States. It is the untold side of the drug war which affects innocent people every week, and only occasionally makes the news.\n\nJust two cases will be mentioned in this article, but they are representative of a larger phenomenon which leads the author to a rather unpopular conclusion: keeping your money in Bitcoin is safer than keeping it in banks, is safer than keeping it in US dollars. Because in this country, at this point in history, the government can take your money just for having a certain amount of it, in one case, or just for depositing certain amounts of it, in another.\n\nSmall Businesses Unknowingly Making “Illegal Deposits”\n\nLyndon McLellan’s small business in Fairmount, North Carolina does well. For many in the area, it is the only convenient place to shop. For those of us that grew up in rural areas, such businesses are not hard to imagine. These businesses usually have a little of everything, and back before the Internet took over that particular business, they even did things like video and game rentals. Your alternative would have been to travel 20 or 30 miles to do some buy something you needed or wanted, making it financially more expensive no matter the price they were charging at the store.\n\nEarlier this year, McLellan made two deposits to his business account $11,400. It was not uncommon for him to deposit amounts totaling over $10,000, but rarely individually over that amount. There are surely people reading this who feel that is a lot of money, definitely more than one would have wanted to keep on hand.\n\nThe following day, he got a call from an employee. He ran down to his store, L&M Convenience, to find it swarming with federal and state authorities, who then informed him that they had seized his entire bank account, a balance of $107,702.66. The reason? Lyndon had unknowingly committed the crime of “structuring,” which basically means you’re making large deposits under $10,000 in hopes of avoiding detection. It was a strategy that was occasionally used by drug dealers in the days when they still wanted to use bank accounts.\n\nThe agents didn’t arrest him. They just let him know, searched the store for evidence of drug trafficking, and were on their way. Now, several months later, it looks like they’re going to give the money back, which studies show is a statistical rarity. Often the fight to get your funds back can drag on for years.\n\nA Young Man Has His Life Savings Seized for Carrying It in Cash\n\nJoseph Rivers was leaving his small town home in Michigan for the big city of LA. He wanted to be a music video producer, and he had saved his entire life for this purpose. His family had pitched in, and he had roughly $16,000 on him when he arrived at the Amtrak station in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nFederal agents boarded the train, as is common at that stop, searched his bag, and promptly seized his $16,000. They didn’t charge him with a crime, which is the fundamental problem with civil asset forfeiture laws. They don’t require the government to have a case against a person in order to seize their money and assets.\n\nSome would agree that a criminal’s money should be seized during the process of his prosecution. Although this is constitutionally a gray area, it is an extremely common practice which is meant to prevent bad guys from becoming rich bad guys. But almost no one would agree that seizing money simply because someone has it should be a thing that’s happening. That’s called theft if you just set aside the fact that the thieves are wearing government uniforms.\n\nPerhaps American exceptionalism keeps us from seeing that our government is as corrupt as any other, and vesting them with the authority to take our money without charging us with a crime is akin to asking them to take it from us.\n\nAlso read: How FBI Illegally Stole Ross Ulbricht’s Laptop & Brought Down The Silk Road\n\nBitcoin: Unseizable\n\nBoth Joseph Rivers and Lyndon McLellan, if they had done it properly, could have benefited from using Bitcoin. Rivers could have simply kept an encrypted wallet on a USB stick in his backpack instead of $16,000. McLellan could have used the cash to buy Bitcoin via LocalBitcoins or something similar, with at least some of the cash that wound up putting him on the radar of the federal agencies.\n\nAgain, this is probably an unpopular opinion. Things like volatility will be brought up. But let’s be clear: if they had done this, and if they had protected the funds properly once in the digital cash, they’d still have them, maybe more than they invested. For Rivers it would have just been for the duration of his trip.\n\nMcLellan might have still come up on their radar. It seems that doing well, and doing so in cash (cash is definitely still king in rural areas), is going to get you in trouble under the current state of affairs. Luckily some representatives have decided that enough is enough. The constitution does not permit unlawful search and seizure, no matter what the courts have ruled over the years. The constitution very simply prohibits such activities, saying:\n\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\nThat’s the fourth amendment, but Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Senator Angus King of Maine are more concerned about the fifth amendment, titling their legislation to respond to this phenomenon “The Fifth Amendment Restoration Act.” The fifth amendment states:\n\nNo person shall […] be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n\nThe synopsis of the representatives’ bill states:\n\nFifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act of 2014 or the FAIR Act – Amends the federal criminal code to increase the federal government’s burden of proof in civil forfeiture proceedings to clear and convincing evidence. Requires the government, in addition to showing a substantial connection between the seized property and the offense in a forfeiture proceeding, to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the owner of any interest in the seized property intentionally used the property in connection with the offense or knowingly consented or was willfully blind to the use of the property by another in connection with the offense.\n\nSenator King is the former governor of the only state to receive an “A” grade on civil asset forfeiture, the State of Maine. This grading system correlated data from all over the country and graded the states according to criteria which included “profit motive” and the burden of proof the states imposed on themselves in order to keep the money. In the case of an “A” grade, the state would have to have proof beyond a reasonable doubt and had 0-5% profit motivation in their ultimate decision.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is by no means a safe investment, keeping one’s funds in it appears to be safer than even keeping it in a bank. “Be your own bank” is one motto often used in the community. Clearly a change in the laws would be preferable to folks having to resort to using Bitcoin simply to keep their money from being stolen by overzealous government agents, but it is important to note that even doing so could still get your bitcoins seized if done wrong. The case of Ross Ulbricht shows that the government is more than willing to take your money if it’s in Bitcoin, but if Ross had properly secured his wallet, the government might still be trying to get access to it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Against all the critical expectations, Bitcoin is growing — and is promising to revolutionize some of the biggest, well-settled banking infrastructures with its indisputably advanced blockchain technology. But according to an accomplished IT scholar, there is still a scope of improvement in the digital currency.\n\nJohn Carroll, a Distinguished Professor of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University, believes that Bitcoin will lose its shine in future, if there be any additional improvements in other alternative digital currencies, or altcoins. His comments are derived from a scenario where Bitcoin will be the victim of some “pioneer’s penalty” if it fails to add anything more to the table. In simple words, who will use an acoustic string telephone when he could access a mobile phone.\n\nThe arrival of some feature-rich digital currencies, on the other hand, does support Carroll’s futuristic theories. At one point, we have Ripple — a payment protocol and a value-carrying token — that is known to be harnessing the most from the Bitcoin technology. At another, we have Dash (formerly known as Darkcoin), which is leaving no-stone-unturned in bringing out a consensus-based decentralized governance model for the entire cryptocurrency community.\n\nProfessor Carroll secretly refers these innovative altcoins to surpass, or even replace, the mightier Bitcoin. At first, the formers have the courage to experiment endlessly, given the small size of their communities. And as it seems, they are in the right direction to make a name for themselves. Bitcoin community, on the other hand, is still fighting over their chief developer’s decision to increase the block size. The lack of consensus and governance is accurately visible. It could certainly impact the currency’s growth in future, if not addressed properly.\n\n“Bitcoin didn’t do everything right,” Carroll further states. “I don’t know whether becoming the currency of choice for murder-for-hire and drug deals helped them much. But it’s often the case that those early pioneers make missteps that are corrected by succeeding initiatives, which may be what will happen here.”', 'What follows is what you might call educated speculation. What we do know is that there are a lot of people, especially in the mining business, who’d have an interest in seeing the premiere Bitcoin forum, Bitcointalk, bite the dust.\n\nBitcointalk is a haven for free speech regarding Bitcoin and issues surrounding it. Support for figures like Ross Ulbricht and criticism of scam artists like Josh Garza are not uncommon within its pages. It is decidedly an arbiter of taste for the Bitcoin community, and to this day the number one place to make complaints. Recently it was issued a subpoena for matters surrounding the Butterfly Labs scandal, and it complied in the most limited way possible.\n\nWhile the Reddit community also serves a segment, posts do not live forever on Reddit, with most people never getting past the first page. Reddit and Simple Machines Forum are fundamentally different platforms, something that was very intentional on the part of the designers of Reddit. Therefore the two have managed to co-exist in harmony, with links from the Bitcoin subreddit being posted occasionally to the Bitcointalk forum and vice versa.\n\nZipkin Implicated\n\nLast August, CCN writer Rick Mac Gillis reported on a tip CCN received from part-time security researcher Tony Serrata about the doings of Joshua Zipkin, CEO of once-relevant AMT Miners. Serrata provided us with evidence then, and more recently, of Zipkin attempting to hire him to hack Bitcointalk. Serrata says of his involvement with Advanced Mining Technology, Inc.:\n\nBased on what I was seeing happen with AMT and also various mining companies with massive delays and stalling tactics, I wanted to pitch in to see what I could do to speed up the delivery of miners to not just myself but for all of us AMT customers waiting. I have the skills to pitch in. I just volunteered my time to assist in this effort. In the end it was just more games from Joshua Zipkin of AMT to run off with everyone’s money. My goal was just to get us all our stuff, nothing more.\n\n[…] Zipkin kept playing stall tactics and, in the end, shipped everyone broken miners. Anyone who got something, got it broken. […] I got two miners that were basically useless. $11,000 for 2TH/s that didn’t even work. […] He went to Dragon Miner and had them ship people more broken miners. […] So anyone who got replacements got defective miners that did not hash as advertised. Not even close.\n\n[…] This is actually what fueled all the talk on Bitcointalk, and is why Zipkin wanted Bitcointalk to disappear, and tried to hire me to make that happen.\n\nThe Evidence\n\nThe following is some of the Skype transcript provided to CCN. The user “Opeium2” is Serrata, whereas “Joshua” is Joshua Zipkin.\n\n[6/9/2014 8:36:34 PM] Joshua: eventually we’ll hack the forum completely\n\n[6/9/2014 8:36:42 PM] Joshua: its a mission. :)\n\n[6/9/2014 8:36:44 PM] Opeium2: Probably better to build something better\n\n[…] [6/9/2014 8:37:29 PM] Opeium2: Build the site and draw in respected vendors FIRST\n\n[6/9/2014 8:37:32 PM] Joshua: and then take the forum down and pay the $1200 a month for the\n\ndedicated forum moderator to do it right\n\n[6/9/2014 8:37:44 PM] Opeium2: I already have a plan for it.\n\n[…] [6/9/2014 8:45:40 PM] Joshua: its effects life.. like I walked into wellsfargo the other day, because several clients bitched to TD and they closed our account, and the wells fargo rep went through the whole application and bla bla and everything was fine. right before i left he was like “i just did a google search and.. well we dont associate with crypto currency related companies.. etc”\n\n[6/13/2014 11:19:39 PM] Joshua: Opeium2 ill give you 5k to hack bct\n\n[6/13/2014 11:20:10 PM] Opeium2: lol nah. Not my bag. Seriously not even worth the time or\n\neffort.\n\n[6/13/2014 11:20:25 PM] Opeium2: It wont do any good\n\n[6/13/2014 11:20:29 PM] Joshua: omg it will\n\n[6/13/2014 11:20:38 PM] Joshua: that place is just trash\n\nClear Intent\n\nIt is clear from this transcript that “it’s a mission,” a top priority, of Joshua Zipkin to eliminate Bitcointalk from the Internet. He is not the first mining magnate to feel this way, but perhaps the first to express such clear, obvious intentions of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Josh Garza had similar feelings, and invested significant sums of money into paying people to speak well of GAW miners on Bitcointalk. However, Garza had the decency to found his own forum, HashTalk.\n\nAll of the elements of a serious crime are here apparent: means (while Serrata is a “white hat” who will not engage in unethical hacking, there are many more out there who would take BCT down for money), motive (bad PR was having an effect on Zipkin’s life), and opportunity (Bitcointalk is currently hosted by a third-party, who was tricked into giving the attacker access.)\n\nThis last part is the most cunning. There was no high-level hacking going on, no brute force attack the administrators could have detected. The attack that was so coveted by Joshua Zipkin and others over the years (Bitcointalk was founded in 2011) was executed with the oldest, hardest-to-fix hack in the book: social engineering. In the words of Michael Marquardt, also known to Bitcointalk users as Theymos:\n\nThe forum’s ISP NFOrce managed to get tricked into giving an attacker access to the server […] you should act as though your password hashes, PMs, emails, etc. were compromised. The forum will probably be down for 36-60 hours for analysis and reinstall.\n\nThere are other suspects, surely. Butterfly Labs came to many people’s minds, with one Reddit user saying, in response to this Bitcoin subreddit post:\n\nIn order to get paid from Sonny Vleisides, Josh Zerlan and Jeff Ownby this scumbag attacks the forum.\n\nAt present, Bitcointalk has given no indication of who it suspects of having compromised its server. Most likely it is more concerned with getting it back online, securely. Hopefully the long-awaited replacement to Simple Machines Forum, epochtalk, will eliminate the possibility of such a hack happening again. Although, even if you had an impenetrable database, this attack could be repeated with another social engineering attack. Thus, it seems that not only will Bitcointalk in the future have to use its own, custom-built forum software, but also its own servers.\n\nThe author was unable to reach Joshua Zipkin for comment in time for this article.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbf2bQcByQE\n\nAdditionally, AMTMiners.com is presently resolving to a GoDaddy squatting page, indicating the company has either not paid for hosting or done anything with its domain recently. An archived version was available, though.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'John Forbes Nash Jr., the Princeton University mathematician who inspired the film “A Beautiful Mind,” and his wife died in a New Jersey car crash Saturday.\n\nNash, 86, and his wife Alicia Nash, 82, were passengers in a taxi near Monroe Township when the incident took place. The car crashed into a guard rail, and the couple, who were not wearing seat belts at the time, were thrown from the vehicle, and later pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nNash is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, known mostly for his work in game theory, as well his personal struggle with paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nHis life was brought to the big screen in 2001 Oscar-winning film “A Beautiful Mind,” starring Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, which portrayed John’s mental illness and the accomplishments which earned him the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics.\n\n“We are stunned and saddened by news of the untimely passing of John Nash and his wife and great champion, Alicia.

Eisgruber said.\n\n“John’s remarkable achievements inspired generations of mathematicians, economists and scientists who were influenced by his brilliant, groundbreaking work in game theory, and the story of his life with Alicia moved millions of readers and moviegoers who marveled at their courage in the face of daunting challenges,” Eisgruber added.\n\nBorn in 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia, Nash began showing signs of math talent in elementary school, eventually winning a full scholarship to the Carnegie Institute of Technology.\n\nNash received his doctorate from Princeton in 1950 based on a dissertation on the fields of mathematics and economics.\n\nNash was a critic of the economic system.\n\n“Good money,” Nash once argued, is money that is expected to maintain its value over time. “Bad money” is expected to lose value over time, as under conditions of inflation.\n\nNash was in particularly distrustful of a world currency administered by the current global structures.\n\n“In practice, I’m a little distrustful of the politicians at the level of the United Nations and elsewhere,” who would be in charge of managing a world currency.\n\nHe greatly disliked Keynesian economics:\n\nThe Keynesians implicitly always have the argument that some good managers can do things of beneficial value, operating with the treasury and the central bank…I see this as analogous how the Bolshevik Communists were claiming to proved something much better than the Bourgeois democracy.\n\nFurther critiquing the ideology:\n\n…while they have claimed to be operating for high and noble objective of general welfare what is clearly true is that they have made it easier for government to print money.\n\nIn conclusion, he writes:\n\nAnd this parallel makes it seem not implausible that a process of political evolution might lead to the expectation on the part of the citizens in the great democracies that they should be better situated to be able to understand whatever will be the monetary polices which, indeed, are typically of great importance to citizens who may have alternative options for where to place their savings.\n\nMany Bitcoiners have submitted that, were it not for Nash’s contributions to math, economics, and other disciplines, then Bitcoin might never have been designed. Some even believe he is Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As previously reported, OKCoin has announced that the company will no longer be managing the domain bitcoin.com, due to a dispute with the domain owner, Roger Ver.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CoinTelegraph, Ver discusses the dispute with OKcoin in detail, provides evidence of fraud and issues his own million dollar bounty.\n\nCoinTelegraph: First, can you give us a brief overview of the events that have transpired with relation to the management of bitcoin.com and OKcoin?\n\nRoger Ver: The full details can be found by reading the long, but juicy email chain between myself and OKcoin:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DabzS\n\nAll the evidence for the proof of the forgery can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/wgmz9ofhq8kymhs/AADOd0QGEL8RvnKoeCKtPBKna?dl=0\n\nCT: Why did you decide to go public?\n\nRV: I didn’t decide to go public.

They have been caught red handed by the laws of math.\n\nCT: After three months of delayed payments with unreasonable excuses, why did you not end the contract? Wasn’t there an option to do so with a 30-day notice?\n\nRV: I was exploring other options, but wanted to have something else lined up before canceling. In my ideal world, OKcoin would have done what they promised, and built a useful website for the Bitcoin community. Instead, they stopped following the spirit of the contract as soon as they received all the initial positive press attention for becoming responsible for the domain.\n\nCT: Did Okcoin request to send the money to another entity on your behalf, and do you have evidence of this? (OKcoin has said: “No payment was ever made, attempted, nor intended to a counterparty other than Mr. Ver in the course of OKCoin’s management of bitcoin.com.”)\n\nRV: Yes, here is a screen shot of the email in question. The full email chain can be found at: https://imgur.com/a/DabzS\n\nCT: Under the V7 contract, how much money are you owed by OKcoin right now?\n\nRV: OK coin is past due on about $US20K and owes a minimum of US$550K more for the life of the contract.\n\nCT: Do you have any evidence to back up your claim that OKcoin is insolvent?\n\nRV: I’ve never claimed that OKcoin is insolvent.\n\nI did say that I can’t think of another reason why they would be willing to forge documents in order to get out of a $10K a month obligation. A former employee, Changpeng, has come out and accused OKcoin of still owing him US$40K in wages.\n\nAnother person contacted me privately and said that OKcoin stiffed him for US$2,000 of a US$5,000 sponsorship deal. Another person on Reddit accused OKcoin of rigging a contest so they didn’t actually have to pay out the prize money.\n\nCT: How will this dispute be settled? Will this matter go to court?\n\nRV: I don’t know. Ideally, OKcoin will do the right thing and honor their contract.\n\nAnother crazy thing is that even if the forged contract from OKcoin were the real one, they are still breaching it. According to the fake contract, they have to give me six months notice to cancel, but in reality, they took the website offline without even notifying me.\n\nCT: In the future, should the blockchain (smart contracts) be used to prevent such disputes from occurring?\n\nRV: I look forward to that day. Even with this situation, PGP signatures have proven beyond all doubt that OKcoin forged my signature onto a fake contract.\n\n*****\n\nVer also told us that he has requested OKcoin’s lawyer’s contact information “nearly a dozen times now.

05/26/2015,"['Will that be debit or Bitcoin?\n\nA British Columbia university has started accepting the digital currency Bitcoin at all of its bookstores, allowing customers to open their mobile wallets in what\'s believed to be a first for post-secondary institutions in Canada.\n\nSimon Fraser University has also installed automated Bitcoin vending machines on its campuses in Burnaby, Vancouver and Surrey.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n""It is still a very new, techie kind of subject and it takes – I think, for the average person – a lot of time to be able to understand it and be comfortable using it,"" said Michael Yeung, who founded the SFU Bitcoin Club that spearheaded the venture.\n\n""The way we\'ve integrated it at the bookstore, allowing you to quickly buy bitcoins under 10 seconds and spend it under 10 seconds, makes it a lot easier.""\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency that is transferred online without the help or regulation of any central bank. Students can either load up their mobile wallets apps by exchanging Canadian cash at the new vending machines or pay with bitcoins they already have.\n\nThey\'re able to buy everything sold at the store, ranging from textbooks to T-shirts and mugs.\n\nThe university broke new ground last year when it became Canada\'s first post-secondary institution to accept Bitcoin donations.\n\nBut Simon Fraser won\'t be amassing piles of the alternative currency – and that\'s how it mitigates any risk.\n\nAs soon as the bookstore receives bitcoins, it\'s channelled directly to a U.S. payment processor that exchanges it for Canadian dollars.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe global processor, called BitPay, is used by many major merchandisers including Microsoft, Expedia and Richard Branson\'s Virgin Galactic, which accepts Bitcoin as payment for space flights.\n\n""People might say, \'This is not money,\'"" said Yeung, a third-year student planning to major in business administration.\n\nBut studying the history of economics and bartering shows many currencies used in previous centuries originated out of community agreement, he said.\n\n""They don\'t have to use it if they don\'t want to use it. But if they use it, it\'s kind of like using gold coins or silver bullion.""\n\nMark McLaughlin, the university\'s executive director of ancillary services, said the school is providing a first-hand learning experience.\n\n""It is our mission to challenge and engage students and provide them with learning opportunities not only inside the classroom but also outside,"" he said in a news release.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSimon Fraser has one of the most active Bitcoin student clubs in the continent. Its members spent the past year encouraging the school to introduce the currency, and they conducted a series of tests before opening for business, said Yeung.\n\nHe likened the shift to the early days of the Internet.\n\n""There were students on campuses around the world getting into it. It was not predictable where it was going to go,"" he said.\n\n""It may not necessarily mean that Bitcoin is the end all, be all of electronic money or the future of currency, but it is a step forward for exploration and learning.""', '', 'Market Thoughts\n\nWe have seen two big headlines rock the crypto-world this week, yet the price hardly budged. This can most likely be seen as positive, but let’s briefly explore these events.\n\nOn May 22 it was announced that one of the most popular exchanges, Bitfinex, had its hot wallet hacked. This is of course is an unfortunate situation, and it clearly show that security in the crypto-world still has miles to go. If, as they claim, only 0.5% of the bitcoins were taken it is not big financial hit, but it is still a confidence hit. In the long run this may prove to be a positive as we need to weed out the week elements of the ecosystem, and replace them with stronger more competent alternatives, which the free market is pretty good at when given the chance. As is usually the advice provided by this analyst, you should only let third parties hold bitcoins you are willing to lose, or have confiscated by Governments. So anyone who is holding more than say 10% of their bitcoins at any exchange, including Bitfinex, only have themselves to blame if things end badly.\n\nAnother piece of news that seems to be dominating the headlines and chat groups is the dispute between one of China’s biggest exchanges OKCoin and Roger Ver, over the website Bitcoin.com. Without going into the details, it seems like OKCoin is doing everything it can to get out of a contract, which is unfortunate and is not reflecting kindly on the organization. As an analyst who is friends with Roger Ver and several former employees of OKCoin, my personal opinion as a trader is to not have any bitcoins at risk at OKCoin. Everyone is free to do as they like, but in this world of self regulation all you have to go on is confidence and character.\n\nAs Martin Armstrong constantly points out, markets are as much about confidence and character as they are about financial health. The relevant quote is above, but the entire testimony can be found here.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nThe technical picture hardly budged on this news, and this stable price might be good for commerce. For traders it is holding in energy, waiting for a big move.\n\nThe Symmetric Triangle that has just been added is not perfect, but it is something a trader must consider. While it is true that this type of pattern tends to have a 50/50 chance of breaking out or break down, in this case we would be slightly leaning for a break down. The reason for this is that it is forming at the end of a very long down trend, and the previous big move was also to the downside. Other than technicals, the general sentiment around Bitcoin is a little week as my recent travels around Asia have shown. Bitcoin does have a bright future, but at the moment the likelihood of one more down move is very high. The bullish side of the move will only be considered upon new highs over $250.\n\nAs for the zoomed in picture, it is really a thing of beauty. Very rarely do you take a snapshot at absolute neutrality. Both the RSI and MACD are dead center, at 50 and 0 respectively, and the price is sitting just $2 above the 50-Day Simple Moving Average, which is on the verge of flattening out. The last time a similar snapshot could have been taken was around Dec. 3, 2014. The movement prior to that was completely different, and the 6 week period that followed was a $200 drop in price from $365 to $165. This type of move is of course not expected right now, but if entertained on a percentage basis, it would put us around $100.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSpending some time with the Bitcoin communities in Thailand and Malaysia, it is even more clear to me that the next rise in price will be lead by developed regions like Europe and the West. It is really hard to see a sub-sector like remittance being the driver. Keep an eye on the Greece default as the bills are due on June 6, and perhaps it will lead to some capital flight via bitcoin, out of that economically dead region caused by insane policies.\n\nThis article was completed on Tuesday May 26 3:00 am ET, when BraveNewCoins Index showed Bitcoin price at $238 USD.\n\nTone Vays will be a speaker at the upcoming Inside Bitcoins Chicago Conference July 10-11.\n\nDisclaimer: The price projections above are just the opinions of one trader. It is meant as a guide, or fresh look, to supplement the reader’s personal views on bitcoin. Trading in general (but especially Bitcoin) is incredibly risky and should only be done with capital one can afford to lose. The Author is a trader and does take on small position in the manner suggested in the article.', 'Bitcoin’s open-source digital currency was designed to disrupt and cut out the manipulative architecture of central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve. Originally, Bitcoin transactions went through a third party. But the virtual currency has evolved to eliminate all of the fees charged by third party financial institutions and banks. That explains why Bitcoin, with virtually free foreign transactions, is about to become a killer app in the $1 trillion remittance market.\n\nThrough a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers, Bitcoin currency is created as rewards to “miners” for providing the computing power to solve difficult math problems to maintain the “blockchain” of Internet transactions that validate the currency. To prevent fraud and theft, Bitcoin uses cryptographic technology. But unlike online credit cards and “PayPal” type systems that allow buyers to claim their money back, Bitcoin permanently transfers value.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSince there are only 21 million Bitcoins that may ever be “mined,” Bitcoins have become rare units of exchange and have appreciated by 2,000%. The over 39,000 retailers that accept Bitcoin payments include majors such as Amazon, Overstock.com, Target, CVS, Subway and Victoria’s Secret. With about 115,000 transactions a day, Bitcoin is creating a powerful competitor to the U.S. Congress and the Fed’s ability to employ inflation as a “stealth tax” to extrapolate wealth.\n\nBy cutting-out third-party central banks and financial institutions, Bitcoin transaction costs are almost free. “Miners” collect fees to integrate a new transaction into the blockchain, and then validate transfers. The current fee is 0.0001 bitcoin per transfer, and the time to complete wealth transfer is about 10 minutes. That compares favorable to credit cards that issue pending exchanges that may take a day to complete, or money transfer services like Western Union that take a big fee to “vouch” for the money transferred.\n\nRemittances come from cash transfers back home by some of the more than 250 million people living outside their countries of origin, and the 750 million that live outside their ancestral communities. The remittance market was $583 billion in 2014 and could reach $1 trillion by 2020, according to the World Bank.\n\nEvery country on earth receives remittances. The largest markets were India at $71 billion; China at $64 billion; Philippines at $25 billion; Mexico at $22 billion; Nigeria at $21 billion; Egypt at $17 billion; and Vietnam at $11 billion.\n\nOnly 5 percent of remittance transactions were digital. The other 95 percent were through traditional brick-and-mortar networks such as Western Union and MoneyGram. Brick-and-mortar remitters charge about 10 percent fees to maintain their “deep local presence” worldwide.\n\nAbout 80 percent of people on earth now have access to mobile phones, versus only about 60 percent that have access to working toilets, according to the UN. Increasingly, those mobile phones are being upgraded to smartphones with Internet access with penetration rates of 25 percent in India and 45 percent in China.\n\nThis revolution of access has powered a boom in digital remittance services that, by cutting-out local infrastructure, can undercut fees charged by retail brick-and-mortar incumbents.\n\nBut most of these new digital remittance services still rely on a third party bank to validate money exchanges. With about $50 billion being raked off each year in service fees, Bitcoin’s P2P decentralized network offers an opportunity for direct cash transfers to recipients–and from Bitcoin to the pre-paid digital debit cards of Google or Apple Pay.\n\nStart-ups focused on Bitcoin remittances include BitPesa, which just received $1.1 million in VC funding to ease Bitcoin transfers from the UK to Africa; Rebit, which is developing bitcoin remittances to the Philippines; ArtaBit, for remittances to Indonesia; and Coincove, serving Latin America.\n\nBitcoin’s P2P potential success at cutting out central banks and financial institutions is sure to create opposition. China already forbids Chinese financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe main argument by brick-and-mortar competitors is the lack of security from bitcoin being hacked. But with a huge cost advantage, over time many nations will be forced to come to terms with Bitcoin as a disruptive event for remittances.', 'On May 11, the leading stock exchange Nasdaq announced that it would begin experimenting with the blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal reported that Nasdaq will start with a pilot project in Nasdaq Private Market, a recently launched marketplace that handles pre-IPO trading among private companies.\n\n“Utilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,” said Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld in the announcement. Speaking with The Financial Times, Greifeld noted that he wants Nasdaq to be “a leader in the field.” He added that the network could potentially revolutionize the time it takes to finalize deals on U.S. securities markets.\n\n“I am a big believer in the ability of blockchain technology to effect fundamental change in the infrastructure of the financial services industry,” said Greifeld. “Clearinghouses are a wonderful invention, but if you have a public ledger that is trusted, you can evolve back to a bilateral (trading) world but proceed with instantaneous settlement. We currently settle at T+3 [within 3 days]. Why not settle in 5-10 minutes?”\n\nThe Financial Times notes that shortening settlement times for trading could reduce the risk that counterparties would not be paid, while also cutting the amount of collateral, or insurance, used to back trades. For the Nasdaq Private Market, using the blockchain means transforming the recording of transactions from paper certificates and spreadsheets to an audited record of the lineage of ownership of private securities.\n\nThe Financial Times’ article includes a video with explanations about Bitcoin and the blockchain. The video notes that everyone from banks to stock exchanges and Silicon Valley technologists are starting to make bets on Bitcoin companies.\n\nDavid Birch, Director of Consult Hyperion, a specialist electronic transactions consulting firm that advises governments and large companies on electronic identity and electronic money, believes that the real value of Bitcoin is independent of the highly volatile exchange rate of the bitcoin currency.\n\n“I think when you see people investing in Bitcoin, it sounds like they are investing in the currency,” Birch says in The Financial Times video. “But I think you’ll find they are not really. The institutional money that is going in, is going into the underlying technology, not the payment instrument itself. So, investing in Bitcoin doesn’t really mean investing in bitcoin. It means investing in what they call the blockchain technology, which is the new technology that sits underneath Bitcoin.”\n\nBirch acknowledges the importance of bitcoin price as a means to incentivize end-users to participate in keeping the Bitcoin blockchain going, but he is persuaded that “in the long run, that is unsustainable.” He notes that the Bitcoin blockchain is not the only blockchain, but there are other blockchains and other ways of incentivizing people to maintain blockchains.\n\nIt appears that Birch agrees with the growing persuasion, in the financial and regulatory sectors, that the promising blockchain technology will eventually have to be adapted to non-Bitcoin blockchains with different features, more appealing to the financial mainstream. In a recent research paper titled “One Bank Research Agenda,” the Bank of England called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank’s ability to control its currency.\n\nNasdaq isn’t planning to develop an alternative blockchain. Rather, it plans to leverage the colored coin protocol Open Assets, which works on the original Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nPhoto bifshadow / Flickr', 'Image: Ken Shirriff\n\nIt long ago stopped being profitable (or even feasible) to mine Bitcoin on consumer-level hardware. So why not try it out on a computer primarily used by forward-thinking universities—an IBM mainframe that runs on assembly punchcards from the 1960s—to see whether or not it can compete with today\'s dedicated mining machines?\n\nKen Shirriff, a computer engineer, blogger, and retro hardware enthusiast, decided to find out. It ended as you might expect. The Computer History Museum\'s mainframe was indeed able to solve Bitcoin hashes—a series of math problems that are used to verify other users\' Bitcoin transactions—but it did so at impossibly slow rates.\n\n""While modern hardware can compute billions of hashes per second, the 1401 takes 80 seconds to compute a single hash,"" Shirriff wrote. ""It would take more than the lifetime of the universe to successfully mine a block.""\n\nIt looks like the IBM 1401 would be slightly more efficient than mining Bitcoin by hand. In practical terms, none of those mining techniques make any damn sense.\n\nThe people successfully mining Bitcoin today use dedicated processors that usually run very hot and suck up lots of energy, which is why some of the largest mining operations are in China, where power costs are low, or in places near the Arctic Circle, where processors can be cooled naturally.\n\nStill, we\'re suckers for weird old tech, and the mining on an IBM 1401 is certainly weird. It was one of the first ""affordable"" computers, costing about $2,500 a month to lease.\n\n""The IBM 1401 didn\'t use silicon chips,"" Shirriff wrote. ""In fact it didn\'t even use silicon. Its transistors were built out of a semiconductor called germanium, which was used before silicon took over.""\n\nThe 1401 also does not compute in 8-bit bytes like modern computers. Instead it uses 6-bit characters, which make it particularly bad at implementing the algorithm used in Bitcoin mining, known as SHA-256 (which operates in 256-bit chunks; 256 is divisible by 8, it is not divisible by 6).\n\n""The IBM 1401 is almost the worst machine you could pick to implement the SHA-256 hash algorithm,"" Shirriff wrote. ""The algorithm is designed to be implemented efficiently on machines that can do bit operations on 32-bit words. Unfortunately, the IBM 1401 doesn\'t have 32-bit words or even bytes.""\n\nIn any case, he wrote out code for running the algorithm on 85 executable assembly punch cards, put the cards into the computer (manually), and fired her up. It started solving an old hash from a successfully mined block of Bitcoin—very, very slowly.\n\n""To mine a block at current difficulty, the IBM 1401 would take about 5x10^14 years (about 40,000 times the current age of the universe). The electricity would cost about 10^18 dollars. And you\'d get 25 bitcoins worth about $6000,"" he wrote. ""Performance was worse than I expected.""\n\nIf you\'re interested in what assembly code to mine Bitcoin looks like, here\'s a snippet of his code:\n\njob bitcoin * SHA-256 hash * Ken Shirriff http://righto.com ctl 6641 org 087 X1 dcw @000@ org 092 X2 dcw @000@ org 097 X3 dcw @000@ org 333 start cs 299 r sw 001 lca 064, input0 mcw 064, 264 w * Initialize word marks on storage mcw +s0, x3 wmloop sw 0&x3 ma @032@, x3 c +h7+32, x3 bu wmloop mcw +input-127, x3 * Put input into warr[0] to warr[15] mcw +warr, x1 mcw @128@, tobinc b tobin\n\nThe full source is here.', 'A new anonymous Bitcoin wallet has entered the crypto universe. It’s called Samourai wallet, and its main focus is security and privacy. The developers of the wallet, who have been in the digital currency environment since its inception, call themselves the “samourais."" Their idea is to create a wallet with many never-before-seen features, and to make it the mobile counterpart to Darkwallet.\n\nDevelopment of Darkwallet, headed off by Cody Wilson and Amir Taaki, has been delayed recently. The code is open source, the product is still unstable, it relies on the Google Chrome browser, and developers have yet to offer a mobile version.

The Samourais explained:\n\n“We are excited about Bitcoin and share Satoshi’s vision of what Bitcoin will achieve. Unfortunately we have seen a disturbing trend in the Bitcoin world.

We want to help build the tools that support Satoshis vision, the tools that always keep the user in control of their money, the tools that don’t ask for permission, the tools that operate outside of the machine.”\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe Samourai wallet is currently only available for Android users. It has many different features that set it apart from other options. The wallet enforces a BIP 39 passphrase on creation. It uses military grade AES-256 encryption. The PIN code and a secret GUID is stored locally in a secure space on a device. It then queries the Bitcoin network, and asks for the unspent outputs for the addresses in the user\'s wallet.\n\nThe private keys are never communicated with the outside world. Another unique feature allows you erase the wallet or retrieve your HD seed off your phone from a remote location. The team has implemented other custom features, such as a LocalBitcoins price ticker. Meanwhile, the Samourai anonymization feature uses tricks with inputs and outputs of your own wallet that create transactions on the blockchain designed to confuse outsiders.\n\nAlpha version 3.0 will be the last, and they Samourais say it is the “most exciting” release they have planned. It will introduce a mobile coin-shuffling feature, allowing you to chop up and shuffle coins right from your phone. The protocol is a trustless system, never using any third parties or servers. With stealth mode enabled, Samourai will hide itself from the Android display, mute all notifications, and remain hidden from the recent apps drawer.\n\nThe next major release will contain more fundamental privacy features like Tor and VPN support, a PIN screen that actively works to thwart spyware and keyloggers, and more UI enhancements. They said:\n\n“We are actively looking at Tor support. VPN and Tor are not mutually exclusive and many users are not Tor-savvy but do know a bit more about VPN. Just as our remote commands are optional, we are working on network anonymity solutions that will appeal to a wide range.”\n\nThe samourai devs also hinted at a “top secret” development they think users are going to love and it should also be another first for a mobile bitcoin wallet, though they aren’t ready to reveal it yet.\n\nDarkwallet still has certain features that Samourai doesn’t. For example, the coin-shuffling feature, a desktop client, and an open-source code viewable by the public. These features propelled the wallet to the number one spot in the recent Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP) review.\n\nBut while Samourai is being developed, its features will be rolled out slowly and in a staggered manner. The developers’ managed release allows the wallet to develop quickly and stick to timelines, something that Darkwallet hasn’t been so successful at. As for direct competition in the wallet arena, the developers say they are determined to be included in the next OBPP report. “We’ll let the experts decide just where we rank,” they said.\n\nSentinel\n\nThis week, CoinTelegraph was the first to hear about their new product, a stand-alone app called Sentinel. It is a read-only bitcoin wallet designed to track balances and transactions, and create new receive addresses for cold-storage HD wallets.\n\nSentinel, the creators say, doesn’t save your identity or your private keys. You simply scan an XPUB and Sentinel will keep watch. You can download the app from the Google Play store.\n\nThe Samourai wallet is still undergoing rigorous testing with help from their private Google+ group. The developers have not opened their source code yet and they say they will do so once they “conclude closed beta.” In the meantime, they remain focused on their overall mission, as they describe on their website:\n\n""We are privacy activists who have dedicated our lives to creating the software that Silicon Valley will never build, the regulators will never allow, and the VCs will never invest in. We build the software that Bitcoin deserves.""\n\nIn the short term, they want to be the best bitcoin wallet on the market, offering the most privacy and anonymity to transacting. In the long term, the goal is to be the one-stop shop with mainstream appeal. The Samourai wallet aims to be a counterweight to the well-funded but privacy-poor services that they believe dominate the current landscape.', 'For many, faucets are their very first interaction with Bitcoin.\n\nLead developer Gavin Andresen was the originator of the idea, and until late 2012 his site was giving away whole bitcoins in some cases. Look at this transaction, for example. In today’s value, 18 BTC is worth over $4,000. Not too shabby. If you’re interested, here is a list of some of the last payouts Gavin’s faucet gave.\n\nSince then, and even as the price of a Bitcoin has soared into the hundreds of dollars, faucets have grown into an industry all their own. Some are themed, others are simple, and far too many are either broken (never pay out) or advertise for obvious scams, like the April Coin Ponzi. There are hundreds of Bitcoin faucets at the moment, and new ones coming online every month. In this crowded field, an entrepreneur has to do a lot to be unique. Modern faucets require a certain amount of advertising revenue to be profitable. Believe it or not, it is a model that can work. To stand out, they have to do something that no one else is doing. Most don’t care about standing out; it should be mentioned. Most are content with whatever traffic they get, confident that if it all goes wrong they can simply not make the payouts.\n\nOne such unique faucet caught this writer’s eye recently, PaidBooks.com. This site allows you to earn a small amount of Bitcoin for reading classic books on the site. Every ten minutes, it pays into your balance, and at the end of the week, your balance is sent to your Bitcoin wallet. This is unique in the faucet space, and so CCN decided to get UK-based Daniel D’Alien (who will be coming out with his real identity before too many months have passed) on the line for an interview about the business model of giving away money.\n\nDifficult to Monetize\n\nDaniel started his first faucet, Bitcoin Aliens, about nine months ago. He says it was rough at first, and not just because he bought into Bitcoin at peak prices. Giving away money is a tough business model to master, and for the first while he lost money at it.\n\nI saw all the positive news about Bitcoin and I knew that I wanted to get involved. My background isn’t technical, I’m not a developer, I can’t make an exchange or technology that fits on the block chain, but I knew that I could blog about it. I could write about it and get other people interested in it, educate people I guess. So my goal is to be the blogger and the interviewer […] And that sort of wasn’t really profitable.\n\nThat led me on to faucets. […] It’s quite hard to monetize. In my opinion, it’s a really baby niche, it’s as if gold investing were just starting or stock trading or commodities trading were just getting started. People don’t know what to do yet, there’s isn’t any guides to it. There isn’t any products to sell. So then I saw the faucet model, and I decided to give that a try. They looked to be high traffic websites with adverts on them, […] so I tried that, and eventually scaled it into a couple of quite big faucets.\n\nLater on, he realized that he could engage the user on a deeper level than just simply having them click a few buttons for a reward. He thought about (and is still considering) doing a video-based faucet similar to PaidBooks, but first he has to see PaidBooks through. He says it costs him a few grand a month at present because he is paying folks to add the books to his website. They tried an automated way at first, but it had a lot of problems. He’s also having to avoid content that is high in disk space, because his faucets overall are incredibly high traffic affairs, with some users coming back as often as they are allowed to.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies have also jumped onto the faucet game, with a wide array of alt-coins being available through sites like MultiFaucet.tk. Daniel estimates that he is the third largest faucet owner in the industry, with the guys who own Bitcoin Zebra and FreeBitco.in presently ruling the roost. It’s important to note that those folks have been in the business quite a bit longer, and at least in the case of Freebitco.in, they have no discernment about the advertisements they run. On this matter, Daniel said he is very conscious.\n\nI think [faucets] definitely get a bad reputation, and there is a bit of crap out there. […] I see the real dark side of Bitcoin from this view as well, because you need the advertising money and it’s good to have the advertising money in Bitcoin, but then someone will advertise a Ponzi on my website and I’ve got to sort of monitor it and check on it and get rid of it. Some of the ad platforms – the whole economy in Bitcoin, even on this micro level where you can buy and sell advertising while paying people in Bitcoin, a lot of our business is running purely off Bitcoin, but some of the advertising networks are, in the spirit of Bitcoin, they’re anonymous. So if they run a Ponzi, they can just come on and advertise and then back out and there’s no trace of them. So I think that needs locking down a bit. I think there should be a bit of regulation.\n\nIt’s hard to disagree with the way faucets and tipping services can grow the Bitcoin world. Before people truly understand it, taking the plunge of investing money can seem quite daunting. The added problem there is that they are thus unable to see how it works, to experiment with it, which might lower the odds that they’ll jump in and invest some of their fiat money into it. Says Daniel:\n\nI think it’s quite a cool way to, you know, this is how you get a wallet, we’ll send you the micro units of Satoshis, they get them in their wallet, and then they learn what Satoshis are, what the value of that is. Then they can send it to people. They can use ChangeTip to tip it on. And yeah, it’s a very micro way to get involved in Bitcoin.\n\nDaniel’s PaidBooks.com is pushing the envelope for faucets. He says he won’t stop there, he just has to stop hemorrhaging money on it before he pushes into a new development. The Bitcoin Aliens app is currently the 8th “Bitcoin” search result in the Google Play store, with mostly wallets occupying the top five slots. Daniel is confident that he will make PaidBooks as successful as his other endeavors, and from there he says he will continue to innovate in this space.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The world of bitcoin is like the Lord Of The Rings without the Hobbits. You’ve got Sauron (Satoshi Nakamoto, who essentially wants freedom from law), Saruman (Ross Ulbricht, the technologist who wants to unleash the currency no matter the cost). They are battled by folks like Boromir (the hapless Mark Karpeles), Aragon (Wences Casares, the hidden knight) and the elves (Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss). Maybe Charlie Shrem is Gimli but, alas, there is no Gandalf in this tale – no one has died and returned reborn from the clutches of the Balrog (Goldman Sachs).\n\nThe fellowship, led by Casares, has to scale Mt. Gox to wrest control of the financial Middle Earth from Sauron and bring peace and prosperity back to the Shire (Wall Street). That’s basically what Nathaniel Popper’s new book Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money is about: “There And Back Again” for the anarchocryptofiscalists.\n\nThis rollicking analogy almost perfectly describes Popper’s book. It’s a tale told quickly and well and each chapter follows, chronologically, a month in the life of bitcoin. Popper’s research is primarily gathered via IRC chat rooms an forums and he interviews all the major players. He tells their tales by turns, bringing Satoshi to the fore in one chapter and then the Winklevoss twins in the next. The tale of bitcoin has not yet sunk into legend and almost all of the major players are vibrant and real. His chapters on the Silk Road’s Ulbricht, told in an almost watercolor-like prose, paints the picture of a good kid gone bad. You almost feel sorry for him until you realize how blasé he was about sending “execution orders” that were never carried out.\n\nThe story, in short, is about acceptance. Popper paints the bitcoin picture as gray with a rosy future. By focusing on the later entrants in the space – Casares primarily – he shows the currency’s attempts at legitimacy in the eyes of regulators and banks. Each story is similar. A small company is born, it grows like topsy, and then gets shut down by the government or a bank. It’s enough to make you scream until Popper quotes Casares who said of Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, “I think whatever Jamie does or doesn’t do [about Bitcoin] will be as relevant as what the Postmaster General did or didn’t do about email.”\n\nThis book is a great primer on bitcoin and it gives you a quick rundown of all the major players. It is a very human book – rarely does Popper get bogged down in technical terms – and it makes it clear that Bitcoin is a boon more for business and less a technoutopianist super-currency. As you watch the price rise to stratospheric heights and then fall swiftly to a steady plateau you can almost feel the urgency of this new digital gold rush and you’re forced to marvel at men and women who made fortunes betting on bits. The language can be clunky at times (Popper notes the sexual attractiveness of the early bitcoin nerds a few too many times for some reason) but on the whole it is a readable adventure story about a battle that’s just beginning.\n\nDigital Gold is available now in ebook and hardback. You can read an exclusive excerpt here.', 'At the end of 2013, after reading an article about Bernanke\'s perspective on Bitcoin and Marc Andreessen’s position on Bitcoin, Francesco Rulli immediately thought of it as being solution to his dilemma of how to distribute money to nearly half a million users scattered across the world that are registered on his platform.\n\nThat inspiration led to the formation of BitLanders - a platform enabling users to build engaging content (videos, blogs, photos, advertisements), which a patent pending measurement and reward algorithm, BUZZ SCORE, judges in terms of quality as well as interactions to reward its creator with bitcoin for content performance.\n\nCurrently, BitLanders is a community of over 500,000 registered users and has differentiated itself by providing people in unbanked sections of the world the ability to leverage and monetize their talent, all thanks to bitcoin.\n\n“[I]t\'s with this power of the Blockchain and Bitcoin that we can truly empower women to financial independence, especially in countries where women have limited freedom.” - BitLanders Founder, Francesco Rulli\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to Francesco to learn how Bitcoin is re-imagining charity and empowering women in third world countries.\n\nCoinTelegraph: How did you get introduced to bitcoin? What fascinated you about it?\n\nFrancesco Rulli: Cryptocurrencies and Cryptoassetts are very interesting technological and philosophical innovations that can stimulate the curiosity and interest of people. Their complexity can be a challenge that can initiate innovation and spark new motivation in people\'s lives. I was born with the Italian Lira, I grew up with the Euro, and I matured with the USD, but Bitcoin was the real choice of commercial freedom I was able to take.\n\nThis exact same choice can be taken by a 13 year-old girl in Afghanistan independently from the approval of her family or the dangers in her society or the flows in her banking system or government. Women do not necessary need more traditional money as it might result in a liability for kidnapping and theft. They need more connectivity and financial technological independence that can be achieved with Bitcoin and not with traditional fiat currencies.\n\n“[I]t is unthinkable for a young woman in Afghanistan to have a bank account. Bitcoin was and remains the perfect solution […]”\n\nCT: Why did you choose bitcoin as a charity platform? What benefits did it pose over fiat?\n\nFR: In 2011, I saw a video of a young woman who was building Internet classrooms in Afghanistan. I approached her and funded the construction of 11 classrooms and 2 IT Centers. Her name is Roya Mahboob, and even John Kerry praised her work. Together, we connected 55,000 girls to the World Wide Web.\n\nWe educated the girls on how to post good quality content and we started rewarding them financially based on their BuzzScore, a proprietary algorithm to measure quality of the content and user\'s reach and influence.\n\n“Two billion people who can raise or donate 10 dollars each throughout their life time on social media will achieve what Bill Gates did with his donation of 20 billion dollars.”\n\nSending payments by Paypal wasn\'t possible as Paypal is not available in Afghanistan and many other parts of the world. We could not wire them money to their bank accounts because the fees were too high and it is unthinkable for a young woman in Afghanistan to have a bank account. Bitcoin was and remains the perfect solution for these redistributions.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin allows us to transfer very small fractions of a cent, down to the five thousandths of a cent! By doing so, we are able to involve people that could not afford traditional donation amounts of US$1 or more, and with their data, we can build a network of supporters and information that can support charities all over the world.\n\nTwo billion people who can raise or donate 10 dollars each throughout their life time on social media will achieve what Bill Gates did with his donation of 20 billion dollars. Our focus is to identify donors and supporters who are located in developing countries that are usually not part of major fundraising efforts.\n\nCT: How does bitcoin empower women?\n\nFR: Bitcoin is safe and confidential. The only person who can have access to it is the very person who is supposed to receive the payment. It positions women on the Blockchain ledger and they can exchange values and seek advice and support from very smart people like Marc Andreessen, Fred Wilson and Nic Cary, regardless of their geo location.\n\nI am a strong believer in what Spiderman says: ""With power comes responsibility"" and it\'s with this power of the Blockchain and Bitcoin that we can truly empower women to financial independence, especially in countries where women have limited freedom.\n\nCT: What kind of impact has your work with bitcoin had overall?\n\nFR: Having access to Bitcoin and understanding its technology establishes a true opportunity for each individual regardless of their status in society.\n\nIn 2013, I mentioned to Roya Mahboob and Fereshteh Forough that Bitcoin was going to be the solution of our problem in distributing money to 55,000 women, and that it was very important that they would support women all over the world to achieve this independence. Today, both Roya and Fereshteh are true pioneers in the Bitcoin industry and already had a major impact on many other women like Parisa Ahmadi (The Age of Cryptocurrency).']"
05/27/2015,"['Countries around the world have a wide ranging view of the digital currency bitcoin or a “virtual currency.” Western superpowers like the United States and United Kingdom have shown a positive attitude towards the new technology. Some countries like Canada and Australia are still deliberating on what to do about Bitcoin, legally. And the many others have already made their decision against digital currency as a whole, and bitcoin, in particular, so here we’ll list the ten places you’ll find the most trouble using bitcoin. Keep in mind not recognizing or supporting the use of bitcoin and banning bitcoin are two different things. This article focuses on those who ban bitcoin legally, or in practice.\n\nReasons why run the gamut, from fear and ignorance, to protectionism of their national currency, to building a new currency in bitcoin’s image. The list, in general, is not much above ten, but that is subject to change, as many countries have not made an official decision for or against bitcoin. Some are banned by the country’s Central Banking system, some are banned by the nation’s government, and in many countries the Central Bank and national government act as one and the same. These are the Top 10 bannings of bitcoin, via official statement banning the currency nationally, or in practice, in alphabetical order.\n\nTop 10 Places Where Bitcoin is Banned\n\nBangladesh\n\nIn a statement the Central Bank of Bangladesh cited concerns over bitcoin’s lack of “a central payment system” which could lead to people being “financially harmed”. It invoked the provisions of the Foreign Currency Control Act of 1947 and the Money Laundering Control Act of 2012. Then, added that trading in bitcoin and other digital currencies could lead to a punishment of up to 12 years in prison.\n\n“Bitcoin is not a legal tender of any country. Any transaction through Bitcoin or any other crypto-currency is a punishable offense,” the bank said in an official statement last September.\n\nThe ban comes as an enforcement of sections 4,5 and 8 of the 1947 law that regulate trading in foreign currency without authorization or general permission from the central bank. Section 5 severely restricts payments did outside Bangladesh, which affect bitcoin payments.\n\nBolivia\n\nThe central bank of Bolivia, El Banco Central de Bolivia said in a statement:\n\n“It is illegal to use any currency that is not issued and controlled by a government or an authorized entity.”\n\nChina\n\nIt is a common misconception that bitcoin and digital currency are totally banned and illegal in China, but China has become the world’s largest bitcoin trading market. The bitcoin ban is strictly on banks, as the central banking authority, The People’s Bank of China is owned 70% by the Chinese government. Banking institutions and employees are banned from engaging in bitcoin business through banking, as well as servicing or doing business with the bitcoin industry. Trading or mining in bitcoin is not illegal for common citizens.\n\nEcuador\n\nThe ban by Ecuador makes the most sense of any ban, as they are building a national electronic cash system, so they feel the need to protect their new currency from something clearly superior. A decentralized currency of finite production that cannot be manipulated by governments or banks might dim the lights on their new program in the eyes of the public, which offers none of those benefits.\n\nIceland\n\nAs of March 19, 2014 the Central Bank of Iceland issued a statement explaining the legal status of digital currency in Iceland. Purchasing them may violate the Icelandic Foreign Exchange Act, which specifies that Icelandic currency cannot leave the country. A nebulous designation, but it sounds like it is banned, in effect.\n\nIndia\n\nBTCXIndia was the first bitcoin exchange designed and built in India. While following KYC and AML guidelines, and allowing instant INR (Indian rupee) deposits and withdrawals, BTCXIndia was forced to close by their bank, which no longer services bitcoin businesses. The reasons are unknown, whether it is based on a perceived risk or just a simple ban by management, but the issue is widespread in India.\n\n“We have today been informed by our bank that they will no longer serve bitcoin businesses,” the notice stated. “We have investigated the possibility to operate through other banks, but it seems this is a general policy in India as of today.”\n\nRussia\n\nEven with the recent legal victory in Ural recently, setting a legal precedent to lift the banning of websites related to bitcoin and other digital currencies, bitcoin is banned in practice, if not officially legal yet. With the Russian ruble rebounding, but still down over 30% from January 2014, banks and the national government aren’t looking kindly on those who are investing in other currencies, digital or not.\n\nGold purchases are frowned upon in Russia, so proceed with caution.\n\nSweden\n\nBitcoin has suffered a small banning in the buying and selling of scrap metal and “waste products”. This sets a bad precedent of government interference for the future, but so far the ban is restricted to this industry by all accounts.\n\nThailand\n\nAccording to news reports, the Bank of Thailand ruled bitcoin illegal on July 29, 2013. However, it appears “it issued a preliminary ruling that using bitcoins . . . was illegal because of a lack of existing laws” in the case of a currency exchange license application by Bitcoin Co. Ltd.\n\nBitcoin businesses have been able to conduct business and get licensing, but the ban technically is still there, if not in practice currently.\n\nVietnam\n\nBack in February of 2014, Vietnam banned the virtual currency bitcoin for use by credit institutions, citing its ease of use for criminal purposes and its high risk for investors.\n\n“Transaction by bitcoin is highly anonymous so bitcoin can become a tool for crimes like money laundering, drug trafficking, tax evasion, illegal payment,” the central bank said in a statement\n\nWhile not officially banned for personal use but discouraged. This seems to be the most common thread in nation-states throughout the world. Trust the central bank’s currency and do not trust algorithmic currency. If you trust your country’s central bank to look after your economic interests, you’re golden. If not, at least you have a choice. Your central bank’s national currency, or the world’s first global, decentralized, mathematical currency.\n\nCan these countries come around to a more progressive view of bitcoin? What country may join this list?

Zur Zeit laufen die Vorbereitungen zur Gründung der ersten Bitcoin-Bank. Das verlautet aus mehreren Quellen in der Finanzbranche. Entsprechende Gespräche mit der Finanzmarktaufsicht Finma sollen in diesen Tagen stattfinden. Bis heute gibt es in der Schweiz noch keine Bank, die Dienstleistungen mit der neuen digitalen Währung Bitcoin anbietet.\n\nDie Initianten des Projekts bestätigen den Sachverhalt: «Das Gesuch für eine Banklizenz werden wir in den nächsten Wochen einreichen», sagt Guido Rudolphi. Der IT-Spezialist gehört zu einer Gruppe von acht Personen, welche hinter der geplanten Gründung des Finanzinstituts stehen. «Erste Investoren sind an Bord, und es läuft die Suche nach passenden Räumlichkeiten.» Um welche Firma es sich handelt, die letztlich die Banklizenz beantragt, wollte Rudolphi aus Wettbewerbsgründen vorderhand nicht sagen.\n\nNoch geringe Nutzung\n\nWöchentlich kommt es weltweit zu Neugründungen von Firmen, deren Geschäftsmodell im weiteren Sinne mit Bitcoin zu tun haben. Bei den Konsumenten ist die sechs Jahre alte Währung allerdings noch kaum angekommen. Die Zahl der Transaktionen nimmt nur langsam zu. Trotzdem beschäftigen sich inzwischen die Regulatoren von New York bis Singapur mit Bitcoin. In der Schweiz will die Finma die kryptographischen Währungen explizit in einschlägige Verordnungen aufnehmen.\n\nFür das neue Bitcoin-Institut gelten allerdings ohnehin die schon bestehenden Bestimmungen, denn die neue Bitcoin-Bank soll als normale Geschäftsbank aufgestellt werden. Sie wird automatisch am Interbanken-Clearingsystem und an Swift angeschlossen sein und alle bekannten Richtlinien zur Identifizierung der Kunden befolgen müssen.\n\nBitcoin-affine Kundschaft\n\nVon traditionellen Instituten unterscheidet sie sich zunächst durch die angestrebte Klientel. Zu künftigen Kunden gehören etwa Firmen, die Erträge und Umsätze in Bitcoin erwirtschaften und gleichzeitig Zugang zum klassischen Bankensystem benötigen. Das sind exemplarisch Bitcoin-Börsen, Bitcoin-Broker, Bezahldienstleister und Software-Plattformen, auf denen die neuen digitalen Währungen eine Rolle spielen. Bisher mussten solche Firmen – obwohl in der Schweiz ansässig – den meistens kostspieligen Umweg über ausländische Banken gehen.\n\nDarüber hinaus gibt es inzwischen auch vermögende private Anleger aus dem In- und Ausland, die in Bitcoin als spekulative Anlage investiert haben. Die Bitcoin-Bank könnte die sichere Aufbewahrung dieser Vermögen übernehmen und den Kunden gleichzeitig entsprechende Kreditlinien in Bitcoin oder einer anderen Währung wie Franken sprechen. Auch eine eigentliche Börse, an der Bitcoins gegen Franken gehandelt werden können, sei denkbar. «Die Branche bewegt sich enorm rasch», erklärt ein Banker, der das Projekt begleitet, aber im Hintergrund bleiben will. «Einige Geschäftsfelder entstehen gerade, andere sind erst am Horizont erkennbar.» Natürlich berge das Risiken, aber eben auch Chancen.\n\nSchweizer Investoren\n\nNiemand weiss, welche Rolle Bitcoin in fünf Jahren spielt. Noch gibt es ungelöste Probleme bezüglich der Massentauglichkeit der Technologie, und entgegen weitverbreiteter Meinung ist ein sicheres Funktionieren des Bitcoin-Netzwerks kostspielig. Trotzdem kommen jede Woche neue Anwendungen auf den Markt, welche ohne die Digitalwährung kaum entstanden wären. Diese Woche etwa streamium.io (User werden zu Film-Streaming-Unternehmer) oder zuvor bittunes.com (User werden Musikvertreiber). In London experimentiert nun die UBS offiziell mit der Bitcoin-Technologie. Und in New York prüft die Börse Nasdaq, Aktientransaktionen von IPO-Kandidaten über das Bitcoin-Netzwerk abzuwickeln.\n\nHeute braucht es in den meisten Fällen irgend an einem Punkt den Anschluss an das bestehende Finanzsystem. Darauf bauen auch die Initianten der ersten Schweizer Bitcoin-Bank. Zum Kernteam des Projekts gehören Banker, IT-Spezialisten, Anwälte und Unternehmensberater. «Das Management wird letztlich vor allem aus Leuten bestehen, die im Finanzwesen und bei der IT-Sicherheit kompetent sind», sagt Rudolphi. «Erste Investoren – alle aus der Schweiz – haben bereits zugesagt.» Eine erste Investorenrunde soll bis zur Dossiereingabe bei der Finma abgeschlossen sein, eine zweite bis zum operationellen Start. Wo der juristische und infrastrukturmässige Hauptsitz der Bank aufgeschlagen wird, steht noch nicht fest.\n\nZum Blog Bits & Coins', 'An MIT student who butted heads with New Jersey regulators over an online bitcoin-mining experiment has finally settled the case after a year and a half of legal wrangling.\n\nAs part of the settlement, engineering student Jeremy Rubin will not have to pay a $25,000 fine as long as the software he helped develop doesn’t improperly access computers in New Jersey.\n\nThat shouldn’t be a problem — the code in question, which was developed as part of a hackathon in November 2013, never grew beyond the proof-of-concept stage and its former website is no longer functional.\n\n“A friendly inquiry and a nudge to be sensitive to user policy would have been appropriate and sufficient for a student project,” Rubin wrote Wednesday.\n\nRubin’s case, which became a flashpoint for prominent figures in the technology and educational research fields, revolved around an idea that Rubin and some friends mocked up over a weekend.\n\nThe idea — known as Tidbit — was to help online publishers bankroll their operations without using advertising, which can track a lot of information about users and crowd out web pages with intrusive ads.\n\nInstead, Tidbit proposed a bit of code that would use some of a website visitor’s processor power to “mine” for bitcoin, the digital alternative currency.\n\nBitcoin mining happens when computers solve complicated math problems, which are used as a kind of password to verify transactions between people transferring money on the bitcoin system. Computers that successfully solve those problems are rewarded with bitcoin.\n\nBy spreading that bitcoin mining work across many computers, the idea went, website visitors could allow their computer processors to contribute to the mining efforts and help pay for the free stuff they’re viewing.\n\nNot long after the hackathon, New Jersey privacy regulators sent a subpoena to Rubin, looking for the Tidbit source code, bitcoin “wallet” addresses that it had used, and more information.\n\nThat riled up academics and tech-policy experts, prompting MIT’s president to get involved. The Electronic Frontier Foundation represented Rubin in the case for no cost.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Rubin wrote, he had to provide New Jersey regulators with the URLs of two websites that had used the Tidbit code in New Jersey.\n\nIn their statement on the case, New Jersey officials said they didn’t aim to stifle entrepreneurship or technical innovation. But they maintained that the Tidbit code had been used to access some New Jersey-based users’ computers without warning them first.\n\nRubin noted that the settlement doesn’t include any admission that Tidbit did anything “unfair or deceptive,” or violate New Jersey laws.', 'Students at Simon Fraser University were able to buy textbooks with Bitcoin for the first time Wednesday, but it’s not the first time the electric currency has made an impact on the school.\n\nLast year, SFU became the first university in Canada to accept the electric currency Bitcoin through its donations program. Thanks to people like Scott Nelson, a class of ‘91 SFU grad and early Bitcoin advocate, the positive reverberations of that decision have been felt as far away as India.\n\n“I donated $6,000 worth of Bitcoin to the program, and that was used to help two health sciences co-op students,” said Nelson, who runs his own crowd-funding website.\n\nOne of the co-op students, Laurie Macpherson, returned in January from Calcutta, where she spent four months working in a program designed to improve the lives of women who are vulnerable to the human and sex-trafficking trade.\n\nMacpherson said the use of Bitcoin was integral to the success of the mission. According to Macpherson, a lot of conventional marketplaces and currencies systematically keep impoverished people down. “The more we can think about alternative marketplaces, that will greatly improve the lives of those that are affected by inequalities within the marketplace.”', 'Debate about the environmental effects of bitcoin mining has resurfaced following claims by an Australia-based sustainability think tank that bitcoin could eventually consume 60% of annual global electricity production.\n\nAccording to the Long Future Foundation\'s website, its calculations are based on the assumption that 1 BTC is valued at £1m, the cost of mining this resource is $500,000 and 3,600 bitcoins are produced every day.\n\n""Bitcoin miners can get power cheaply for $0.05 per kilowatt hour (kWh) which means that they get 20 kWh per dollar spent,"" notes the website.\n\nBy multiplying these numbers (500,000 x 20 x 3,600 x 365) on its Bitcurrent calculator – an interactive spreadsheet – the foundation arrives at the conclusion that bitcoin mines would consume 13,140,000,000,000 kWh – or 13,140 terawatt hours (TWh) – per annum, or the amount of energy required to power 1.5bn homes.\n\nGuy Lane, an environmental scientist and spokesperson for the foundation, said:\n\n""While bitcoin is a virtual currency, it has very real economic, social and environmental effects […] Bitcoin has the potential to have an enormous impact on our global resources and energy use if not managed properly.”\n\nLane explained that the foundation’s bitcoin energy model assumes that miners will spend half the value of a potential million-dollar bitcoin on mining. “As their [bitcoin] value increases, more people will certainly look to create more bitcoins, the cost and energy used in this process will logically grow so long as people can make money.”\n\n“There is a lot to be said for bitcoin as a currency, but it may ultimately be fatally flawed because of its growing energy consumption,” Lane concluded.\n\nDebate ignited\n\nThe think tank\'s findings have been widely contested by the bitcoin mining community.\n\nSam Cole, co-founder of KnCMiner AB, spoke to CoinDesk about the relative shortcomings in the foundation\'s research.\n\nHe said:\n\n""The main thing that they [the foundation] appear to be missing is that the amount of coins released to the network is halved every four years [...] the people who produced the report are very bullish on the coin price.""\n\nLane said the foundation\'s argument rested on a ""scientific theory based on an understanding of the bitcoin technology and economic system. The scenario of $1m bitcoins is just one of the many that can be applied to the Bitcurrent Calculator.""\n\n""If bitcoin replaces gold and the US dollar as a global currency, maybe $1m is a low figure. Even if bitcoin only gets to $400,000 it still consumes 23% of global electricity supply,"" he added.\n\n\'Extreme argument\'\n\nDave Hudson, author at HashingIt, a blog that looks at statistics of the bitcoin ecosystem, noted that although the essence of the foundation\'s argument was not fundamentally wrong, he thought that there were making a ""very extreme argument more for effect than anything else"".\n\nLane, however, rebutted the claims that the presented argument was extreme. ""What is extreme is the possibility of a simple technology that did not exist a decade ago threatening to overwhelm global energy supply,"" he noted.\n\nDespite this, Hudson agreed that if potential profit margins from bitcoin mining were large, this would incentivise people to continue reaping the profits and ""one unfortunate consequence of this is energy use"", he said.\n\nAccording to him, one of the issues is that the foundation\'s calculations assume a daily production of 3,600 bitcoins, but Hudson pointed out that as of next year this would drop to 1,800 and in another five years it would be halved further to 900 bitcoins a day.\n\nHe said:\n\n""To reach the sorts of values being talked about here we\'re now thinking of bitcoin as the major international settlement system and I\'m pretty certain that the views of the current bitcoin developers would be deemed pretty-much irrelevant at that point; things would long have moved to being regulated.""\n\nHudson added: ""For one thing at these sorts of levels the entities controlling mining operations would now be huge corporations (the infrequency of blocks means that a degree of block-maker centralisation is inevitable) and with that would come accountability.\n\nGreen credentials would need to be established otherwise we\'d see governments elected with a remit to tax such unfriendly businesses of all profits.""\n\nAlthough he said that some of the more ardent decentralisation fans would potentially dispute his reasoning, Hudson believes that the only way to achieve mass-scale decentralisation would be to have hashing distributed over a vast number of devices and locations. In turn, this would mean that system-wide upgrades or protocol changes would be unpractical.\n\nForest image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Whether you’re traveling on a WiFi-free flight, or waiting for the next price change, the Bitcoin podcasts below are sure to satiate your appetite.\n\nDecentralize.fm\n\nBitcoin Magazine had the chance to speak to Decentralize.fm’s Tony Sakich, who spoke about how they “did not want to be a podcast exclusively about Bitcoin, as there are plenty of those.” This led to Decentralize taking a different route and really covering other things that are related, but that do not exclusively involve Bitcoin. Topics range from decentralization of education, to virtual worlds and politics related to everything crypto.\n\nRun by Eric Martindale (Bitpay), James Walpole (Bitpay), Tony Sakish (Augur) and Chaz Ferguson, Decentralize.fm started eight months ago with their first guest, country singer Shooter Jennings, who talked about cryptocurrency as well as decentralization in music.\n\nTheir latest episode is with Ryan X. Charles, former astrophysicist, veteran of BitPay and Reddit, and current software engineer at BitGo. Ryan comments on BitGo’s Innovators Patent Agreement which has recently created a stir.\n\nTheir unbiased approach toward Bitcoin adds a new flavor to podcasting about the digital currency, an example being their interview with Steve Albini, who’s produced records for Nirvana, The Pixies, PJ Harvey, Cheap Trick and many others. Albini’s take on Bitcoin might not be positive, but is a refreshing one nonetheless.\n\nTrace Mayer’s Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast\n\nConsidered a Bitcoin legend by many, Trace Mayer is most renowned for being one of digital currency’s earliest adopters, while the market cap was still less than $2 million, Mayer had already helped fund Armory, Bitpay & Kraken.\n\nHis podcasts usually span 15 to 30 minutes and are updated as often as once every three days. One of his most popular podcasts is his interview with Erik Voorhees, author of Money & State, and current CEO of Shapeshift.io.\n\nOther notable mentions are his interviews with Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, and more recently with Roger Ver, who funded big names such as Blockchain.info & Coinlab.com.\n\nLet’s Talk Bitcoin\n\nBoasting more than 9,000 community members, Let’s Talk Bitcoin (LTB) prides itself on being more than just a podcast. Episodes are uploaded almost every day, and have been consistently covering all aspects of cryptographically secured money since April 2013. The website has numerous hosts and sub-shows, and content is largely volunteer-based. Dubbed as an “an experimental community platform,” the LTB network is “home to many ACTs (Autonomous Content Teams) who create what they want and when they want, according to their own rules.”\n\nThe network’s podcasts ideas range from breaking news to interviews and even satire. Popular episodes include the interview with founder of Bitinstant Charlie Shrem and Andreas M. Antonopolous’s episode about his book Mastering Bitcoin.', ""CoinTelegraph spoke with Mark A. Calabria, the Director of Financial Regulation Studies at Cato Institute, about the institute’s views on Bitcoin and the impact of burdensome regulations on cryptocurrencies and the U.S. economy as a whole.\n\n“I don’t think the Bitcoin community should be complacent about the current regulatory environment. The potential to get a lot worse is definitely there.” — Mark A. Calabria, Cato Institute\n\nCoinTelegraph: What do you think about Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology?\n\nMark A. Calabria: While I’m an economist, not a tech guy, I’m very excited about Bitcoin, as I am about alternative currencies in general, and perhaps even more interested in the blockchain. Whether Bitcoin succeeds or not, the decentralized ledger offers tremendous potential in a number of areas, from land title to electronic payments. I am optimistic that both Bitcoin and the blockchain technology offer avenues to disrupting our current financial system, which I believe is badly needed.\n\nCT: Many would argue that the mission of Cato Institute is almost identical to that of many Bitcoin advocates. What is Cato’s position on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?\n\nMC: Well Cato itself does not take positions, its scholars do. But that said, pretty much everyone at Cato, to varying degrees, is supportive of Bitcoin. A number of Cato staff own Bitcoin, as well as a few other alt-currencies. Sure there’s some skepticism about whether Bitcoin is “the one” but there’s a strong desire to see it given a chance and a concern that the financial regulators may hamper its further development.\n\nCT: What was the reason for the ‘08 crash, in your view? What do you see as the fundamental problem in today’s financial system?\n\nMC: The ‘08 crash was certainly large by any measure, but its causes were not that uncommon as far as crises go. At the risk of oversimplification, we had an asset boom, largely but not exclusively in the property market, driven by loose monetary policy in the U.S. and large global flows of capital into the U.S. As those funds increased demand in an environment of relatively inelastic supply, particularly in housing markets like California, prices shot up. As with any boom, the momentum attracted fraud and resulted in a general reduction in underwriting standards.\n\n“I certainly expect another crisis within the next decade or so.”\n\nAll of this was made especially fragile by government guarantees, both explicit and implicit, that increased leverage and reduced market discipline. While booms occurred across property types, U.S. housing policy resulted in our single family housing market being far more leveraged than other property markets. So while office, retail and apartments boomed to the same degree, they were not as leveraged and not as interconnected to our capital markets as was single family housing. Lots of really bad policy choices over the years, few of which have been reversed, some of which have been made worse. I certainly expect another crisis within the next decade or so. The fundamental problem facing our financial markets today is a lack of market discipline.\n\nCT: What do you see as the potential solution?\n\nMC: Foremost we need to eliminate the various government guarantees of risk-taking in our financial markets, including deposit insurance, Federal Reserve rescues of too-big-to-fail companies, and guarantees in the mortgage market, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We need to deregulate our land markets, so that housing supply becomes more elastic, reducing the size and frequency of booms and busts. It is not a coincidence that California was ground zero for the crisis, while prices didn’t move much at all in Texas. You only get booms and busts when demand and supply can become disconnected. And last but not least, we need a rational, rules-based monetary policy.\n\n“Most members of Congress have little understanding of financial markets or even basic economics. Perhaps even worse, they don’t want to even have that knowledge.”\n\nCT: You have a lot of experience working in Washington DC, having served as a senior staff member on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. How was that experience, and is there interest within the government to reform the financial system?\n\nMC: Working in the Senate was certainly educational, if not a little disheartening. Most members of Congress have little understanding of financial markets or even basic economics. Perhaps even worse, they don’t want to even have that knowledge. You have a large contingency in the middle that feels the status quo is mostly OK, and sizeable minorities on the left and right that feel the current system is deeply in need of reform.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that those who feel the system is broken do not necessary agree on how it is broken and what the appropriate remedies are. Hence, the mushy middle continues to set policy. Ultimately one reason I left the Senate was I felt there was not a lot of leadership there. Politicians are understandably risk averse. They are essentially followers. You have to get the public there first, which in a democracy, is a good thing, even if a little frustrating sometimes.\n\n“[R]egulators have so far been relatively restrained. That may well change if regulators start to see cryptocurrencies as a real competitive threat to banks.”\n\nCT: How much interest in cryptocurrency is there within the government?\n\nMC: At this point it is really more a curiosity than anything else, with a few exceptions. Bitcoin has benefited with an association with the tech community — that’ll help insulate it from attacks from the left (with a few exceptions like Paul Krugman). While there’s been some concern expressed by banks, regulators have so far been relatively restrained. That may well change if regulators start to see cryptocurrencies as a real competitive threat to banks.\n\nOn the right the concerns have mostly been about terror finance and money laundering, but since neocons have far less influence than they used to, these concerns have largely been checked. All of the proceeding can change and hence it is important for the Bitcoin community to engage and educate policymakers. I wished we lived in a world where that didn’t matter, but we don’t.\n\nCT: Are you working with any Bitcoin organizations in DC (e.g., the Digital Chamber of Commerce)?\n\nMC: Cato tends to have a, not surprisingly, “go it alone” culture. So we do occasionally interact and work with Bitcoin organizations but I’d say we aren’t as deeply involved as some of them and we do not, yet, have any staff committed to these issues exclusively. That said, we did launch in the fall our Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives and plan to become far more engaged with policy issues surrounding cryptocurrencies.\n\nCT: What’s your take on the IRS’s classification of bitcoin as a taxable commodity?\n\nMC: I’m not a fan of it. It’s obviously not a commodity in the strictest sense. There is an argument for subjecting it to capital gains taxes, in the same manner you’d apply to a stock or bond, but I do worry that the IRS’s decision will complicate and slow acceptance. If its value relative to the dollar stabilizes, this becomes less of an issue. Of course if lots of users start to use any capital losses to offset other income, I wouldn’t be surprised if the IRS reconsiders. I hope with a future administration this gets reversed.\n\n“I should be clear that even under our expansive securities laws: I don’t see Bitcoin as a security. I’m far more worried about what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau might do.”\n\nCT: What about the SEC’s position?\n\nMC: Not as bad as I’d normally expect, but then the SEC is deeply divided at the commissioner level, and Chair Mary Jo White has been more restrained that I might have initially feared. You don’t quite have as much curiosity among SEC commissioners as you do with, say, CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen. I should be clear that even under our expansive securities laws: I don’t see Bitcoin as a security. I’m far more worried about what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau might do.\n\nCT: Do you think the government is following a planned strategy here, or are they scratching their heads with regards to this disruptive tech?\n\nMC: It’s more a head scratching. There’s no coordinated DC approach to Bitcoin. Some of that is a result of the fact that regulators still have their hands full with Dodd-Frank. Some of it has arisen from a lack of pressure from Congress. There’s also been little public demand, so far, to “do something” about Bitcoin. So far, it has really been driven by distinct individuals in key policy roles.\n\nThere’s still a lot of opportunity, and need, to educate policymakers. Those individuals will move on at some point. There’s no guarantee that future appointees will not be hostile. I don’t think the Bitcoin community should be complacent about the current regulatory environment. The potential to get a lot worse is definitely there.\n\nCT: What do you think about regulating Bitcoin? Should or can it be regulated, under the NY BitLicense, for example?\n\nMC: Setting aside any practical politics, as an economic matter, I’d prefer we not regulate Bitcoin at all. My experience has been that regulation generally just creates barriers to entry and protects established incumbents. That said, private exchanges should adopt rules that protect users. We do not know ex-ante what the right set of rules are going to be, so I think it's critical we have some room here for experimentation. Does that mean some people will lose some money? Absolutely. But then Bitcoin isn’t for the faint hearted, at least not yet.\n\nCT: You studied how policy changes in Washington affect low- and moderate-income households. What kind of impact have recent policies had on these households, compared to the higher classes? Do you think cryptocurrency has the potential to democratize money and offer a more egalitarian financial system for the public?\n\nMC: The post-crisis financial reforms have unfortunately raised the costs of credit to lower income families, while also reducing its availability. If these reforms resulted in a more stable economy, then that might be a tradeoff worth making, but unfortunately they do not. And of course the post-crisis monetary policy we’ve had has largely benefited higher income families, as easy money has driven up the stock and property markets. Regulatory changes, for instance, have done tremendous harm to the flow of remittances, which for many emerging economies are a crucial source of capital and income.\n\n“Misguided and harmful regulations almost always weigh heaviest on the poor, as they are least able to avoid them.”\n\nCryptocurrencies already helped there, but have considerable potential to do more. The same is true for other types of payments. Of course, like most technologies, the first movers have been and will be the non-poor. That’s best, since these first-movers are able to shoulder any losses. But as we build to greater scale and separate out the good from the bad, there can be a tremendous benefit for moderate and low income families. It’s especially for that reason that we need to be cautious on the regulatory front. Misguided and harmful regulations almost always weigh heaviest on the poor, as they are least able to avoid them. The rich can always move to Monaco, or transfer their dollars into Swiss Franc.\n\nTechnology can be a great disrupter of the establishment, toppling entrenched incumbents. Accordingly I hope we allow cryptocurrencies considerable room to develop."", 'The UK could be on the cusp of leaving the European Union as the latest poll shows that a majority of Britons do not believe that Prime Minister David Cameron can secure a ""better deal"" with the 28-nation bloc.\n\nAccording to a poll on the Daily Express website, over 97% of the 1,926 people who took part in the survey said ""no"" when asked if Cameron would get ""Britain a fair deal in the EU.""\n\nBritain\'s Conservative party pledged to deliver a simple in/out referendum by 2017 if it won the General Election this year. Now that it has, Cameron and his party are allegedly looking to push forward the vote to 2016 as business lobby groups and analysts have remarked that the uncertainty over Britain\'s membership will have an adverse affect on the economy.\n\nThis month ING\'s senior economist James Knightley said that UK GDP growth in 2017 could be half a point lower, regardless of the outcome of the referendum, because the uncertainty over the referendum will cause projects and investments to be put on hold until there is a clear result.\n\nYesterday, French newspaper Le Monde reported that Germany and France sidestepped Cameron\'s demands to renegotiate the Lisbon Treaty and instead sealed a pact to ""integrate the eurozone without reopening the EU’s treaties."" The Lisbon Treaty is the successor to the European Union Constitution, which became law in 2009. It includes heightened powers for the European Commission, European Parliament and European Court of Justice. It also opened the doors for more freedom of movement between EU members and greater control from Brussels over the final say on asylum applications.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-Brussels party UKIP, which received more votes than the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party combined at the UK General Election with 3.8 million, said Cameron won\'t even ""get close"" to securing independence or a better deal with the EU.', 'Bitcoin exchange Kraken has announced that financial compliance veteran Howard Bernstein has joined the company as chief compliance officer as the trading platform looks to expand to the United States.\n\nBernstein, who has more than 20 years of experience in American financial regulations, constructed the entire anti-money laundering program of the publicly traded investment bank Merriman Capital, Inc. He also helped Merriman comply with SEC and FINRA requirements. Much like the current state of Bitcoin regulations, the compliance requirements for the SEC and FINRA were new and very unclear at the time.\n\nAccording to a Kraken blog post, Bernstein will help manage the company’s day-to-day compliance program and begin to engage regulatory officials and lawmakers. But the new CCO also marks a change of heart for the exchange about the U.S. market, a country Kraken doesn’t operate in, but which contributes greatly to bitcoin’s trading volume.\n\nThe San Francisco-based exchange previously swore off the U.S. market, having said that the country’s regulations were too nascent to know what they needed to comply with. Kraken instead focused its efforts on Europe and Japan, which it found to have simpler financial regulations.\n\nBernstein will now led the exchange’s efforts to get a U.S. banking partner and necessary financial licenses so the trading platform can operate in the country.\n\n“We are working toward being able to operate legally in the United States,” Kraken CEO and founder Jesse Powell told Bitcoin Magazine. “Unlike most other services, we’ve chosen to stay out of the U.S. until we have the necessary licenses, which has put us at a substantial competitive disadvantage. We’re looking forward to entering our home market.”\n\nHe added that the new CCO is also re-evaluating Kraken’s existing compliance programs in Japan and Europe.\n\n“We plan to better localize our compliance efforts and adjust to a more customized risk-based model, as opposed to the generalized policy we have now, which might in some cases be too strict, and in other cases not strict enough,” Powell said.\n\nImage via Kraken.']"
05/28/2015,"['Have you ever wondered why even after six years of invention, the decade’s most disruptive mode of payment has failed to gain public acceptance? Many would say that high volatility and scams and thefts are scaring away the masses – I too agree with them – but this article is about that one thing that mostly misses the list.\n\nBitcoin is not a financial asset, it’s a currency!\n\nBitcoin was never intended to be an investment-grade financial asset, on which you could employ a “buy low, sell high” approach. It was developed as a decentralized medium of exchange, which does not depend on third party processing, and magnificently outdoes the traditional payment methods in terms of cost, time, and reliability.\n\nBut, too much emphasis on the price of Bitcoin is only fueling speculative bets in the financial market, essentially contributing to the high-risk nature of the nascent technology. There are many investors who bought into the digital currency thinking that one day this “future currency” will gain mainstream adoption and put before them huge piles of cash. We all know how the prices have crashed, right?\n\nThis speculative, asset-based attitude is taking away the crucial chance from Bitcoin to cultivate into a true currency like USD.\n\nThe Gresham Law Explanation\n\nIn economics, there is Gresham’s Law which states that, “when you have two currencies, people tend to hoard the one with greater material value and spend the one with less material value.”\n\nConsidering this principle, if people have speculative expectations from Bitcoin and perceive it as an investment tool, they will hold on to it while increasingly using the US dollars to pay their bills, buy food and go shopping. As a result, Bitcoin loses another opportunity to establish itself as a mode of payment.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you want something that appreciates in value, consider investing in stocks, real estate, and precious metals. The sooner the people realize this, the sooner they will spend Bitcoins in daily routine. I am sure Bitcoin-related companies, who are unaffected by price crashes, realized this a long time ago.', 'While some nations have been open to developments in the crytocurrency industry and others are still trying to understand its workings, others have opted to have a bitcoin ban. One of the biggest reasons for banning its use is the association with money laundering and criminal dealings.\n\nMonetary authorities and government officials have been particularly skeptical about the use of bitcoin wallets, as these are protected by a layer of anonymity. In addition, hacking incidents involving bitcoin exchanges have also cast doubts on the viability of the industry.\n\nCountries with a Bitcoin Ban\n\nChina has one of the largest bitcoin trading markets in the world but its government has imposed a bitcoin ban for banks, which means that financial institutions and its employees are prohibited from engaging in any business involving the cryptocurrency. However, trading or mining bitcoin is not banned among regular citizens.\n\nIn Russia, the central bank and the national government have mentioned that there is no legal currency in the country other than the ruble. It has also blocked access to bitcoin websites, but this has recently been overruled in a court hearing.\n\nThailand has also announced a bitcoin ban, with the government officially declaring the cryptocurrency illegal back in 2013. Interestingly enough, bitcoin-related businesses are able to get licenses and operate in the country, suggesting that the ban is not strictly put in practice.\n\nIn Vietnam, the government banned the use of bitcoin in credit institutions, citing its high risk for investors. The cryptocurrency hasn’t been banned for personal use but this has been discouraged.\n\nThere is also rumored to be a bitcoin ban in India, as BTCXIndia was recently forced to close up shop.

The power needed to mine big data can oftentimes mean big costs for companies. For BitVest, the move to Iceland allows for significant savings and increased ROI.\n\nVerne Global will supply BitVest with an affordable 100% carbon-neutral power solution that offers unparalleled pricing and efficiency. Low-cost, reliable and sustainable power is crucial for Bitcoin mining computers that generate huge amounts of heat.\n\nIn warmer climates, the majority of the costs for Bitcoin mining comes from expensive air conditioners and paying for the power to run them. By using Iceland’s temperate climate to cool the equipment, BitVest can save as much as 30% in cooling costs.\n\nMoreover, Iceland’s low-cost electrical power comes from one of the world’s most reliable power grids. Verne Global’s campus is also connected to the world via redundant, high-capacity, multi-terabit-per-second connections. This long-term hosting agreement will help BitVest to meet corporate objectives by providing a scalable solution that addresses both immediate and future power requirements.\n\n“It makes strong business and financial sense to move our mining operations to a renewable data center where we are able to reduce our total cost of ownership by 30-40%,” said Bitvest CEO, Devin L. Hahn.\n\n“We chose Verne Global primarily due to the climate profile for computing and the advanced infrastructure design of the campus in Iceland. The power is also backed by secured, long-term pricing predictability, meaning BitVest has visibility into the future of our power costs. In the end, we are able to mine smarter with Verne Global’s flexible and scalable data center space.”\n\nAbout BitVest\n\nBitVest Digital Mining is headed up by team of seasoned business professionals, high-tech entrepreneurs and Bitcoin enthusiasts.

Customers should do their own research before investing funds in any company."", ""This question originally appeared on Quora: Is the price of Bitcoin going to bounce back?\n\nAnswer by Henry Berg, Engineer, on Quora\n\nAll of us who are interested in bitcoin follow the price in one way or another. It is, after all, a very clean and simple indicator of how bitcoin is doing. But given that the price of bitcoin is determined solely by supply and demand, and that the supply of new bitcoins is predetermined, with new coins being issued steadily at a rate that drops sharply in the future, the only variable of interest is demand. And the demand for bitcoin is determined by how useful bitcoins are to people. So if you want to know whether the price of bitcoins will go up in the future, you have to ask yourself how useful you think bitcoins are going to be. Bitcoins are an almost pure example of an ideal online currency, with almost flawless fungibility, divisibility, portability, scarcity, durability and un-consumability. But to somebody who already has access to modern financial tools like bank accounts and credit cards, there are very few new things bitcoin has to offer. The compelling uses for bitcoin so far are to serve as a vehicle for speculation, i.e., a ticket for the roller-coaster ride of the last few years, and as a method of gambling and making purchases on the dark markets. For traditional purchases, the merchants pay all of the fees and bear all of the risks of credit cards, so a modern consumer has no incentive to use bitcoin for such purchases. That may change, but until merchants find some way of offering a discount for the use of bitcoin, bitcoin demand is dependent on the discovery of new uses.\n\nThere are several uses of bitcoin which people are pretty excited about. Bitcoin allows cross-border transactions over the internet, which could include business supply-chain payments, international remittances, and online orders from people without credit cards. Bitcoin allows micro-payments for online services, including automated payments, which may create a whole bunch of different uses. In theory, merchants should love bitcoin, which can be processed, kept or sold with low fees, eliminating high credit card acceptance fees and getting rid of the scourge of credit card chargebacks altogether. Look at all of the scandals about leaked credit card information, the subsequent horrific PR messes, and millions of customers having to replace their credit cards because a merchant gets hacked. With bitcoin, the merchant might lose some money if they screw up, but their customers are unaffected no matter what. This is just the payment uses of bitcoin that we've looked at so far.\n\nBitcoin can also be used to leverage the underlying blockchain. Several services are looking at ways to commit a hash value to the blockchain, usually spending a small amount in bitcoins in fees to do so. Others are looking at ways of having bitcoins represent the ownership of real-world assets in different ways. All of these services require bitcoins in some way or another.\n\nLastly, look at the massive funding that has gone into Coinbase, Circle and 21, inc, along with many other bitcoin companies. I think it is a pretty safe bet that all of these factors are going to put upward pressure on bitcoin prices. Many are arguing that bitcoin prices are going nowhere but down since the peak at $1200 in late 2013. I would argue that sure, there was a massive speculative peak, but bitcoin has been trading steadily at $200-$300 for the last several months. The efforts people are putting into mining bitcoin have not pulled back at all. And in the third quarter of 2016, the rate of new coin issuance drops by half, from the current 3600 coins/day to 1800 coins/day. Everybody can make whatever choice they are comfortable with, but I am very comfortable being long on bitcoin, and I'm going to remain so.\n\nIs the price of Bitcoin going to bounce back?: originally appeared on Quora: The best answer to any question.

More questions:"", ""Bitcoin is facing a coming-of-age moment. The cybercurrency, beloved by techno-libertarians and notorious for financing the Web’s largest black market, will soon come under the formal purview of New York state financial regulators.\n\nThat’s anathema to bitcoin diehards.\n\n“The reaction has been overwhelmingly negative,” says Steve Wager, head of global operations at digital currency startup itBit, which is headquartered in New York.\n\nBut itBit isn’t your typical bitcoin outfit. “We take somewhat a contrarian stance,” says Wager, a former manager at Citibank. “We see this as a positive.”\n\nNot only does itBit support the coming rules but the company took the trouble to obtain a traditional banking license earlier this year -- the first bitcoin exchange in the U.S. to do so. (Indeed, it’s the first institution of any kind to secure a New York banking charter since the financial crisis.)\n\nThat leaves Wager blasé about the BitLicense, New York’s coming regulatory regime for bitcoin-based financial services. The final act of Benjamin Lawsky, New York’s outgoing chief financial regulator, the BitLicense is meant to safeguard consumers and root out money laundering in the burgeoning industry.\n\nThe rules, expected to be announced in the coming week, will likely mandate capital cushions at bitcoin depositories and address risks around money laundering and cybersecurity.\n\nDepending on who’s talking, the regulations could lend legitimacy to an industry on the up-and-up -- or impose roadblocks that will send digital entrepreneurs packing for Silicon Valley and other locales with looser requirements.\n\n“A clear set of rules and certainty in how they’re going to be enforced would give New York an advantage,” says Gil Luria, a digital currency analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Even if the regulations are more restrictive, the clarity would allow businesses to move forward.”\n\nThough many bitcoin companies are bracing for the costs the new regulations may bring, the industry as a whole will breathe a sigh of relief when the rules are unveiled, Luria says. “The uncertainty is paralyzing.”\n\nFrom Wild West To Wall Street\n\nTwo years ago, the world of bitcoin was considered a monetary Wild West. Exchange rates swung violently, with the currency topping $1,000 in late 2013, before a spectacular plunge cut prices in half. High-profile trading venues like Mt. Gox imploded amid allegations of fraud and incompetence. Customers lost hundreds of millions of dollars from their accounts.\n\nBut in the past year, the currency has tamed its price gyrations, shaken its outlaw image and found a new home on Wall Street, where legacy institutions have acquired a taste for the technology.\n\nThis month, the New York Stock Exchange debuted a bitcoin index, while Nasdaq announced a pilot program that would use bitcoin’s technological infrastructure -- known as the blockchain -- to trade shares in private companies.\n\nWall Street titans have dabbled in the cryptocurrency as well. Goldman Sachs joined a recent $50 million funding round for Circle, which uses bitcoin technology to aid money transfers. And Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan executive and storied pioneer of derivatives, now leads Digital Asset Holdings, which aims to settle bitcoin transactions for large financial institutions.\n\nOthers have loftier visions. Some see bitcoin slashing the cost of remittances that immigrants send home. Its underlying technology, others hope, could be a bulwark against identity theft and other frauds.\n\nLuria compares bitcoin’s move into legitimacy to the Web’s adolescence. “In its early days, the Internet was a cesspool of pornography and hate speech,” Luria says. “Bad people realize when regulation hasn’t caught up, and they exploit it. But some people saw through that and realized the Web was a powerful technology.”\n\nBitcoin has followed a similar route. And as cryptocurrencies have marched into the financial mainstream, New York’s Department of Financial Services has extended a regulatory embrace.\n\nBy August 2013, the DFS was devising the BitLicense to address bitcoin’s unique risks. “The more we learned during the course of our inquiry,” DFS Superintendent Lawsky said in a speech last year, “the more we saw that virtual currencies -- and the very powerful technologies behind them -- could hold a number of very interesting potential benefits.”\n\nBut unsurprisingly, draft proposals of the rules released last year raised the hackles of the bitcoin community. Thousands of comments flooded into the agency, asking which types of firms would be affected and how rigorous the anti-money-laundering controls would be.\n\nLawsky’s office clarified that only financial intermediaries -- companies that safeguard customer bitcoins -- would need a BitLicense. Software developers and individuals would be exempt. Moreover, some firms could seek a provisional two-year BitLicense with lighter requirements, to “provide startups an on-ramp as they build up their operations,” as Lawsky said in December.\n\nStifling Innovation\n\nStill, some say that the new requirements could be a drag.\n\n“Can regulators do a sufficient job in maintaining consumer safety? Do regulators even know enough about bitcoin?” asks Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of Coinsetter, a New York bitcoin exchange. “That’s probably not the case today.”\n\nLawsky, who has cemented a tough-guy reputation on Wall Street, has said the rules are tailored to allow for innovation in the bitcoin business.\n\nBut Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director of the bitcoin think tank Coin Center, isn’t convinced. “When the burdens placed on a company are above those of normal money transfer companies, I think it’s a facetious claim.”\n\nTo Van Valkenburgh, state regulations for existing money transfer companies like Western Union suffice to keep bitcoin dealers in line. The added requirements in Lawsky’s proposals for digital currencies, he says, could push bitcoin-dealing firms out of the New York market -- though most see this as a faint possibility.\n\nDespite protests from bitcoin proponents, though, the currency remains a favorite means of hiding ill-gotten money. Money laundering has emerged as one of Lawsky’s chief concerns.\n\nGenerally the province of federal regulators, money-laundering oversight brings with it considerable costs. New York’s rules could require firms to keep tabs not just on their own customers -- which Coinsetter's Lukasiewicz says companies like his already do -- but also on transfer recipients.\n\nLukasiewicz says his company has spent upwards of $30,000 preparing for the new rules. The DFS’ proposed money-laundering requirements, he worries, could present a steeper challenge than those already on the books.\n\nIf the measures remain, Lukasiewicz says, “you’ll see a stifling of innovation.”\n\nPhoto: Hanna Sender/International Business Times\n\nWhat's more, bitcoin’s blockchain technology could make these controls unnecessary. Bitcoin operates by keeping a public ledger maintained independently in countless digital wallets. Law enforcement agents have successfully used that ledger to ferret out lawbreakers.\n\nIndeed, bitcoin devotees were even able to locate the FBI’s own bitcoin hoard after the agency seized the digital assets of Silk Road, the now-shuttered online black market.\n\nAnalysts warn that the novelty and intrigue of bitcoin will cause regulators to impose rules that are at best redundant and at worst suffocating. Some fear a dizzying patchwork of independent state regimes. “There’s already a robust set of regulations around money transfer companies,” Luria says. “Going above and beyond regulations for other money services businesses would be unusual.”\n\nRules Of The Road\n\nBut itBit’s Wager isn’t stressed about the rules coming down the pike. He harks back to his years at Citibank, which is now reportedly under investigation for letting dirty money come through its Mexican branch.\n\n“It’s onerous, there’s no arguing with that,” Wager says of money-laundering oversight. “But it gets you out of trouble.”\n\nWhat worries Wager more is the reputation of bitcoin, which is still dogged by memories of wild speculation and outright theft. “We’re still fighting the issues of legitimacy,” he says. A solid regulatory regime could help buffer bitcoin’s public image, even if it comes with costs.\n\n“We don’t want there to be a backlash against New York state,” he says. But he hopes that the new rules will bring transparency to the world of bitcoin operators and spur wider adoption of the technology.\n\n“When there are rules of the road, businesses won’t have to operate in a gray zone.”"", 'European Bitcoin exchange BitStamp launched a pre-paid debit card that can be loaded with bitcoin on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the London-based exchange, the debit card is accepted at anywhere major credit and debit cards are accepted. The card’s balance can be denominated either in British pounds, euros or American dollars.\n\nThe debit card has three stages of verification, each with its own spending limit. The most basic stage requires no know-your-customer verification and allows for €2,500 worth of transactions annually. Government ID, proof of residence, and a certified source of funds document is required for the highest annual spending limit, €125,000.\n\nCrypto Debit Card\n\nThe debit cards can be ordered now. They are first received in a digital form that can be used only at online websites. A physical card for usage at brick-and-mortar retail stores can be ordered for $10. The card will take 10 to 15 business days to arrive.\n\nAfter receiving the card, users can transfer bitcoin from a BitStamp account to it; a $10 flat fee will be taken for transfers of $1,000 or less. A 2 percent fee will be taken for anything above that.\n\nCard holders will be able to see their transaction history, retrieve their PIN, order new cards and more at cardportal.com.\n\nThe debit card was launched through a partnership with the European and Latin American payment processor AstroPay. The London-based company operates the largest payment network in Latin America and has partnered with several Bitcoin companies in the past, including Latin American Bitcoin exchange Bitex.la, cryptocurrency development company Ripple Labs and the now-defunct exchange Mt Gox.\n\nThe card currently is not available to U.S. citizens. The Bitcoin exchange hopes to expand the service to United States, but BitStamp founder and CEO Nejc Kodri? said no launch date has been determined.', 'Dream Lover, a virtual relationship platform that allows users to send texts and receive pictures from professional models, is now supporting bitcoin as a payment option.\n\nA product of the people behind adult entertainment studio Naughty America, Dream Lover follows in the footsteps of its sister website, which began accepting bitcoin in January 2014.\n\nLaunched later that year, Dream Lover allows users to spend bitcoin on account credits called Coins that can be used to purchase access to phone numbers assigned to Dream Lover models. Users pay for 30-day access to the phone number and any transaction fees.\n\nDream Lover CEO Andreas Hronopoulos described the product as one that seeks to capitalize on what he considers the broader trend of startups enabling both real and fantasy online relationships, citing Tinder as an example.\n\nHronopoulous told CoinDesk:\n\n""We don\'t think about it as adult entertainment, we look at it as people have relationships online and this is just an opportunity to have a virtual companion. I think the movie \'Her\' really hit the nail on the head. People want to have relationships online and this is just the beginning.""\n\nHronopoulous indicated that models on the website are predominantly female, but that the platform is open to all applicants.\n\nAbove all, however, Hronopoulous sought to stress that Dream Lover is not an \'adult entertainment\' product, but instead a kind of for-profit fantasy social network.\n\n""The purpose of this service isn\'t for people to meet,"" he continued. ""It\'s for users to have somebody to communicate with and who better than the pin-up girls of our generation?""\n\nBitPay serves as the transactions processor for the service.\n\nDiminishing role\n\nWhile bullish on the prospect of bitcoin in the adult industry last year, Hronopoulous indicated that he now believes the technology\'s broader adoption is likely to happen without the help of adult entertainment.\n\n""Adult entertainment works when you talk about using a medium and having devices which can access it,"" he explained. ""Bitcoin is something different. I don\'t think adult will play a big role in that, I just think it\'s another form of payment.""\n\nConversely, Hronopoulous described virtual reality as perhaps a technology that would be propelled forward by the adult industry. He noted that Naugthy America has gone ""back and forth"" on bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin payments, he said, are in the process of being restored on the website, though he did not elaborate more fully.\n\nStill, Hronopoulous lauded bitcoin as a technology, indicating he believes it has a lot to offer in terms of the relative privacy it offers purchasers from third parties.\n\n""I think the idea is strong,"" Hronopoulous concluded.

Meanwhile, operators are reportedly making US$1-3K monthly of their Lamassu units, 2-way machines are on the rise, and other interesting metrics from CoinATMradar.\n\nOn October 28, 2013, Bitcoin's quest to enter the mainstream passed a milestone when the world's very first ATM was installed in a downtown Vancouver coffee shop.\n\nThe machine, a Robocoin two-way bitcoin ATM, generated lots of buzz and managed to proceed over CA$100,000 in 348 transactions in the first 8 days of its existence.\n\nA year and a half later, the number of bitcoin ATMs has rose sharply, today reaching a total of 400 machines available around the globe.\n\nAccording to metrics from Coin ATM Radar, a website that tracks the bitcoin ATM industry, one ATM is installed every two days, outlining the growing demand.\n\nNorth America leading the way\n\n2014 was without a doubt, the year of momentums with the launch of hundreds of bitcoin ATMs around the world, notably in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nWhile the bitcoin ATM industry experienced impressive growth in 2014, North America has been, and still is, leading the way with 133 machines installed throughout the U.S., and 69 machines in Canada. Between them, the two countries host more than half of all the machines available worldwide.\n\nThe geographical breakdown shows that Europe follows North America with 30% of all bitcoin ATMs followed by Asia with 10% (43). Africa remains the most underserved continent with only one machine located in the city of Midrand in South Africa, although it was announced in April, that Botswana should have its first bitcoin ATM operating shortly.\n\nThe top five countries with the most machines are the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K., and Finland.\n\nIndia, which is fairly known for its growing bitcoin community, is surprisingly still unequipped, and the Maghreb region is unquestionably lagging behind.\n\nLamassu holds the largest market share\n\nWhile Robocoin might have been the first widely known manufacturer brand name since the media hype in October 2013, the first Lamassu machine actually went into operation in August 2013, while the Harvey brothers were showing it off at a series of conventions.\n\nLamassu quickly emerged as an industry leader, holding 32.5% of market share at the time being. Following Lamassu is Canadian manufacturer BitAccess, with 15.5% in market share, followed by low-cost bitcoin ATM manufacturer Skyhook, with 14%.\n\nOther metrics from Coin ATM Radar reveal that the proportion of two-way bitcoin ATMs has been on the rise, representing today 41.25% of all the machines operating in the world.\n\nThe current average fee is 5.52% and with roughly the same average rate for buy and sell operations.\n\nFigures released by Lamassu in late November 2014, unveiled one of the main reasons as to why bitcoin ATMs have been popping out so quickly. The manufacturer said that its machines are producing an average profit for their operators of US$1,000-US$3,000 per month.\n\nAt the time, Lamassu said that its standard one-way bitcoin ATMs are averaging transactions worth about US$20,000 a month, with prime locations averaging US$40,000-US$60,000, reported the WSJ's MoneyBeat.\n\nHowever, this lucrative business is not without risks. In January, two bitcoin ATMs were stolen in Amsterdam. One of these machines was a two-way BitAccess BTM, worth about US$10,000. The second was a one-way General Bytes BATMtwo, worth some US$3,000. As of yet, the offenders have not been caught."", 'The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) plans to begin using the Ripple network to settle payments between its subsidiaries soon.\n\nCommonwealth Bank chief information officer David Whiteing revealed the large bank’s interest in Ripple technology yesterday during a speech at an event hosted by the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA).\n\nTechnology news outlet CIO reported Whiteing said, “Bitcoin is a protocol which is now being replicated by non-asset based vendors like Ripple and others. We absolutely see that’s where it’s going to go. The bank has a role to play in that.”\n\n“As a result, we have done a whole bunch of experiments with it. We are about to launch using Ripple as a means to transfer payments between our subsidiaries.”\n\nCommonwealth Bank’s mobile app already features multicurrency bank accounts, which he noted supports up to 15 currencies, and that it wouldn’t be hard to add loyalty points or digital currencies to it.\n\n“It shouldn’t be that difficult for us to then add cryptocurrencies to it and whatever other means of payment transfers people might want,” said Whiteing.\n\nWhiteing, who became CBA’s CIO last year, has been leading the bank’s efforts to innovative. As highlighted in his speech at the AIIA event, CBA is exploring the many new trends in the banking industry. Their mobile banking app already is used by 3.5 million of Commonwealth Bank’s 11 million customers and is something the bank is putting a lot of resources into to developing. CBA is also considered to be part of the “big four” Australian banks, alongside National Australia Bank (NAB), ANZ and Westpac.\n\nWhen contacted by Bitcoin Magazine, a CBA spokesman confirmed the bank has been experimenting with Ripple and added that Commonwealth Bank will continue to test “crypto protocols” and soon “begin a wider experiment with one of our offshore subsidiaries to explore the benefits of interbank transfers using these protocols. The idea is to test in a controlled environment what a bank-to-bank internal transfer might look like using crypto rather than existing payment providers.”\n\nThe spokesman also stressed that use of Ripple’s payment network will stay within the Commonwealth Bank Group and they will continue “to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe news comes a week after Ripple Labs announced a $28 million series A funding round and a pivot to institutional use cases. Previously, the digital currency startup aimed to leverage its payment network for cheaper and more efficient remittances but now, Ripple Labs is focusing its efforts on “correspondent banking, domestic transfers and corporate treasury” applications.\n\nRipple Labs previously announced partnerships and pilots with several financial institutions, including global remittance provider Western Union, but according to Ripple CEO and founder Chris Larsen, there are many more that haven’t yet been publically announced.\n\nIn an interview on the BreakingBanks Radio Show with guest host Chris Skinner, a fintech author and founder of the Financial Services Club, Larsen said, “We have about 30 partners in various stages of proof-of-concept, pilot and production. We have to respect when our partners want to announce they are using our infrastructure. We are very, very excited and pleased with the uptake we are seeing.”\n\nPhoto Mattinbgn / CC 3.0 Unported']"
05/29/2015,"['The regulators are coming, the regulators are coming.\n\nIt was bound to happen sooner or later.\n\nSince venture money keeps fueling the beast called bitcoin and the blockchain, regulators have decided to put their arms around that which is bitcoin in an effort to better control its every move.\n\nSo, to keep up with all the ebbs and flows of who is regulating what, we’ve gathered the recent news on regulation.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York State’s Department of Financial Services granted its first official business license for a bitcoin exchange, itBit, in early May. The license will allow the bitcoin exchange to bring in customers across the country in a legal manner, which then puts the onus of regulation on the state. Allowing itBit to align itself in a similar manner to how banks are regulated is a first for the bitcoin exchange community, and a victory (of sorts – although most don’t necessarily characterize regulation as a victory) for the bitcoin community, as it marks the first fully regulated digital currency exchange in the U.S.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey seems to be following New York’s footsteps and giving bitcoin a regulatory framework. Now, the New Jersey Legislature is attempting to push through a bill that would help regulate digital currencies — and also offer tax breaks for companies that exchange bitcoins. That measure could potentially push more businesses to accept bitcoin.\n\n“I want to encourage innovation here in New Jersey. I think there’s an opportunity for job creation,” said New Jersey Assemblyman Raj Mukherji, who is credited with spearheading the bill with Assemblyman Gordon Johnson.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAs a major banking hub, North Carolina is also investigating how it can legislate bitcoin to help protect consumers and prevent the currency in being used in money laundering efforts. The state’s banking commissioner is trying to help push through legislation, which has passed the state house, and is making its way into the state’s senate.\n\n“There’s two sides to the bitcoin. One side is the clear potential value of the innovation, and what that could portent for the payment system. Since we’re a business friendly state, we want to facilitate that,” North Carolina State Banking Commissioner Ray Grace said in an interview. “We wanted to mitigate the risk while facilitating the potential benefits down the road.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nWhile the East Coast looks to bulk up its bitcoin laws, the West Coast might soon want in, too. Reports indicate that California’s Department of Business Overnight will not look into how to regulate bitcoin itself, but will allow the state’s lawmaking body to weigh in on what to do. While no proposals have made their way to the legislative floor, it appears as though discussions are still in the works.\n\n“We’re still in the process of how or if at all to regulate virtual currency business under our current statutory scheme,” Department of Business Oversight spokesman Tom Dresslar said in an interview.\n\nLegislation that was introduced in March would require maintaining bank-style reserves against possible losses for bitcoin exchanges, but that law hasn’t moved forward. Licensees would have to pay a non-refundable $5,000 registration fee, provide identifying information, and keep enough capital in “investment-grade permissible investments” to cover customers’ deposits.\n\nCalifornia is a particularly interesting state for regulation since it is home to bitcoin companies Coinbase, Ripple Labs and ChangeTip.\n\nWhat Other States Are Doing\n\nOutside of those listed above, reports from CEX.IO, the international bitcoin exchange that joined the U.S. market in April, announced that it was unable to work with businesses or consumers in the following states because they required additional money transmitter licenses for bitcoin companies. These states include: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Guam, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nBut as more states look to clarify bitcoin and digital currency legislative frameworks, it’s likely more of these states will join the ranks of the ones above which plan to put official bitcoin license regulations on the books as statewide measures help give the regulatory measures more clarity for bitcoin businesses looking to open shop.\n\nInternational Bitcoin Bans\n\nWhile bitcoin seems to be moving rapidly in Europe, with places like the U.K. looking to be the hub for bitcoin, there are still plenty of regions around the world looking to heavily regulate — or hold outright ban bitcoin. Countries like China have a partial ban on the digital currency, and Thailand and Vietnam do not recognize bitcoin as an acceptable form of currency — in large part because the digital currency is not issued by the government. Particularly in regions like China and Russia, regulatory hurdles will always remain a struggle for bitcoin. India has also reportedly looked into banning bitcoin but hasn’t moved toward doing so. Bitcoin is also currently banned in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador, Iceland and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nBut on the bright side for bitcoin, Russian authorities just announced they were lifting the country’s ban on bitcoin. So it appears bitcoin will be back in Russia — at least for now.\n\nBitcoin Tracker | Week 75\n\nWhile bitcoin regulation makes its way through the U.S. — and potentially across the rest of the world — there’s always plenty going on with new bitcoin products, services and exchanges. This week, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared some reasons as to why his customers’ bitcoins are safe, and a documentary was released about how to survive on bitcoin. But on the dark side, bitcoin is creating a cultural divide in the financial community.\n\nBitcoin was trading yesterday (May 28) at $237.33, which was up a whole $2.03 from last week’s $235.30\n\nAs always, if you have any news you’d like to share, please send it our way at contactus@pymnts.com.\n\nOn the Plus Side …\n\nA lot of the criticism related to bitcoin exchanges — particularly after the collapse of Mt. Gox — was the risk of bitcoins being lost if a company went under. But Belshe gave some relief to the bitcoin community this week about how his bitcoin exchange protects its users’ money. In an interview, the CEO claimed that “if we disappear, you will still have your money.” Because of the company’s multi-sig bitcoin wallet service provider, it ensures the company cannot transact bitcoins without the customer, but the customer does not need the company to transact bitcoins. Sounds like friction to us.\n\nMay 25, 2015: Bitcoin is getting more support across the globe as reports indicate Indonesia is warming up to the digital currency.\n\nMay 26, 2015: Can someone survive a few weeks on bitcoin?

While New York’s state regulators look to tie up loose ends on bitcoin regulations, there’s also a crowd on the regulatory side who has been quite negative about allowing bitcoin to operate like any other currency. The bitcoin rules are expected to be fully announced in the next week — with clarifications on how bitcoin depositories will be handled under the law.', 'If it feels like you’re seeing more and more articles about blockchain technology lately, it’s because you are. The distributed transaction processing technology, which is behind the notorious Bitcoin crypto currency, has been featured in a big Economist special section, Fortune, and in The Guardian. Numerous books are coming out, and startups trying to capitalize on the technology are popping up like daisies.\n\nThe Nasdaq is using a blockchain technology in its Private Market platform. IBM (IBM) and Samsung (SSNLF) are testing blockchain technology as a way to connect devices for the Internet of things. Startups such as Peernova and Guardtime are suggesting it might be perfect for guarding passwords and other secure documents. Last month, a startup called Factom proposed a blockchain-based solution for the Greek economic crisis.\n\nAdd to this earlier this week, an economist named Eli Dourado suggested that web security was broken and that a version of blockchain could fix it. For those skimming the news in the morning and asking what this wonder technology is that can underlie a currency, solve a connection problem for the Internet of things, keep documents secure and also secure the world wide web, the answer is actually simple. You don’t even need to understand how blockchains work (although you may as well get the basics down).\n\nBlockchains are being applied to all of these problems because they can offer two seemingly contradictory attributes—accountability and decentralization. And taken together that allows really big systems that need to be trustworthy to scale, whether those systems are the Internet, a grouping of sensors, a digital currency or a record of land titles. And if there’s one thing that’s certain as we move more of our economy to the digital world, we need a way to assure both trustworthiness and a way to make sure it scales with the petabytes of information created weekly.\n\nBlockchains are simply distributed transaction processing engines. The technology allows data to be stored in a variety of different places while tracking the relationship between different parties to that data. Most people trying to explain blockchains like to compare it to a ledger. Anytime someone makes a transaction, such as a currency changing hands or a new device being added to a network, it is recorded in the chain and anyone can track what has happened. This is why law enforcement is so keen on Bitcoin—the digital footprints are easy to trace.\n\nHowever, because all of this happens in the realm of math and software, there’s no one entity controlling the documentation. This means if anyone with a powerful enough computer running the appropriate code can participate in the system, making it decentralized and scalable. There are some caveats on the tech side to be aware of.\n\nThere are many kinds of blockchains that differ only in the way their algorithms (math) generate their ledgers. The most popular is the Bitcoin blockchain, which is used for a variety of things outside of the currency. But there is also the Ethereum blockchain, which is what Samsung and IBM are using in their experiments with the Internet of things. There is also Namecoin, which Dourado is writing about as the basis for a new type of web security.\n\nThe other big thing to remember is that blockchains require other technologies to build these decentralized systems of trust. In the case of the internet of things example, there are other technologies that will handle identity, messaging and other elements that might be needed for the overall system. For the web security proposition, the blockchain would act in conjunction with a browser extension and an identification element.\n\nBut even if you know nothing about the technology outside of its rising ubiquity in major newspapers and magazines, know that the reason it has so captured the fancy of technologists and policy makers is because our economy is now more digital than ever and more distributed. As an example, Cisco estimates that global IP traffic will reach 1.1 zettabytes per year (a zettabyte is a trillion gigabytes) in 2016. By 2019, global IP traffic will pass a new milestone figure of 2.0 zettabytes per year. If you take internet traffic as a measure of our digital economy, it’s clear that it’s growing like crazy. Blockchain technologies could let us continue our reliance on the digital economy while adding a layer of accountability and trust that can scale. No wonder everyone is excited about it.\n\nSubscribe to Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.', 'Blockchain, one of the Internet\'s most widely used Bitcoin wallets, has rushed out an update for its Android app after discovering critical cryptographic and programming flaws that can cause users to send digital coins to the wrong people with no warning.\n\nThe vulnerabilities affect a subset of people who run Blockchain for Android on versions 4.1 or older of the mobile OS, according to an advisory published Thursday. The most serious of the flaws is the use of the unencrypted HTTP connections when the app\'s cryptographic engine contacts random.org to obtain random numbers used to generate private keys for Bitcoin addresses. Since January, random.org has required the use of the more secure HTTPS protocol and has returned a 301 Moved Permanently response when accessed through HTTP. As a result, vulnerable installations of Blockchain for Android generated the private key corresponding to the address 1Bn9ReEocMG1WEW1qYjuDrdFzEFFDCq43F, regardless of the address specified by the user.\n\n""To our knowledge, this bug resulted in one specific address being generated multiple times, leading to a loss of funds for a handful of users,"" Thursday\'s advisory stated.\n\nAccording to this entry in the Bitcoin ledger, the owner of the lucky 1Bn9ReEocMG1WEW1qYjuDrdFzEFFDCq43F address appears to have received almost 34 bitcoins since the January, when the address became active (hat tip to Ars reader Bob Loblaw). Nicholas Weaver, a security researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California, said it\'s possible multiple people may have been able to benefit from the error through the use of ""tumbler"" services designed to obfuscate how bitcoins are spent and received. Still, the at today\'s rate, the 34 bitcoins are worth about $8,100.\n\nAdditionally, in certain cases, the pseudorandom number generator in Blockchain for Android failed to access random data that was supposed to be mixed into the random bits downloaded from random.org. Instead of returning an error, the app simply used the 256-bit number provided by random.org as the sole input for generating private keys. That meant the random.org website was the sole supplier of entropy used in the generation process.\n\nIt\'s not entirely clear what causes some users on Android 4.1 and earlier to be vulnerable while others are not affected. Some people have speculated that the vulnerability is present on devices that can\'t access random values that are supposed to be available in the /dev/urandom file.\n\nThe horror\n\nCryptography and security experts were aghast at the scale of the error. Beyond no one using HTTPS by default to access random.org—and the months-long failure to catch the 301 response—there\'s a more fundamental error of judgement. Random numbers are one of the most important components in secure cryptographic functions. Critics said it was a mistake of epic proportion for Blockchain to be so casual about how it went about obtaining the raw material for such key ingredients.\n\n""WTF? The blockchain.info Android app was just getting \'random\' numbers from the Internet?"" Weaver wrote on Twitter. ""I think I need to write a followon rant: how to make money in Bitcoin with sabotaged pRNGs. Reduce entropy pool to 30 bits with \'improvements\',"" he added.\n\nThe vulnerabilities involved the use of the LinuxSecureRandom programming interface to generate pseudo random numbers instead of SecureRandom, which is the more standard interface for Android developers. The idea behind the customization in Blockchain seemed to be the ability to pull in random values from two sources—random.org and a resource residing in the OS itself. In retrospect, the lack of HTTPS protections, the failure to detect a 301 response, and the inability of some devices to pull random bits from the OS itself underscore how easy it is to make mistakes when developing home-grown cryptographic solutions.\n\nFurther Reading Google confirms critical Android crypto flaw used in $5,700 Bitcoin heist ""It only seems to affect a tiny number of devices,"" Johns Hopkins University professor Matt Green told Ars. ""On those devices it\'s catastrophic unless you\'ve patched.""\n\nIt\'s not the first time crypto failures have caused Android wallet users to lose real-world money. Almost two years ago, a critical crypto flaw in Android itself was exploited to pilfer more than $5,700 worth of the digital coin.

The decline reversed at $235.02 (Bitfinex) and 1460 CNY (BTC-Cina).

At the 4-hour timeframe, reverse divergence is setting in on the move lower. Conceivably the 4-hour 200MA ($235 Bitfinex / 1460 CNY BTC-China) is the target and should provide support, thereby, terminating the decline.\n\nLater during the day:\n\nPrice’s reaction to the Fib lines is interesting, although its intended path is not so clear. What does increase confidence that short-term trend has turned up is the divergence indicated by RSI on the last low. But “Ha!” some might say – “Look at what happened in the left of the chart, despite red divergence dots!” Indeed, well-spotted, yet consider price was in a larger range of motion back then; it was below both descending 20 and 200MAs and had consistently been making lower lows for 5 weeks prior to this final low. This is opposite in almost every regard to the current condition:\n\nAt the present moment, price is above an ascending 200MA in the 4hr chart. There have been a succession of higher lows for the past 4 weeks; and, instead of having just fallen through a long-term Fib line, price is currently bumping up against one, apparently seeking to break through resistance.\n\nBeing ignorant is not so much a shame, as being unwilling to learn. – Benjamin Franklin\n\nBitcoin Price Not Moving\n\nBTC-China 1-Day Chart\n\nThe past 5 weeks have seen a decrease in the range of motion in the Bitcoin price chart and an apparent inability of price to move below $225 and beyond $250. The range has contracted, during the past week, to $230 – $245. The question as to why this is happening has two answers: one is general to markets, and the other, specific to Bitcoin.\n\nIn most price charts, there are times when the market enters a period of consolidation, just as we see now. The range of price motion decreases over time and narrows to a virtual flatline. There are two common explanations for this: 1) market participants are unsure about the direction of the larger trend, and 2) the underlying psychological engine of market activity, namely volatility, is ebbing prior to a sudden onset of buying and selling.\n\nThe 1-day candle timeframe BTC-China chart, above, highlights times when price action had slowed down and narrowed to a small trading range. Notice that, in each case, the lull was preceded by a surge and followed by a rally. This brings us to the Bitcoin chart-specific reason for the current doldrums, and the repeating pattern can be seen in the chart:\n\nFollowing significant price corrections the Bitcoin chart, typically, surges and then consolidates before launching into a larger price rally. During the consolidation phase, the volatile activity of the preceding surge ebbs away, as the market quietens down to a price lull and takes stock of what just happened. This phase is characterized by a narrowing of the range of momentum indicators, such as MACD, to almost zero. Then, as if out of nowhere, price begins moving and, in an apparent positive feedback cycle, traders all pile into the direction of trend, thereby, causing a unanimous price rally.\n\nReading the technical signs in the Bitcoin chart, price is currently in a consolidation phase, forming a base from which it should rally – if the historical chart pattern plays out here.\n\nVarious technical analyses explored at xbt.social have put the ETA of the advance between now and the middle of July. The past year’s decline has been formidable and will take time to expend its dying throes in the chart. In the meantime, price may still make some unexpected moves in the established price range since January, but inevitably advance will become the dominant mode. The massive speculative interest in Bitcoin price is, after all, in this super-commodity’s ability to rally unlike any other market instrument in history.\n\nCoinCompeition\n\nThe leaderboard is presented, even though no significant changes are evident. Presumably, traders simply kept their positions unchanged while waiting for price to take direction. Ongoing consolidation may see Winner the winner and Fijibound stay at home! Hoping for a price move and Good Luck to contestants.\n\nJoin CoinCompetition and win bitcoins. Weekly round starts June 1st. Winner: 1 BTC, Runner-Up: 0.25 BTC\n\nSummary\n\nIf Bitcoin price can establish above $238 (Bitfinex) and 1490 CNY (BTC-China), then the probability of continuing advance increases significantly. Keeping below these levels – or falling away from them, over the weekend – opens a can of decline below $230, and alters our longer-term outlook.\n\nBitfinex orderbook depth and Buy/Sell Volume:\n\nClick here for the CCN interactive price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

The initiative allows Bitstamp’s clients to get US dollars, Euros or British pounds denominated debit cards, which can be either virtual or physical and loaded with Bitcoin.\n\nThe program is being launched thanks to a partnership between Bitstamp and the payment processor AstroPay. The cards will be available to the exchange’s customers based in the European Union and will be accepted by any business that currently accepts major credit and debit cards.\n\nBitstamp’s card, which was launched on Wednesday (27th), has three different stages of verification. And, to make sure the program is completely safe for the customers, each stage has its own spending limit.\n\nThe first stage doesn’t require know-your-customer verification and allows for €2,500 worth of transactions per year. Security is most demanding on Stage 2, but the annual loading limit is higher and the card includes access to ATMs. The third stage requires government ID, proof of residence and a certified source of funds document. However, the annual spending limit is quite high, at €125,000.\n\nBitstamp is already accepting orders for its new debit cards. At first, the cards will be provided in a digital form and can only be used at websites. The exchange’s customers can also order a physical card that can be used at any brick-and-mortar retail stores for $10, but the first 100 clients to order the card will get it for free.\n\nThe card will take about two weeks to arrive and can then be loaded with BTC using a Bitstamp account. According to the exchange, “transferring funds from your Bitstamp account to your card carries flat $10 fee for amounts up to $1000. For transfers above $1000, a two percent fee is charged.”\n\nTransfers to cards denominated in Euros or British pounds will be converted automatically, Bitstamp informed in a blog post. Card holders will be have access to their transaction history and will be able to retrieve their PIN, order new cards and more using the site Cardportal.com.\n\nThe card is not available to United States citizens at the moment, but the exchange plans to expand the service in the near future.', 'Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analyzing media and its impact.\n\n\n\nDespite featuring its fair share of salacious material – including the run-up to the sentencing in the Ross Ulbricht trial, this week\'s news cycle was perhaps more mature in its assessment of bitcoin as a financial technology.\n\nSpurred by the inclusion of former US Department of Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to Xapo\'s board of directors, more enterprising journalists sought to venture into topics that aimed to illuminate debates on bitcoin as a monetary system.\n\nArguments centered largely on whether bitcoin represents a truly unique breakthrough in the history of money, one that can only be compared to disruptive technologies like the Internet, or whether it is a passing fad, one that, despite promise, is doomed to repeat past mistakes.\n\nSummers meets magnifying glass\n\nFT Alphaville\'s Izabella Kaminska, one of the more outspoken and well-spoken bitcoin critics, produced a retrospective piece which questioned Summers\' motives for joining the board of bitcoin firm Xapo.\n\nKaminska made her opinion of the company known, chiding Xapo for its business model. A specialist in deep cold storage, Xapo uses a process by which bitcoins are kept secure in reinforced underground bunkers with all manner of military-grade protections.\n\nHere, Kaminska reintroduces the idea that bitcoin is a speculative bubble that will eventually deflate, one akin to the \'tulip mania\' of the 1600s where the value of tulips skyrocketed, only to again fall.\n\nUsing past statements, Kaminska aimed to suggest that Summers should perhaps be against the idea that bitcoins could have lasting value.\n\nShe wrote:\n\n""Worth noting in this context, of course, is that Larry Summers is also the man arguing that bubbles are a bit of an inevitability in a secular stagnated world.""\n\nKaminska cites Summers\' statement in the Financial Times from last year, in which he is quoted as saying:\n\n""It is better to support demand by supporting productive investment or highly valued consumption than by artificially inflating bubbles. On the other hand, it is only rational to recognise that low interest rates raise asset values and drive investors to take greater risks, making bubbles more likely.""\n\nSummers himself has presented mixed views on bitcoin in public appearances. For example, Summers has sought to portray the payments network as one that requires the help of regulation to succeed.\n\nFurther, much of his praise for bitcoin seems based in its comparison to the Internet, which he noted was also roundly dismissed in its early days.\n\nStill, this didn\'t stop Kaminska from poking fun at Summers\' appointment to the company\'s board.\n\n""You might as well sit on the advisory boards of the companies pumping [bubbles] so as to advise and steer them?"" she concluded.\n\nSpeculation on speculation\n\nElsewhere, the evolution of the bitcoin economy was discussed by Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group and a noted early-stage investor in bitcoin startups.\n\nSpeaking to Entrepreneur, during the Inside Bitcoins Conference in New York last month, Silbert discussed whether he felt bitcoin could become a stable form of money, or rather, how it could develop into a perhaps more mature means of value exchange.\n\nSilbert said:\n\n""I do think today the main use of bitcoin is speculative investment, which I think is OK, because in order for bitcoin to become a rail we have to have a monetary base. The monetary base of bitcoin today is about $4bn, which does not lend itself to be used as a rail.\n\nSilbert added that he believes bitcoin must still be ""established as a form of value"", suggesting that this evolution will likely take place over time.\n\n""For bitcoin to be a global currency the volatility has to decrease or we need to hedge out risk,"" he said.\n\nSilbert\'s statements follow Bloomberg\'s Bitcoin Brief, released last week. The report, to which Silbert contributed, tackled the question of how speculation is affecting the bitcoin economy, suggesting that this is perhaps holding back bitcoin from becoming a true digital currency.\n\n""There\'s a rule in economics called Gresham\'s law, which is that when you have two currencies, people tend to hoard the one with greater material value and spend the one with less material value,"" it reads, continuing:\n\n""If people think bitcoin has value as a speculative asset, they will hoard it, and buy their groceries with greenbacks instead – after all, they expect bitcoin\'s price to go up, and the price of greenback to go down.""\n\n""This makes it more difficult for bitcoin to establish itself as a medium of exchange, because no one wants to actually spend them,"" concluded the report.\n\nA question of worth\n\nLinking into the debate, Forbes, a regular in this weekly series, re-posted a Quora piece with the following headline ""Is the Price of Bitcoin Going to Bounce Back?""\n\nThe piece again takes on the question of how the health of bitcoin\'s economy should be assessed.\n\n""Given that the price of bitcoin is determined solely by supply and demand, and that the supply of new bitcoins is predetermined, with new coins being issued steadily at a rate that drops sharply in the future, the only variable of interest is demand.""\n\nThe piece continued:\n\n""And the demand for bitcoin is determined by how useful bitcoins are to people. So if you want to know whether the price of bitcoins will go up in the future, you have to ask yourself how useful you think bitcoins are going to be.""\n\nThe article seemed less positive with regard\'s to the digital currency\'s potential, at least today, arguing that there has been little evidence to suggest the technology is mature enough to compete against traditional financial incumbents.\n\n""To somebody who already has access to modern financial tools like bank accounts and credit cards, these are very few new things bitcoin has to offer,"" the report read. ""The compelling uses for bitcoin so far are to serve as a vehicle for speculation [...] and as a method of gambling and making purchases on the dark markets"".\n\nPete Rizzo contributed reporting.\n\nNewspaper image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Now he's launching Veritaseum, a Bitcoin solution which aims to disrupt the traditional financial services model by eliminating the need for middlemen.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to Reggie Middleton to discuss his background, his solution and where he thinks the Bitcoin industry is headed.\n\n“Several clients asked me to look into Bitcoin, and when I did my jaw dropped.” - Reggie Middleton\n\nCoinTelegraph: Your personal journey to where you are in the Bitcoin Community today was an interesting one – can you talk a little about that?\n\nReggie Middleton: I struck out on my own at age 23 creating mutual fund arbitrage programs, selling risk management and insurance programs to municipalities, creating dot.coms during the frenzy (basically, the first version of Google Docs 20 years before its time), and creating fundamental analysis software. I was (and still am) a full-time dad raising three children. I bought distressed real estate in downtown Brooklyn in 2000. The fundamentals were in place, liquidity via loose lending standards, optimal pricing (distressed only) and quantitative metrics were prime (the bubble was just getting on its way).\n\n“[I] schemed on shorting each and every financial institution that ever did business with me as I blogged about it.”\n\nAfter a 1,200% return 5 years later 2+2 started to equal 63 - it was time for the exit. I sold off my portfolio for literally multiples of what I paid for them just a couple of years earlier after pocketing real cash flow and schemed on shorting each and every financial institution that ever did business with me as I blogged about it. Since I couldn’t find any decent research, I decided to roll my own by hiring a few analysts and teaching them my critical, spreadsheet-driven method of looking at things.\n\nThe blog became very popular (~2007) to the point where people were actually getting belligerent in their requests for opinion causing me to put up a paywall. Three days of silence later I got a call from Wall Street to turn on 3 members of their prop desk if they wired me US$10k. BoomBustBlog.com was born.\n\nSeven years and roughly 80 highly contrarian, accurate boom/bust predictions later… Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Countrywide, WaMu, residential and commercial real estate busts, Blackberry fail, Google pop and Apple drop, European sovereign debt crisis, etc. Several clients asked me to look into Bitcoin, and when I did my jaw dropped.\n\nProgrammable money with its own transportation rails that can sidestep money center and central banks via an unhackable, open consensus ledger? Even though I missed the boat on BTC price gains, I was actually right on time for the smart contract gravy train.\n\nCT: You made a name for yourself in finance by predicting the demise of the, then very buoyant, housing market and then the banks that had become incredibly wealthy from trading MBS etc. – did you have an inherent skepticism about financial services or was it a result of what you saw with regards to leverage and counterparty risk?\n\nRM: I’m a very analytical person. If you went through the balance sheets of the banks during that time (or today) you’d notice plenty that didn’t make sense. It’s as simple as adding 2+2 and then realizing it didn’t really equal 64! Now, add on top of that my natural “skepticism about financial services” business model and you had what was essentially a hound on the scent of insolvency armed with spreadsheet wielding analysts and a penchant for sniffing out bullshit.\n\nCT: When was your ‘eureka moment’ with regards to applying Bitcoin to this industry?\n\nRM: It was October 2013, when I read the “contracts” section of the bitcoin Wiki. The minute I got through the first paragraph my entire brain lit up! Smart contracts are by far the most disruptive aspect of the bitcoin “invention” yet they are being overlooked and dismissed by most investors and practitioners. I expect this to change in a dramatic way once education permeates the sector.\n\n“Veritaseum contracts are superior to traditional contract law in terms of security, costs and efficiency and reduces the frictions of most other transaction costs commonly found in the financial system[.]”\n\nCT: Can you explain (as simply as possible) the workings of Veritaseum and its difference from the traditional financial services model\n\nRM: In Roman mythology, Veritas was the goddess of truth. Veritaseum is the business expression of this truth, the ability to transact with anyone, anywhere knowing full well their ability to deliver upon any promises made and what their intent to deliver is.\n\nVeritaseum is the culmination of what happens when truth in transaction and business is constant and a given. It is literally Truth in Transaction, what we call the unbreakable promise. In practice, this means two or more parties create a smart contract – a computer protocols that facilitates, verifies, or enforces the negotiation or performance of an agreement.\n\nOur smart contracts feature a graphical user interface (GUI) that enable simple and extremely rapid creation of terms normally found in any financial purchase or sale – basically enabling the logic of contractual clauses without a legal contract, but binding through cryptography and math.\n\nThe resultant contract is fully funded (assets are pledged up front), self-executing, self-enforcing, unbreachable and viewable by all parties involved at all times, along with all of the assets involved in the contract.\n\nVeritaseum contracts are superior to traditional contract law in terms of security, costs and efficiency and reduces the frictions of most other transaction costs commonly found in the financial system, e.g. Policing and enforcement costs - making sure the other party sticks to the terms of the contract, and taking appropriate action (often through the legal system) if they don’t.\n\n“Even with all of these ‘can’t trust ‘em’ safeguards, the [legacy] system still comes crashing down as entities discover ways to circumvent the safeguards of trust.”\n\nThe technical term for this is a zero trust system. When zero trust is required, anybody can transact with anybody else for anything, anywhere in the world nearly instantaneously through the blockchain.\n\nThe legacy financial system is essentially the opposite of Veritaseum. Actors inherently cannot trust each other. This distrust calls for the need of “so-called” trusted thirds parties to mediate and intermediate deals. Even these “trusted” third parties have trust issues so they must contract with 4th and 5th parties (and often more) to mitigate risk and build trust in a trustless business environment.\n\nEven with all of these “can’t trust ‘em” safeguards, the system still comes crashing down as entities discover ways to circumvent the safeguards of trust. Methods used in the past (and present) include wayward accounting, outright fraud, off balance sheet vehicles, failure to mark to market, rehypothecation, excess leverage, opaque reporting, regulatory capture, etc.\n\nTransactions have yet to take full advantage of modern technology, so although institutions can execute multiple trades in literally milliseconds (think HFT), it still takes T+3 days to settle a single retail trade – and it costs too much!\n\nCT: I find it somewhat ironic that you are skeptical of the traditional Wall Street model (as well as of esoteric financial instruments such as complex derivatives) but you know that the first real users of Veritaseum are likely to be hedge funds and other traditional Wall Street players, probably seeking two sides of a complex derivatives trade – how do you square this?\n\nRM: I’m skeptical of the Wall Street compensation model, because it incentivizes actors to move against the best interests of their clients. I’m not skeptical of esoteric instruments per se, but I am skeptical of the use of said products without:\n\nA proper understanding of them (from both the vendor and the client side) Proper safety nets\n\nI believe entities should be able to trade whatever they want provided they know what they are trading and the risks in doing so are limited solely to their balance sheet and not the taxpaying populace a whole. Veritaseum simply provides the tools to allow institutions to do their thing transparently, efficiently and safely. And while the first waves of material revenue should come from larger players, individuals are using the platform right now. You don’t need to make big trades (you can trade 10 cents at a time) or complex trades (you can simply buy AAPL exposure for USD).\n\nCT: Can you explain how Veritaseum is able to minimize counterparty risk without creating an intermediary?\n\nRM: The true nature of bitcoin, its blockchain and by extension Veritaseum is that of autonomy. You have original possession of your private keys and can transact directly with others like this without a problem. That is the invention, and that is what makes Bitcoin unique and powerful.\n\nParticipants in the Veritaseum platform are wholly and solely in control of their own assets. By removing the need to rely upon other entities to handle your assets (custody, transfer or settlement), we have essentially removed 3rd party credit/default/counterparty risk in addition to significantly reducing friction and costs by eliminating rent seeking middlemen. Entities that ask you to send them BTC are breaking the autonomy mold and then attempting to glue it back together with extra technology, more 3rd party assurances and regulation.\n\n“Using smart Bitcoin like dumb assets is akin to buying a 2015 Ferrari 458 Speciale A and then removing the (private) keys and pushing it around town instead of driving.”\n\nThis is how a purely autonomous platform proves to be both safer and superior to heteronomous platforms that seek to provide assurances and insurances such as FDIC and SIPC protection. The very reason why these insurances are necessary is because you are allowing third parties to take possession of your assets in the first place! This is a very, very important point for it goes to the heart of what advantages are had by utilizing the bitcoin platform.\n\nWhy strip the (free) autonomous security protections of Bitcoin away from customers and then charge them to buy another set of inferior protections that also limit their autonomy? Using smart Bitcoin like dumb assets is akin to buying a 2015 Ferrari 458 Speciale A and then removing the (private) keys and pushing it around town instead of driving.\n\nOf course, even with 3rd party risks removed, you still have to worry about your counterparty. Veritaseum solves this problem by forcing all parties to prefund their contracts fully, and up front. No one could default, even if they wanted to. Institutional players accustomed to high leverage systems can use our digital leverage to turn up the risk/reward dial as high as their respective stomachs can possibly withstand.\n\nWith the ability of implementing enough leverage to practically guarantee dramatic price action in just a few trading hours, there is no issue of capital efficiency. Of course, the restriction here is that you’re P&L is restricted to you capital at risk, meaning you can only win or lose the amount that you have wagered. You can’t bet US$10 million to lose US$1 billion and then rely on the taxpayer to cover the difference.\n\n“Veritaseum is nothing short of a highly ‘programmable version’ of dollars.”\n\nCT: The possible applications of this solution are numerous: from trading to P2P lending to investments. What made you choose to target everything at once rather than selecting one, more narrow segment of the market (such as exchanges only) to try and disrupt?\n\nRM: I created the vehicle (Veritaseum) as a universal platform upon which to build industry solutions. I’m not trying to “target everything at once.” I’m providing the tools to allow my sales staff and solution providers to enable customers and clients to build their own solutions or buy said solutions directly from us.\n\nWe will create business verticals to address separately from a marketing perspective. Keep in mind that the universality of Veritaseum literally makes it a write once – run anywhere solution. Think about asking the same question of the purveyor of the dollar bill. “What made you choose to target everything at once with dollars rather than selecting one, more narrow segment of the market with which people can use dollars?”\n\nVeritaseum is nothing short of a highly “programmable version” of dollars."", 'There is a myth in certain circles that it is too late to get into Bitcoin -- that if you didn\'t buy in early then you missed the boat. Not so, says Roger Ver. You might expect him to say that, though: he is also known as Bitcoin Jesus, after all.\n\nIt feels like a lot has happened to Bitcoin during its short lifetime, but the reality is that it is still early days for the cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is, however, changing fast.\n\n""Just this year we\'re seeing major financial institutions get involved in Bitcoin,"" says Ver, speaking on stage at Pioneers Festival in Vienna. Big banks like Goldman Sachs are getting involved -- it\'s hitting mainstream Wall Street. ""A couple of years ago this would have been unimaginable,"" he says.\n\nThere are more and more ATM machines where you can put cash in and Ver thinks that this year there\'s a chance we\'ll see traditional ATM integrate Bitcoin too. ""This is heading towards worldwide adoption.""\n\nRead next Bitcoin\'s scaling problems mean it won\'t make it as a currency Bitcoin\'s scaling problems mean it won\'t make it as a currency\n\nOne company that Ver thinks has a lot of potential to benefit from Bitcoin is Amazon, which endures an annual struggle to turn a profit, and spends around $2.6 billion a year on credit card processing fees. Ver asserts that if Amazon switched to using Bitcoin, it could cancel out that spending and in doing so, double its annual profit.\n\n""I want to point out to you that if Amazon adopts Bitcoin, it won\'t just be Amazon,"" he adds. ""If the entire world adopts Bitcoin each Bitcoin will be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.""\n\nThere are somewhere between 5 and 10 billion Bitcoin users in the world -- because of anonymity, the exact number is unclear, but one thing Ver is sure of is that it is going to grow. People will be using it for everything, from gambling, to sending money to foreign workers, to grocery shopping. ""More and more people are going to start using it, there\'s absolutely no doubt in my mind,"" he says.\n\nOne of the things that will increase confidence in Bitcoin is the extensive startup and VC investment in the cryptocurrencies infrastructure that is currently ""exploding"". Once upon a time there was only one Bitcoin exchange, but now there are many and they\'re getting better and better all the time. It is becoming hard for Ver himself to keep track, he says. ""Somehow i wound up with the nickname Bitcoin Jesus so people expect me to know about everything everywhere.""\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother thing that will increase usage is general awareness, of course. ""Once people see Bitcoin and how it works they realise this isn\'t just a flash in the pan,"" says Ver. He believes the currency\'s impact will be ""on par with the internet... in terms of how it\'s changing the way people around the world are behaving"".\n\n""Because the supply of Bitcoin is limited, the price of Bitcoin is going to have to increase and increase very substantially over time,"" says Ver. ""My advice is that if you\'re interested in Bitcoin and excited by Bitcoin then buy some Bitcoin and hold onto them and you\'re likely to do very well over time.""', 'For most of us, bitcoin doesn’t make much sense. The cryptocurrency has been trusted for almost 200,000 transactions totaling more than $45 million dollars in the last 24 hours, but it still feels unfamiliar. It\'s digital; it\'s global; it breezes through national and legal barriers. We literally can’t grasp it. This week at IDEAS CITY, Foamspace is trying to explain bitcoin in a new way . The interactive installation puts cryptocurrency in the context of the city, making both a bit easier to understand.\n\nIDEAS CITY is part conference and part art fair. It was founded by the New Museum in 2011 and made a mission of bringing art, education, and civic action to public places. The theme of this year’s IDEAS CITY is Invisible City, and explores “transparency and surveillance, citizenship and representation, expression and suppression, participation and dissent, and the enduring quest for visibility in the city.”\n\nWhat sort of project do those themes inspire? There will be a painting by drones, a “performative conference” in hot air balloons, pop-up playgrounds, and Foamspace.\n\nFoamspace is the Monopoly of bitcoin. Participants learn about bitcoin through a simplified, fun version of the currency. But where Monopoly is competitive, Foamspace is communal. And at the end of the game, the play money becomes a real investment fund.\n\nRyan King, Katya Zavyalova, Nikolay Martynov, and Betty Fan started the project in January 2015 and found inspiration in the IDEAS CITY prompt: “The theme for this year’s IDEAS CITY Festival is the Invisible City and the material we chose to use for our installation is omnipresent yet invisible in our everyday lives: EPS Geofoam.""\n\nGeofoam blocks are usually a structural support inside of buildings. Foamspace puts the out-of-sight material into public view to demonstrate bitcoin exchanges.', 'The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) announced this week it will use Ripple technology to facilitate payments between its subsidiaries, describing distributed protocols as ""the way of the future"".\n\nLast May, Germany\'s Fidor became the first bank to integrate Ripple\'s protocol into its payments infrastructure, with two US banks, CBW Bank and Cross River Bank, following suit four months later.\n\nTech news site CIO quoted the CBA\'s own Chief Information Officer David Whiteing as saying the bank had ""done a whole bunch of experiments"" with bitcoin and other cryptocurrency technologies.\n\nWhiteing said he sees no reason why bank accounts could not be used to store fiat money, cryptocurrencies and other assets like store loyalty points in the future.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Bitcoin is a protocol which is now being replicated by non-asset based vendors like Ripple and others. We absolutely see that’s where it’s going to go. The bank has a role to play in that.""\n\nA spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that the CBA has been performing tests with cryptocurrency technologies.\n\nThe organisation will begin a wider experiment with one of its offshore subsidiaries to explore the benefits of intrabank transfers using these protocols, they said, adding:\n\n""The idea is to test in a controlled environment what a bank-to-bank internal transfer might look like using crypto rather than existing payment providers. We are ensuring our testing remains internal within Commonwealth Bank Group and we continue to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements.""\n\nBanking giant\n\nWhile its decision to use Ripple for payments between subsidiaries remains experimental, the Commonwealth Bank\'s sheer size makes its announcement all the more significant.\n\nThe 104 year-old banking group is one of Australia\'s \'big four\'. According to its 2014 Annual Report, it made AU$8.65bn ($6.84bn) profit and has over 44,300 full-time employees.\n\nCBA recently acquired a digital banking-related business in South Africa, Tyme Capital.\n\nWhiteing made several references to mobile banking and payments solutions, especially in Africa where 1.2 billion people have far greater access to mobile phone services than traditional banking networks.\n\nThe CBA\'s mobile banking app in Australia already supports up to 15 international currencies, allowing its 3.5 million users to make instant payments in whichever one they choose. It ""shouldn’t be that difficult"" to add cryptocurrencies to that list, he said.\n\nAsia-Pacific focus\n\nRipple Labs and its subsidiary XRP II appeared to be going through a rocky period after being fined $700,000 by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for non-reporting of certain transactions in 2013-14.\n\nIt bounced back just two weeks later, however, with an announcement it had raised $28m in Series A funding from several venture capital and technology companies.\n\nAs part of its expansion efforts, Ripple Labs announced at the beginning of April that it would open subsidiaries in the Asia-Pacific region to focus on the over $3tn in intra-Asia trade, which is expected to surpass European trade flows to be the world\'s largest by 2016.\n\nIts first regional office opened in Sydney under new managing director Dilip Rao, and is currently undertaking a local hiring drive.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

05/30/2015,"['Changpeng Zhao left OKCoin earlier this year, with the company owing him $10,000 and apparently feeling no obligation to pay him.\n\nA company that doesn’t treat its employees well will inevitably have other problems, and so Zhao’s exit could have served as a warning for the rest of the community, including Roger Ver, who says they owe him tens of thousands of dollars now.\n\nZhao took the time to make a lengthy statement to the Bitcoin community via Reddit recently. As a former high-ranking company official, his view of how things work at OKCoin is valuable insight.\n\nI tried hard to stay out of the public dispute between OKCoin and Roger Ver, hoping they would resolve themselves, over a contract relatively small in size. […] I have also always refrained from saying anything bad about my previous employer. But the situation has left me no choice but to make a public statement.\n\nOne of the more important things he said in his lengthy statement was that, initially, he tried to take the deal between OKCoin and Roger Ver off OK Coin’s hands. He says that Roger Ver is a friend of his, and that the gentleman’s agreement made with Ver was made between friends and businessmen. This is an historically bad way to do business.\n\nAlso read: Roger Ver & OKCoin In Dramatic & Public Contract Dispute\n\nA written contract can serve both parties equally. The more money you’re talking about, the worse an idea it is to do something without legal documents to bind you and the other party. But, this wasn’t the overwhelming point that Zhao was attempting to make. The overwhelming point he was trying to make was that he expected more of OKCoin regarding their commitment to Roger Ver:\n\nRoger and I are friends. We have enough respect and trust for each other that we both thought a simple gentleman’s agreement would suffice. I did not expect OKCoin would delay or default on payments of $10k in size. For this I apologize. I also did not expect OKCoin would not pay my salary for the time I spent there.\n\n“Still a Good Deal”\n\nZhao believes the contract works for both parties equally, and that OKCoin should have no problem making the money it agreed to make from Bitcoin.com. He talks about how the company had planned to make around (at least) $76,000 from 2,500 unique daily visitors, saying the breakdown of advertisements was provided to him by OKCoin CEO Star Xu.\n\nOKCoin internally planned to charge $12,000/month for two top ad spots, $8000/month for 6 middle position spots, and a number of $4000/month ad spots below the first scroll. […] A few ex-employees can confirm this.\n\nIn a move that Zhao considers a blunder, the company turned away advertisers who preferred to pay based on the pay-per-click model, rather than the monthly flat-fee model. For smaller firms, monthly advertising rates don’t work because, as with any advertising, there is no guarantee of return on investment. With pay-per-click, they can be sure that they’re getting something for their money, and often enough it can cost the advertiser more than the flat-rate model.\n\nOKCoin “Violating its Obligations”\n\nZhao says that he remembers version seven of the contract, though he does not recall a later version, which is the crux of the dispute between Roger Ver and the exchange. Ver says that his signature was forged onto the supposed version eight of the contract, and OKCoin says he is just mad because things didn’t work his way. OKCoin also now says that they can prove Ver signed the eighth version. Zhao says it doesn’t matter, either way you look at it, OKCoin is out of line in this situation.\n\nI signed version 7 of the contract with Roger. […] I do not recall a version 8. […] With either version of the contract, OKCoin is seriously violating its obligations.\n\nOther Problems with OKCoin\n\nZhao’s post overall serves as a word of caution against using the OKCoin Bitcoin exchange at all. He alleges that they are using bots on their exchanges, similar to the ones who ran up the price of Bitcoin to unsustainable levels on Mt. Gox.\n\nHe says that they are not transparent, and at this point in the short history of Bitcoin, we have learned that a lack of transparency can quite easily translate into a lack of authenticity or even to nefarious activities. Zhao joins Roger Ver in calling for a full proof of reserve by OKCoin but says that they will gladly fake such proof.\n\nI can confirm OKCoin removed a number of accounts (used by OKCoin bots) to pass the Proof-of-Reserve audit in Aug 2014. In essence, these bots trade on fractional (or fictional) reserves. Stephan Thomas was lied to during the audit. This is an unfortunate limitation of the proof-of-reserves method. […] As a side note, Stephan Thomas specifically did not want any compensation for his audit efforts. Before the audit, OKCoin offered to make a donation in his name to a charity of his choice. He named a charity. After the audit was carried out, OKCoin never made that donation.\n\nThe matter between Roger Ver and OKCoin will resolve itself eventually, but yet another black mark will be left on the history of Bitcoin. Perhaps it’s time for truly decentralized exchanges, for cutting out these middle men who are profiting while not necessarily offering anything concrete to the confusing world of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat do you think? Should OKCoin call it quits if they are unable to meet their obligations, or should people like Roger Ver and Changpeng Zhao just cut their losses and carry on? Like and share above and comment below!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'By now, few would argue that the technology behind Bitcoin isn’t groundbreaking. Now that blockchain technology is shifting from a fringe phenomenon to being studied by traditional finance and governments, it is gaining more and more momentum and interest from VCs, financial experts and traders. But while this tech has come a long way in such a short time, some of its proposed potential applications are pretty unconventional. Currency aside, listed below are six of some of the most interesting and perhaps revolutionary use-cases for the blockchain.\n\nStreamium’s Pay-as-you-go\n\nStreamium.io is an app that allows users to stream videos live, with viewers paying at a per minute basis. Naturally, this decentralized Pay-As-You-Go service has attracted everything from cam-girls to “a live stream of my dog chasing a laser in their diaper.” While there is no limit for how much you can charge your viewers, it seems that the minimum payment at the moment is 1 satoshi per second.\n\nBitnation’s Spacechain Program\n\nWhen a futurologist hears the word space “Spacechain”, they would think of time-warping fleets of spaceships traveling across the universe. The reality, however, is somewhat less exciting. Founded by Iman Mirbloki, a 35-year-old IT specialist based in Sweden, Spacechain aims to create a decentralized space program “where everybody is welcome to join, and all technological developments are shared on an open source basis with all users”. While it all seems like hot air, future space missions calendars are accessible on the website, and Spacechain plans on making the first ever Bitcoin transaction from space to earth.\n\nCoinometrics…metrics\n\nReddit’s /r/bitcoin is rife with bitcoin trade volume & price speculators, who might be right in their assumptions at times, but rely heavily on rumors and gossip. Without any credible blockchain metrics to determine the profitability of a certain blockchain app, entrepreneurs are unable to persuade investors who are mainly interested in in-depth analysis. This is where Coinometrics comes in. By deploying “Bitmon super-nodes” across the planet, the service can accurately calculate how many transactions occur daily, as well as the dollar value of these transactions.\n\nBitfury’s bitcoin mining light bulbs\n\nShared as a tweet by Marc van der Chijs directly from the Blockchain summit, this light bulb automatically mines bitcoin when screwed in. We’re not sure just yet whether this light bulb relies on WiFi or Bluetooth, or if it even mines enough bitcoin to cover the lighting costs, but the idea itself acts as humble introduction to the internet of things – or it could be a friendly jab at 21.co’s Bitcoin in everything attitude. Bitfury isn’t all bitcoin light bulbs, though, the company claims to have already “delivered three prior generations of silicon chips, and has a roadmap to double performance-per-watt every 6-12 months.” This may mean that by 2020, bitcoin-mining household items could be an everyday way to handle microtransactions.\n\nBitfury developed a light bulb that automatically mines Bitcoin when you screw it in. #sideproject #blockchainsummit pic.twitter.com/8liCtOwlKV — Marc van der Chijs (@chijs) 27 ??? 2015\n\nOnename\n\nFounded by Ryan Shea & Muneeb Ali, Onename allows users to create tamper-proof digital identities for themselves by being the ""first comprehensive blockchain-based identity service.""

Factom – which has sold well over 4,379,972 “FACTOIDS” to date – aims to use blockchain technology to simplify record business processes. Common security and compliance issues are addressed by adding another data layer for the blockchain, via their “proof of existence, proof of process, & proof of audit” procedure. In other words, Factom aims to show the world that Bitcoin transactions don’t necessarily have to be financial, it could be information.', 'If you are still skeptical about the way Bitcoin works, perhaps this would be the time to get to know everything that there is to know about Bitcoin.\n\nIn recent news, a team of eight members is all set to open up a Bitcoin bank in Switzerland. A Bitcoin bank, where all the usual banking facilities would be available, just without the paper currency. The Bitcoin bank aims to impart various services such such as loans, storage, transacting with the ‘international, digital, government-free currency’ that Bitcoin is.\n\nThe team is currently looking for premises for the bank and is all set to apply for an official license in a few weeks. The team comprises of both IT experts and those who expertise in finance. The team already has investors set in place.\n\nA founder member and the IT specialist – Guido Rudolphi recently spoke on behalf of the bank, “Managers of the banks have knowledge both in IT and traditional finance. We hope to apply for Bank license in a few weeks. First people already got in business and now the bank is searching for the premises.”\n\nThe key factor about this Bitcoin bank is that it isn’t related with Bitcoin deposits, but Bitcoin credits – the most important factor in a mortgage-run economy that any of the previous Bitcoin-bank-attempts failed to provide.\n\nFor now, no official name has been disclosed for the potential upcoming Bitcoin bank and no date is known as to when the bank might get the license.\n\nRecently, XAPO – the Bitcoin wallet company that offers vaults and secured storages to people’s bitcoins moved their headquarters from Palo Alto, California to Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nWhat impact will this have on the current currency run banks? Will this be an effective way for the people to save on taxes and eliminate the interference of the government? Questions such as these can only be answered when the bank actually comes in charge. How the government regulated banks react to the development of a Bitcoin Bank would also be interesting to see, as the legalization of the Bitcoin Bank will directly affect the stature of the national currency.\n\nSwitzerland has always been a key player in global economy circle, and this eliciting of attention of the Bitcoin industry towards the nation could be a huge boon for the future of Bitcoin.', 'Ross Ulbricht, the convicted founder and operator of online black market Silk Road, was sentenced to life in prison yesterday after being found guilty of narcotics and computer hacking charges in February.\n\nThe severity of the sentencing quickly set off a firestorm of comment and criticism, with debates centering on the alleged hypocrisy of the federal government and the morality of its handling of illicit Internet crime in context of its actions against the traditional financial sector.\n\nSuch criticisms, however, were interspersed with live drama, as standing outside of a New York courthouse, Lyn Ulbricht voiced concern for her son Ross Ulbricht’s safety as he heads to maximum security prison.\n\n“I fear for his safety,” she said, according to footage of the press conference. “I fear for his life.”\n\nLyn Ulbricht added that a medium-security prison, in her opinion, would be more appropriate given his behavior since his arrest in late 2013, but acknowledged that “with his sentence, I don’t know if that can be possible"".\n\nDuring her comments, Ulbricht criticized the government for keeping Silk Road open, suggesting that federal officials should share the blame for deaths said to be tied to the dark market’s operation.\n\nShe told reporters:\n\n“Two of those overdose deaths happened while the government had the server. They owned and controlled it, and they kept it open, open for business, and those two deaths happened. And by their logic, are they liable as well?”\n\nUlbricht went on to criticize the fact that some information remains under seal regarding the indictment of two federal agents accused of going rogue during the US government\'s investigation of Silk Road.\n\nDefense attorney Joshua Dratel also spoke during the press, declaring his disappointment with the outcome and vowing once again to appeal the conviction.\n\nDratel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwitter reacts\n\nEven before the sentencing hearing, Twitter was abuzz with thoughts on the then-pending result.\n\nOften times the law is wrong.

Puede ser un solo hombre, una organización, un gobierno o la mismísima NSA. Nadie lo sabe. Bajo el nombre de Satoshi Nakamoto se oculta el inventor de Bitcoin, una criptomoneda llamada a revolucionar los sistemas de pago en Internet cuyo valor total se estima hoy en el mercado de unos 4.000 millones de dólares. Pero nadie ha visto jamás el rostro de su creador ni oído su voz. En 2011, cuando su invento empezaba a ser grande y él podría haberse hecho millonario, desapareció. Dejó de contestar hasta los emails de su colaborador más cercano, Gavin Andressen. Simplemente dijo que iba a dedicarse a otras cosas. El tipo de mensaje que habría escrito alguien que acababa de fracasar. No el inventor de algo así como el Napster del dinero.\n\nNi siquiera se sabe si se trata de una persona, una organización, un Gobierno o la mismísima NSA\n\nA finales de 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto publicó un artículo de investigación donde explicaba los fundamentos del Bitcoin, una nueva moneda digital basada en un software de código abierto y la tecnología P2P. En el documento incluía una dirección de correo a través de la que intercambió emails durante dos años y medio con la comunidad que le ayudó a desarrollarlo. El sistema pretendía eliminar a los bancos de la ecuación económica, suprimir comisiones, preservar la privacidad en las transacciones, facilitar los micropagos entre personas… Nacía en plena crisis y poseía todos los elementos relativos al signo de los tiempos.\n\nHoy, siete años después, se emiten 25 bitcoins cada 10 minutos y solo en España se realizan 100.000 transacciones diarias. Muchas empresas empiezan a aceptarlo como medio de pago (Microsoft, Dell, Destinia…), la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos estudia incorporarlo al sistema y gran parte de las inversiones de Silicon Valley fluyen hacia revolucionarias firmas del entorno de esta criptomoneda (230 millones de dólares solo en 2015). En España lo utilizan despachos de abogados como Abanlex o empresas como Coinffeine atraen ya la atención de todo el mundo por su vuelta de tuerca a la descentralización del Bitcoin mediante la eliminación de las casas de cambio del tablero.\n\nHoy se emiten 25 bitcoins cada 10 minutos y solo en España se realizan 100.000 transacciones diarias\n\nDesde entonces, la caza de Satoshi Nakamoto (nombre que podría ser un simple alias) se ha convertido en un reto para periodistas, informáticos y criptógrafos. The New Yorker o el New York Times han señalado a sus candidatos sin obtener confirmación de ninguno de ellos. Pero el caso más sonado se produjo en marzo de 2014 cuando Newsweek recuperó su edición impresa con una bomba en la portada: le tenían. La periodista Leah McGrath Goodman aseguraba haber localizado a un tipo corriente llamado Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto que vivía humildemente en un suburbio de Los Ángeles. Un físico de origen japonés cuya biografía guardaba demasiadas coincidencias con los datos que se tenían del fundador de Bitcoin. Hablaba un inglés un tanto pobre, había trabajado para asuntos clasificados del Gobierno, su entorno sostenía que podía ser él… Según la periodista, a las puertas de su casa, incluso llegó a decirle: “Ya no estoy involucrado en eso, no puedo hablar sobre ello. Otra gente está al cargo ahora”. No dejaba lugar a demasiadas dudas.\n\nampliar foto Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto en su comparecencia para desmentir que fuera el creador de Bitcoin, tal y como señalaba 'Newsweek'.\n\nAl día siguiente de la publicación, el supuesto Satoshi lo desmintió todo. Incluso aseguraba no haber tenido conocimiento del Bitcoin hasta hacía seis meses. Lo más doloroso para la periodista fue que la mayoría de expertos consultados respaldaron su versión. Tras un año de silencio, McGrath, atendió a este diario, durante diez minutos, pero quiso limitar su declaración oficial a que tanto ella como Newsweek siguen respaldando y dando crédito a su artículo, todavía colgado en su web bajo una petición de rectificación del abogado del Nakamoto que negaba serlo. Algunos creen que Leah McGrath tiene que saber algo más de lo que llegó a publicar para seguir manteniendo su versión.\n\nEl bitcoin es la cristalización de un viejo anhelo perseguido por el movimiento cypherpunk desde los años 80 que encontró la solución en el protocolo de Nakamoto. Hay unos 14 millones en circulación (cada uno vale hoy unos 220 euros) y, tal y como está configurado el sistema, permitirá que se reproduzcan hasta 21 millones (el proceso terminaría alrededor del año 2140). Su estructura está basada en la llamada cadena de bloques, algo así como las hojas de contabilidad donde se anotan todas las transacciones que se realizan. Esos bloques se generan mediante un complejo cálculo que solo pueden procesar potentes computadoras (a veces centenares de ellas). Ese trabajo lo realizan los llamados mineros, que son recompensados con 25 bitcoins cada vez que obtienen un nuevo bloque. Un incentivo que empezó siendo de 50, pero que desciende a la mitad a medida que aumenta la complejidad del problema matemático. Luego, su valor fluctúa en el mercado en función de la oferta y la demanda y el precio que fijan las casas de cambio.\n\nNewsweek' aseguró en su portada haber dado con el auténtico Satoshi. Al día siguiente fue desmentido\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto fue el primero en minar Bitcoins y podría tener en su cuenta, según los cálculos que pueden hacerse consultando la cadena de bloques, alrededor de un millón de ellos. Pero desde que desapareció en 2011 no ha movido ni un céntimo. Algo que ha despertado toda suerte de teorías: desde que perdió las claves de su cuenta, hasta que los ha abandonado para no dar pistas de su identidad. Lo que está claro es que es alguien que no los necesita. Además, hay algunos rastros, extraídos de todos sus emails que han vistos la luz pública, que permiten al menos descartar a algunos sospechosos.\n\nPortada del libro de Nathaniel Popper sobre la historia del Bitcoin.\n\nEsa es la única manera de acercarse al enigma. Nathaniel Popper, periodista del New York Times y autor del libro Digital Gold, opina que le contexto histórico es muy importante para definir su identidad. Hay que entender los experimentos previos que se hicieron en la misma línea (como Hashcash o B-Money) y que Satoshi probablemente surgió de ese entorno. Justamente, otro de esos antecedentes, fue Bit Gold, una especie de versión beta sin desarrollar del Bitcoin. Su creador, un experimentado criptógrafo llamado Nick Szabo es a quien apuntaría Nathaniel si tuviera que apostar sobre nombre real del verdadero Satoshi. “Mi apuesta es que estuvo involucrado, pero que tuvo ayuda para desarrollar el código. Él no era el tipo de programador que podría hacer solo ese software. Hay gente que le ayuda. Pero yo no digo que sea él, sino que todas las evidencias obtenidas hasta la fecha apuntan a él”, matiza con toda la cautela del mundo. Szabo, como todos los demás anteriormente, lo niega.\n\nampliar foto Portada del cómic 'La caza de Satoshi Nakamoto'.\n\nPara la gente más cercana al Bitcoin, tanto por su uso como por la militancia ideológica, desenmasarar a Satoshi es irrelevante. Así opina Alex Preukschat es el autor del cómic Bitcoin: La caza de Satoshi Nakamoto. Para él lo importante es que se trata de un proyecto descentralizado p2p y cuya estructura puede aplicarse a otros campos de la vida. “Lo relevante es la comunidad de personas involucradas. Eso se aplica también a la democracia, que solo puede ser igual de buena como lo es la calidad de las personas que la componen. En los proyectos p2p pasa de una forma más pronunciada: todos sus miembros constituyen la fuerza. Para mí lo más bonito no es el dinero o la tecnología. Sinó las nuevas estructuras descentralizadas que nos ofrece para la sociedad. Se trata de una manera de organizar e incentivar en el futuro comportamientos humanos”. Algo así debía pensar Satoshi cuando se marchó a hacer otras cosas y renunció a su invento y al millón de bitcoins de su cuenta."", 'Xapo has announced its latest, bold move to add a few financial and political power players to its advisory board. Xapo will strategically grow its company and services with the expertise of Visa founder Dee Hock, former Citibank CEO John Reed, and former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.\n\nAlso Read: Xapo Releases New Comments on BitLicense\n\nOn May 26, 2015 Xapo announced the following additions to its advisory board:\n\nDee Hock\n\nAn expert in payment systems, Dee Hock is the founder of Visa. Hock is a believer in bitcoin and what it can do for the financial sector. According to Hock, “Bitcoin is one of the best examples of how a decentralized, peer-to-peer organization can solve problems that these dated organizations cannot.” Bitcoin, he says, “presents incredible opportunities for new levels of efficiency and transparency in financial transactions.”\n\nJohn Reed\n\nJohn Reed, former Chairman & CEO of Citibank, sees a unique opportunity for bitcoin companies. As he points out, “Financial services have remained largely untouched by the digital revolution.” Citibank grew to be among the world’s first global financial franchises under his leadership.\n\nLawrence Summers\n\nLawrence Summers, serving as US Treasury Secretary during Bill Clinton’s presidency, also sees bitcoin’s potential. Summers says that sending bitcoin with the same ease as sending text messages could become an everyday norm for billions of people. He explains, “Bitcoin offers, for the first time, a method for transferring value and making payments from anywhere to anywhere, in real-time, without any intermediary.”\n\nXapo: The “Fort Knox of Bitcoin”\n\nSince 2013, Xapo has lead the digital currency industry with its secure bitcoin wallet and cold-storage service. Xapo has made security its top priority and is setting the bar high for other bitcoin security companies. Xapo stores its customerss bitcoins in secure, encrypted servers offline. Known as “cold storage,” the bitcoin wallet never connects to the internet.\n\nThrough this service, users can protect their bitcoins with multiple levels of protection. The company uses a steel blast door, radio wave-blocking Faraday cage, and walls of concrete to protect its servers. The company takes its security a step further by recommissioning a former Swiss military bunker to house its server vaults.\n\nXapo customers can also connect their bitcoin wallets with the Xapo debit card in order to process payments from merchants. The company partnered with Bitwage in March, giving people a way to spend their bitcoins and offer Bitwage’s bitcoin payroll service to withdraw fiat currencies from the blockchain.\n\nThe acquisition of Xapo’s new advisory board members is a prime example of a new trend in business. Bitcoin companies are recruiting the world’s leaders in banking, finance, and economics to lead their businesses and gain a competitive edge.\n\nAs we’ve seen recently, several Wall Street bankers and high-ranking finance professionals have left their positions to lead promising bitcoin companies. For example, Former JP Morgan Chase banker Paul Camp joined cryptocurrency firm Circle Internet Financial. Blythe Masters, a senior executive of JP Morgan Chase, left her position to become CEO of Digital Asset Holdings. Another example is Anthony Watson, former Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Nike, who is now COO of BitReserve.\n\nHave you used Xapo before? What do you think of its services?

For much of the past few decades, the goals have been independence through home and car ownership along with a growing retirement account to supplement Social Security and pensions.\n\nNot surprisingly, banks have catered to these desires with a bevy of products, including vastly increased mortgage lending (in fact, increasing to the point of catastrophe as we recently witnessed) along with home-equity loans, investment and retirement advisors, and a customer service relationship centered on local branches.\n\nMillennials have entirely different life goals, and yet, financial institutions have yet to respond with the kinds of products needed to satiate them. Just to start, this generation has the greatest levels of student debt in the country’s history. That means that almost all the products currently offered by banks are mostly irrelevant, since major purchases like homes will be pushed back, perhaps indefinitely.\n\nAmazingly, we have seen almost no innovation in student loan lending from the traditional banks, while there has been tremendous innovation in the market from startups like SoFi, Earnest, CommonBond, among others. What gives? Imagine if the first thing a traditional bank said to a college graduate and potential new customer was “open an account, and we can can help you refinance your student loans with a lower rate and save serious dollars during repayment.”\n\nI’ll talk about customer service in a moment, but it is clear that there is a gaping hole in the market here that the traditional banks seem all but blind to.\n\nThat said, big banks have been a bit more engaged around improving investment advising. Many now offer automated investment accounts directly or through contracted brokerages, just like fintech startups Wealthfront or Betterment. These tools have traditionally targeted millennials, who seem more comfortable with computers handling their money and who also desire a well-balanced investment portfolio (we did survive that global financial crisis after all).\n\nThere are all kinds of other financial products that traditional banks should be engaging with. Newer models of credit scores, like those from Affirm, could greatly help younger workers find loans. RobinHood and others are trying to show that stock trading fees are obsolete. Banks have so many opportunities to engage with millennials, it is disappointing to see how much they have ignored this demographic.\n\nThat Said, Please Don’t Talk With Us\n\nYes, we want banks to engage with us, but no, please don’t talk with us. I have only once ever walked out of a bank branch as a completely satisfied customer (this trip may also have involved free candy). Automated investment platforms are not just popular due to their lower fees and balanced risks, but also because traditional investment advisors had no fricking idea what they were selling (yet somehow still became rich in the process).\n\nTraditional banks have moved many of their banking functions online or at least to ATMs, since every in-person transaction has a significant cost attached to it. But so far, none of them has developed the user experience and product quality necessary to really take full advantage of mobile and the web for banking.\n\nSimple Bank, the startup acquired last year by BBVA, tried to reach a point where everything could be done through mobile. They missed the mark, but the potential is still there. With Nimbl acting as a “Uber for ATMs” and several other new startup banking services, this dream seems much less far-fetched than it did just a year or two ago.\n\nI want a bank where absolutely everything can happen through my phone, and if I need help, I can ask a banker about something instantly through the click of a button. I want a concentrated set of services designed just for me, and not a menu with more than fifty options for services that aren’t even relevant for me.\n\nI want to transfer money in ten seconds – not ten screens.\n\nAlong that simplicity theme, part of shedding all of these human touch points is also reducing the complexity of banking products. Every time I go to a bank, there is a rigamarole involved as we go through the new-account-type-of-the-month, each of course with their complex tiers of fees. I know this is designed to screw me, and I don’t like it. Simplicity is golden.\n\nThe Future Bank For Everyone\n\nYes, millennials are annoying customers, but here is the irony: everyone wants these features. Consumers want to be able to manage their finances from their phones and tablets while limiting their visits to bank branches and bank tellers. Plus, everyone hates bank fees, particularly their complexity and lack of transparency.\n\nThe difference today is that millennials are willing to shop elsewhere, because we are simply not going to accept that these are the only products on the market. We are willing to try new startups and their innovations, since they speak our consumer language while the traditional banks do not.\n\nIf the big Wall Street banks fail in this new environment, it won’t be because they failed to bring millennials into the fold. It will be because they will have failed to innovate for all of their customers.', 'ShapeShift.io is an instant Bitcoin and altcoin exchange innovative service.

Chamou-lhe Silk Road e colocou-a num canto escuro da Internet, um sítio que protege a identidade dos seus utilizadores e onde não se chega através dos browsers que usamos todos os dias para ler notícias ou partilhar fotografias de gatos nas redes sociais.\n\nEm vez de livros novos ou telemóveis usados, quem entrava no Silk Road ia à procura de duas coisas, acima de tudo: anonimato e drogas. Muitas drogas. Cannabis e heroína. LSD e ecstasy. Mas também medicamentos que se vendem nas farmácias; garrafas de Krating Daeng – a forte bebida energética tailandesa que deu origem ao mais diluído Red Bull ocidental –; ou documentos de identificação falsos.\n\nDurante três anos, o anonimato da operação e o aumento do volume de negócios no Silk Road renderam a Ross Ulbricht mais de 18 milhões de euros – a soma das partes que lhe cabiam por cada transacção feita entre compradores e vendedores, sempre pagas com a moeda virtual bitcoin , que não envolve bancos nem cartões de crédito.\n\nPUB\n\nMas o obscuro mini-império de Ulbricht desmoronou-se em finais de 2013 , quando foi detido por agentes do FBI numa biblioteca pública em São Francisco, no estado da Califórnia, em flagrante delito: estava a teclar no seu computador portátil e ligado à área de administração do Silk Road com o nome de utilizador Dread Pirate Roberts – nome do mítico e impiedoso pirata do livro The Princess Bride, escrito pelo norte-americano William Goldman.\n\nPUB\n\nAcusado de ser líder de uma organização criminosa – uma acusação geralmente reservada aos chefes da máfia –, e de seis outros crimes, Ulbricht foi condenado na sexta-feira a uma pena invulgarmente pesada: prisão perpétua sem possibilidade de liberdade condicional.\n\nDe acordo com a lei norte-americana, a juíza Katharine B. Forrest não podia sentenciar Ross Ulbricht a menos de 20 anos de prisão, mas o criador do Silk Road já esperava pior, depois de a acusação ter pedido uma pena ""substancialmente superior ao mínimo obrigatório"". O que poucos esperavam, incluindo Ulbricht, era que a juíza quisesse fazer dele um exemplo, condenando-o à pena máxima que a lei permitia.\n\n""O que você fez não tem precedentes. E, sendo a primeira pessoa a ultrapassar essa linha, senta-se neste tribunal como réu e tem de suportar as consequências desse facto"", declarou Katharine B. Forrest, antes de proferir a sentença, que será alvo de recurso.\n\nDe escuteiro e bem-sucedido aluno universitário, Ross Ulbricht transformou-se no “chefe de uma organização digital de tráfico de droga que operava em todo o mundo”, segundo a acusação.\n\n""Uma experiência""\n\nA juíza sublinhou esse papel quando se dirigiu a Ulbricht na sala de audiências: ""Não pode haver dúvidas de que ninguém está acima da lei, independentemente da sua instrução e dos seus privilégios. Todos são iguais perante a lei. Não pode haver dúvidas de que ninguém pode gerir uma enorme organização criminosa, e que essa actividade possa ser minimizada só porque existe apenas na Internet"", disse Katharine B. Forrest. Admitiu no entanto que o criador do Silk Road ""não encaixa no típico perfil de criminoso"".\n\nO melhor do Público no email Subscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público. Subscrever ×\n\nFoi nessa aparente disparidade entre o perfil de rapaz bem integrado e instruído, e o rótulo de perigoso criminoso internacional, que a defesa apostou para tentar convencer a juíza de que Ulbricht nunca pensou em criar uma organização criminosa – o Silk Road foi uma ""experiência na área da economia"", um ""mercado sem interferência do Estado, aberto a todas as oportunidades"".\n\nNuma carta enviada à juíza no início da semana , Ulbricht mostrou-se arrependido e pediu clemência, argumentando que o tempo que já tinha passado na cadeia foi suficiente para ""reflectir"" sobre as suas ""acções"": ""A ideia do Silk Road era dar às pessoas a liberdade para fazerem as suas próprias escolhas, para alcançarem a sua felicidade. Em vez disso, transformou-se num caminho conveniente para satisfazerem a dependência de drogas. Não defendo nem nunca defendi o uso excessivo de drogas. Com o Silk Road aprendi que quando damos liberdade às pessoas, nunca sabemos o que vão fazer com ela"", escreveu Ross, ele que era conhecido pelos seus ideais libertários.\n\nEm tribunal ficou provado que Ulbricht ganhou milhões com uma loja online que permitia a venda de drogas ilegais, e que pelo menos seis pessoas morreram após terem consumido drogas compradas no Silk Road. Mas a dureza da sentença deixou os seus apoiantes em estado de choque, e a sua mãe, Lyn, perdida numa floresta negra em busca do filho que conhecia: ""Eu sei que se o Ross saísse da prisão amanhã, as autoridades nunca mais ouviriam falar dele. O Ross não é uma ameaça maior para a sociedade do que eu.""\n\nPUB', '443 Compartido Whatsapp Facebook Twitter Meneame Print Mail\n\nEn 2012 el banco HSBC llegaba a un acuerdo con la justicia de los EEUU. Pagando 1.200 millones de libras (a cargo del bolsillo de los accionistas) se corría un tupido velo sobre su actividad de blanqueo de dinero procedente de los carteles de la droga Mexicanos. Según el Senado Norteamericano el HSBC transfirió, entre 2007 y 2008, la friolera de 7.000 millones de dólares de México a EEUU. Ningún directivo del HSBC en prisión.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso, unos de los grandes señores de las temibles autodefensas en Colombia, al que se le relaciona con más de 900 asesinatos, uno de los grandes señores de la droga en Colombia (responsable de la producción en sus territorios de 138.000 kilos de cocaína) y condenado en EEUU por por narcotráfico, lavado de activos y financiación al terrorismo, fue sentenciado en EEUU a 22 años con la posibilidad de que ahora su condena se reduzca a 12 años.\n\nLas cosas parece que son bastante diferentes, incluso cuando los volúmenes de sustancias ilegales que has movido ni se acercan a los grandes delincuentes ni cuando no has ocasionando matanzas de civiles con sierra mecánicas.\n\nRoss Ulbricht\n\nAyer, Ross Ulbricht, aka Dread Pirate Roberts, el fundador del marketplace de venta de drogas Silk Road, fue condenado por la justicia norteamericana a cadena perpetua. En la lectura de su condena la juez de distrito Katherine Forrest dijo que había tardado más de 100 horas en decidir la condena a Ulbricht (menos mal que se lo pensó) pero que lo que había hecho creando Silk Road era un asaltó a la salud de nuestra comunidad al hacer más sencillo para la gente de todo el mundo comprar drogas ilegales.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, 29 años de edad, licenciado en física, se empezó a interesar por la economía. Veía el sistema de impuestos establecido por el gobierno como una forma de coacción que reforzaba el monopolio del Estado sobre la violencia. Su pensamiento estaba influenciado por el economista austríaco Ludwig von Mises según el cúal los ciudadanos deben tener libertad económica para poder ser moralmente libres.\n\nRoss Ulbricht unió su hobby como cultivador de setas alucinógenas con una tecnología emergente. El Bitcoin. En enero de 2011 lanzaba Silk Road, una especie de Amazon de las drogas, oculto en internet en una red Tor y en la que las transacciones entre compradores y venedores ser realizaban en Bitcoins.\n\nRápidamente Silk Road se convirtió en el mayor supermercado del mundo con más de 13 mil referencia de drogas legales e ilegales disponibles, cocaína colombiana, heroína afgana, LDS, y también cualquier droga legal disponible en el mercado desde Xanax a Oxycontin. En 2012, Silk Road generaba unos 22 millones de dólares al año. Nada que ver con los 7.000 mil millones blanqueados por el HSBC, pero todo un éxito para un startup.\n\nLa moraleja de la historia queda clara. Si eres el sistema cometer un delito es un pecado menor. Desafiar al sistema es un pecado mortal. Ulbricht, era muy peligroso para el sistema establecido. Rompía el negocio de las grandes farmacéuticas, rompía la exclusiva de la banca en el “blanquero” de dinero, rompía el monopolio de los grandes carteles de la droga, y lo hacía además utilizado una divisa que rompía el monopolio que tiene el Estado sobre el dinero.\n\nEl resultado no podría ser otro: Condenado a cadena perpetua.

05/31/2015,"['Coders and criminals aren\'t the only ones interested in bitcoin these days.\n\nAlong with a growing cohort of global businesses that are starting to adopt the currency, such as Amazon and PayPal, banks are coming to terms with what a decentralised cryptocurrency - one which drastically reduces the costs of global transactions - means for the future of their businesses.\n\n""[Banks] are not dealing with it but I can confirm that they are highly interested in what the implications of digital currencies might be,"" said Lee White, chief executive of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, which has more than 5,000 members in Hong Kong. ""I think they\'re in a phase of business where [banks say] \'I need to understand this more to know what my response might be.\' ""\n\nChartered Accountants and PwC recently released a white paper on digital currencies to address the strong demand for information on the disruptive technology, part of which was driven by large financial institutions, according to White. A survey of 10,000 finance and accounting professionals included in the paper showed that 67 per cent of respondents believed digital currencies would be widely used in 10 years.\n\nSome 28 per cent said the main challenge with currencies such as bitcoin was a lack of understanding in the market. Links to money laundering and terrorism were the biggest concern, according to 23 per cent.\n\nBitcoin and many other fledging digital currencies use what is called a blockchain database for transactions. The blockchain is a public ledger where every transaction made with a bitcoin is recorded. A decentralised network of volunteer computers decodes and validate each transaction, earning, or ""mining"", bitcoins as rewards for the work.\n\nAs of May 31, one bitcoin was worth US$234, up from less than a dollar in early 2011 but far below a high of nearly US$1,000 in November 2013.\n\nWhile the public nature of the technology makes digital currencies highly transparent, transactions can be made without disclosing one\'s identity. That has opened a new channel for criminal activity and drawn the scrutiny of both banks and regulators.\n\nBanks in particular have been wary of bitcoin given the huge fines they have paid out over the past three years for money laundering violations.\n\nRegulators have similar qualms, and what have come to be known as digital currencies are - depending on the jurisdiction - classified as commodities, collectibles, digital goods or assets - but not as legal tender.\n\nThe People\'s Bank of China, the mainland\'s central bank, banned financial institutions from accepting it or pricing products in it.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has called bitcoin a ""virtual commodity"", giving it a leg to stand on in the city where start-up firms have rapidly embraced it. But it also bars banks from offering bitcoin products.\n\nAt present, keeping banks and bitcoins separate is the global norm.\n\n""Only a tiny, limited number of these [digital] financial products are allowed and available at banks in any given jurisdiction,"" said Nathan Kaiser, a Taiwan-based partner at law firm Eiger.\n\nMoney laundering - and potential billion-dollar fines - is a real concern banks have with supporting bitcoin. However, it is not the biggest of the traditional financial industry\'s worries.\n\nDecentralised currencies can be transferred in a fraction of the time it takes banks to do similar work. The transactions also cost little more than the internet connection they are conducted on. Banks, on the other hand, often charge hefty fees to wire money.\n\nMcKinsey forecasts that revenues from the global payments market will hit US$2.3 trillion in 2018, or 43 per cent of all banking-service revenues, up from 34 per cent in 2009. That chuck of change is the banks\' to lose should the traditional payments market be challenged by new technologies such as decentralised currencies.\n\nThe disruptive nature of digital currencies should usher in quicker-than-expected acceptance by banks as they look to cut their losses, said Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong.\n\nSmaller, more flexible banks may move first in an attempt to rapidly gain a share of the market that was once reserved for global banks with international payment networks.\n\n""I don\'t expect this to last for very long,"" Weese said of the current standoff between banks and digital currencies. ""Especially smaller banks have a strong interest in cutting the monopoly that banks like HSBC have over international transfers, and in the long run bitcoin will enable them to do that. To build up that knowledge and foster the relationships, banks have to start their partnerships today.""\n\nA few banks, such as Singapore\'s DBS, have gotten off to an early start by banking bitcoin businesses, Weese pointed out, but examples remain limited.\n\nThe real takeaway for banks could be the technology itself, White noted. The adoption of blockchain databases at any kind of business, or even governments, could introduce a new level of transparency and speed to deals.\n\nThe US exchange operator Nasdaq announced in May that it would increase the number of trials that it runs using the technology in the hopes of speeding up transactions. The government of Honduras earlier this year said that it may use a blockchain database for land transactions to fight corruption.\n\n""I think a more interesting question is, would the blockchain technology that underpins digital currencies be the future for not only banks but all forms of business?"" White said.', ""Reid Williams is a senior designer and engineer at IDEO Futures, where he works at the intersection of technology, design, and new venture creation. Alongside Joe Gerber, he is kicking off the Bits + Blocks Lab, a pop-up blockchain startup creation lab hosted at the Harvard Innovation Lab.\n\nThis post, which examines how the technology behind bitcoin could make supply chains much more transparent, is part of the Humans + Bits + Blocks series.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere does stuff come from?\n\nWhether we buy a taco or an iPhone, we’re at the receiving end of a supply chain that often stretches around the globe. Usually we don’t think much about it, and this is a good thing. But sometimes it’s important to know more. Taking a bite out of a taco involves a certain amount of trust: trust that the kitchen that made the taco is sanitary, that the ingredients that went into it are fresh, and that the taco tastes good.\n\nThis trust is critical, but there’s so much more we could know. We could create entirely new relationships with the stuff we buy, namely where it came from and how it arrived in our hands. Blockchains offer a way to introduce transparency into supply chains and to create entirely new opportunities for participation.\n\nAs a shared, secure record of exchange, blockchains can track what went into a product and who handled it along the way, breaking supply chain data out of silos, and revealing the provenance of a product to everyone involved from originator to end user.\n\nThis transparency will impact all sorts of products:\n\nIs this shirt manufactured with child labor? Which of my friends owns the same shirt?\n\nAre there any hazardous materials in this couch? What other pieces of furniture are typically bought with it?\n\nIs this really the car that Steve McQueen drove in Bullitt? Who else has owned it?\n\nIs this bottle of olive oil just olive oil? Where can my sister on the other side of the country buy it?\n\nInspired by the bitcoin blockchain, Skuchain, and smart contract platforms, let’s see how these technologies might change one particular supply chain: the everyday experience of buying, cooking, and serving dinner to friends.\n\n1. Seeing where your food was grown\n\nIt’s Saturday morning and you’re at your favorite bakery, Tantric Flour & Co for a pastry and coffee. A strawberry tart catches your eye and your order one along with a coffee. The tart is amazing, and the strawberries, though baked into the tart, are some of the best you’ve ever tasted.\n\nYou’re curious about where they came from and pull out your phone to find out more. The bakery purchases and manages its ingredients inventory using a system that you can use too on your phone. You see all the ingredients that went into the tart and where they originated.\n\nThe strawberries came from a small farm about 200 miles away called Straw Hen Farms. Straw Hen records and shares many of the details of how it operates. This lets the farm share good practices with other farms and easily get certifications.\n\nYou see that Straw Hen grows strawberries in a field that uses drip irrigation and is certified organic and low water use. You can also see what else they’re growing right now: lettuce, carrots, summer squash, and kale.\n\nFrom dinner at a restaurant to a bag of potato chips, every ingredient has a history. Blockchains provide a shared and secured record, letting users see where ingredients come from and how they were produced while letting producers see where their ingredients and how they’re incorporated into finished food products.\n\n2. Buying local produce in more flexible ways\n\nWhile drinking your coffee, you follow a link to Straw Hen’s blog and read that they sell directly to individuals and that you can buy their strawberries. You’re an avid preserve maker and so you buy a smart contract, committing to buying 5 pounds of strawberries if the price goes below $5 a pound. Since the contract is binding and automatically executed, the farm can use it to forecast their revenue for the season.\n\nA few weeks pass, and you get a push notification on your phone. Straw Hen is having a bumper crop of strawberries, and your contract has been executed. You have the option to pick them up in the next week at a few nearby farmer’s markets. You see that your neighborhood farmer’s market in Glen Park isn’t on the list (bummer). If you can get enough orders to be picked up there, the farm will set up a booth. You post a link on Facebook to your friends.\n\nSaturday rolls around and it’s time for you to pick up your strawberries at the Glen Park market. Your Facebook post kinda went viral and enough people committed to orders that Straw Hen set up a booth this weekend. Excitedly, you head to their stall to pick up your strawberries.\n\nSmart contracts built on blockchains create new options for buying goods that include naming your own price or automatic recurring orders.\n\n3. Seeing how your food got from farm or sea to plate\n\nAs you wander the stalls, you see one of your favorite fish vendors, Fork & Fish, selling Black Cod. You recall the first time you bought from this stall. It was strange buying fresh fish from an outdoor market but the fishmonger explained how it works.\n\nFrom boat, to storage, to truck, to cooler at the market, the Fork & Fish tracks inventory and uses equipment that monitors and records the storage temperature. Both you and the vendor can see when and where the fish was caught and how it got from the boat to the market. Inspired by the freshness of the Black Cod, you buy some and start planning a dinner party Sunday night.\n\nBlockchains can create a formal registry to identify individual goods, and track possession of a good through different points in a supply chain.\n\nInternet connected equipment such as fishing boats, shipping trucks, and storage coolers can monitor which objects they’re housing and tag those objects with relevant environmental conditions like temperature or location, providing assurance that a product was safely handled through the entirety of its journey.\n\n4. Rewards programs that cross traditional boundaries\n\nYou swing by a wine shop and see that they’ve got a few bottles of red from your favorite winery, Chalk Brain Vineyards. You have a subscription to the winery which means you prepay for a case of their wine (at a discounted price) and can pick it up at any retail location. You pay full price at the checkout but after scanning the wine bottle with your phone, the winery reimburses what you just paid.\n\nYou first heard about Chalk Brain through a recommendation from your phone. You keep track of all the beer and wine you buy and get suggestions and discounts on new wines to try. It’s anonymous if you want it to be, but you choose to submit tasting notes using your name.\n\nBlockchains establish a shared place to track the purchase of goods from the manufacturer, through the point of sale, to the end user, creating a way to track purchasing habits that’s independent of any one retailer or manufacturer.\n\nSince identity on a blockchain can be anonymous, users can receive promotions or discounts sent to a bitcoin address without revealing unnecessary personal information.\n\n5. New kinds of markets that create new ways to participate\n\nFish, check. Wine, check. You still want some beer and a dessert. You head to a new place in your neighborhood called Locavore. Locavore is a small market that sells craft foods like honey, jam, beer, and hummus created by people from around the region.\n\nYou drop off two flats of some lemon marmalade that you made recently, scan them into Locavore’s inventory, and pick up a few bottles of beer made by one of your neighbors. When your marmalade sells, you and Locavore share the revenue, which automatically goes into an account you have.\n\nAs an inexpensive and open payment system, bitcoin enables new kinds of trading and markets where makers can sell products they make part time.\n\nBeyond payments, blockchains create a way to register and sell goods in a more distributed way, as well as to track the identity and reputation of sellers, thus creating new kinds of sharing economies with open participation.\n\n6. Knowing exactly what went into your food when it really matters\n\nLast stop, dessert. You head over to a supermarket you like that has good desserts. As you walk in you see some brownies that look good. You have to be careful though. One of your friends coming tomorrow night has a serious peanut allergy and you can’t serve anything that has come into contact with peanuts during processing.\n\nYou already have an app on your phone that lets you find products with or without certain ingredients and you have a saved filter for peanuts that you’ve used before. The app checks not just the ingredients of the product, but the entire supply chain of ingredients.\n\nYou pick out some brownies made in house by the supermarket, but see that the almonds they used were processed by equipment that also processes peanuts. You grab a different kind, brownies made with macadamia nuts and see that they’ll be fine for your friend.\n\nThe next day as your friends marvel at the amazing dinner, you tell them how you made it, and you digitally share your recipe too: not just what went into it, but exactly which markets and stalls where you bought each ingredient.\n\nWhen blockchains track the movement of objects through the supply chain they can also note how individual ingredients combine to form a newly manufactured item.\n\nThis 'provenance tree' allows an end user to know exactly what went into the product even if it has been through multiple manufacturing steps at different companies.\n\nThese moments show how in a future with blockchains, our experience producing and consuming food could be quite different than it is today. At the core of this is the ability to assign identity to people, to organizations, and to goods, to track in a transparent way the provenance of goods as they pass from one organization to the next, and lastly, as goods change hands, to exchange payment between the two organizations.\n\nFood is a compelling supply chain because we’re deeply sensitive to where our meals come from, and how they arrived at our plate, but importantly the human-scale impact of blockchains will be felt throughout the world’s supply chains.\n\nWritten by Reid Williams and Joe Gerber.

(CBA) has signed a deal with Ripple Labs, Inc. that will see the bank implement Ripple’s Bitcoin-inspired Blockchain ledger system for payment settlements between its subsidiaries.\n\nCBA Chief Information Officer David Whiteing revealed the bank’s interest in Ripple technology while giving a speech late last week at an Australian Information Industry Association lunch in Sydney, where he also noted that there is shift in global sentiment towards cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\n“Bitcoin is a protocol which is now being replicated by non-asset based vendors like Ripple and others” Whiteing said. “We absolutely see that’s where it’s going to go.

CBA was the first local bank to offer P2P money exchange via its mobile application, and also tap-and-go NFC payments on mobile phones in Australia.\n\nCommonwealth Bank’s mobile app already supports multicurrency bank accounts for up to 15 currencies, and Whiteing added that it shouldn’t be that hard to add loyalty points or digital currencies to it, saying “it shouldn’t be that difficult for us to then add cryptocurrencies to it and whatever other means of payment transfers people might want.”\n\nA bank spokesman added that the use of Ripple’s payment network will stay within the Commonwealth Bank Group for now and they will continue “to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements.”\n\nRipple makes ripples\n\nThe deal is another step forward in Ripple’s efforts to extend the use of its Ripple Protocol, based on the Bitcoin Blockchain, out further into mainstream financial institutions, and the exposure to The Commonwealth Bank (the world’s 10th largest bank) will provide ample grounds to proving the technology both works, and can be practically implemented.\n\nRipple has raised $34.4 million to-date and investors include Crypto Currency Partners, RRE Ventures, Route 66 Ventures, Core Innovation Capital, Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, China Rock Capital, Camp One Ventures, Google Ventures, IDG Capital Partners and others.', 'Peter Todd went on the Let’s Talk Bitcoin show yesterday and said something that hit home: Satoshi was wrong about some things.\n\nNow, Satoshi was a technologist, that is, a sort of scientist.

Todd, the outspoken Bitcoin developer, spoke directly to the issue of raising the block size limits, and said at one point that the whole debate had become more philosophical than technical. In essence, Todd feels that raising the block size limit to 20 megabytes, as Gavin Andresen suggests, does not solve the central issue, but rather “kicks the can down the road,” thereby making it an issue we’ll only be dealing with again in the future.\n\nTodd could be right about that part. It’s not even what I’m actually here to write about. I’m here to address the “libertarian” and “anarcho-capitalist” contigent of Bitcoiners. I’m here to deliver a simple message: your ideas don’t matter. Bitcoin is a digital cash, difficult to censor, and resistant to regulation. It is an implementation of cryptographic principals which people have dreamed about since the 80s if not sooner: the ability to transmit value without a trusted third-party to mess things up. Bitcoin does not answer to your ideals, it does not care about your stance on this or that issue. Bitcoin is not a person, in effect it is not even a community. Bitcoin is a technology.\n\nThere is a large group of people running around on the Internet, corporatist apologetics firmly in hand, completely forgiving of all the evils that capitalism perpetuates worldwide. Oh, Chevron murdered protestors in Nigeria? Coca-Cola killed Colombian peasants? Well, was it done in the name of profit? Oh, so be it. These are the kinds of the things the objectivist, Ayn Rand-loving “anarcho-capitalist” can freely forgive. Nevermind that these aren’t the only effects of globalization and corporate capitalism, that they weaken the very economies which these willfully ignorant individuals derive all of their wealth and strength from.\n\n“Anarcho-capitalism” is a contradiction in terms. True anarchists don’t believe in the freedom of the “market,” they believe in the freedom of the individual, which will inevitably, yes, lead to markets free of regulation. Because, as was illustrated in the true anarchist novel “The Dispossessed” by Ursula K. Le Guin, a new morality will be born in the inevitable post-government society. One that puts people and ecology ahead of the person or profit. That is to say, true anarchists tend toward a form of socialism, often dubbed “anarcho-socialism,” but that, too, has been hijacked by perversions of anarchism. Allow me to be very clear: the truest anarchists in society have long foregone the term “anarchist,” as it dawned on them some years back that the use of the word “anarchy” implies that government is the natural state of affairs. Anarchism is more a verb than a noun, more a decision than a philosophy. Anarchy is a return to the natural human order more than it is a fight against the existing one.\n\nThe poverty against which man has been struggling throughout history is not merely the poverty of material goods; the ennui and disorientation experienced by the members of the middle and upper classes in today’s wealthy industrial nations have revealed the poverty of Western existence itself. –-Some Real Anarchists\n\nThe traditional, non-capitalist anarchist movement has mostly not acknowledged the Bitcoin technology. They are a very intelligent bunch of people, as evidenced by their continued existence. Around 100 years ago, anarchists represented a far greater portion of Western civilization than they do now. They did things like organize wild cat strikes against bosses who pathologically did not care how they lived, no matter how much money they made for them. The Pinkerton bosses were willing to murder their workers for even having the idea that they deserved a better lot in life.\n\nBitcoin is Resistant to Censorship\n\nThe central appeal of Bitcoin to all political dissidents will be that it is resistant to censorship. Satoshi was uneasy about the idea of Wikileaks accepting Bitcoin when their bank accounts were being shut down, for fear that it would bring unneeded attention to the protocol. Satoshi was right about that, for it wouldn’t have done much good for either party. But this is irrelevant to the matter at hand. There is no such thing as anarcho-capitalist. The people who invented and defined the term “anarchist,” and in more recent times have abandoned it in favor of words like “human being,” who, in the words of one great anarchist text, “fought [the] fascists tooth, nail, and knife in the streets, when no one else would even confront them in print,” they were not capitalists.\n\nAlso read: Anti-State Propagandist Julia Tourianski: “How to be a Bitcoin Hater”\n\nIn fact, if you’re reading this, you are very unlikely a capitalist. A capitalist is not someone who believes in capitalism. A capitalist is someone who controls the means of production. A person who supports capitalism but does not control the means of production is a fool; a person who opposes capitalism and does not control the means of production is a revolutionary. But, if you’re one of these “anarcho-capitalist” types, and you’re reading this, again, have fun with the term. We’re glad it’s cool enough for you now.\n\nRemember, as a great man said: if someone says that miners, or McDonald’s workers, or any group of workers or poor people is organizing, nobody blinks, nobody is surprised. But if someone says that the rich are organizing, they are a conspiracy theorist. Be wary of anyone who says they’re going to liberate you by making it easier for rich people to get richer. Be wary of any movement which embraces the wealthy classes and looks at them with no suspicion. Be wary of anyone who believes that the problems of society have a single solution.\n\nAll Technology is Ideologically Agnostic\n\nBut most importantly, be extremely wary of anyone who pre-supposes that Bitcoin, a technological tour de force, owes any allegiance to any ideological neck-bearded fools spouting off about Austrian economics as if the gods themselves had transacted in a deflationary currency (or any currency at all).\n\nAnarchism is about challenging power, free thinking, and, occasionally, about challenging anarchists. Anarchists demand a future free of government and other hierarchical structures of control (such as capitalism). Anarchism is not about morally agnostic movements which suppose that, somehow, it’s okay to take profit from the hardship of others so long as there is some illusion of choice made by the disadvantaged millions. If you’re not okay with those goals, you are not an anarchist, and that’s okay, too. Neither do most anarchists identify with the anarchist movement.\n\nIf you’re not well-versed in the works of Emma Goldman, the CrimethInc. Collective, John Zerzan, and others who have come before, then what does that make you, if you’re utilizing the word “anarchist,” trying to sanitize the long history it has in direct opposition to the things that “anarcho-capitalism” proposes (such as privatizing the water, the air, the land that belong to all of humanity), then what does that make you? It makes you a scumbag hipster.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Imagine life as a the patriarchal head of a fiat currency banking empire. Life is good, with the ability to create fiat currency out of thin air, thanks to fractional reserve banking practices which effectively legalizes counterfeiting money. You compare notes with other billionaires. Your donations and campaign influence have politicians wrapped around your finger when it is time regulate new competitors or new technologies. With effective control of politicians, regulators, and consumers sending you multiple streams of income, life couldn’t be better. With one exception.\n\nWhat if there was something, like Bitcoin, which the establishment’s bankers couldn’t wish into the corn fields?\n\nControlling politicians, regulators, the general public, and national economies is pretty sweet, but can all that power protect you from new technologies? What if people had an option where they didn’t have to cut the banks in on every loan, transaction, or new economic measure passed through government? What if people start to figure out you don’t need a bank to live a prosperous life? What if a new technology removed the banks from the equation, leaving people to manage their own money, without a corporate middleman with their hand in your pocket? If you were a billionaire who owned a massive national bank, that might cause you to lose some sleep over the potential erosion of your empire.\n\nUday Kotak is the founder and executive vice chairman of Kotak Mahindra Bank in India, and he has a problem. Digital currency innovations like bitcoin, mobile payment apps like the recently announced Android Pay and Apple Pay offer great opportunity, but a great risk for a traditional banker like Kotak, currently worth over $7 billion. Where do these new financial technologies fit in with a banking industry that is built around the status quo?\n\n“I am excited, but very challenged. I keep wondering at night ‘Will I have a bank the next morning?’ or will some technology company be doing banking without needing a bank?” Kotak told CNBC. “As long as there are cash and the economy is running, all is well. But as a bank, we’ll have to test, experiment, try a hundred different things. A few may work, a few may fail, but we have to experiment and try.”\n\nHe said something very important there that could be easily missed. Kotak said “As long as there is cash….”, but cash is under attack by governments and even bankers worldwide. It is becoming more and more illegal to use cash. And we all can see that national economies worldwide are hardly “moving” in the direction he’s talking about. Many have stagnated if not collapsed recently. The days of cash are soon coming to an end, from all indications, and this can be a boon or a bust for banks everywhere. Kotak obviously feels pressure to innovate in an industry that’s about as innovative as wicker basket making.\n\nUnless you consider negative interest rates an innovation. With them becoming all the rage in European bankings sector and beyond, coupled with bans on cash, this can push consumers into banks and out of banks, creating a fork in the road. Banning cash will force people to either become even more dependent on their debit cards and credit cards for all of their shopping needs, at the expense of all privacy. There was a time not long ago when a consumer could make 6% a year on a Certificate of Deposit annually. Now, consumers may be paying banks to keep money in savings after negative interest rates become the new standard. This may drive revenue into banks in the short-term, but cost millions of customers in the long-term.\n\nOr consumers can rebel against this obvious manipulation of the financial system, and move towards trustless, peer-to-peer options like bitcoin, where the consumer acts as his own bank. The market may be heading towards having to make a choice between the total economic control of each transaction by the establishment’s bankers, or the ability to control one’s own money of from now on with digital currencies like bitcoin.\n\nIs Kotak just learning from history? Blockbuster video couldn’t imagine an online company like Netflix not only controlling the market within a matter of a few years, but bankrupting the legendary video franchise. Kodak was once the #1 camera maker in the world, until a phone company, Nokia, passed them seemingly overnight. Stranger things have happened.\n\nAre superior online options, both centralized and decentralized, coming to remove the average bank from the landscape by giving consumers the freedom and convenience they desire? The rapidly changing landscape in lending, spending and regulations may alter the financial world forever. And since money makes the world go round, all of this new technology may change us all forever. Maybe Kotak just sees the handwriting on the wall? Is Circle the next Netflix?\n\nNew technologies had beaten the establishment before and banished them into the corn fields. Is traditional banking next? It has billionaires like Kotak thinking about what’s next every night.\n\nHow worried should billionaire bankers be about powerful new technologies dwindling their business model? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A technology has two aspects — good and bad. The aspects however are not integrated within the functions of a technology; but instead, it is implied by its operator — the man — which decides whether to utilize an innovation for a good or bad purpose.\n\nBitcoin somewhere has fallen between these two distinctive flocks: one, which is trying to utilize its technology for making banking easier, faster and cheaper; the other, which is abusing it for all notorious crimes that hold the power to destabilize order. Speaking particular about the latter, criminals indeed have found an accessible companion to feed their empire of terrorism, money laundering, drug trafficking and various other illicit activities.\n\nSome Surveys, Opinions\n\nJust a few months back, Chartered Accountants and PwC conducted a survey to understand the strong demand of disrupting technologies in the future. It derided that over 23% of accounting and finance professionals found money laundering and terrorism to be the biggest roadblocks for Bitcoin. In the same survey, it was told that over 67% of the 10,000 participators believed Bitcoin to be used widely in the next 10 years — perhaps by a majority of criminals as well.\n\nRegulators have therefore found it troubling to compute laws that could be well-fitted with Bitcoin’s technological traits. Just a month ago, a meeting held between government officials and digital currency entrepreneurs thoroughly raised this issue. There the regulators believed that companies will play a major role while combating Bitcoin-related risks, with FinCEN head Jennifer Shasky Calvery adding that:\n\n“When I put my financial intelligence unit hat on and we’re trying to trace funds of criminal and other illicit actors, the reporting that we’re getting from some of the bitcoin exchangers is quite good. They use that technology mind to provide some really good reporting and do work that is incredibly helpful for law enforcement and FinCEN in terms of trying to trace money.”\n\nPerhaps, the government is too sure that criminals will be using centralized channels to move their money across the borders. But we have to see that the transactions can take place even without needing a Coinbase or iGot — through direct wallet-to-wallet payments.\n\nBut meanwhile, on the receivers’ end, the deposited Bitcoin equivalent of some giant transfer would be difficult to exchange with fiat currencies, especially when there will be regulated exchanges that would be sharing every transaction detail with their onlookers. A focus however would be needed on countries where terrorist financing and money laundering regulations are poor — such as in Pakistan, Iraq and many parts of Africa.\n\nBut would countries choose to impose an overall ban, should Bitcoin leave no choice for them? No, definitely. The digital currency undoubtedly has come too far from where it was started. It is gaining momentum in the name of mass consumer and merchant adoption, and constantly optimistic exposure to mainstream companies and regulatory bodies.\n\nGovernments will simply be compelled to flow with the wind and deal with Bitcoin’s criminalistic concerns alongside. It is the same with cash which, despite being one of the most avid tool for hawala and other illicit activities, has never faced ban thanks to its mass adoption.\n\nA technology has two aspects, literally.', 'SFU is the first Canadian university to accept the international digital currency, Bitcoin, in its bookstores.\n\nSFU has partnered with Bitsent to place automated Bitcoin vending machines (AVMs) in the Burnaby, Surrey, and Vancouver campuses, unveiling the AVMs at ribbon cutting ceremonies on Tuesday, May 26 through to Thursday, May 28.\n\nAt the ribbon cutting event in Burnaby on Tuesday — where students were treated to a $5 gift card with any $20 purchase at least partially using Bitcoin — Mark McLaughlin, executive director of SFU’s Ancillary Services, explained that this will allow students to try out Bitcoin, and explore a new technology.\n\n“For us at the bookstore, it’s about SFU being a bold and innovative university,” he said. “We’re giving students the opportunity to try it out on a small scale.”\n\nSFU had previously made the news as being the first Canadian university to accept Bitcoins for donations last September. McLaughlin credited student initiative as the reason that SFU was willing to give Bitcoin a chance, noting the drive of the SFU Bitcoin Club.\n\n“Students really persisted,” he said. “[The SFU Bitcoin Club] have been working hard at this, they’ve been working with us, they’ve been pushing us, and we want to respond to students. We’re here for students and we want to inspire them.\n\n“A lot of students coming to SFU nowadays are passionate and want to change the world. Well, maybe through Bitcoin, they’ll be able to change the world.”\n\n“For us at the bookstore, it’s about SFU being a bold and innovative university.” Mark McLaughlin, SFU Ancillary Services, executive director\n\nAs a decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin allows instantaneous transactions without the need for a debit or credit card, and is not held or regulated by any bank. For vendors, Bitcoin has fewer fees to process than for debit or credit cards.\n\n“[Bitcoin] kind of makes you want to rethink about the concept of money, why it has value,” said SFU Bitcoin Club president Mike Leung, who founded the club in 2013. “Bitcoin has a lot of benefits over traditional currency and how it’s used.”\n\nA student can purchase Bitcoins by downloading an app on their phone called a digital wallet. With the wallet, students can put cash into the AVM — which has a six percent processing fee, two percent going to SFU, with the rest going to Bitsent — and receive the equivalent amount in Bitcoin. One Bitcoin, as of Thursday, May 27, is worth around $295 Canadian, but they can be purchased in fractions.\n\nThe nature of the Bitcoin means that its value can fluctuate in comparison to physical currencies, meaning that there is both a risk of devaluation for long term investors, and a possibility for investment — in November 2013, one Bitcoin reached an all time high price of $1,242 USD.\n\nHowever, Bitsent founder Leo Dominguez explained that the volatility of Bitcoin is currently low enough that one can purchase Bitcoin and spend it without worrying about it devaluing between the time you hit the AVM and head to the checkout.\n\n“Unless you’re holding the Bitcoin for several days, weeks, or months, you’re not exposed to the volatility,” he noted.\n\nSFU is not taking any chances, though. Any purchase made in Bitcoin is immediately converted into Canadian dollars by the payment processor Bitpay.\n\nMcLaughlin sees the potential for other Ancillary Services establishments, such as SFU’s coffee shops, to adopt Bitcoin as well, if the bookstore’s acceptance of Bitcoin is a success. However, he is adamant that there no plan to accept Bitcoin for tuition, despite student — and particularly international student — interest.\n\n“Bitcoin is really brand new. These things take time to work through the system, and we’ll see. Bitcoin’s here today, might be gone in a year, we don’t know,” McLaughlin said. “Right now, within the bookstore, [it’s] just to create a little environment so students can really test it out and see for themselves.”', '0\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañolWhile companies worldwide are embracing the rise of decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin, Ecuadorian officials have chosen to make local banks adopt a home-grown state digital currency — whether they like it or not. The nation’s central bank has given them 360 days to get on board, with a mandate in Resolution 064-2015-M, released on May 25 in the official register.\n\nThe ruling, signed by Economic Policy Minister Patricio River Yánez, establishes that “all entities of the public, private, and cooperative financial sectors are obliged to incorporate themselves as macroagents within the Electronic Currency System.”\n\nThe document stipulates that financial institutions will have to provide an electronic tender option for “all the services that they currently offer and those that they will subsequently offer.” Each bank will thus have to open an account with the government-run Electronic Currency System.\n\nEcuadorian establishes the US dollar as the official currency, under the purview of the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE). The digital currency will, therefore, be “equivalent and convertible to US dollars.”\n\nThe objective of the electronic system is, according to the resolution, “to seek efficiency in payment systems to promote and contribute to the economic stability of the country.”\n\nCésar Robalino, president of the Ecuadorian Association of Private Banks, told Guayaquil-based newspaper El Universo that his organization has not yet opposed the electronic form of currency as a “payment method exclusively for transactional ends.”\n\nHe mentioned that it could be used to finance the public debt, although the administration of President Rafael Correa has insisted that this won’t happen. However, he cautioned that “you can’t create money out of nothing.”\n\nHe also lamented that the government had changed its previous stance on making the adoption of the system voluntary for financial institutions.\n\nThe resolution gives a sweeping and vague definition of “macroagents” for adoption: “companies, organizations, and public or private institutions; financial institutions of the popular and cooperative system; that maintain a network of establishments available for clients and are capable of acquiring mobile money, distributing it, or converting it into varieties of money.”\n\nAs of May 18 this year, 23,927 electronic-money accounts have been opened, according to BCE data.\n\nThe mandate on financial institutions to adopt the new system will apply in stages, depending upon the assets they possess. Those that hold U$1 billion and over in assets will have 120 days; those that have between $150 million and $1 billion will have 150 days; and those under $150 million will have 360 days to adopt the new system.\n\nThe Central Bank Supplanting Bitcoin?\n\nGustavo Solórzano Andrade, general manager of the BCE, stated in June 2014 that “the only currency of legal tender in Ecuador is the US dollar … used in all economic operations through payment methods authorized by the Central Bank of Ecuador … in this context, if an Ecuadorian citizen wishes to invest in bitcoins or another cryptocurrency it will be an individual and personal decision, and he will have to do so outside of Ecuadorian territory.”\n\nThe superintendent of Ecuador’s Banking and Securities body, Pedro Solines Chacón, further explained the ban by saying that “this cryptocurrency [bitcoin] has no regulating or supervisory body,” adding that cryptocurrencies carry the risk of money laundering and financing terrorism.\n\nBut for Luis Nuñez, a member of Ecuador’s bitcoin community, the absence of privacy in the BCE’s electronic money system “is far more worrying.”\n\n“With the electronic currency all transactions are linked to your identity, something which doesn’t happen with physical money, so it seems like a de facto acquired right is being progressively lost,” he told the PanAm Post.\n\nNuñez further argues that the BCE’s new payment method and cryptocurrencies follow two distinct models: “Bitcoin has a decentralized model that has clear rules: it’s transparent and public, it promotes freedom, and it’s adopted freely; the other is a centralized model that seeks to control information, and in which the rules conform to the political vision of the day.”\n\nNevertheless, the bitcoin proponent concludes that the state-backed electronic tender wouldn’t affect the the fortunes of bitcoin in Ecuador. Instead, the “legal uncertainty” surrounding the digital currency in the Andean nation is far more damaging.\n\nTranslated by Laurie Blair.', 'The developer of Genesis Coin, the physical cryptocoins, says that he will now be selling his products exclusively on Bitcointalk.org for the first month of the release. Currently, he has 300 coins available for purchase; if there are any left after the first month, the developer will open up to other sale avenues.\n\nAlso read: Citi Suggests UK Government Create its Own Digital Currency\n\nIn his detailed post, wheelz1200 says he will be selling a total of 300 coins in Series 1 of his line that spreads across 12 different cryptocoins:\n\nBitcoin: 10\n\nLitecoin: 10\n\nDogecoin: 10\n\nCoin2: 30\n\nHyper – 30\n\nPeercoin: 30\n\nNamecoin: 30\n\nShadowCash: 30\n\nDNotes: 30\n\nDarkcoin: 30\n\nReddcoin: 30\n\nClams: 30\n\nTalking about the inspiration behind the creation of crypto coins, wheelz1200 says that he was looking for physical representations of some of the lesser-known cruptocurrencies. When he saw that there weren’t many choices out there, he decided to create a brand new line of coins to compliment the current market.\n\nDesign and Features in Genesis Coin\n\nDue to the large cost of minting a short run of coins, each Genesis Coin will have the same generic design. The coin is 1.5” in diameter and is made from copper/brass alloy. Each coin will be serialized 1-10 or 1-30 depending on which coin you get.\n\nHe further explains:\n\n“The design on side one will have the word Genesis right in the middle, with a circle surrounding the word. On top of Genesis will be six dates and below will be six dates. Each one of those dates corresponds to the genesis block creation date for each one of the 12 coins in series one. On the outside rim will be the names of all 12 coins represented. On the bottom right will be the date 2015 to correspond to the mint date. Opposite on the left side will be a serialized engraving of the number coin it is. On the bottom center will be the coin’s name that it is engraved on the coin. On side two will be a full address on the top rim that will be specific to the coin that is engraved on side one.”\n\nSecurity Sticker\n\nThere will be a security sticker in a recessed area in the center of each coin. This sticker will cover the printout of the full security key that pairs with the address engraved on the coin. The security sticker has the company’s name that lights up under UV lighting.\n\nHow one Can Buy Genesis Coin?\n\nGenesis coin serialized 1-10 will be gold plated, and every coin serialized 11-30 will be silver plated (excluding Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, as only 10 of each will be produced). Wheelz1200 says that every coin serialized 1-15 and 26-30 will be packaged up into “packs”; the coins serialized 16-25 will be available for direct sale. He will be sending the coins in a non-see through, white package with a Genesis sticker placed on the front of the package. Thus, the only way to attain a Genisis Coin for Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Dogecoin is to buy a pack and luck out on getting the coin you want. The other coins will each have 10 available for direct sale, with the other 20 placed into packs as well.\n\nCustomers interested in buying the crypto coins need to pay in Bitcoin. Wheelz1200 will approve of a reputable escrow service from a BitcoinTalk member; wheelz1200 also warned potential buyers about fake usernames like wheelz120O or whee1z1200.\n\nWill you buy a Genesis Coin?

Forrest refuted the defense\'s characterization of the website as a ""harm-reducing"" ""economic experiment"" that simply got out of hand.\n\n""Silk Road was a planned, comprehensive, and deliberate scheme that posed a serious danger to public health,"" she said.\n\nJudge Forrest\'s finding that Silk Road was not a victimless experiment but a ""demand-expanding operation"" that exploited people\'s addictions was a significant concession to the prosecution — assistant US Attorneys Serrin Turner and Timothy Howard had claimed throughout the trial that the website had resulted in multiple drug-related deaths because of the ease with which it allowed people to purchase drugs.\n\nParents of drug overdose victims who spoke at Ulbricht\'s sentencing also noted how Silk Road\'s combination of accessibility and anonymity proved deadly for their sons. One of those sons overdosed on heroin, and the other suffered fatal head trauma after taking a synthetic drug and jumping off a building.\n\nThe drugs that ultimately led to their deaths, the parents said, were bought on Silk Road, where users needed only a shipping address and a bitcoin account to purchase a vast array of drugs — including cocaine, meth, and heroine — and never had to prove their age.\n\nWhen drugs are this accessible, ""the addict loses his ability to choose,"" said one father, whose son, Bryan, had struggled with a secret heroin addiction before fatally overdosing in 2013.\n\n\n\n""The lure of Silk Road\'s convenience and anonymity ultimately overpowered Bryan,"" he continued. “I strongly believe that my son would be here today if Ross Ulbricht had not created Silk Road.""\n\nOne particularly controversial aspect of the sentencing was Judge Forrest\'s decision to factor in murder-for-hire charges that were never actually pursued by the prosecution.\n\nShortly after his arrest, Ulbricht was accused of hiring assassins to murder six targets that threatened the existence of Silk Road. The government alleged that files were collected from Ulbricht\'s laptop detailing his plans to kill staff members he suspected were stealing money or leaking clients\' information.\n\nThe prosecution never officially filed the murder-for-hire charges, but Ulbricht was denied bail on the basis of these accusations. The judge stated Friday that there was ""ample, unambiguous evidence"" based on Ulbricht\'s own journal entries and the chats he had with hit men that he ""paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the murders.""\n\nJust because these deaths were never confirmed, Forrest noted, ""doesn\'t mean that Ulbricht didn\'t order them.""\n\n""Ulbricht knew that the first man [he ordered a hit on] had a wife and children,"" she added, pushing back against the defense\'s insistence that Ulbricht was a ""compassionate"" man and challenging Ulbricht\'s own claims about his ""love for humanity.""\n\nNoting that Ulbricht did not ""fit the typical criminal profile"" as an educated, seemingly well-adjusted family man with two degrees, Forrest reminded Ulbricht that he was still a criminal.\n\n""You are no better a person than any other drug dealer,"" she said.\n\nIf anything, Forrest argued, the global reach of Ulbricht\'s enterprise made him even worse than a traditional, street-level drug dealer. Silk Road, she said, ""was a ""demand-expanding"" operation with far-reaching consequences, from encouraging overseas drug production and increasing crime to destroying lives and families.\n\nThe website ""created demand and fulfilled demand"" on an unprecedented scale, and Ulbricht was well aware of both its impact and its illegality. He frequently referred to the operation in his journal as a ""worldwide criminal enterprise.""\n\n""It is still unclear to me why you ever wrote a journal,"" Forrest said. “But what is clear is that you were captain of the ship as Dread Pirate Roberts and you made your own law. It was your opus, and you wanted it to be your legacy.""\n\nForrest implied that the unprecedented nature and global scale of the operation made her more inclined to impose a harsh sentence.\n\n“What you did was unprecedented,” she told Ulbricht, “and in breaking that ground as the first person” he had to be punished accordingly.\n\nShe added that anyone who might consider following in Ulbricht\'s footsteps needed to understand clearly “and without equivocation that if you break the law this way, there will be very serious consequences.”']"
