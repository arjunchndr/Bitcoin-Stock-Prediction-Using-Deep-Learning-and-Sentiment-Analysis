09/01/2015,"['A second former federal agent in the Silk Road case has admitted to stealing $820,000 worth of bitcoins while hunting for the Dread Pirate Roberts, federal prosecutors say.\n\nShaun Bridges, a former Secret Service agent with the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force, pleaded guilty to money laundering and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThis follows a guilty plea in July by another former Secret Service agent, Carl Force, who admitting to money laundering and stealing $700,000 in bitcoins.\n\nBoth were part of the investigation of Ross Ulbricht, also known as Dread Pirate Roberts, who created the underground website Silk Road.\n\nSilk Road served as an online and anonymous marketplace for cocaine, LSD, hacking tutorials and other illegal products. In May, Ulbricht, who took his moniker from the movie ""The Princess Bride,"" was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nSilk Road dealt in Bitcoin, an electronic currency that is not backed by any government. Bitcoin is often used for illegal purchases because some of its users believe it\'s untraceable. It is also used for legitimate purchases, though not all businesses recognize it. The value of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since its creation in 2008.\n\nAccording to the government, Bridges fraudulently accessed Silk Road and stole 20,000 bitcoins, which were then worth about $350,000. He then moved the bitcoins into an account of Mt.Gox, a Japan-based Bitcoin exchange that shut down in 2014 after hundreds of millions of bitcoins in the exchange mysteriously disappeared.\n\nWhen Bridges cashed out his stolen bitcoins nearly a year before Mt.Gox vanished, their value had jumped to $820,000.\n\nHis lawyer, Steve Levin, said Bridges is taking ""responsibility"" for his actions.\n\n""During an otherwise stellar career that spanned several years, Mr. Bridges exercised poor judgment on one single day, over the course of a few short hours, and will have to live with the consequences for the rest of his life,"" Levin said.\n\nBridges faces sentencing on December 7.', 'For a long time gold was regarded as the safe haven currency of choice by many investors around the world. The logic was simple: gold has certain intrinsic traits that make it excellent for preserving value.\n\nAt the most basic physical level, gold generally doesn’t tarnish and doesn’t degrade over time. Gold also has some valuable uses in electronics and other industries. Further, supply is limited and demand is high, largely because people quite simply love the shine of gold. Add it all up and gold is a near perfect safe haven asset.\n\nBitcoin, for many of the same reasons, stands a good chance of becoming a top choice for investors to park their money in when the global economy is hit by a bout of turbulence. This isn’t pure speculation either: when Greece was on the verge of collapse and the Eurozone was at risk, Bitcoin’s price spiked from less than $250 dollars to over $300 dollars within the course of a month.\n\n[tweet_box design=”box_02?]Bitcoin stands a good chance of becoming a top choice for investors to park their money in when the global economy is hit.[/tweet_box]\n\nMeanwhile, with China suffering from huge economic and financial strains, Chinese buyers have been cashing in their yuan for Bitcoin. Slowed growth, dropping consumption, potential real estate, stock market bubbles and other conditions have made many Chinese investors nervous, and last week it spurred a huge sell off, which plunged stock markets around the globe into the red. If you had invested in Bitcoin at the beginning of last week, however, you would have watched your investments climb even as everyone else’s dropped.\n\nChina’s economic problems, which seemed to emerge out of nowhere, may explain why Bitcoin’s price rose from $209 dollars last Monday, at the start of China’s stock market collapse, to $230 dollars at the close of the week. A large portion of Bitcoin purchases over the past week have been in Chinese yuan. Why? With the economy slumping, the risk of the Chinese currency devaluing have increased substantially.\n\nWhy Bitcoin could emerge as a safe haven\n\nSo what makes Bitcoin a good candidate to emerge as a safe haven currency or asset? Many of the same features that make gold so valuable, also make Bitcoin valuable. First, and perhaps most importantly, like gold there is a limited supply of BTC. While governments can continually print up cash and use quantitative easing to add trillions of dollars to the money supply, only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be mined. After that 21 million mark is hit, no more digital coins can ever be produced, though it’s believed that this hard limit won’t be reached until sometime around 2140.\n\nLimited supply is especially valuable because it protects against inflation. While governments have a tendency to print money when they suffer tough economic times, Bitcoin will never face a similar scenario. If money supply does not increase, then generally speaking the risk of inflation is much lower. Gold’s limited supply, for example, has long been one of its most valuable traits and helps explain the metal’s position as a safe haven, and previous the commodity of choice for backing currencies. Bitcoin’s limited supply should make it similarly attractive.\n\nFurther, limited supply isn’t the only thing that makes Bitcoin valuable. Cryptocurrency consumes resources in order to be mined, which means you can’t just capriciously produce a bunch of random BTC. Money, on the other hand, can basically be created at will. If the US Federal Reserve System decides it wants to create $1 trillion in new money, it can do so.\n\nOn the other side, for Bitcoins to be made, miners have to produce them and that costs money because they have to purchase mining equipment and use a high amount of electricity. It’s a lot more expensive for miners to produce new Bitcoins than it is for the Federal Reserve to capriciously produce new money.\n\nInterestingly, the process for mining gold is similar. Lots of investments, time, energy and mining equipment is needed.\n\nSo what does all of this mean?\n\nThe jury isn’t out, of course, but so far Bitcoin has proven its chops during the last few market crises. Since cryptocurrency is so easy to access, use and convert, it’s becoming an increasingly popular option around the world. Add in Bitcoin and related technologies’ increasing prominence on Wall Street, it’s reasonable to assume that the currency will grow more popular among traders, professional and amateur, in the future.\n\nHowever, keep your eyes out for crises. If you have holdings in Bitcoin, you’ll likely see your coins appreciate when a major crisis roils the markets. Your gains might be 10 percent, 20 percent, or more. If the crisis looks like it’s going to be short and quickly blow over, selling your BTC in the aftermath of a market drop could be a smart move.\n\nOn the other hand, if conditions are going to worsen, you might be safer with your investments in Bitcoin. Financial crises are difficult to predict and there’s no surefire survival guide or money making strategy for when the economy does tank. Nevertheless, compared to a lot of traditional currencies, Bitcoin appears to be a pretty safe place to store your wealth.', 'Lightning networks are considered a promising innovation in the Bitcoin space, which would make the Bitcoin system much more scalable and able to process transactions at a high rate and low cost, and are suitable as an alternative to existing payment networks.\n\nIn February, developers Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja proposed a decentralized Bitcoin Lightning Network where related transactions can take place instantly on “micropayment channels” off-chain, and only the final settlement is processed by the blockchain. According to the authors, lightning networks would enable Bitcoin scalability, efficient micropayments, and near-instant transactions. The Lightning Network white paper, a work in progress, has recently been updated.\n\n“The payment network Visa has achieved 47,000 peak transactions per second on its network during the 2013 holidays, and averages hundreds of millions per day,” note the developers in the white paper. “Currently, Bitcoin supports less than 7 transactions per second with a 1 megabyte block limit.”\n\nIt seems evident that as long as the transaction rate supported by the Bitcoin network remains that low Bitcoin won’t be able to achieve the global reach of existing payment networks like Visa. That’s the main reason for the current – and heated – discussions about raising the block size. In a recent interview with MIT Technology Review, Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen warned that the Bitcoin network might soon become oversaturated, and people might just stop using Bitcoin because transactions would become either unreliable or expensive.\n\n“Looking at the transaction volume on the Bitcoin network, we need to address it within the next four or five months,” said Andresen. “As we get closer and closer to the limit, bad things start to happen. Networks close to capacity get congested and unreliable. If you want reliability, you’ll have to start paying higher and higher fees on transactions, and there will be a point where fees get high enough that people stop using Bitcoin.”\n\nThat’s what prompted Andresen to launch the Bitcoin XT alternative to Bitcoin Core, with 8 megabyte blocks, which is polarizing the Bitcoin community and could result in a “BItcoin civil war.” But lightning networks could achieve the same scalability and sustainability without requiring dramatic modifications to Bitcoin Core.\n\n“With a network of instantly confirmed micropayment channels whose payments are encumbered by timelocks and hashlock outputs, Bitcoin can scale to billions of users,” note the developers in the white paper. In a presentation at the SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar, Poon and Dryja argued that lightning networks could make Bitcoin capable of processing billions of transactions per day and handling the volume of all global electronic payments on a single blockchain without custodial risk of theft.\n\nThe implementation of lightning networks would require appropriate tweaks to Bitcoin core. A soft fork, described in Appendix A of the white paper, has been proposed to enable near-infinite scalability. “To mitigate malleability, it is necessary to make a soft-fork change to bitcoin,” note Poon and Dryja. “Older clients would still work, but miners would need to update. Bitcoin has had several soft forks in the past, including pay-to-script-hash (P2SH).”\n\nImplementing the malleability soft fork will take time, but in the meantime developers are beginning to build stand-alone implementations of lightning networks for development and testing. In May, Blockstream hired developer Rusty Russell to work on lightning networks.\n\n“[W]e can have a network of arbitrarily complicated transactions, such that they aren’t on the blockchain (and thus are fast, cheap and extremely scalable), but at every point are ready to be dropped onto the blockchain for resolution if there’s a problem,” said Russell. “This is genuinely revolutionary.”\n\nIn August, developer Mats Jerratsch launched a preliminary, simplified lightning network implementation dubbed “Thunder Network.” Jerratsch’s implementation, written in Java and available as open source code on Github, is less watertight than the full Lightning Network proposal, but doesn’t require a fork and can be used now as it is.\n\n“The initial proposal of the lightning network required some new features, that required at least a [soft fork], pushing any real implementation many months or even years into the future,” notes Jerratsch. “I, therefore, changed the channel design of the initial paper such that it can be implemented with the tools currently available in bitcoin. While such a channel does no longer work in a completely trustless manner, it is a good trade-off to start implementing LN. Most importantly, it allows deployment of software using something similar to the future LN implementations for now.”\n\n“I think there is a lot to be done, before LN (or similar) is even remotely useful,” said Jerratsch in a Reddit discussion. “My main goal is to start the process of implementing these changes, such that we may experience LN anywhere soon.” Jerratsch added that lightning networks won’t arrive in time to make any difference in the block size debate.', 'Beam relaunched their service as payment gateway for Ghanaians living abroad to buy services and products for family or friends living in their home country earlier this month. The firm will now only be accepting international debit and credit cards for payment, dropping the digital currency bitcoin as a payment option.\n\nBitcoin played a central role in the startup’s earlier business plans, which targeted undercutting remittance companies servicing the country by using the digital currency’s payment network. Beam cited bitcoin’s ability to be borderless and stored without a bank account as reasons the currency had potential in Ghana’s developing economy.\n\n“Using an international debit or credit card, you can pay for utility bills, top up airtime, send gifts or even get errands done back home in Ghana,” Beam CEO and cofounder Falk Benke told Disrupt Africa. “So no direct cash payouts anymore and we no longer accept bitcoin as means of payment.”\n\nBeam is also offering valet services, tuition payments, cable bills payments, and more. This type of money transfer is called value remittances, and involves the recipient receiving a product or service rather than actual money. It is a business model used by several African remittance companies as well as the Latin American remittance company Regalii, a graduate of the Y Combinator startup incubation program.\n\nBeam launched its original service in October 2014, suggesting that the local remittance market was ripe for an alternative. The company stated that local remittance fees were nearly three times than that of Asia and often suffered from delays. The firm partnered with several mobile money operators in the country so recipients could receive money directly to their phones, a form of payment that many Ghanaians are familiar with. It also gave them the ability to easily turn it into cash through mobile money tellers.\n\n""By using bitcoin to accept payments from remittance senders, we are able to receive payments instantly and with almost no fees.” said Beam cofounder and former CEO Nikunj Handa, in October of 2014.\n\nHowever, as the year progressed the firm discovered that while having several benefits there were also numerous drawbacks to bitcoin. Benke told Disrupt Africa that the cost of exchanging the digital currency to Ghanaian cedi, the country’s national currency, alongside bitcoin’s volatility and lack of merchant adoption contributed to the lack of adoption among consumers that led to company’s pivot.\n\nDigital Currency and Africa\n\nMany proponents of Bitcoin believe that it could have the most dramatic impact in emerging markets, including some countries in Africa. Many cite the currency’s adoption in Argentina, where the Argentine peso has experienced high inflation, bitcoin being one way for Argentines to escape its effects. Africa’s high inflationary currencies, and lack of financial infrastructure, are reasons many believe the digital currency will help the continent.\n\nBitcoin remittance startup BitPesa was one of the first digital currency startups to open for business in Africa, when it launched its beta service in May 2014. The firm, which services Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, has reported that its service has been growing steadily and the company raised $1.1 million in funding earlier this year. BitPesa has found that businesses paying suppliers and talent in Kenya to be its greatest source of customers, and is now focused on serving them. The company also operates a bitcoin exchange in all of the countries its remittance service is offered.\n\nBitPesa, however, remains the only real success story for bitcoin in Africa. Other African bitcoin companies, including Bitfinance in Zimbabwe, IceCUBED in South Africa and Nigeria, ZapGo in South Africa, or Bankymoon in South Africa have yet to raise a sizeable seed round or impressive customer metrics.\n\nBitsoko, a bitcoin and blockchain wallet in Kenya, did breathe some fresh life back into the space when it announced it received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Grand Challenges Explorations Competition, a program to find new companies that solve important issues in emerging markets, in June.\n\n“Daniel Bloch of Bitsoko in Kenya will develop their mobile money platform known as Bitsoko, which integrates Blockchain technology for low-cost transactions mediated by bitcoins. They have built a mobile wallet and a point-of-sale service for merchants that allows money to be easily and securely transferred around the world using only a Bitsoko username, phone number or bitcoin wallet address,” read the program’s website.\n\nBitcoin Remittance\n\nRemittance powered by bitcoin is commonly regarded as a use case that could propel the nascent digital currency into everyday use while saving unbanked immigrants billions of dollars in remittance fees at the same time.\n\nBy using Bitcoin’s cheap payment network, proponents claim that startups will be able to cut down the cost of remittances. Using the digital currency costs a fraction of the fees charged by large incumbents, including Western Union and MoneyGram.\n\nThe resulting massive savings would put more money in the pockets of people who rely on remittances for their basic needs, the poor and unbanked. Without a clear winner in the space, remittance analysts are still unsure whether bitcoin has a future in the remittance industry, or if blockchain technology will have a bigger impact.\n\nRemittance industry analyst, and SaveOnSend founder, Yakov Kofner thinks the case for bitcoin money transfer is weak. One example he gives to illustrate his point in a blog post is that nearly half of all expenses for the remittance incumbent Western Union were agent commissions, payments given to the people who manage the remittance company’s physical points of presence. This cost, Kofner points out, is one that bitcoin would have very little effect over.\n\n“It becomes apparent that most of [remittance companies’] costs are related to payments for receiving from and discharging funds to customers, customer acquisition, channel infrastructure, customer service, and risk-management-compliance, not in recording transactions or moving money cross-borders. Hence, providers are eagerly looking for more cost-effective ways to collect and distribute funds vis-a-vis customers, acquire customers, deploy offline and online channels, service customers, manage risks of releasing funds before getting paid… not functions where bitcoin seems to be offering a distinctive cost advantage,” wrote Kofner in a blog post.\n\nThe notion that bitcoin could help the unbanked, a reason often given why it will have potential in emerging markets, is also flawed according to Kofner. He puts forward that people sending $200 per month to their families in India, China, Philippines, Mexico, or elsewhere have money, and likely a bank account and a smart phone as well. An analysis of 2011-2012 World Bank and FDIC data by remittance startup Xoom (recently acquired by Paypal), showed that 78% of US resident non-citizens have a bank account. Western Union has also reported that the majority of the company’s customers are banked.\n\n“On the receiving end of remittances,” Kofner continues his post, “being unbanked is not a significant inconvenience or cost issue. With around 500,000 Western Union locations, money could be easily picked up by the great majority of such unbanked recipients. There will always be pockets of consumers who live in extremely remote areas, but reaching them with an advanced technology in a cost effective way is simply unrealistic at this point.”\n\nWhile many remittance experts and analysts debate the merits of bitcoin-based remittances, international transfers leveraging blockchain technology, the type of ledger that bitcoin is built on top of is becoming more and more popular among payment thought leaders. Though much of the conversation around blockchain technology has been focused on institutional applications the managing director and founder of payments research and consulting company Q Insights, Nasreen Quibria wrote in an American Bank Op-Ed that she could also see it being used in consumer to consumer transfers.\n\n“The blockchain could be particularly effective in improving cross-border payments, more specifically correspondent banking, business-to-business payments and peer-to-peer remittances. Each of these areas involve numerous inefficiencies. That could soon change,” wrote Quibria. “The blockchain faces no geographical borders and can reach any area with Internet access. Without middlemen, the fees, transactions times and opacity that have plagued legacy cross-border payments can become a thing of the past.”\n\nRipple Labs, the firm behind the Ripple protocol, tried to lessen the costs of consumer remittances when it first launched the Ripple distributed ledger, in 2012, which is technologically similar to Bitcoin. But the firm found that due to difficulties, including volume and regulation, that is was better suited for institutional uses, like bank-to-bank payments. Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larsen still describes the opportunity as one very much in the mind of the firm, and something they are interested in revisiting in the future.\n\nAlign Commerce, on the other hand, is taking a very different approach and targeting business-to-business (B2B) remittances powered by bitcoin in the background. And unlike previous startups, the firm does not require users to purchase bitcoin in order to use the service, avoiding the hassle and cost of obtaining the digital currency, while at the same time benefiting from the digital currency\'s advantages. The startup thinks that businesses will be more eager to change to a new remittance service for a cheaper rate than consumers, and that since they don’t have to touch bitcoin there is no barrier for those who don’t have any digital currency.', ""Benson Samuel is the CTO & Co-Founder of Coinsecure, a start-up focusing on solving the liquidity problem of bitcoin in India. Following a career in the payments space, Samuel realized that cryptocurrency could solve many of the issues that plagued the industry and took an instant liking to bitcoin.\n\nWith his newfound passion for bitcoin, Samuel found a critical problem early on, which was the lack of liquidity for bitcoin in the Indian market. This eventually led to the founding of Coinsecure- a bitcoin exchange which hopes to make bitcoin a part of every Indian’s wallet.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Tell us about Coinsecure and some upcoming projects.\n\nBenson Samuel: Coinsecure has proven itself to be one of India's best startups, whether it is in the Bitcoin space or from the growing Indian startups perspective. Apart from a Bitcoin Exchange, we are working on delivering a wallet and a merchant gateway as well. The wallet is live on our testnet system on coinsecureis.cool.\n\nWe also have a lot of educational events across schools, meetups and hackathons, where we engage with people to understand Bitcoin better. The next big one will be our mobile app, which will allow us to gain further traction with regards to Bitcoin.\n\n“Bitcoin has opened up people’s eyes to understand that there is an alternative [.]”\n\nCT: In what ways do you think bitcoin usage has impacted the average Indian? What do you envision in the near future for bitcoin usage in India?\n\nBS: Bitcoin has opened up people’s eyes to understand that there is an alternative to the current centralized system that we use. While it is currently being used widely to speculate or conduct arbitrage by the Indian trading community, Bitcoin’s future in India will get a lot more exciting with time, as more startups adopt Bitcoin and more tech is delivered around it for India.\n\nCT: What are your plans for Coinsecure?\n\nBS: Coinsecure has been a huge and ambitious project and it has come a long way. Mohit Kalra (The CEO of Coinsecure) and I build on the product everyday and are constantly tweaking and adding better features. Our aim is to build a product that can funnel an ecosystem, either by using our API or by conducting arbitrage on our platform. We are fast, reliable and we really understand what we are doing in this space, for India.\n\nCT: Micro-Payments and remittances are among the major pain points for the urban and rural sections of Indian society, which bitcoin could address immediately. Do you see bitcoin being used for the above scenarios and what is Coinsecure doing to facilitate this?\n\nBS: Yes, Bitcoin is very capable of micro-payments and remittances, but needs a bit more time before tech like sidechains or lightning network get standardized into Bitcoin. At the moment, last mile providers like us need to be used to convert the bitcoin to Indian Rupees. My hope is that this will change over the next 5-10 years and people will start to use bitcoin directly as they receive it. This is where it shines in the Indian Context.\n\nIn the meantime, we are releasing our version of a bitcoin wallet, which will provide off-chain capabilities, which will allow transactions as low as 1 satoshi with no fees and we will grow this into an on-chain solution option over the coming months.\n\n“It is just a matter of time, before the ecosystem explodes and provides options for Investment [.]”\n\nCT: In the past year, few other industries can compete with bitcoin in terms of innovation and momentum. This, off course, has led to an influx in VC capital. This, however, doesn’t hold true for India. What’s the reason for this?\n\nBS: VC's and angels are interested in Bitcoin in India. We have seen some seed funds and small stages being done. The larger amounts have obviously not entered into India as the ecosystem is in 'build up' mode. There is a tremendous amount of interest in this space. It is just a matter of time, before the ecosystem explodes and provides options for Investment, which is when this will start to look like an Industry."", 'Furor over management decisions, an abrupt CEO exit, a rising competitor.\n\nThe last few months haven\'t been kind to Reddit, the social networking giant that raised $50m in new funding in September from an A-list cast of VC firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital alongside angel investors including Snoop Dogg and Peter Thiel.\n\nHowever, if one former employee and bitcoin developer succeeds on his vision, Reddit\'s biggest challenge could be a decentralized, bitcoin-based alternative. Called DATT (short for Decentralize All the Things), the still-in-development social network recently held a global hackathon on 1st August aimed at kickstarting the project.\n\nProject leader Ryan X Charles, who was previously hired by Reddit to helm its short-lived cryptocurrency initiative, suggested that work on the idea is pressing forward, and that a prototype of the project is expected soon, providing CoinDesk a glimpse at what his team of 10 part-time developers have so far built.\n\nCharles suggested the project, kickstarted by a 5th July blog post that convinced him to leave his post at bitcoin security firm BitGo, could become a more ""more professional"" version of the social platform all too easily overtaken by frivolous bickering.\n\nIn short, he said, it might not look like Reddit at all if successful.\n\nCharles told CoinDesk:\n\n""I don\'t think we\'ll replace Reddit. We\'ll make something different that services a different need. By integrating payments, it will feel different than Reddit. As soon as people have incentive to host good content, this will change the dynamic.""\n\nThough much about the exact design of DATT remains to be determined (and currently lies in uncompleted GitHub form), the open-source project is so far built around a series of principles, that the network be uncensorable, feature strong anonymity and require nothing more than a web browser to operate.\n\nThe principals were developed at the hackathon, held in a distributed manner across Buenos Aires, Bombay and San Francisco. It saw some 100 participants take part in, or at least investigate, a Slack group for the weekend-long brainstorming session on how the project could be developed, designed and marketed.\n\n""We did quite a lot of stuff in one weekend,"" Charles said.\n\nProfessional destiny\n\nThroughout the interview, Charles framed the project as one that serves as a culmination of his professional skills. He says he\'s always wanted to start a business and is uniquely suited to creating a product like Reddit, having spent a short time at the company.\n\n""The pieces all fell into place and I have the right skill set, it\'s exactly the type of company I\'d want to start,"" he said, recalling the series of events that led former CEO Ellen Pao to be replaced by co-founder Steve Huffman.\n\n""I thought about my time at Reddit and realized that some of the stuff I was working on had the potential to fix problems with Reddit, and the validation [from the blog post response] was big enough for me to pursue it full time,"" he continued.\n\nCharles indicated a handful of investors are interested in the project, having reached out after his blog entry received widespread media coverage.\n\nThe post wasn\'t so much critical of his former employer as a referendum on social media platforms in general, which, in his words, ""focus a little more time converting content into money ... and a little less on building better tools"" for users.\n\nUnder the original vision, users will pay to download and upvote content to the website, with bitcoin being used as the currency to incentivize all the parties – readers, writers, moderators and developers – to keep producing valuable content.\n\n""Any user can run a business by running the app full-time,"" the post explained. ""Any user, including Reddit, Inc, can censor content they themselves deliver to other users, but cannot censor content other users send to other users.""\n\nUsers would pay content creators through votes, while creators would add posts and comments, in turn paying moderators for hosting the content. Node operators would then pay moderators who would finally pay DATT at a percentage determined by nodes.\n\nProject developers argue this will financially incentivize mods to increase the number of votes, and that nodes would be motivated to provide mods ""friendly policies around censorship"".\n\nPower to the people\n\nAs for how the project will aim to improve on Reddit, Charles was quick to downplay decentralization as a ""technical detail"", as opposed to something that would be the main value-add of the service.\n\nCharles suggested that DATT\'s most important feature will be its ability to return ownership of content to the site\'s users, who he said will be free to publish their own comments or content.\n\n“""The way the ownership works on Reddit is that, in effect, the company owns everything.""”\n\n""If some moderator doesn\'t like them, then the moderator shouldn\'t be able to ban them from the experience,"" Charles explained. ""With Reddit, the moderator can moderate in a community, but users can be shadowbanned or mistreated by mods and the mods mistreated by the company.""\n\nHe\'s clear in his critique of the service and what it hopes to change, adding: ""The way the ownership works on Reddit is that, in effect, the company owns everything.""\n\nWith DATT, moderators would in turn be able to host multiple versions of the content published through the platform, effectively creating different versions of the same content streams. DATT nodes will connect to the platform\'s peer-to-peer network, broadcasting content for download.\n\nThough this might lead usability to suffer, Charles said content creators will be able to take their content elsewhere if they feel slighted.\n\n""Even if a Reddit user is a perfectly good user, but they make the wrong mod angry, they can lose access to their content or their account unjustly, and there\'s no recourse other than leaving Reddit,"" he continued. ""If they go to [Reddit alternative] Voat they have to start over.""\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nDATT won\'t be built completely from scratch, however, as Charles indicated the project will seek to use other open-source technologies.\n\nIn particular, Charles said DATT\'s stack will leverage Bitcore, BitPay\'s open-source JavaScript bitcoin library, and the payments channels platform developed by the open-source livestreaming platform Streamium, which enables real-time micropayments.\n\nResources on the project\'s GitHub suggest the project may eventually implement the Lightning Network, a proposal to add payment channels to bitcoin, should it be developed.\n\nFor now, the project will be built on bitcoin due to the additional developer resources that are already available, with payments and proof of ownership handled on its blockchain.\n\n""We\'re using the bitcoin blockchain for payments, [and] we\'re going to use the bitcoin blockchain for putting the hash of your content on the blockchain, so someone can query if content exists even if they can\'t download it,"" he said.\n\nAs for the user experience, Charles indicated it was his goal for DATT to serve as an onboarding tool for new bitcoin users, meaning users won\'t have to pay to create content.\n\n""That\'s how the bootstrapping problem is solved,"" he stated. ""Write compelling content and people who do have money would be willing to pay for it. So long as we can draw some bitcoin users, the rest of the people will be able to earn bitcoin by using the app.""\n\nHurdles remain\n\nAs of now, Charles is optimistic a prototype of the platform, complete with payments and comments features, will be in place sometime in September. A minimum viable product (MVP), he suggested, could be as many as three months away from this milestone.\n\n""We don\'t want to build something really complicated that doesn\'t solve the problem, so we\'re trying to carefully move in the direction of enabling users to own [and sell] content,"" he said.\n\nThe MVP, as currently described, would feature a light node and a full node, with traditional bitcoin transactions being used in lieu of any payment systems.\n\nOf course, Charles is cognizant of the challenges ahead. Monetizing any content from consumer payments remains a challenge, even for the most well-capitalized publishers in an age where readers expect content to be subsidized by advertising.\n\nFurther, while he suggested bitcoin enables micropayments for perhaps the first time in history, he acknowledges the idea has been around for some time, always failing to take flight.\n\n""You can say the same thing about any idea, sometimes companies fail,"" he said in response to this line of questioning. ""I think the thing is we have to execute correctly.""\n\nStill, he expressed optimism that DATT would become useful for an early batch of users, whether disaffected Reddit participants or even professional writers and content creators, and that the project has a unique combination of factors that could propel it to success.\n\nCharles believes he has at least one advantage that could skew the results, concluding:\n\n""The earlier projects didn\'t have the technology.""\n\nA full log of project developments can be found on the project\'s official GitHub.\n\nImage credit: GongTo / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Over the last few months, the volume of all bitcoin trades have risen from US$1.65 million to US$2.6 million, showing a 158 percent monthly increase in trading volumes across all exchanges.\n\nIn August, Mercado Bitcoin, the largest bitcoin exchange in Brazil alone has processed 28.48 percent of all market share or US$740,480 worth of bitcoin trades.\n\nImage via bitValor\n\nAccording to BaseBit founder Daniel Novy, the majority of bitcoin-related news presented by major news outlets in Brazil is negative and affects the potent Brazilian population that is underbanked and underserved by financial institutions.\n\nDespite the negative image of bitcoin built by the media, many merchants are becoming more open to using bitcoin, due to its low transaction fees and high international exchange rates. With the strict financial regulations in countries like Argentina and Brazil, it is extremely difficult to move the local currency out of the country. Bitcoin in contrast, has a high international exchange rate, allowing merchants to store their income in a liquid currency or asset.\n\n“The problem we have in Brazil is that the only news that becomes mainstream is the bad ones. Bitcoin has a bad reputation here but anyway the merchants are definitely being more opened to it,” Novy told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nImage via bitValor', 'By default, Bitcoin clients connect to other bitcoin nodes on TCP port 8333. If a user wants their Bitcoin client to connect to other nodes, they will need to allow outgoing TCP connections on port 8333, and also will need to have the ability to accept connections on that same port.\n\nSome Bitcoin users have reported issues attempting to connect or receive connections to their bitcoin clients across port 8333.\n\nAfter spending an entire day effortlessly trying to get a bitcoin client working from a home computer, one AT&T Uverse customer called customer support.\n\nAfter hours of phone calls and messaging AT&T finally told me the truth of what was going on, and only because I noticed it myself and demanded an answer. The internet is being routed through a DVR/cable box, and they confirmed the DVR also has a firewall.\n\nAT&T Uverse is a bundled package similar to what many of the other nationally known Cable Companies / ISPs are offering. Home Internet service along with your TV channels in one, with added benefits such as DVRs, streaming music, games, and much more.\n\nThe issue arises when the ISP is in full control of the hardware from your house to their router to the Internet. Many big name providers will intentionally close a slew of connection ports in order to provide what the company deems to be the best level of service.\n\n“Perhaps this is the driving force behind the inexplicable and massive decline in Bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin is being censored by the ISPs themselves, and they won’t even tell you that. I had to get in touch with headquarters and threaten to rip it out of the wall to get a proper answer.”, the disgruntled AT&T Uverse customer concluded.\n\nFear not, for all hope is not lost. While some ISP may indeed be blocking port 8333, they’re not singling that specific port out. The ISP are simply blocking ports en masse.\n\nIf users are unsure whether their ISPs are blocking Bitcoin, they may opt to perform an inbound port test. There are several web based services that will test an inbound connection on a specific port for you. A web search of “port testing” will give users a few different free services to choose from. Performing a port scan on port 8333 on your own connection will let you know if your ISP is blocking it or not.\n\nIf the user’s ISP does happen to block port 8333, there are a few solutions they can turn to, all of which require a little bit of effort and technical ability on the end users part.\n\nFor starters, users can ask their ISP’s to put the router into “Bridge Mode”. This turns the ISPs hardware into nothing more than a simple connection to the Internet. The user would be required to provide their own router, and to handle the configuration and maintenance of that hardware. The downside is that many ISPs limit technical support when a home user requests their router be put into Bridge Mode.\n\nA second option, very similar to Bridge Mode, is to get a business account with the ISP. While these typically cost more money per month, they do come with additional benefits such as static IP Addresses, and higher bandwidth. Depending on the provider, business account may or may not come with their own Router, so users must be prepared to manage their own hardware with this scenario as well.\n\nIf users are concerned with telling their ISPs that they’re running a Bitcoin client, it just so happens that a few other well known services use port 8333. Instead of revealing any information about Bitcoin, users may tell their ISPs they’re running the VMWare Server Management User Interface, or the Y-Cam Wireless IP Camera.\n\nAre ISPs Intentionally Blocking Bitcoin? Probably not. It’s safer to assume the ISPs are simply protecting their own network by limiting open ports to the ones the vast majority of consumer level people are using. There are options available to users of all levels to work around any perceived limitations ISPs place on connections, and there is a fantastic bitcoin community eager to help in any way they can.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the community written and signed by many of the Bitcoin developers, including the most prolific contributors to (at least) three separate implementations of the Bitcoin system. Signers of this letter represent about 90% of the commits in the last year or two to Bitcoin Core, according to Greg Maxwell.\n\nAs active contributors to Bitcoin, we share this letter to communicate our plan of action related to technical consensus and Bitcoin scalability.\n\nBitcoin is many things to many people. However, the development and maintenance of Bitcoin is a human endeavor. Satoshi sought review and cooperation, and the subsequent work by Bitcoin’s developers has made the system more secure and orders of magnitude faster. The Bitcoin developer community is dedicated to the future of Bitcoin, looks after the health of the network, strives for the highest standards of performance, and works to keep Bitcoin secure on behalf of everyone.\n\nWe’re committed to Bitcoin and responsive to the needs of the community. For the past five years, we’ve written code and managed over 50 Bitcoin releases and reviewed more than 45 formal proposals to improve Bitcoin’s performance, security, and scalability. Technical discussions, while heated at times, are always focused on improving Bitcoin.\n\nMuch work has already been done in this area, from substantial improvements in CPU bottlenecks, memory usage, network efficiency, and initial block download times, to algorithmic scaling in general. However, a number of key challenges still remain, each with many significant considerations and tradeoffs to evaluate. We have worked on Bitcoin scaling for years while safeguarding the network’s core features of decentralization, security, and permissionless innovation. We’re committed to ensuring the largest possible number of users benefit from Bitcoin, without eroding these fundamental values.\n\nThere will be controversy from time to time, but Bitcoin is a security-critical system with billions of dollars of users’ assets that a mistake could compromise. To mitigate potential existential risks, it behooves us all to take the time to evaluate proposals that have been put forward and agree on the best solutions via the consensus-building process.\n\nIn the upcoming months, two open workshops will bring the community together to explore these issues. The first Scaling Bitcoin workshop will be in Montreal on September 12-13. The second workshop is planned for December 6-7 and will be hosted in Hong Kong to be more inclusive of Bitcoin’s global user base.\n\nWe ask the community to not prejudge and instead work collaboratively to reach the best outcome through the existing process and the supporting workshops. It’s great to already see broad excitement for the event and the high concentration of technical participants attending.\n\nWe’re confident that by working together we can agree on the best course of action. We believe this is the way forward and reinforces the existing review process that has served the Bitcoin development community (and Bitcoin in general) well to date.\n\nWe welcome your participation as we continue our efforts to bring Bitcoin into the future.\n\nSigned,\n\nWladimir J. van der Laan\n\nPieter Wuille\n\nCory Fields\n\nLuke Dashjr\n\nJonas Schnelli\n\nJorge Timón\n\nGreg Maxwell\n\nEric Voskuil\n\nAmir Taaki\n\nDave Collins\n\nMichael Ford\n\nPeter Todd\n\nPhillip Mienk\n\nSuhas Daftuar\n\nR E Broadley\n\nEric Lombrozo\n\nDaniel Kraft\n\nChris Moore\n\nAlex Morcos\n\ndexX7\n\nWarren Togami\n\nMark Friedenbach\n\nRoss Nicoll\n\nPavel Janík\n\nJosh Lehan\n\nAndrew Poelstra\n\nChristian Decker\n\nBryan Bishop\n\nBenedict Chan\n\n?tcDrak\n\nCharlie Lee\n\nJeremy Rubin\n\nIf you’d like to express your support of this letter, please sign the petition on Change.org.\n\nPhoto Kim Piper Werker / Flickr (CC)', 'Time is money. Which is why Indian startup SearchTrade is looking to change how the Internet functions today by rewarding people with bitcoin for their time spent using search engines. Along with the ability to purchase keywords like assets, the innovative approach to search engine monetization may usher in a whole new industry.\n\nSearch engine marketing\n\nSearch Engine Marketing and Search Engine Optimization are terms that definitely strike a chord with most Internet marketers today. For someone hoping to quickly scale the reach of his or her new brand on the internet, search engine marketing is truly the best thing since sliced bread and it’s certainly bringing home the bacon for Google and it’s competitors such Bing, Baidu and others.\n\nIt is estimated that overall, U.S. marketers will spend more than US$103 billion on search, display, social media, and email marketing by 2019—but search will remain the largest share of interactive spending (about 44%).\n\nThe reason behind the success of this model is not a tough one to crack; it’s simply convenient and cost effective. 74% of Google users perform local searches and 84% follow up the search offline via a phone call, visit etc. in order to purchase the product. This effectiveness mixed with the ability to place ads on a pay-per-click basis for specific keywords makes the search engine a great medium for marketing in comparison to direct mail and other more expensive routes.\n\nInnovation in the space is also not lacking with new players such as SmashFuse focusing on social search and discovery to provide users with more specific content. If user tracking isn’t your cup of tea, ethical search engine duckduckgo, which doesn’t track any its users, recently witnessed surges of 600% in direct searches and is on track to do 3 billion searches this year.\n\nIt pays to search\n\nHowever, two entrepreneurs from India, Vishal Gupta and Rashmit Gupta argue that in most cases the innovation has been at the front end of the user experience. The most exciting piece of the pie, i.e. the revenue model, is still up for grabs. This is something they hope to change through their startup SearchTrade.\n\nSearchTrade looks to reward users for their time spent searching for information on search engines. The plan is to incentivize the user with satoshis every time a keyword is entered. Where it gets interesting is that the user is also able to join in the network’s revenue pool by purchasing keywords as though it were assets. Once purchased, these keywords would then create revenue for the investor on every search generated involving the word throughout the network.\n\nGupta:\n\n“Users should gain the maximum benefit from their valuable time and information; hence the reason for this unique approach in rewarding them with bitcoin. Time is money and the time has come for Internet users to be paid for their input. This proactive approach will change the way the Internet functions today.”\n\nSearchTrade is set to launch in 107 days and has already generated a fan following by raising 91 BTC during a recent keyword presale.\n\nSo the question is, can you become a millionaire by spending more time searching for stuff on Google? It seems certain that in a world where Google’s ad revenue is now larger than that of the entire U.S. printing industry and startups like SearchTrade attempting to an create an even distribution, the question may be answered sooner than we expect.']"

The move is perhaps surprising given the originally skeptical outlook on the technology Alter voiced at the New York BitLicense hearings in early 2014.\n\nAt the two-day event, Alter was perhaps the most outspoken of NYDFS representatives on the potential downsides of digital currency regulation, arguing that the state\'s money laundering obligations should take priority over innovation and that the decentralized payment network\'s mining community represented a ""systemic threat"" to its operations.\n\nIn interview, Alter indicated that his opinion on the technology has since evolved as he became ""incredibly fascinated"" with developments in the field. Today, he finds that bitcoin and the blockchain could offer solutions for the very challenges it seemed to initially pose.\n\nAlter told CoinDesk:\n\n""At NYDFS, I had a special focus on anti-money laundering and economic sanctions enforcement. I thought [blockchain technology] had incredible applications and if it grows and is adopted more broadly could ... reduce regulatory costs. There\'s substantial time and effort that goes into compliance and this may provide an important answer to that problem.""\n\nAlter framed his interest in a position at itBit as an extension of his interests in compliance and regulation.\n\n""Over the months it came to pass I had this opportunity with itbit and thought this was a tremendous opportunity to pursue that,"" he said.\n\nAs for any potential conflict of interest from the appointment, Alter stated his position that he did not participate in the granting of itBit\'s New York banking charter. The approval, secured at the time of the company\'s $25m Series A in May, grants itBit the ability to serve customers in 50 US states and to hold customer deposits.\n\nThe comments position Alter in contrast to former NYDFS superintendent Ben Lawsky, who has previously indicated that he is unable to work with bitcoin industry firms as a private consultant.\n\n""I had no discussions about ever going to work with itBit, that didn\'t come up until months after I left NYDFS,"" Alter said. ""My ethical requirements are defined by NY state law, and I\'m sure there isn\'t the conflict of interest for me that a superintendent would encounter.""\n\nAlter\'s appointment coincides with the hiring of CFO Kim Petry, who formerly served as CFO and vice president of global commercial and corporate card payment at American Express.\n\nNew responsibilities\n\nIn regards to his new role at itBit, Alter indicated that he would play an ""active role"" in working with regulators as they seek to inform their positions on the technology.\n\n""I understand the benefits of the platform and can accommodate their concerns, adjusting the business and the message of doing business in a way that will give regulators security that it is being done right,"" he continued.\n\nAlter suggested that within the next three to six months he will be working with itBit to develop strategic relationships with investors, while also attending to the company\'s compliance efforts.\n\nHe further suggested that he would be uniquely suited toward helping others understand the potential of blockchain technology in financial transactions and settlement, while dissuading concerns similar to his own after first learning of the technology.\n\nAlter said:\n\n""Coming from where I come from, I have a sense of what those concerns are.""\n\nAt press time, the NYDFS had not responded to requests for comment.\n\nNew York image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Armstrong said the service is not considered regulated activity in Singapore.\n\nUnlike conventional currencies, bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Bitcoin is not backed by a government or central bank, and its value fluctuates according to demand by users.\n\nOn Wednesday, bitcoin was trading at $229.35, up 0.6 percent on the day.\n\nCoinbase also launched a retail buy and sell service for consumers as well as an exchange for professional traders in Canada earlier this week.\n\n“About a year ago, we made a decision to offer bitcoin services to as many countries in the world,” Armstrong told Reuters.\n\nAt present, Coinbase operates in 28 countries. Armstrong said the goal is to be in 40 countries by the end of 2015. “That would be an aggressive goal. So we may end up 2015 with 30-40 countries.”\n\nCoinbase currently has more than 3.9 million consumer wallets, 40,000 merchants using its payment mechanism and 7,000 software developers using its platform to create new products.

From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the internet.”\n\nWhile it has had a relatively strong security record, it has been subject to a number of attacks and vulnerabilities have been identified.\n\nThe likelihood is that as it evolves and becomes more prominent and lucrative, it will face even greater threats from cybercriminals. Security, as outlined by the signees of the open letter, will be high on the agenda.\n\nAuthor Karl Thomas, ESET', 'BitFury has announced it has completed the tape-out for its 16NM ASIC bitcoin mining chips, which were first revealed to be in production in February.\n\nThe chip will achieve energy efficiency of 0.06 joules per gigahash, compared to the 0.2 joules per gigahash of its 28nm predecessor. BitFury suggested the chip will deliver ""four times the compute power"" of its previous 28NM chip.\n\nThe startup, which has so far raised $60m in VC financing, used the announcement to tout its commitment to green energy, the strength of its immersion cooling process and what it called an ability to compete in a ""new era"" of bitcoin mining, in which the total computing power of the network exceeds 1,000 petahash.\n\nBitFury CEO Valery Vavilov said:\n\n""All told, BitFury is leading the development of environmentally-responsible infrastructure for the next chapter of the Internet based on the bitcoin protocol and blockchain technology.""\n\nBitFury further suggested the new technology would likely be deployed in data centers that could be located in North America – a potential first for the company.\n\nIn the past, the company has faced criticism for basing its mining operations outside the US, though it has maintained it is primarily concerned with the cost of data center development in places where energy and building costs are beneficial.\n\nThe announcement comes amid a continued push for efficiency in the bitcoin mining space, following KnCMiner\'s June news that it had released the 16NM KnC Solar chip.\n\nBitFury image via Facebook\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Instead, they would prefer “permissioned ledgers” owned and by the banks, which can be operated only by vetted players. Think of “BankCoin” blockchains that only the banks and the authorities have access to.\n\nSince this trend appears to be rising fast, many startups are developing infrastructures for permissioned ledgers.\n\nSETL is a permissioned ledger system that aims to be as palatable to top-tier banks as possible, with a view to moving cash and assets immediately and achieving settlement finality of transactions, International Business Times reports. The brainchild of hedge-fund investor Anthony Culligan and Peter Randall, former CEO of leading equities market Chi-X Europe, the SETL blockchain system runs alongside and can be integrated into existing systems.\n\n“If you make the assumption that the nodes are actually basically benevolent to each other, which they are, of course, if you have got identity attached to it, then the type of cryptography and, therefore, the time it takes gets a lot easier,” said Randall, who is persuaded that vetted identities and capacity within a blockchain system are usefully related. “[I]f you are not talking in the tens of thousands per second, and possibly hundreds of thousands per second, in terms of transactions for financial services globally, you are crazy.”\n\nFollowing this logic, Randall sees a possible scenario where the major financial players operate their own private blockchains, “a UBS chain and a Deutsche Bank chain and a Morgan Stanley chain and a JP Morgan chain and so on.” But he is persuaded that the BankCoins would eventually have to become interoperable for global reach and increased efficiency.\n\nSETL’s network would work in the same way as the bitcoin blockchain, generated from each participant’s server. The ledger of transactions would be stored on these servers, with encryption, but regulators or auditors would be given access to identify the parties involved. “We want to unlock the power of the blockchain for financial markets,” Randall said an interview as reported by Reuters. The technology will be regulator-friendly and “permissioned,” meaning that participants’ identities can be derived by regulators and auditors if required.\n\nA similar position was recently formulated by two Accenture representatives.\n\n“To be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus,” they said.\n\nBloomberg Business is running a profile of Blythe Masters, which is also the cover story in the October 2015 print edition of Bloomberg Markets. Masters, a financial superstar and a former JPMorgan executive, is the CEO of digital economy startupDigital Asset Holdings. In June, Digital Asset Holdings acquired Hyperledger, a company that developed distributed ledger technology to allow banks and other financial institutions to clear and settle transactions in real time. The company’s technology enables financial institutions to create multiple private blockchains across a known group of participants. Unlike other distributed ledgers, Hyperledger does not have an inbuilt cryptocurrency and uses a proven consensus algorithm capable of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nMasters is persuaded that Hyperledger’s private, permissioned blockchain technology will permit developing “gated communities” where trusted users will be able to process transactions themselves rather than depend on the open bitcoin blockchain, which in her opinion is required for mainstream adoption. “With private chains, you can have a completely known universe of transaction processors,” Masters says. “That appeals to financial institutions that are wary of the bitcoin blockchain.”\n\nThe Bloomberg article notes that Masters is determined to make the financial system more efficient, using a technology that was initially designed to bypass the financial system – the technology of Bitcoin – without the troublesome openness and potential for privacy.\n\nBut it’s wise to bear in mind one simple fact – Bitcoin works. While closed, permissioned blockchains and BankCoins might theoretically work tomorrow, Bitcoin works in practice today, and perhaps the chaotic anarchy of the Bitcoin network is the very reason it works.\n\nPhoto Carlos Delgado / CC-BY-SA', 'Before the proceeding ended, prosecutor Katherine Haun mentioned that the government had just received information that gave them concerns that Bridges could be a flight risk.\n\n\n\n""The defendant had been actively trying to change his name and social security number in the state of Maryland,"" she told the judge. ""That\'s very concerning.""\n\n\n\nAccording to Hahn, Bridges had tried to change his last name to be the same as his wife\'s last name and change his first name to ""a very odd name.""

An FBI team out of NY beat the Baltimore DEA/Secret Service team to finding Ross Ulbricht, leading to a weird situation in which, hours later, the Baltimore folks filed their own indictment with somewhat different charges, including a trumped up fake murder of a former Silk Road employee, that was supposedly ""carried out"" by an undercover agent, later revealed to be DEA agent Carl Force, who Ulbricht contacted for help. The story was crazy and cinematic, but apparently that wasn\'t even half of it, because the story in March revealed that two members of the Baltimore team, including Force, had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from Silk Road. It also revealed that the ""murder for hire"" plot against the ex-employee only happened after the Secret Service agent, Sean Bridges, stole Bitcoin from Silk Road, leading Ulbricht to think that it was the former employee, Curtis Green.So, yes, you had a DEA agent, Carl Force, who was already moonlighting for a Bitcoin company, and who used his position as a DEA agent to steal a bunch of money from a customer of that Bitcoin company, befriending Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road while supposedly ""investigating"" him. Then, you had a colleague of Force\'s, the Secret Service agent Bridges, go and steal a bunch of Bitcoin from Silk Road immediately following the arrest of Curtis Green, one of Ulbricht\'s top lieutenants. Green revealed his admin login, and Bridges just went in and took a ton of money. Ulbricht then contacted Force, to help him kill Green, because Ulbricht believed that Green had stolen the money that Bridges had actually stolen. It\'s so complicated it feels like it needs a graphic to explain it all, but even that might be too confusing.Either way, earlier this summer, Force pleaded guilty , and earlier this week Bridges also pleaded guilty . In both cases, some interesting additional information came out. With Force, it was that, prior to his own arrest, he\'d apparentlyto his story of tracking down Ulbricht to Fox for $240,000. As the government pointed out, this was a conflict of interest (you think?).With Bridges, it\'s that he had been attempting to change his name and social security number, leading the judge to wonder if he was a flight risk. According to Joe Mullin at Ars Technica:Bridges\' lawyer came up with an excuse that is so ridiculous that it literally made me laugh out loud. Bridges wasn\'t trying to change his first name, last name and social security in order to disappear from the law, or to avoid the reputational harm of being known as a former Secret Service agent who stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from an operation he was investigating... but because he was so, so worried about the recent OPM hack of government employee files. Bridges, of course, was a government employee:Somehow, among the millions of others concerned about the OPM hack, you don\'t hear too many stories about them trying to change their first and last names along with their social security number...', 'Bitcoin payments services startup Paymium has raised €1m in new seed funding from investors including Newfund and Kima Ventures.\n\nFounded in 2011, Paris-based Paymium, while not a marquee name in its sector, has so far garnered notable partnerships with online fashion retailer Showroomprive – then the largest merchant in Europe – and point-of-sale solution provider Ingenico.\n\nDespite the success in its home market, however, Paymium president and co-founder Pierre Noizat suggested the funding round was perhaps lower than it would have been if the company had been focused on the US market.\n\nNoizat told CoinDesk:\n\n""In the US, bitcoin awareness and venture capital funds are much more available.

Should suspicious actions take place, it is the responsibility of the MSB to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARS) with FinCEN.\n\nSuspicious activities come in a myriad of guises and can be difficult to detect. Some examples include high rates of rejected transactions, and complaints or enquiries from other financial institutions. Ignoring them can be detrimental to the business in question.\n\nAccording to a Justice Department press release CommerceWest Bank facilitated consumer fraud schemes, and failed to file SARS. The department charged the bank with a felony violation of the BSA in connection with a third-party payment processor V Internet Corp LLC, based out of Las Vegas. Allegedly CommerceWest Bank allowed this third-party to withdraw millions of dollars from consumer accounts without authorization\n\n“CommerceWest Bank ignored a parade of red flags indicating that a third-party payment processor was defrauding hundreds of thousands of innocent victims,” said General Benjamin C. Mizer Acting Assistant Attorney of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “As the civil and criminal actions filed against CommerceWest Bank today demonstrate, we will hold financial institutions accountable when they choose unlawfully to look the other way while fraudsters use the bank’s accounts to steal millions of dollars from American consumers.”\n\nV Internet’s debit transactions had an abnormally high rate of rejected transactions. According to a press release from the Department of Justice, 50 percent of the transactions were returned by consumers and their banks. “Many of those returned transactions included sworn affidavits, in which victims stated, under penalty of perjury, that the withdrawals on their accounts were unauthorized.”\n\nIn addition, other banks believed that V Internet’s transactions were fraudulent, and expressed their beliefs to CommerceWest. However, theses explicit warnings allegedly fell on deaf ears, and CommerceWest continued business with the third-party failing to terminate their relationship or file SARS. “Instead, CommerceWest and V Internet developed a practice of blocking transactions against accounts at those banks that complained, but allowing the transactions to continue against accounts at all other banks,” said the Department of Justice.\n\n- Acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie Yonekura of the Central District of California\n\n“CommerceWest Bank not only failed to comply with its statutory obligation to notify the government of suspicious illegal activity involving consumer fraud,” added the Inspector in Charge, Gary Barksdale of the USPIS. “The bank also allowed fraudulent activity to continue through its accounts to the detriment of the American consumer.”\n\nThe mistakes made by CommerceWest Bank resulted in a US$4.9m civil and criminal resolution. To a startup in the digital currency space, these red flags can be easily overlooked.\n\nHashingSpace Corporation is a bitcoin ASIC mining and hosting company, based out of Washington. In addition to mining, the company offers a slew of other products, including but not limited to HashWallet and ATMs. IdentityMind is recognised as one of the leading providers of compliance services, including Anti Money Laundering (AML).

""Money laundering is an issue we take seriously, and compliance issues are a complicated obstacle that companies in our space have to stay current with. IdentityMind\'s complete risk and AML solution will give us the capabilities we need to identify and prevent these issues.""\n\nAs legal frameworks for digital currency MSBs evolves, expertise will need to follow suit.

He has been involved with the Israeli Bitcoin Association, The Bitcoin Embassy in Tel Aviv, and has founded AlefBit — the first Bitcoin education website in Hebrew.\n\nThere has been much talk about the “Bitcoin fork” lately. So I thought it would be appropriate to explain some of technical stuff behind this obscure phrase.\n\nThe word ‘fork’ in this context originates from open source software. Open source software is computer code, which is intended to be openly accessible and liberally used by anyone reading it. Open source software can be coded communally (such as with the GitHub platform), or alternatively can be copied locally and coded separately.\n\nThe development of software like this would allow to draw trees: each time the code was copied separately there would be a new branch. This would be called ‘forking’, since the same code would then develop in two parallel directions.\n\nAs we know, the Blockchain is decentralized, which by definition means there is no absolutely “correct” chain. Each node in the network downloads all the blocks to connect a chain, verifies them against the laws of math and Bitcoin and chooses the correct chain accordingly. For instance, if there is a block that has an invalid cryptographic signature, any chain including that block is invalid.\n\nA block will also be invalid if there is a violation of the Bitcoin rules such as, for instance, if a miner rewards themselves with 26 coins instead of 25 as per protocol. Either way, it is up to the individual to verify the validity of the blockchain. Therefore, it seems, if there are two conflicting chains, one is valid and the other is malicious.\n\nHowever, small forks happen in the blockchain naturally quite often. If two miners find a new block at the exact same second, they will both have valid and legitimate blocks, and neither will have a reason to toss it out. Both blocks are linked to the last one, but the block after will have to be linked to one of these two. Technically, this is a fork in the blockchain.\n\nThis happens every so often in the blockchain with no malintent. Miners tend to quickly converge on one chain and discard the other because of profit-related motives, and so these discarded chains are usually only one block long and are considered a statistical loss. While technically these are forks, they are short and not intentional, so they are referred to as “orphaned blocks”.\n\nWhat we’re hearing in the news these days is a whole different beast.\n\nThere is a heated technical discussion on a significant issue for a few years: how Bitcoin deals with scalability and high load. Only recently has the discussion become a more broadly discussed matter, seeing as how nothing has been done and with all the growth lately, the blockchain has been under stress and experiencing delays and higher costs for transactions. The technical discussion is immense and interesting, and any summary will not do it justice.\n\nIn one sentence, the issue revolves around block size: currently limited to 1MB per block of transaction. A measure put in place years ago to prevent DOS attacks, but kicking the can down the road for how to scale Bitcoin and allow for more widespread use of the system.\n\nThe most interesting recent developments involved a few developers writing a new version of the Bitcoin software. The project named BitcoinXT is lead by Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen, and it takes a practical stand on the issue, allowing for bigger blocks. This is not the first time a new version of the Bitcoin software is written, but it is the first time one is created with the intention of allowing the blockchain to fork.\n\nHow does the blockchain fork?\n\nFor a very long time, this discussion has been a topic mostly for the core developers, those contributing and volunteering time to work on the Bitcoin core code. However, Bitcoin is not under their control, and neither under the control of miners. While there are smart minds on either side of the debate, the blockchain is apathetic to opinions.\n\nThe new software allows for something that the old software does not. Something the old software would consider a violation of the rules of Bitcoin: blocks larger than 1MB. As a decentralized system, there is no higher authority which will make a decision, rather each node chooses for itself what are the rules of Bitcoin (a.k.a “The Bitcoin Protocol”). This is why recent developments are so interesting: using the new software is a way of choosing new Bitcoin rules.\n\nObviously, the developers of this software are not interested in breaking the rules, and they would only take effect if 75 percent of recent blocks signal that they are in favor of these new rules, a form of voting for support and consensus. Once we see the first block with the new rules – those who have not accepted them will consider the block invalid and will ignore while those who have accepted the new rules will consider the block valid and will add new blocks on top of it. This is where the blockchain forks.\n\nWhat happens when the blockchain forks?\n\nIt’s actually quite simple: you get two chains with a shared genesis and are identical up until the forking point, after which they exist exclusively in parallel (unless one is completely abandoned), creating two separate networks.\n\nCoins in my possession (all transactions leading up to that) before the fork remain mine on both chains after the fork, and both chains agree on those transactions since they were all before the fork. After the fork, each transaction takes place exclusively on each separate chain. It would be expected that each chain and the coins on each of those chains would get its own name (like Bitcoin vs. BitcoinXT).\n\nThe economies around each of these chains inherit the economies from the shared economy before the fork, so even though there are now twice as many coins, there is not twice as much value. In fact, the economy would split along with the networks. Therefore, when considering when and how to split, one should consider both technical and economic majorities. Even if 75 percent of the recent blocks were in favor of a fork, it is possible that less or more than 75 percent of the economy is in favor.\n\nIt may sound confusing, but this system allows for maximum individual freedom and minimum collateral damage. In the eyes of many, Bitcoin is still too young and it’s still too early in the experiment to split into two separate networks and two separate currencies (which is why waiting for a larger consensus before forking the Blockchain is a good idea).\n\nIf the new software would only wait for 50 percent of the network showing support before forking, it is possible that there would be no clear winner: both chains would compete and panic would ensue. Theoretically, though, the network can fork with only 20 percent support, taking along only a minority if they wish.\n\nHow is it even possible to do this?\n\nThis is a big principle in Bitcoin: there is no need to trust anyone, and everyone should enforce their own rules. Whether or not the new software gets support from 75 percent of miners, this is an interesting story to follow in the news, but now that you know what a fork is and how significant it is, you will understand why it is such a heated debate and why recent developments are so controversial.\n\nThe most recent developments\n\nBitcoinXT is actually an implementation of the the BIP101 proposal – Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen’s proposal for how to increase blocksize. That being said, there are other proposals for increasing blocksize, all curiously named BIP100, BIP102, and BIP103. As of writing these lines BIP100 – a proposal to allow miners to vote on blocksize with a 32MB maximum – seems to have the widest support among mining hashing power.\n\nIt seems that the mining industry is, generally speaking, wary of BitcoinXT, however they are supportive of the ability to increase the blocksize to 8MB. Some mining pools are allowing their miners to individually vote. Considering all these proposals are carefully designed to take time as well as gain consensus, all this can and will still change as the proposals and discussions are developing.\n\nFollowing the news\n\nEven if you aren’t a tech-savvy person, it is unreasonable to stay away from cryptocurrencies, as they are gaining momentum. An in-depth knowledge of how Bitcoin and blockchain works are appreciated, but to stay on the board, you can simply follow the news and, literally, get some bitcoins.']"
09/03/2015,"['In April, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Bitcoin exchange itBit had filed for a banking license in New York. Later in May, itBit was granted a trust charter by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYFDS) under New York State banking law, the first such charter granted to a digital currency company by the NYDFS. ItBit also announced the successful completion of a $25 million Series A funding round.\n\nOn September 2, itBit announced the appointments of Daniel “Danny” Alter as the company’s new general counsel and chief compliance officer, and Kim Petry as chief financial officer. Petry was previously CFO of global operations and technology at Broadridge Financial Services and, before that, served as CFO and vice president of global commercial/corporate card payment at American Express.\n\nAlter joined itBit after stepping down in February from his most recent post as general counsel of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), where he served as principal counsel and strategic adviser to the New York state superintendent of financial services.\n\nThe former New York State Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky left the NYDFS after releasing the controversial Bitlicense regulations for digital currency businesses operating in New York. Lawsky’s move to a consulting business was strongly criticized by the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\n“Because of the contacts he made as a regulator, [Lawsky] can hire himself out to Bitcoin companies wanting to signal to other regulators that they have the approval of the regulatory establishment,” noted Cato Senior Fellow Jim Harper.\n\nIt seems likely that Alter’s move to itBit might be criticized in the same grounds.\n\n“The New York State Public Officers law requires that I have a two-year recusal before I can appear before the New York Department of Financial Services on behalf of the company,” said Alter in a pre-emptive statement reported by Reuters. “And it will certainly apply to itBit. I will not step near or have any communications with the New York Department of Financial Services. Those will be handled by outside counsel or qualified compliance people within the company.”\n\n“Between Danny’s deep expertise in financial services and virtual currency regulation and Kim’s demonstrated track record as a successful CFO of global financial organizations, I’m confident that itBit will continue to grow and develop innovative blockchain-based solutions to address the financial industry’s greatest pain points,” said itBit co-founder and CEO Chad Cascarilla. “Danny and Kim possess a deep understanding of how to grow and run a successful business within the regulatory framework of the financial services industry, and their expertise will be invaluable as we work toward the launch of our new permissioned distributed ledger product – Bankchain.”\n\nBankchain, a new high profile project still held under wraps by itBit, will be a closed, “permissioned blockchain” owned and operated by banks and financial institutions – in other words, a private blockchain without bitcoin and anonymous miners. According to itBit claims, Bankchain will automate, accelerate and simplify post-trade processes across the financial services industry, saving institutions time and money.\n\nBankchain is “the first consensus-based ledger system exclusively for financial institutions,” states the still very basic Bankchain website. “Bankchain is a new clearing and settlement network that leverages blockchain technology to reimagine how financial institutions execute post-trade. The decentralized network is powered by itBit but fully governed by the member participants that join the platform.”\n\n“[Bankchain] is a proprietary itBit protocol, not blockchain based, but is derived off of blockchain,” itBit head of global operations Steve Wager told Coindesk in August. “We will also not be using bitcoin as the native token; it will be an itBit proprietary token.”\n\nReddit users strongly criticized the “Sinister Bankchain Project,” but it appears that the trend toward private, permissioned blockchains is here to stay, with strong support expressed, among others, by Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters.\n\nThis article has been updated to correct Jim Harper’s name.', 'Barclays is testing Bitcoin as it looks into the potential of the cryptocurrency for online banking, charity support and other use cases.\n\nCryptocurrency is defines as digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank- with Bitcoin emerging as the most popular example of this.\n\nThe move follows a £10m investment by the UK government into cryptocurrency research, announced in the 2015 budget.\n\nSeveral banks headquartered in the UK want to find the positives and negatives of implementing cryptocurrencies.\n\nBarclays will initially test Bitcoin support for charities, but plans to look at further support for online banking in the future.\n\nThe bank has two research centres in Notting Hill and Old Street, one focused on Bitcoin, the other on blockchain. It also has another research centre in Whitechapel for new technologies to be researched and implemented.\n\nBitcoin has seen a large drop in interest, but started to recover in late 2014. The Greek financial crisis has helped the cryptocurrency, with a lot of Greek residents using Bitcoin to get past the current capital controls on banks.\n\nMost developed economies have rejected Bitcoin as a ‘currency’, lowering the value of it significantly. The investment by the UK government into research shows there is still some potential of it becoming a recognised currency in the future.\n\nHSBC will also look into Bitcoin implementation. The multinational bank originally called on the government to look into Bitcoin in 2014.', 'The controversial group behind several bitcoin \'stress tests\' has confirmed it will push ahead with its biggest experiment to date.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, CoinWallet COO James Wilson said the test – which could reportedly cause a 30-day backlog of transactions – would be executed at 10am Thursday (GMT) next week.\n\nThe mysterious group, which sees its work as a drastic but necessary demonstration of Bitcoin XT\'s need, has been criticised by some users for ""bullying"" a live network worth several billion dollars.\n\nIts first test in June, which aimed to fill blocks with 105 BTC broken into thousands of small transactions, reached just 15% of its 200MB goal before its servers crashed.\n\nLeft waiting\n\nAlthough Wilson did not provide any specifics on next week\'s test, he did take credit for yesterday\'s network disruption – an apparent trial run which saw unconfirmed transactions on the network pile up to 50MB.\n\nHe said the group paid five times the standard fee – 0.0005 BTC per KB – to give its transactions priority on the network and ""leave others waiting"". Not all miners took the bait however, with some disregarding CoinWallet\'s transactions despite their higher fees. Wilson, who framed these actions as a form of censorship, said:\n\n""Today miners may avoid high paying \'spam\' transactions (although such a classification is ridiculous, a transaction is a transaction) but tomorrow they may start throttling gambling transactions or use similar filtering to attack competitors.""\n\nThe tests come at a highly-charged time in bitcoin\'s development. Following the release of Bitcoin XT, the currency\'s major developers and contributors have been unable to reach a consensus on how bitcoin should be scaled – and what it should sacrifice in the process – as it approaches its so-called \'capacity cliff\'.\n\nWhile Jeff Garzik\'s BIP 100 proposal has seen increased support from bitcoin\'s biggest miners, wallets and other consumer services are still behind BIP 101, which grants miners less decision-making power.

Bitcoin\'s blockchain tracks who has had each Bitcoin, verifies its authenticity, and so on.\n\nThis technology, however, has much broader applications. As governments move to release more data and documents online, verifying the authenticity of those files will become increasingly important. In the future, governments could use blockchains to track and verify the ownership of property records, banking records, securities or anything else posted on an open data platform.\n\nBrian Forde, the director of the MIT Media Lab\'s Digital Currency Initiative, explores the concept in the video below.\n\nBy 2020, using blockchain technology might even become a best practice for the verification of public records online.\n\nMakes sense, @digiphile.

Now, a contract was awarded to a company in Texas to set up a blockchain-based property system.""\n\nThat example and others are drawing attention in other contexts, from countries around the world. In the United States, the blockchain might be a way of validating voter records before and after elections, making entries perusable and insulating them from fraud. It might also be relevant to securities, adding a technological component that would make fraud by corrupt officials much harder.\n\nGiven how blockchain technology has matured in recent years, Goodenough says it\'s just going to require hard work to get it into use -- and he hopes that Vermont will be a leader in that area.\n\n""This could give sunshine and make it very hard to screw the system,"" he told me.

But at least one recognizes the potential of blockchains.\n\nThis summer, Vermont took a couple of step toward smart contracts, agreements that contain technology that automatically tracks versions and authors.

""We are just establishing legal recognition that this is a way of establishing evidence.""\n\nGoodenough, who directs the Center for Legal Innovation at the Vermont School of Law, has been researching the potential of smart contracts and automated securities that can automatically record who has accessed, changed or traded them.', 'AT&T has confirmed it is not intentionally blocking customers from using their bitcoin ports, contrary to some allegations in recent days.

(Barclays has since denied this, saying it\'s simply working on a ""proof of concept."")\n\nI sat down with Barclays Chief Design and Digital Officer Derek White, who oversees bitcoin and blockchain at Barclays, to discuss what else the bank is planning to do with this technology.\n\n""As a heritage organisation we can either embrace disruption or be disrupted,"" White told me at Barclays Techstars Accelerator in Whitechapel, east London. ""We’ve chosen to embrace disruption. We\'re increasingly becoming a technology financial services company, not a bank with a technology division.""\n\nOne of the technologies White is most excited by is the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain is the software that both powers and regulates cryptocurrency bitcoin. Transactions are signed off by the parties involved using the software, then added to the blockchain, a long string of code that records all activity.\n\nOnce other transactions are added on in front of an exchange, the transaction is stuck there forever and can\'t be changed, in the same way you can\'t change a brick once it\'s been built into a wall.\n\nThe blockchain uses open ledger technology, meaning all of these transactions are free for anyone to look at and not siloed in some private data centre in Canary Wharf.\n\nWhite says: ""We fundamentally believe that the world is shifting from closed to open — closed architecture to open architecture, everything moving to the cloud; closed networks to open networks; closed systems to open systems.""\n\nOn the blockchain, anyone can theoretically check to see if someone\'s using stolen bitcoin and this adds a level of transparency to the system.\n\nOn top of that, the blockchain is quicker and cheaper than the systems banks use right now to send and receive money — that\'s why they\'re interested.\n\nBarclays has two bitcoin ""labs"" above old branches in Notting Hill and Old Street that are open to bitcoin and blockchain entrepreneurs, businesses, and coders.\n\nWhite says: ""The blockchain community, a little over a year ago, started saying they needed a place to gather. Some would say they\'re the anarchists. We said, why don’t you come use our space? So we invited them in so we can learn together.\n\n""It’s a new technology, we know a little bit about it but we wanted to learn more from the creators of it. They could see our genuine interest in the technology and they could see we weren’t looking to just sponsor, we were looking to shape.""\n\nAs well as working with startups, the bank is experimenting with the technology internally. White says: ""We looked at how many experiments we wanted to do internally with the blockchain. The first wave led to 22 experiments, we\'ve now got over 45 experiments our businesses want to do.""\n\nSantander is conducting similar experiments. Mariano Belinky, head of Santander\'s investment arm InnoVentures, told Business Insider earlier this year that the bank is experimenting with 25 use cases for the technology.\n\nEnabling charities to take bitcoin is just one expression of Barclays\' tinkering. White says: ""This is everything from identity, to corporate payment solutions, to treasury, to supply chain, to core payments.""\n\nBarclays bankers are also directly mentoring 3 bitcoin startups out of the current cohort of 10 companies on its current Barclays Techstars Accelerator programme, a 15-week scheme meant to help fintech startups grow.\n\nUBS is doing something similar, with Business Insider revealing recently that the bank\'s CIO, Oliver Bussmann, is directly mentoring blockchain startups based in Canary Wharf\'s fintech space Level39.\n\nWhite singled out one of the current Barclays Techstars crop, Everledger, for particular praise. The startup uses blockchain technology to keep a record of diamond ownership in a bid to try and stamp out fraud and theft.\n\nWhite says: ""It starts with diamonds, but what it actually has is application for anything that requires documentation, anything that needs to be insured. You move from diamonds, to watches, to yachts, to art — once it’s embedded in the blockchain, it’s there.""\n\nOn the day I visited, members of the Treasury were also at the Whitechapel site, appropriately meeting in a room called ""Coin"".\n\nWhite says: ""We’re working with HMT to share how we see the blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and bringing to life potential use cases that we are exploring.\n\n""The UK policy makers and regulators are both very much on the front foot of wanting to understand this. They want to understand it to make sure they’re protecting UK citizens are putting the right regulation around it.""\n\nUltimately, White says, Barclays is ""seeking to become the connector in this ecosystem.""', 'It seems that some Bitcoin users have been reporting issues when attempting to connect or receive connections to their bitcoin clients across port 8333. Assuming that Bitcoin clients connect to other bitcoin nodes on TCP port 8333 by default, some of these users have strong suspicions that some ISP providers might have been intentionally blocking communications through and by this specific port.\n\nThe problem is said to appear when the ISP has complete control over the hardware from the user’s house to their router to the Internet. Many well-known providers will deliberately close a number of connection ports to facilitate what they presume to be the optimum level of service.\n\nHowever, the reports points out that while some ISPs may indeed be blocking port 8333, they are not singling that particular port out but several others that might be affecting the so-called optimum level of performance.\n\nIf the user’s ISP does happen to block port 8333, there are a few solutions they can resort to. For starters, users can ask their ISP’s to put the router into “Bridge Mode”, which turns the ISPs hardware into nothing more than a simple connection to the Internet. A second option is to get a business account with the ISP.\n\nThe report concludes that ISPs are probably not blocking intentionally bitcoin, however it’s safer to assume the ISPs are simply protecting their own network by limiting open ports to the ones the vast majority of consumer level people are using. There are options available to users of all levels to work around any perceived limitations ISPs place on connections, and there is a fantastic bitcoin community eager to help in any way they can.\n\nIt can turn out to be a huge problem if the optimum level of service parameters is inevitably starting to block bitcoin port connections.\n\nIf you have the same problem and you are uncertain whether your ISP is blocking Bitcoin, you may choose to conduct an inbound port test. A web search of port testing will give users some free services to pick from. Performing a port scan on port 8333 on their own connection will let the users know if ISP is blocking it or not.\n\nSource & Image', 'Fintech, short for ‘financial technology‘ is the new buzzword online.

The company already has 25,000 users and has yet to even market the business.\n\nThe startup recently launched their mobile app, which “rebundles” traditional finance applications together. CEO Valentin Stalf told Business Insider that he sees many fintech firms split up taking on individual objectives. Namely the “unbundling” of savings, loans and payment processors, which are often found as separate applications or businesses. Stalf wanted his startup to rebundle these separations by plugging them together. With concepts being applied and solved this way, the company hopes to fix the banking sector’s problems like a Rubik’s cube: the name Number 26 actually refers to the solution of the classic game solved by scientists in 2007.\n\n“I think there will be a massive shift in market share. It is not going to happen tomorrow, but I think it is going to happen much faster that most banks expect.” Valentin Stalf, CEO Number 26\n\nSo far, the startup has raised $13.7 million in investments. The company offers services like a digital bank, whereas user accounts are tethered to a debit or credit card. Number 26 offers various applications, which allow you to spend funds at local outlets and restaurants. The sign up process takes roughly four minutes and you have to verify your identity through a video call. The app then takes all of your spending data and offers solutions to your everyday transactions.\n\nAccount funds are held in limbo like a German bank Wirecard, as the business is not licenced with the banking industry of the region. Currently, the company is scaling up its salary accounts initially and will focus its energies towards savings in the future. “The idea is to be the connector for finance startups,” Stalf added.\n\nFinancial technology and distributed ledger initiatives are moving into the finance world at great speed. With startups like Number 26, FinTech Sandbox, and Trade Block spearheading the financial world with solutions the banks should worry.\n\nBusinesses like these have already disrupted the finance sector, creating a split of very different and individual services geared by technology. FinTech services are looking into many puzzle-like solutions to help savvy the customers experience via their applications.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is one of those puzzle solutions, offering extreme technical advancements into the global landscape. Tradeblock with help from Sandbox has created a way for consumers to view trade indexes, mining data and blockchain research, for instance. Customers can register and use the company’s APIs and custom data to help make their own business more successful. With access to visual analytics, insights and trades, they have more advantages by understanding these new technologies.\n\nA survey from Greenwich Associates, a financial research center, says that 47 percent of financial institutions were exploring blockchain technology. Distributed ledger systems could be the swiss army knife of tools to the banking industry’s errors. “OTC derivatives, private stock, repo, and loan markets” are said in the survey to be the best markets affected by this protocol.\n\nNumber 26 says that companies like Atom Bank will be its direct competitor when they launch. With the companies bundled-like services, you can have an account with them, but also use the likes of Lending Club and Transferwise, which typically offer better rates through them than the banks.\n\nThe new formation of fintech and blockchain technology seems to be a new home for consumers as opposed to conventional finance, creating new methods and concepts that are changing the world and adding financial inclusion. This means basically anyone can join in this new economy as it’s inclusive to all.\n\nDistributed ledger technology is showing massive amounts of startups concentrating on reformation of the traditional finance sector. Startups like Ethereum are paving the way, creating smart contracts’ protocol and a complete touring language. The team Augur is producing a prediction market with blockchain tech that will transform trading and decision making. With fintech and blockchains exploding in interest, it’s hard to keep up with the speed of these advancements. Keeping to now default positions of core foundations these businesses limits appear to never end. Using concepts like decentralization, peer-to-peer applications and open source technology the world is in for an amazing experience.', 'Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous Silk Road drug market, will be remembered as one of bitcoin’s most relevant contributors, a man that grew bitcoin’s relevance to extraordinary levels, and became instantly popular following his arrest. Silk Road was a dark net market that ran on the TOR Network. At its peak, Silk Road accounted for 70% of all dark net drug sales. People wondered whether Ulbricht’s arrest was justified; consequently, his prison sentence became controversial as well. In the midst of the controversy it was later discovered that federal agents infiltrated the administration of the Silk Road under fake identities, which led to Ulbricht’s arrest. Additionally, it was uncovered that these agents were responsible of stealing bitcoin while they worked for the site. One particular agent, Shaun Bridges has recently plead guilty to stealing over $800,000 USD worth of bitcoin.\n\nAlso read: Silk Road Shutdown Only Temporarily Stifled Online Drug Sales\n\nFollowing the guilty plead by Carl Force, the hearing for Shaun Bridges was held past Monday, August 31, 2015. Shaun Bridges plead guilty to stealing over $800,000 in bitcoin. Bridges also admitted committing the crimes of money laundering and obstruction of justice. In stealing the bitcoin, Bridges used a simple yet effective strategy. After the arrest of Silk Road administrator Curtis Green, Bridges logged into the Silk Road using Green’s login credentials, proceeded to lock vendors out of their accounts, and looted their accounts into his own bitcoin address.\n\nBridges tried to launder the bitcoins by transferring them into his MtGox account and moving them into a Fidelity account he created under the name “Quantum International Investments LLC.” His actions led Ross Ulbricht to believe that an administrator was stealing from Silk Road. Ulbricht allegedly reacted by hiring a hitman to eliminate this person he thought stole the coins. Bridges’ lawyer Steve Levin said this in regards to Bridges:\n\n“He’s regretted his actions since the beginning, and he’s trying to put this behind him, It’s a very stressful time.”\n\nIronic considering what the prosecutor for the State, Katherine Haun, said in regards to Bridges being a flight risk:\n\n“The defendant had been actively trying to change his name and social security number in the state of Maryland. That’s very concerning.”\n\nAllegedly, Bridges tried to change his last name to coincide with his wife’s last name, and also tried to change his social security. Haun said that Bridges handed over 4 firearms to this date, and that a change of name would enable him to purchase firearms once again. Furthermore, Bridges was forbidden from changing his name or other personal information. He is also being monitored electronically and has had curfews placed on him. Bridges will be sentenced in December of this year.\n\nIt is no secret that many people wanted Ross Ulbricht to have a lighter sentence than what he received. And, to be fair when considering the things he did as the owner of the Silk Road, his sentence does seem quite harsh. We have been put in a situation that creates feelings of distrust in the government’s judicial and executive branches. Law enforcement can no longer be trusted by the general public when they see how agents like Shaun Bridges and Carl Force fold to the temptations of power and money. In this light, the meant to protect and serve have become the ones that cause harm. The government did root out its corrupt agents, though, and justice is being had against Bridges and Force.\n\nFurthermore, there is a discussion to be had regarding the sentencing of both Shaun Bridges and Carl Force. Can we trust that the judicial system will keep true to its promise of impartiality in the court even when a member of the government’s police force faces prosecution? Can we be sure that he would not receive special treatment of any kind? We certainly cannot be sure. There is no way of removing corruption where it iss already present. However, the judicial system has proven to be more reliable than the people’s general consensus of its effectiveness. Ross Ulbricht’s lawyer will appeal the decision made by the court using the information they have on Bridges and Force. We must wonder whether or not there is enough information to dismiss the case against Ulbricht. Although far-fetched, Ulbricht could receive a decrease in his sentencing. However, nothing is certain, and anything could happen in the American judicial system\n\nIs the sentencing against Shaun Bridges and Carl Force fair? Will Ulbricht’s court appeal work in his favor?

CoinWallet’s first test in June aimed to fill blocks with 105 BTC worth of miniscule transactions, but reached just 15% of its 200MB goal before its servers crashed.\n\n""I’m inclined to say there is a good argument that the CoinWallet stress tests would be a breach of section 3 of the CMA 1990,"" Jankelewitz said.\n\nReckless behaviour\n\n""The intention of CoinWallet in conducting the tests may well be to demonstrate the network’s capacity, but they should not be reckless as to the consequences of that test (section 3(3)),"" the lawyer explained.\n\nSome Reddit users claim the tests are ‘authorised’ on the basis that they involve the sending of transactions, which is the primary purpose of the bitcoin network.\n\n""However,"" said Jankelewitz, ""The courts have previously said there is a limit to the amount of ‘authorised acts’ that are acceptable before the acts become unauthorised.""\n\nHe illustrated his point using Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks as an analogy, explaining that these attacks typically involve permitted acts, but the affected service provider does not authorise those acts to be carried out so many times that their service becomes overloaded.\n\nWhen asked what he thinks of accusations that his company is planning to hold a live network – and potentially billions of dollars – hostage, James Wilson, COO at CoinWallet said: ""This is an absurd accusation. And if we were able to hold billions of dollars hostage, then it is pretty good evidence that bitcoin is worthless.""\n\nCoinWallet is planning to carry out the next test at 10:00 (GMT) on Thursday 10th September.\n\nUK law image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It has roots in places like the video game community, which has fawned over Nintendo tees since game time immemorial. Bitcoin Not Bombs is one of the most recognizable, you but others like BitGear and Bitcoin Pride offer a wider variety of Bitcoin clothes.\n\nNow a new site called Good Emoji is trying to gain a foothold. It was founded by Connie Kearney, a Bitcoin professional from Atlanta, Georgia working for Vanbex Group and various Bitcoin publications. It will, of course, accept Bitcoin.\n\nConnie is also hoping to promote Bitcoin, however, and Good Emoji has its own style about it. True to name, the shirts are emblazoned with emojis, a Japanese derivative of the standard emoticon that is now popular worldwide. They conjure images of the cuter, more sociable side of the Internet, and elicit positive, almost New Age-y emotions. “By choosing to cultivate good vibes, we are choosing a fun, more enjoyable existence,” to quote their About Us section.\n\nThey have Bitcoin clothes for men, women and soon children, as well, and a variety of shirts that aren’t explicitly Bitcoin-related. Most of the initial customers are likely to be Bitcoiners, however, and the related designs consist of three emojis put in a row to tell a story. The Bitcoin Pizza Day shirt, for example, shows the Bitcoin symbol, a pizza and a calendar (which is sadly not turned to the day of celebration).\n\nSince Good Emoji is just getting off the ground, they’ve launched a giveaway on Twitter. It is perhaps one of the simplest giveaways out there, requiring you only to follow their Twitter handle. Each person that does so gets about 10 American cents worth of Bitcoin, no follow-up Tweets required.\n\nThese “tips” are issued via ChangeTip, a well-known service allowing people to send and receive Bitcoin via their social media handles as well as custom “tip.me” wallet names. It is currently free to use, and designed to make Bitcoin easier for mainstream users to understand. Good Emoji has a similar feel, and hopes to establish itself with a similar audience.', 'One of the most prominent benefits of using Bitcoin is being able to send money across the world without any hassle, from as little as one cent to as much as millions. Most traditional financial services are limited when it comes to sending micropayments or large payments with huge fees attached to them, but Bitcoin is very different.\n\nThe internet has allowed all of us to be connected in real time. However, (look at the image on the right) before Bitcoin helping this ‘Bitcoin believer’ wouldn’t be feasible or convenient. So how connected were we in reality before cryptocurrency?\n\nMost of the world’s population lives with less than $2.5 per day. These people are truly affected by the way, the remittance market operates, as it’s impossible for them to send or receive small payments. This is a real barrier in the developing world, where even a single dollar can make a big difference.\n\nAlso, take the example of the advantages of micropayments for non-profit and charitable causes. Being able to send a dollar or less than a dollar to someone allows for more people to contribute, helping to eliminate poverty and diseases in the distant corners of the world.\n\n[tweet_box design=”box_02?]Micropayments will empower every single one of us to make a change, no matter how little we have.[/tweet_box]\n\nThe current problem with micropayments\n\nThe biggest problem associated with sending micropayments is the fee that is deducted by the intermediaries, but that problem can be minimized now thanks to Bitcoin. However, even cryptocurrency in its current form does not completely allow for micropayments to be sent on regular intervals. The problem is that most of the companies that allow for microtransactions to be made do not post them on the blockchain for public access. They use internal managing systems to keep track of these transactions.\n\nThe blockchain being the cornerstone of Bitcoin, users need to be able to rely on its security and transparency. The major reasons companies cite for not using the blockchain is its limited size and the fact that micro transactions bloat the system. They also claim that fees are higher for micropayments and the standard block confirmation time can make micro transactions very slow.\n\nThe possible solution\n\nOne of the possible solutions was released in the form of an API by BlockCypher, the API allows for micro transactions to take place on the blockchain. They have tackled the problem by using an adaptive method to calculate fees.\n\nThey add a suitable fee to each transaction so that it is feasible for the miners to confirm the transaction instead of delaying it.\n\nThey have also devised a system that they like to call ‘confidence factor’, which is able to predict with up to 99.9 percent accuracy which micro transactions will be confirmed, helping them to calculate and pay the miners’ fees. This in result allows for people to receive the exact amount that is sent.\n\nThe transactions can be viewed and monitored using any block explorer.\n\nUses of micropayments\n\nMicropayments are huge when it comes to online businesses, mainly the ones with a large amount of traffic like news sites and blogs. The monetization of such traffic becomes easier with micropayments.\n\nThere was even an experiment done by the Chicago Sun-Times in collaboration with BitWall to see if people would pay micro amounts in BTC to view content on the site. The experiment showed that people are willing to pay for access to content using cryptocurrency. This shows that digital money-powered content monetization has a huge potential.\n\nThe other great use for micropayments is to pay for streaming websites that can charge a small amount to viewers for streaming content, thus helping artists monetize their music, for instance. In fact, Shopify calculates royalty payments for artists by paying a fraction of a cent per stream.\n\nThe reason for the decline of the music industry is not just because people don’t want to pay for music, but because there aren’t many affordable and efficient ways to pay for it. People want to pay what they think the content is worth, even if that is one cent per song. A crypto-approach to this problem would allow upcoming artists and musicians to monetize their content.\n\nAnother industry that can make good use of micropayments is online advertisement. Before Bitcoin it wasn’t feasible to charge per impression – the minimum charge was usually for 1000 impressions on most advertising sites – and that is why this huge industry needs to take a step forward using cryptocurrency.\n\nA lot of new incentive-based models can now be introduced online where people can pay to play games, read content, give surveys and what not.\n\nThe possible prospects for content creators are limitless. With a growing number of internet users, each user counts and being able to charge even a fraction of a cent per user/action is going to be profitable in the long run.\n\nJust recently, a company named Zapchain introduced a content monetization model where users can earn Bitcoin by creating content. The service also allows people to tip each other based on questions asked or answers given within the community.\n\nEven Adam Draper, CEO of Boost.vc, agrees. “Microtransactions might be a new way for web content creators to make money. It could be a game changer,” he said.\n\nMicropayments also have the capacity to put an end to many of the problems the internet currently faces, like spamming. In the future, some of the services that are free – and constantly attacked by spam, like emails – could be replaced by making use of micropayments.\n\nPaying a fraction of a cent for an email wouldn’t bother most people, but for the spammers it would totally be a deal breaker.\n\nMicropayments definitely have a huge role to play in the future, but how things will change because of this transition is not clear. In any case, in order for micropayments to prevail, adoption of cryptocurrencies needs to increase and that is only going to happen when people understand the possible applications and prospect that this technology offers.', ""Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralised peer-to-peer payment protocol and one that would fall outside the control of both governments and banks.\n\nThis, however, has not prevented central banks from voicing their opinion on the digital currency and its potential regulation.\n\nAlthough bitcoin regulation continues to be a contentious subject, some central banks have said it is necessary. Others have assessed the potential costs of regulation and realised that this would not outweigh the benefits.\n\nAdditionally, institutions have explored both the risks and benefits associated with the use of bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nWho's said what and when?

One cybersecurity firm thinks it might have the answer.\n\nIn a 1st September blog post from network security firm CloudMark, software engineer and research analyst Toshiro Nishimura suggested that as much as $6,400 may have been extracted from those seeking to buy the silence of the blackmailer.\n\nCoinDesk reported last month that customers Ashley Madison, a website that advertised itself as a platform for infidelity, were receiving blackmail threats by email that contained personal information derived from the cache of released information.\n\nNishimura said the team tracked bitcoin payments around the time the blackmail threats emerged using blockchain analysis. The process looked for payments with bitcoin amounts consistent with the demands they reviewed – for 1.05 BTC – and showed little transaction history prior to the period.\n\nNishimura wrote of the findings:\n\n""We found 67 suspicious transactions totaling 70.35 BTC or approximately $15,814 USD within the extortion time frame of approximately four days paying 1.05 BTC to addresses, with no previous activity, and with two or fewer transaction outputs.... (We conservatively restricted ourselves to ordinary transactions with two or less outputs, thus excluding those which were less likely to be simple one-to-one payments.)”\n\nNishimura – who tempered his post by saying that the results are not as yet conclusive – went on to say that those conducting the blackmail attempts stand to benefit given the free cost of exploitable information and the cheap resources – an email and a bitcoin address – required.\n\nHe also speculated that, in the future, blackmailers may seek to further obfuscate their efforts in order to avoid identification, which he suggested could be achieved by tracing the addresses used in the blackmail emails.\n\n“Since this search would not have been possible without the consistent extortion amount, we suspect that future attempts at Bitcoin-based blackmail will randomize the amount they demand,” he wrote.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The cryptocurrency is under a strong pressure, but the bulls are putting up a remarkable fight to defend a crucial support level, which we will be discussing very soon. But for how long they are able to do so in an adverse environment remains to be seen. Bitcoin is currently trading at $228.90.\n\nImage: https://www.tradingview.com/x/J5VKeV1W/\n\nToday, we will be discussing the technical considerations of the weekly BTC-USD price chart.\n\nBitcoin Chart Structure – If we take a look at the weekly chart above for the period spanning year-to-date, we find that the trendline connecting the closing lows is actually providing great support to Bitcoin for the past three weeks. No matter what the daily fluctuations have been, Bitcoin has been flat on a weekly closing basis for two weeks (three if it settles this week at current levels).\n\nMoving Averages – The 9-week SMA of $263.2756 can be seen closing in on the 30-week SMA of $250.3773. If the short-term average closes below the long-term average, expect a serious decline in the market cap.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence – While the price has managed to sustain itself, the Histogram has skid into the negative region following the bearish crossover of MACD and Signal Line.\n\nMomentum – Another indicator with bearish connotations is the Momentum indicator with a value of -19.7200.\n\nMoney Flow Index – The MFI does not provide much help with its value of 48.1858.\n\nRelative Strength Index – The RSI is flat as the price for the past three weeks. It is now at 41.5000.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the light of the technical indications and the flat weekly price action, I would suggest the market participants to use any bounce or rally – yes, I am not ruling that out – to exit Bitcoin.\n\nIf Bitcoin closes this week below $220, we will witness an extended decline in Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Bruce Pon, the company’s CEO, has invested in numerous fintech startups and worked for several consulting firms; Trent McConaghy Ph.D, the company’s CTO and lead machine learning architect, previously founded several AI startups; and Maria McConaghy Ph.D, who has worked for several museums, including as a curatorial assistant for the Louvre in Paris, France.\n\n“We believe simplifying and streamlining the user interface for copyright management will be the driver behind an unprecedented explosion of creativity on the Internet. The more artists feel that they can safely show, sell and license their work without fear of having their work taken, the more they will produce. And we’ll all be a little better off because of it,” wrote Ascribe Director of Marketing Mike Klein.\n\nTo showcase the Berlin tech startup’s digital copyright and verification system, limited edition pictures that combine everyday settings with abstract design are being given away.\n\nThose who receive the digital artwork will be able to prove that the copy is an original, by comparing a cryptographic hash of the picture with a correspondent one on the Bitcoin blockchain. If they match, people can be assured it is one of the limited edition proofs.\n\n""Essentially, the process mirrors the way in which the art world has traditionally established value through ‘originality’, which up until now has been problematic in the digital space,” wrote Bill Murray, the editor of The Space.\n\n- Bill Murray\n\nAscribe Chief Policy Officer Greg McMullen explained that when an artist registers a piece of art on the platform, they can set a number of editions available to the world, “similar to the way a printmaker will decide on a number of prints.”\n\n- Greg McMullen\n\nThe service is just one part of a platform that Ascribe is building for digital artwork and the management of copyrights, but it is one of the first real world tests for the concept. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said one of the most remarkable achievements of Bitcoin was its ability to make something digital scarce. Now Ascribe is taking that from the world of currencies and payments to art, so that all digital forms can be rare and, the company hopes, more valuable.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Youtube and Facebook, Ascribe wants to give digital artists the ability to legally license their work, trade and transfer it, and find violators inappropriately using their work.\n\nThe company raised a $2 million seed round earlier this year, and is now further developing its system, as well as the machine learning technology the firm will use to search the web for any violations in using Ascribe verified artwork. The firm is also approaching more artists about the platform, and beginning to look into offering different copyright licenses alongside the current creative commons.\n\n“I believe ascribe opens a huge door for the art world. More importantly, Ascribe allows artists who are working in the digital realm to stay within it. Digital works of art now have the ability to stay true to their original form as opposed to steering away from it for the sake of distribution,” said Jackson Hallberg, the artist whose artwork is being given away, in an interview with Ascribe.\n\n- Jackson Hallberg\n\nAscribe is not the first company to explore the use of Bitcoin’s decentralized ledger for authentication purposes. Proof of Existence and Blocksign, among others, have allowed people to “hash” their documents into the blockchain, allowing it to be verified later on. Although these projects were focused on legal papers, there are other companies’ exploring the process.\n\nEverLedger is exploring a sightly different business model and has began to record thousands of diamonds and their unique characteristics into the blockchain, in attempt to prevent fraud. Though a different mission than Ascribe’s, EverLedger is one of the forerunners in proving the case for verifying items that aren’t bitcoins on the currency\'s decentralized ledger.\n\nMonograph, which uses Namecoin’s blockchain, and Verisart both launched earlier this year. Alongside Ascribe they are some of the first companies to form services around blockchain-based solutions for art verification.\n\nBoth Ascribe and Verisart are attempting to differentiate themselves from the competition, and previous developers who have explored the concept, by attempting to create a complete copyright solution for digital artists, not just a blockchain record keeping service.\n\n- McMullen\n\nAscribe allows digital artists to sell, loan, and transfer their work. Eventually users will be able to give partial ownership to another person, a 50-50 split for example. The startup also has the grand goal of simplifying global copyrights, which currently can be quite tricky, since the blockchain is a “borderless database.”', ""Have you ever thought to yourself, “I really wish I could ship a large inflatable middle finger to my best friend”? Well, now you can…and you can do so for Bitcoin!\n\n“The idea came from a friend,” Kurt Zoe, co-founder of Ship The Finger tells me. “After hearing of the Ship Your Enemies glitter service, he wanted to send something different.” So the idea for Ship The Finger was born.\n\n“He told me that he wanted to send the finger to his dad as a joke after a football game.

I thought I had stumbled onto some luck when I found the Buttcoin Foundation website, which clearly mocks the Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit that claims to represent Bitcoin to regulators.\n\nBarry Oners, the man who responded to me from the website’s contact form, agreed to an interview. He then goatsed me. It was shocking and disturbing. I made this post on r/Buttcoin, where after the moderators on Reddit stickied it to the top of the subreddit.

The purpose of Buttcoin is multifaceted. For GreatGuy_GG, the growing community of Bitcoin shills offer a dose of sanity to Bitcoin fanatics.\n\n“Some also see us as a bitcoin fanatic rehab center and that’s just great,” he wrote.

It looks like I was not discreet enough as Manuela turned her body towards me as I was nearing the end. I had planned to contain my ejaculation with my other hand, but seeing her looking at me was such as surprise that I ended up ejaculating all over my chest and also over hers. It was so powerful a feeling that I could not let it go and gave it a few more strikes while looking at her stupidly.\n\nNobody knows if the story is true.\n\nThere are other Buttcoin associated Reddit sites, such as /r/NotAcceptingBitcoin, /r/SorryForYourLoss, /r/ActualMoney, /r/EnoughLibertarianSpam, as well as newer ones like /r/ButtcoinXT. Yet another, r/SecretButtcoin, won’t let you in without a code they say.\n\nButtcoiner u/ghostofsatoshi thinks that digital currency is feasible, even if it’s not Bitcoin. “If we can ever make one that is fast, cheap, secure, and decentralized I think it would be great. Bitcoin, however, only meets one of those requirements, and it’s getting less decentralized as time goes on.” Reddit user justcool393 also shared his thoughts with me on the viability of the technology.\n\n“It could work, but a lot of money is already digital, even through services like PayPal and more, and generally have better security than most other Bitcoin services, as evidenced by the repeated hacks and thefts,” justcool393 told me. The user also opined on the block size limit debate.\n\n“I think there needs to be testing and research done before people make drastic changes willy-nilly. There is a problem with that, because everyone seems so reluctant to give any different opinion a thought,” the user wrote. Reddit user Shatari is no Bitcoin sympathizer.\n\n“The block chain is interesting (I imagine it will be far more useful on smaller scale and more centralized platforms), but Bitcoin has too many crazies on board and is never going to be able to scale to meet global needs,” he wrote. Shatari believes digital currency is redundant.\n\n“It’s completely unneeded, since most cash transactions are already done online, except that they’re regulated, insured, faster, more reliable, and don’t pretend to be anonymous (since I don’t buy illegal things I’m not too worried about pretending that I’m untraceable),” he wrote. Lulz at the Bitcoin community were expressed by many Buttcoiners.\n\n“I followed bitcoin news for a while, because I’m a tech geek and it was interesting. But after awhile the content on /r/Bitcoin just seemed… Off,” king_of_the_shill wrote. “Then I discovered this subreddit and realized I wasn’t the only one thinking the Bitcoin community was getting crazy.” This after king_of_the_shill devoted time to the project.\n\n“I tinkered with bitcoin while it was still being explored, but now that’s over,” he added. “Time to watch the death spiral. All in all, I’m here for the lulz.” Reddit user Unistrut detailed his journey into – and out of – Bitcoin:\n\nI grew up with William Gibson and Neil Stephenson, I read “The Great Simoleon Caper” when it was published. When I read that someone was creating an actual version of it I was very interested. Then it all went sort of mental. The main exchange was a repurposed Magic: The Gathering trading site, scams were multiplying daily, and the more you read about actually trying to use the damn stuff the worse bitcoin seemed to get.\n\nUnistrut is no longer sympathetic to the Bitcoin cause, believing “It’s poorly implemented and infested with scammers, crooks and fools.” He noted life on the Buttcoin mining farm has been pretty good lately.\n\n“It was slow for a bit, but the blocksize censorship craziness and the recent flash crash has given us a pretty good supply of material,” Unistrut wrote. The user also opined on the block size debate.\n\n“2.7 transactions per second is a joke. So is 24,” the user wrote. “8MB blocks are still pathetically small compared to the volume of transactions Bitcoin will need to handle in the future – Bitcoin doesn’t scale, not that millions of people are dying to use an irreversible volatile currency anyway.”\n\nWhile Buttcoiners maintain their staunch individualism, there are many common themes amongst them. For one, many of them deny the existence of the Buttcoin Foundation.\n\n“This guy is an idiot,” writes a Buttcoiner. “He really thinks we’re some kind of centralized organization.” More echo this sentiment.\n\n“We don’t have a leader — we’re a decentralized network of shills,” says another.\n\nThey seem to also agree on one another thing: “You are a shit journalist…Just really total shit.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
09/05/2015,"['Recently, Simon Dixon, entrepreneur, former investment banker and author of the book Bank to the Future, explained in an interview with Epicenter Bitcoin that our financial problems are derived from money, “simply because money is debt.”\n\nSince the birth of Bitcoin in 2009, many economists have talked about the digital currency, and its potential to disrupt the financial sector and solve most of the financial problems we have today. Dixon explained the concept behind money and banks, and more importantly, what money actually is. He said:\n\n“Positive balance in a bank account simply is somebody else’s debt, which is created into existence by the banks. 97% of the money in the economy is created this way, which means the only way to drive sustainability of an economy is to have more debt.”\n\nIn order to have a sustainable and debt free economy Dixon explains, is to use a decentralized currency like bitcoin.\n\nBank to the Future\n\nDixon’s book, Bank to the Future states three main problems of today’s financial problems –\n\nDeposits made with banks are controlled by the banks; Banks can spend the deposits at their will. Banks spend the deposits on things which help their shareholders, which aren’t good for the economy; Banks are the creators of money; economics assumes that bank is an intermediary between lenders and buyers.\n\n“The reason that we have financial problems today is because we are trapped in a multi-decade Ponzi scheme, where in in order to have an economy, we have to have more debt,” he continued. “The reason for that is simply because money is debt. In order to have a growing and stimulating economy, you have to have governments take on more debt, you have to have individuals take on more debt, you have to have corporations take on more debt.”\n\n‘Hate Bitcoin, Love the Blockchain’\n\nMajor banks around the world, including BBVA, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi bank, UBS, etc. have announced their plans to experiment with the blockchain technology and to create their own currencies to facilitate transaction settlements quickly, with low costs.\n\nHowever, Dixon explains, that the reason banks love the blockchain and hate bitcoin is because the banks have thought bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme, and criticized it for such a long time. In other words, if the banks came out today and said that they support bitcoin, they would be admitting that they were wrong about the digital currency.\n\n“I thought the bitcoin was some kind of a crazy Ponzi scheme, I didn’t get involved and I don’t want to lose face. Therefore, if I say I love the blockchain, then I can be involved, is the translation of “I love the blockchain, I hate bitcoin,” said Dixon.', 'Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.\n\nIf there was remaining doubt that digital currency applications of bitcoin have taken a backseat to distributed ledger use cases, the October edition of Bloomberg Markets illustrated how fast this narrative is gaining traction.\n\n""It\'s all about the blockchain,"" read the cover of the monthly magazine, currently on sale, the slogan referring to bitcoin\'s underlying distributed ledger and the growing contingent of financial executives who believe the technology will dramatically reshape how they do business.\n\nPersonifying this transition was the magazine\'s cover star, 46-year-old Blythe Masters, the CEO of blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings (DA) and a 27-year JP Morgan veteran best known as one of the early proponents of the credit-default swap.\n\nThe interview, Masters\' first lengthy sit down as DA CEO, further shed new light on how big banks are seeking to leverage the technology, a narrative that also surfaced in the week\'s other dominant stories.\n\nMaster of the blockchain\n\nInarguably the most high-profile veteran of Wall Street to go full time on a blockchain project, Masters is rumored to be raising venture funding on a valuation of as much as $1bn, a goal that could be expedited given her propensity to attract media attention.\n\nWhile much about DA still remains under wraps, the sweeping 3,000-word article provided evidence of the attention Masters\' star power has so far brought to the industry.\n\nOverall, the article largely provided background on the larger narrative of Wall Street\'s interest in bitcoin, diverging to spend time on Masters\' professional history and bitcoin\'s origin. Surprisingly few new details were provided about Masters\' career and new company.\n\nDA did reveal it intends to focus on three markets, US treasury repos, syndicated loans and equity shares in private companies, though this is notably terrain that is already being sought after by firms including Overstock\'s tØ.com and Symbiont.\n\nRather than delve into the mechanics of DA and its market strategy, however, authors Edward Robinson and Matthew Leising spent more time on building up the narrative around the technology, writing:\n\n""In a matter of months, this word, blockchain, has gone viral on trading floors and in the executive suites of banks and brokerages on both sides of the Atlantic. You can’t attend a finance conference these days without hearing it mentioned on a panel or at a reception or even in the loo.""\n\nThe piece\'s most important finding shed light on the fact that, while banks have been touting an interest in private blockchains, Masters herself believes there will be value in connecting these databases to open public ledgers such as bitcoin.\n\nRobinson and Leising suggested DA is in fact working on both private decentralized ledger projects, as well as offerings that would ""connect its customers to the existing bitcoin system"".\n\nElsewhere, Bloomberg commentator Matt Levine penned an editorial calling foul on what he suggested is the trumped up controversy around distributed database systems, asking:\n\n""But do you care about exactly how the computers determine and record the market participants\' agreement on who sold what to whom?""\n\nStill, Masters showed she could make news simply by holding an interview, as her comments were widely covered by outlets including MarketWatch and American Banker.\n\nBig banks reveal more\n\nOn the subject of big banks, both UBS and Barclays made the news this week for releasing new information about their ongoing experimentations with digital currency and blockchain tech.\n\nOf the two, Barclays was the biggest winner for its announcement that it would work with an unnamed bitcoin firm, later revealed by The Wall Street Journal to be wallet provider Safello, to help charities accept bitcoin as part of a program to be announced later this year.\n\nConfusion arose, however, when Ars Technica published an article that perhaps took too much creative license with the original details revealed by The Sunday Times in its reporting.\n\nArs Technica suggested that Barclays would go so far as to accept bitcoin into its bank accounts, though it later corrected the overstatement. The development would have been surprising given that many major banks are still uncertain about their ability to work with the technology in anything other than an experimental environment.\n\nStill, the notion that Barclays had somehow become the ""first"" bank to accept or support bitcoin proliferated in headlines, even despite the ample work being done by other major financial institutions to understand the technology.\n\nAs such, Barclays received perhaps exaggerated headlines in outlets including Quartz and The Daily Mail, among others, that perhaps strengthened this misconception.\n\nThe news reverberated around the world as well with news of Barclays\' favorable stance on the technology even reaching Russian-language news outlets.\n\nBitPay\'s free publicity\n\nOne of the more odd news pieces this week came from tech blog TechCrunch, which chose to highlight the technology host Alex Wilhelm called ""that thing that you\'ve heard of and that you claim to understand but you do not"".\n\nWhile meant to be tongue-in-cheek, the line was perhaps more reflective of the video and its approach to highlighting industry conversation than intended.\n\nThough it covered some pertinent current issues (such as the ongoing debate around how the network should address the scalability of its core software), the six-minute talk was largely focused on adoption of bitcoin as a consumer payment method and the effect of media interest on price, two trends that have been fading in relevance in industry conversation.\n\nMuch of the narrative was driven by featured guest Sonny Singh, CCO of the merchant bitcoin payments startup BitPay, a firm that has raised $32.5m in public funding, but has recently shown signs its business is suffering growing pains, cutting short a large public contract and laying off staff members.\n\nSingh also positioned himself and his company against the prevailing news narratives, noting that in his position he ""never talks about the word blockchain"".\n\n""A payment manager of a big company would have no idea of what that means,"" he said.\n\nThis may be unsurprising given that merchants are still primarily interested in the technology for its use as a low-cost digital cash, though it\'s notable that Singh suggested his firm was seeing continued interest from merchants.\n\n""You went from redheaded step child to belle of the ball,"" Wilhelm quipped in response to Singh\'s statements that merchants were now ""calling BitPay"" to accept bitcoin.\n\nThe statements, though potentially accurate, run counter to evidence collected by CoinDesk in its recent Q2 State of Bitcoin report, which found that growth in overall merchant adoption is now slowing.\n\nAlso unmentioned were continued reports that the company has been mired by high-profile developer exits and an inability to monetize given that it offers its merchant processing services at no cost.\n\nImages via Shutterstock; Bloomberg; TechCrunch\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

About 43 percent of Kenya’s GDP flows through the service and close to 70% of Kenya’s adult population has an account for the service.\n\nSafaricom’s website reads:\n\n“The new M-PESA platform dubbed G2 (for M-PESA 2nd generation platform) offers versatile integration capabilities that our development partners can take advantage of, to create excellent M-PESA journeys across the different industries they serve.”\n\nApart from enabling Kenyans send and receive money fast through simple feature phones, the service also makes it possible for its users to pay bills and shop. M-pesa has also partnered with banks to offer its customers loans.\n\nIn April 2015, Safaricom moved M-Pesa’s servers to Kenya, which it declared will help improve services to customers.\n\nWhile announcing the API launch in Nairobi Kenya, Betty Mwangi, Safaricom’s director of financial services explained that this step has been made possible by the company’s decision to transfer its servers from Germany to be hosted locally.\n\nBetty Mwangi:\n\n“One of the advantages of the new M-PESA platform is the fact that it is easier to integrate with other financial platforms to offer more or improved services to our customers […]. We do, however, accept that innovation cannot come from us alone - it takes partnerships to come up with some of the best possible solutions that will help transform lives.”\n\nM-pesa, despite its enormous market size, has in the recent months experienced concerted efforts from competitors such as Airtel Money and Orange Money to cut its market slice. The move to open the service to third party developers could give it an advantage of harnessing innovations from a wider pool.', 'Sin embargo, se tiene la sospecha de que a pesar de estas razones, las compras de Bitcoin en el mercado chino sí han ayudado a mantener el precio de la criptomoneda. No es secreto para las personas que operan con bitcoin que agosto fue un mes con muchas dificultades para la moneda digital. Sucedió la caída de 14% que recibió el nombre de “flash crash” o choque relámpago, además de venir arrastrando desde julio la problemática de la bifurcación de la blockchain.', 'The NYSE has had investors baffled and confused during these past few weeks of wild volatility with its use of Rule 48.\n\nThe little-known rule, which was passed in 2007, permits specialists or “market makers,” as they prefer to call themselves today, to open a stock very quickly during periods of “extreme market volatility” without even indicating a price.\n\nThis ruling cost many investors lots of money, as they unknowingly sold their stock into the hands of the Wolves of Wall Street at unnecessarily low prices. But it did let the market open earlier (and more quickly, presumably), but for the benefit of whom?\n\nThe primary problem with Rule 48 is that it removes the indication of a stock’s opening price range in the most volatile of times for all investors except the specialists/market makers.\n\nA need for some adult supervision is evident when Johnson & Johnson, among the bluest of blue-chip stocks, closes at $95.56 on the Friday prior to the Monday 1,000-point crash.\n\nDuring the chaotic opening minutes under Rule 48 even a company like Johnson & Johnson got unreasonably knocked down to a low of 81.79 per share in the opening minutes and yet went on to close more than $10 higher, at more than $92.82.\n\nThe problem is, Rule 48, besides permitting the specialist to open a stock without indicating its price first, also permits the specialists to open stocks without a floor official or floor operations approval.\n\nIt’s a bit like letting the wolves decide what time to let the hens out of the house that they are charged with guarding.\n\nI am sure the profit-and-loss statements of specialist firms on the NYSE looked a heck of a lot better than those of the rest of the market participants at the end of Monday.\n\nIn a Sept. 2 interview, SEC commissioner Dan Gallagher said, “We’re going to have tons of data to look at after last week. Data about the [exchange-traded funds], data about the performance of Rule 48.”\n\nHe went on to say, “Rule 48 went into place in 2007 at a time when you were shifting from specialists into electronic trading here on the floor. It made sense in 2007. Does it still make sense today? We’ll have to look at that.”\n\nIt’s good the adults in Washington are looking into this. Just follow the money — the data will tell the story.', 'Labor Day is always a bittersweet holiday, marking the impending end of summer, the start of another school year and, often, the last chance to host a blowout barbecue for friends. And for craft beer drinkers, it’s also the warning sign that your favorite summer seasonal is about to go away for a while.\n\nWith pumpkin beers already starting to sneak onto shelves and spicy winter ales just around the corner, Labor Day is the perfect opportunity to take a final sip of summer. But while it’s still among the top five “beer holidays” of the year, it may not rank as high as you may imagine.\n\nIn 2014, Labor Day beer sales came in just shy of $709 million – notably better than Cinco de Mayo and St. Patrick’s Day – but falling behind the 4th of July, Memorial Day and Christmas.\n\nThis is also one of the best weekends of the year to hit a craft beer festival. There are at least a dozen festivals planned in the U.S. (and another dozen happening in Europe – 10 of which are in England).\n\nAmong the notable domestic events are the Lexington Fest of Ales in Lexington, KY, with over 200 beers from 60 breweries; the Mass Brewers Guild Fest, which will have over 100 beers on tap in Boston; and Bend, Oregon will host the Little Woody Barrel Aged Beer, Cider & Whiskey Fest, which offers more than the usual suspects of a typical beer festival.\n\nAll of this, of course, is an industry wind up for the Great American Beer Festival, which takes place Sept. 24-26 in Denver. It’s the biggest event of the year for the beer world – and can be the launching pad for the next great beer. (I’ll be in attendance this year, so if you know of a can’t miss offering to try or event to attend, let me know in the comments or via Twitter.)\n\nIf you’re more the stay at home type for Labor Day, though, here are a few seasonals that might have missed your radar this summer. Grab ’em while you’ve got the chance.\n\nNoDa Nodajito – Mint generally isn’t a taste you associate with beer, but this Belgian Wit blends it in well, along with a good dose of lime. Inspired, as you might guess, by the mojito, it has a unique taste that straddles the line between beer and the popular cocktail. The mint and citrus won’t be for everyone – and it’s not a beer I’d crave in the winter – but on a hot day, it goes down easily. (ABV: 4.8%)\n\nSmog City Unity – I’m not going to lie. It’s gonna be pretty hard to find this Los Angeles-brewed beer, which was released during LA Beer Week. But if you do managed to track some down, you’ll be rewarded with a nice tart farmhouse that blends fruity aspects with a slight bitterness. It’s a crisp beer that has a fair level of acidity, but boasts a very dry finish. (ABV: 5.3%)\n\nBrooklyn Summer Ale – Made by Brooklyn Brewer, this English Pale Ale is a malty, light beer that will gladly keep you company as you work the grill, without filling you up. It’s sessionable – and while the malt is the predominant flavor, the hop mix adds a touch of floral, without any hop bitterness. (ABV: 5%)\n\nCisco Brewers Summer of Lager – A medium-bodied pilsner, this seasonal is strong on the malt, but has a distinctive hoppy bitterness, making it stand out from the lighter summer ales that often dominate the summer selection. There’s a lemon taste that’s mixed with an extremely dry finish. (ABV: 5.5%)\n\nGolden Road Heal the Bay IPA – This summer-only IPA (which benefits a Santa Monica nonprofit of the same name) is dank and full of citrus and pine. You’ll get lots of tropical notes that are supported by a solid malt backbone, but the hops are the star of the show here. It’s a bit more carbonated than you might expect from an IPA, but that works in the beer’s favor, as curious as that might sound. (ABV: 6.8%)\n\nFounders Rübæus – Like raspberries? You’d better if you’re going to crack open a Rübæus. It’s technically an ale, but it’s one where fruit is added at every stage of the brewing process, resulting in an intense flavor that is neither overly sweet nor overly tart. This isn’t a framboise, by any means. It’s closer in style to a sour – though it’s not really that either. While this isn’t a beer you’d want to drink throughout the day, it’s the perfect way to end a day with friends – and say goodbye to summer. (ABV: 5.7%)', 'Establishment Survey +173K Jobs, Private Jobs +140,000; U.S. Unemployment Rate 5.1%\n\nThe establishment survey came in a weaker than expected 173,000 job. The Bloomberg Consensus estimate was 223,000 jobs.\n\nHowever, the preceding two months were revised up by 44,000 and wages were strong. Bloomberg provides a nice summation of the strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe headline may not look it but there\'s plenty of strength in the August employment report. Nonfarm payrolls rose only 173,000 which is at the low-end estimate, but the two prior months are now revised up a total of 44,000. The unemployment rate fell 2 tenths to 5.1 percent which is below the low end estimate and the lowest of the recovery, since April 2008. And wages are strong, with average hourly earnings up 0.3 percent for a 2.2 percent year-on-year rate that\'s 1 tenth higher than July. Debate will definitely be lively at the September 17 FOMC!\n\nPrivate payroll growth proved very weak, at only 140,000. Government added 33,000 jobs vs July\'s 21,000. Manufacturing, held back by weak exports and trouble in energy equipment, shed a steep 17,000 jobs followed by a 9,000 loss for mining which is getting hit by low commodity prices. A plus is a 33,000 rise in professional & business services and a respectable 11,000 rise in the temporary help subcomponent. This subcomponent is considered a leading indicator for long-term labor demand. Retail rose 11,000 with vehicle dealers, who have been very busy, adding 2,000 jobs following July\'s gain of 11,000.\n\nSeasonality, especially the timing of the beginning of the school year, always plays an outsized role in August employment data which are often revised higher. Policy makers are certain to take this into consideration at this month\'s FOMC. There\'s something for everybody in this report which won\'t likely settle expectations whether the Fed lifts off or not this month.\n\nRevisions\n\nThe employment change for June revised up from +231,000 to +245,000, and the change for July revised up from +215,000 to +245,000. Incorporating revisions, employment has increased by an average 221,000 per month over the past 3 months.\n\nWages\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private, nonfarm payrolls rose by 8 cents in August, following a 6-cent gain in July. Hourly earnings are up 2.2 percent over the year. In August, average weekly hours of all employees edged up 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours.\n\nBLS Jobs Statistics at a Glance\n\nNonfarm Payroll: +173,000 - Establishment Survey\n\nEmployment: +196,000 - Household Survey\n\nUnemployment: -33,000 - Household Survey\n\nInvoluntary Part-Time Work: +158,000 - Household Survey\n\nVoluntary Part-Time Work: -131,000 - Household Survey\n\nBaseline Unemployment Rate: -0.2 to 5.1% - Household Survey\n\nU-6 unemployment: -0.1 to 10.3% - Household Survey\n\nCivilian Non-institutional Population: +220,000\n\nCivilian Labor Force: -41,000 - Household Survey\n\nNot in Labor Force: +261,000 - Household Survey\n\nParticipation Rate: +0.0 to 62.6 - Household Survey\n\nAugust 2015 Employment Report\n\nPlease consider the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Employment Report.\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 173,000 in August, and the unemployment rate edged down to 5.1 percent. Job gains occurred in health care and social assistance and in financial activities. Manufacturing and mining lost jobs.\n\nUnemployment Rate - Seasonally Adjusted\n\nNonfarm Employment\n\nNonfarm Employment Change from Previous Month by Job Type\n\nHours and Wages\n\nAverage weekly hours of all private employees rose by 0.1 hours to 34.6 hours (from a downward revision of 34.5 hours last month) . Average weekly hours of all private service-providing employees was flat at 33.4 hours.\n\nAverage hourly earnings of production and non-supervisory private workers rose $0.05 at $21.07. Average hourly earnings of production and non-supervisory private service-providing employees rose $0.06 at $20.88.\n\nFor discussion of income distribution, please see What\'s ""Really"" Behind Gross Inequalities In Income Distribution?\n\nBirth Death Model\n\nStarting January 2014, I dropped the Birth/Death Model charts from this report. For those who follow the numbers, I retain this caution: Do not subtract the reported Birth-Death number from the reported headline number. That approach is statistically invalid. Should anything interesting arise in the Birth/Death numbers, I will add the charts back.\n\nTable 15 BLS Alternate Measures of Unemployment\n\nTable A-15 is where one can find a better approximation of what the unemployment rate really is.\n\nNotice I said ""better"" approximation not to be confused with ""good"" approximation.\n\nThe official unemployment rate is 5.1%. However, if you start counting all the people who want a job but gave up, all the people with part-time jobs that want a full-time job, all the people who dropped off the unemployment rolls because their unemployment benefits ran out, etc., you get a closer picture of what the unemployment rate is. That number is in the last row labeled U-6.\n\nU-6 is much higher at 10.3%. Both numbers would be way higher still, were it not for millions dropping out of the labor force over the past few years.\n\nSome of those dropping out of the labor force retired because they wanted to retire. The rest is disability fraud, forced retirement, discouraged workers, and kids moving back home because they cannot find a job.\n\nBy Mike ""Mish"" Shedlock\n\nhttp://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com\n\nClick Here To Scroll Thru My Recent Post List\n\nMike Shedlock / Mish is a registered investment advisor representative for SitkaPacific Capital Management .

This has been going on for many years and investors are starting to turn their heads to new exciting asset classes that have emerged. The rationale is backed by the motivation to seek further diversification benefits, which is characterised by the unique features of unconventional assets.\n\nThe rise of so called alternative investments (alternatives to the three dominant traditional investments mentioned above) came along with the convenient risk hedging financial derivatives and started to appeal many investors, who today include them in their portfolios due to their unique advantageous characteristics. Trust in alternative investment took a significant plunge during the financial crisis of 2008 and deterred investors worldwide. The primary reason for this fall in demand was the misuse of financial innovation, which produced many alternative investments and indeed was a significant trigger of this crisis. Given the measurements and improvements taken in the aftermath of the historic crisis, people should stop worrying and start embracing the beauty and usefulness of alternative assets.\n\nA possible taxonomy regarding alternative investments could follow with the distinction between tangible and intangible assets. Intangibles include alternative financial assets, such as well-diversified mutual/hedge funds or indirect strategies with real estate through REITs, REIFs or MBSs. This analysis is particularly devoted to the less known tangible alternative investments such as precious metals, wine or antiques. More specifically we will now move towards the analysis of a particularly interesting tangible alternative investment – ART.\n\nArt as an Asset Class\n\nOne of the less common alternative investments, art (e.g. paintings, sculptures, architecture, photography, etc.) has become a rising investment opportunity for investors worldwide and is considered to be a new form of asset class to be included in modern alternative portfolio management.\n\nThe best part about investing in art could be seen in the effects of diversification, which typically finds its limits when investing through conventional methods. Although art contributes as an additional source of return with an attractive risk-reward ratio, it is important to remember that due to globalisation, overall market correlation has actually increased over the years. Fear of including art inside the portfolio should be slowly eradicated and motivated by the fact that the root cause of this worry, which is the yet undiscovered and uncertain knowledge on this new asset class, could potential create a competitive advantage towards other investors. Nevertheless, portions of investments in art should be relatively low, since the benefits from diversification are not as large as with other traditional assets yet and the uncertain nature might cause high unexpected risk.\n\nThe Art Market\n\nAll investments made in art are connected through one unifying factor, which is the art market per se. A striking attribute that describes the art market is its lack of regulation and thus following somehow the benefits of a free market. One might argue that it is precisely this feature that enables many investors worldwide to generate some type of arbitrage opportunities. In addition, special expertise in the art market could substantially generate extra opportunities and return coming from investments in art. Furthermore, the foreseeable future outlook for the art market seems to be following a positive trend with rising activities in wealth management involving products of art and incoming demand for this interesting alternative investment.\n\nKey Characteristics of the Art Market\n\nLack of significant regulation\n\n\n\nLack of transparency\n\n\n\nIlliquidity\n\n\n\nHigh entry barriers\n\n\n\nLarge transaction costs\n\n\n\nHigh degree of specialisation/expertise\n\nTrading in the Art Market\n\nPrimary Market Sale of new art by living artists through dealers and galleries Many not yet established artists cause potentially higher risk, but with higher return\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Market Resale market through auction houses or private sale transactions Increased shift of living artists from primary to secondary markets\n\n\n\nArt Funds\n\nFor the retail investor, the probably most efficient and simplest way to invest in art would be through a diversified art fund, which presents itself in different forms and types as a collection of various artworks. The fund can be freely chosen, based on the risk-return trade-off preference of the individual investor.\n\nArt funds are created and managed by a composition of professional investment managers and experts from the art industry and involves advisory coming from professionals in traditional hedge and private equity funds.\n\nThe conclusion of the philosophy of art investing as a choice of alternative investment, brings with itself some wisdom for modern investors. The concise suggested way to tackle this issue is to ideally invest a portion of your portfolio in art funds but with careful consideration to not overinvest. The relative portion of your art investment should be kept small in order to avoid increased risky correlations with the market, yet benefit from the effects of diversification by having an additional asset class inside the portfolio. That having said, the next strategic move is to find your adequate art fund and enjoy the additional benefits of investments in art.']"
09/06/2015,"[""Chris Grundy is a self-confessed bitcoin obsessive and avid tech fan. He works for bitcoin lending platform Bitbond and has written for a variety of online publications. In this article, he speaks to a number of European bitcoin companies about why the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology could lie in their home continent, not the US.\n\nInnovation is the primary distinction between leaders and followers. It represents disruption and a challenge to our way of life.\n\nBitcoin is an important innovation, and it needs progressive legislation to unlock its full potential. Clear and progressive legislative guidance will give aspiring bitcoin entrepreneurs the confidence they need to find new use cases and bring bitcoin to the masses.\n\nDespite this, bitcoin regulation in the US remains unfriendly.\n\nAction in the US\n\nReleased in April, the deadline for BitLicence applications passed on 8th August 2015. The result has been 22 applications (confirmed so far) and 15 bitcoin companies ceasing their operations in New York State. Poloniex, BitFinex and Kraken are just some of the important players that have left, with BTC Guid deciding to shut down completely.\n\nSome, like ShapeShift and Xapo, have re-located their headquarters from the US to Europe, as a result.\n\nOnly a few hours drive away, Connecticut has passed questionable bitcoin legislation, giving individual state regulators the ability to deny or accept applications for a money transmission licence by an otherwise qualified applicant, if digital currencies are involved.\n\nAdditionally, in March 2014, the Texas State Securities Board served a cease and desist letter to Balanced Energy LLC, an oil and gas exploration company. The company’s acceptance of bitcoin as payment method was regarded as such a risk to investors, that it was shut down.\n\nOn the West Coast, a bill has been proposed in California,which would result in a $5,000 non-refundable registration fee for any digital currency business. This bill comes with no guarantees, from banks or legislators.\n\nFor small, un-established innovators, the fee could make the difference between getting into business or not.\n\nAlena Vranova, co-founder of SatoshiLabs, and creator of the Trezor bitcoin wallet, said:\n\n“The barrier of entry for newcomers to financial services is too high.”\n\nThus, Europe is becoming more attractive for bitcoin entrepreneurs.\n\nWhy bitcoin needs progressive legislation\n\nA recent article on CoinDesk by Jean-Louis Schlitz described Luxembourg’s approach to bitcoin legislation. He explained how the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), has provided bitcoin companies with “the basic regulatory recipe for success”.\n\nBy doing so, the CSSF has provided legislative clarity and given entrepreneurs the basic principles they need to run their business with confidence.\n\nLuxembourg is by no means alone in Europe for providing actionable legislative frameworks for bitcoin companies.\n\nGerman financial regulator BaFin confirmed in 2013 that it classified bitcoin as a “financial instrument”, which gave companies operating in the space a better idea of where they stood in regards to the law.\n\nKaja Ribnikar, executive assistant at Bitstamp, said her company has had positive experiences with European regulators, adding:\n\n“It goes without saying that they are open for dialogue, they are receptive and have a more balanced view on bitcoin. It is evident that the US is a much tougher environment to run a bitcoin business.”\n\nThe prevailing regulatory insecurity and the necessary legal bills incumbent in the US made entrepreneurs wary even prior to the BitLicence.\n\nHenrik Hjelte, co-founder of ChromaWay, a Stockholm-based open-source coloured coins wallet, explained his company was close to moving to the US around a year ago. However, the thought of expensive legal bills “scared” the team, so it decided to settle in Europe instead. “So far we have not regretted it,” he added.\n\nLedgerWallet, a provider of smartcard security for bitcoins, is based in France and manages to largely sidestep regulation because of the nature of the service it provides. However, CEO Eric Larchevêque believes that, by being in Europe (and especially France), the company enjoys “major benefits”.\n\n“We … have access to a large range of state-sponsored grants, helping us fund R&D or develop production facilities,” he added.\n\nPuzzling resilience\n\nThe US’s resilience to progressive bitcoin legislation is puzzling, considering the tax and revenue implications. Some 77% of all bitcoin currency conversions are denominated in US dollar, yet the US does not officially consider bitcoin a currency.\n\n“It is up to our governments to stimulate innovation by being responsive, fast, cheap.””\n\nIn early 2014, the IRS ruled bitcoin must be treated as property for tax purposes, yet the federal judge presiding over the Silk Road case, as well as Judge Frank Fletcher, have ruled that bitcoin should be treated as a currency.\n\nImpartial observers point towards the willingness of European governments to see bitcoin as an opportunity rather than a threat. In 2013, the United Kingdom issued a Revenue & Customs Brief, outlining levied taxes for bitcoin-generated income.\n\nAdditionally, Spain's tax office, Ministerio de Hacienda, confirmed in April that bitcoin is exempt from value-added tax (VAT). Following this decision, the the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice, said digital currencies like bitcoin should be exempt from VAT.\n\nChromaWay’s Hjelte welcomed these regulations, stating: “The most important thing for innovation here is the legal aspects. It is up to our governments to stimulate innovation by being responsive, fast, cheap.”\n\nEurope as the center of bitcoin\n\nDespite these positive developments in Europe, media coverage has been thin on the ground. The waves European startups are making are often neglected for their US counterparts. With only 25% of the bitcoin network located on European soil, you might be forgiven for putting America first.\n\nHowever, Europe has been instrumental in shaping bitcoin. Bitstamp, for example, comes from the first generation of bitcoin exchanges. It has enforced full KYC processes and implemented hot wallet multisig technology.\n\nOther Europe-based companies in the space include bitcoin wallet providers Trezor and LedgerWallet; Bitbond and coloured coin creator ChromaWay, which is implementing an open-source protocol for creating digital assets on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAdditionally, Berlin-based SatoshiPay, an open transaction-focused nanopayments provider, enables the payment of “thousands, hundreds or even single satoshis”. The company has also built a cross-website content payment mechanism that works without the user having to sign up or download.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nBitcoin is disruption. Bitcoin is innovation. Bitcoin is truly global. Its success will be based on the use cases found and invented for it. In order for innovation to take place, progressive legislation is required.\n\nBitcoin needs governments to see its potential and let it grow at its own pace.\n\nAs Bitstamp's Kaja Ribnikar said, regulators in Europe have realised that clamping down on bitcoin would mean “killing a very powerful and productive ecosystem”.\n\nMany entrepreneurs point towards the incomparable level of venture capital available in the US, as a palliative for the unfriendly legislation. As Meinhard Benn, CEO of SatoshiPay, has stated, however, US legislation “gives advantage to well-funded companies, which in turn dampens innovation”.\n\nWhat we should take away from this is that progressive legislation can open the door to innovation. By providing a legal framework, many European countries are giving bitcoin entrepreneurs the confidence they need to create and find new use cases for bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nEurope image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

According to the Greater Zurich Area AG, Zug is well known for its commodities trading, but times are changing,\n\n“... in recent years young entrepreneurs and programmers have set out to make Zug a leader in the field of digital finance – cryptocurrencies, to be more precise. New trading markets, new encryption technologies or new digital currencies are being developed. The room for possibilities is huge – Bitcoins are only one option out of many.”\n\n- Greater Zurich Area AG\n\nThere are many internationally recognised crypto companies that are based in the so-called “Crypto Valley”. Xapo has three layers of security protection. The company also provides 100 percent insurance for all bitcoin funds kept in its virtual vault. ShapeShift which offers instant bitcoin to altcoin conversion with an easy to use app with high level of consumer protection.\n\nEcurex is a trading engine, with financial instruments and information services, with a focus on the speed of their operations, reliability and convenience. Ethereum is a decentralized platform for applications that can run exactly as programmed without fraud, censorship or third-party interference.\n\nMonetas is an app that helps consumers buying goods and services through digital transactions made through its app. Swiss Bitcoin Exchange is a Swiss marketplace where Bitcoin digital currency can be exchanged and traded.\n\nDigital currency companies are spread across the entire country such as sBex, or Metaco from the French part of Switzerland. A wealth of events will also be taking place in the coming weeks. There will be a Cryptocurrency and Blockchain event in Zurich on September 23, 2015 and an International Crypto Finance Tech Conference taking place on November 3, 2015 in Zug.\n\nSandra Tobler, believes that companies are attracted to Zug specifically as Switzerland is valued for its tradition of international neutrality, national sovereignty and regulatory stability. “They say that Switzerland offers an excellent operating, financial and regulatory environment and consequentially the greatest level of protection for keeping and trading bitcoins,” she said.\n\nTobler has a Master’s degree in International Affairs from Geneva with a focus on International Business within the ICT sector. Tobler is currently working for the Swiss Business Hub US which is based in the Consulate General of Switzerland in San Francisco. Working with Swiss companies on business development activities across the US West coast, she aids US companies by assessing investments in Switzerland. “In addition, I am responsible for the ICT sector within the organization, bringing associations, media, SMEs, startups, corporations and regulators together in order to facilitate internationalization and Swiss-American business exchange in particular.”\n\nTobler advises that Bitcoin is an interesting investment topic for several reasons. “First of all the “new currency” is decentralized and based on a peer-to-peer principle. This implies it is an independent currency regime with cryptographic proof without the need to trust a third party middleman like a central bank. The system is attractive as the blockchain is public and all transactions are fully transparent. Only the content is encrypted. For example, all transactions can be controlled by any participating party at any time. Still, one negative associated item is the high fluctuation of the value of Bitcoin.”\n\n“Bitcoin enables money transactions to many people who currently do not have a bank account. The use of bitcoin reduces transaction costs massively.”\n\n- Tobler\n\nIn addition, the subject of microcredits, holds great value to Tobler. Today’s financial system cannot support micropayments as it is costly due to transaction costs. “With Bitcoin, there are no transaction costs like what is seen with credit card companies. Large international corporations are now starting to understand the potential of lower internal transactional costs,” said Tobler\n\n- Tobler\n\nTobler explained there is a lot of activity and know-how in Switzerland around service providers of Bitcoin and she is happy to see lively development in Switzerland. “In addition to having a health fintech community connected to Bitcoin, Switzerland has been pioneering growth in the industry.”\n\nAs far as regulation goes in Switzerland, Tobler explains that the various angles of laws surrounding the use of Bitcoin still need to be fully explored. She advises that bitcoin touches areas of tax law as well as areas of penal law such as cyber security or money laundry. It also needs to be defined in the area of data security including data access TPP or identity theft and data privacy personal profiling, and big data as an example.\n\nIn a report dated 25th June 2014, the Swiss Federal Council explained they would refrain from drafting legislation respectively adopting regulation with regards to digital currencies. It refers to existing laws and where contracts, and payments are made in a digital currency, they will be generally enforceable and criminal acts related to Bitcoin can be persecuted.\n\nAccording to Deloitte Switzerland, due to the fact that Bitcoins are not considered securities as defined by the Swiss Stock Exchange Act this will not be applicable to the trade of digital currencies. “However, depending on the use of Bitcoin in the business operation, the Swiss Banking Act may be relevant and an authorization by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority may be required. Additionally, specific transactions may be in the scope of the Money Laundering Act,” advised Deloitte Switzerland\n\n“Experts do not even agree on whether bitcoin can be considered as full-fledged currency from a legal standpoint. However, if you look at the Swiss legislation, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) did authorize the bitcoin stock exchange (ECUREX) in May of 2015. This will facilitate the exchange from Swiss Francs to Bitcoin. The new draft of the provision on money laundry will deal with virtual currencies. It will go into effect at the beginning of 2016,” said Tobler\n\nIn June this year, bitcoin became exempt from Switzerland’s Value Added Tax (VAT), which was welcomed news in the Swiss Bitcoin community. In a press release Niklas Nikolajsen, CEO of Bitcoin Suisse AG, commented, “This is excellent news for Bitcoin in Switzerland as it provides the legal certainty we need to professionally operate our business.”\n\nTobler sees that Switzerland has the chance to be at the forefront of innovation in financial services. “We have the rare combination of being an internationally recognized finance center paired with a lot of innovation and know-how in ICT. I hope in five years’ time, we will have an even more vibrant internationally recognized start-up ecosystem around Fintech closely interplaying with the banking sector, independent players from the telco, retail and other areas.”', 'UBS is working on a block chain based “settlement coin” that financial institutions will use, according to The Wall Street Journal. Unlike bitcoin, the UBS “utility settlement coin” would link to real-world currencies and central bank accounts.\n\nOliver Bussmann, CIO of Switzerland-based UBS, said the coin will help establish the block chain in global finance. The currency, being developed with Clearmatics, a London-based firm that makes clearing machines for OTC markets, could reduce transaction settlement times. The coin could reduce settlement time from two or three days to a matter of seconds.\n\nUBS’ new cryptocurrency lab in London is leading the initiative, according to Financial News, a London-based newspaper.\n\nBank Will Use The Coin With Market Players\n\nAlex Batlin, head of the UBS lab, said the bank does not plan to issue the digital coin itself. Instead, UBS will work with other market participants such as buy-side firms, regulators and market structure providers for an industry-wide product.\n\n“Obviously we need to collaborate with other parties around the market in the space, with the regulators, with the central banks, to take this forward,” said Hyder Jaffrey, e-commerce commercial director at UBS Investment Bank.\n\nThe bank also said it is collaborating with BNY Mellon on separate block chain projects.\n\nBussmann said at a recent press briefing that the bank has identified 20 to 25 potential uses for block chain technology in finance. He said there are also limitations, including the block chain’s ability to handle large volumes of transactions.\n\nAlso read: Global financial research institute seeks grant proposals on block chain capabilities\n\nInstitutions Must Consider Block Chain Limitations\n\n“The limitation is scale,” Bussmann said. “It (the block chain) still can’t handle the volumes that we handle in our traditional business.”\n\nIn April, UBS became one of the first big financial institutions to reveal its block chain plans when it launched a lab in the fintech accelerator space Level39 at Canary Wharf to experiment with the technology.\n\nUBS also unveiled other projects developed at the lab, including a prototype for a smart bond platform built on Ethereum, a type of block chain.\n\nThe smart bond platform enables the issuance of bonds through distributed ledger technology. The bonds would be “smart contracts,” programmed to pay out coupons automatically. The bank does not plan to bring the platform to market in the short term, but executives said the prototype proved the technology’s potential.\n\nFeatured image from Pincasso / Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Is the future of bitcoin in Europe?\n\nAcceptance and further developments behind the digital currency have been active and apparent in areas such as the United States and Southeast Asia. Coinbase recently announced its expansion into Singapore, and several major players such as Kraken make their home on American soil, but that’s not to say that there haven’t been problems.\n\nFor one thing, the U.S. is still coming to terms with the idea of digital currencies in many ways. Regulation stemming from the BitLicense and the various “copy models” we now see in areas such as California and North Carolina has caused several businesses to leave, unwilling to “play by the rules” and put customer privacy on the line. Furthermore, hostility is coming from several businesses looking at regulation as an attempt to halt innovation in the cryptocurrency arena.\n\nAsia has also had an up-and-down, slow-paced relationship with bitcoin. Between Mt. Gox, Russia’s on-again off-again relationship with virtual currencies and China’s alleged bans on bitcoin trading have not done much to further its establishment in eastern countries.\n\nMany are now pointing to Europe as the potential “it factor” behind the perfect home for bitcoin. Due to licensing restrictions in the United States, for example, many bitcoin entrepreneurs are looking at areas such as the U.K., Germany and related areas through a more attractive lens. With less regulation to adhere to, there is obviously more room to prosper.\n\nAdditional benefits can also be seen in neighboring countries. Spain has recently exclaimed that bitcoin is a VAT-exempt entity, and the U.K. has outlined levied taxes for bitcoin-generated income. Switzerland is proving to be very beneficial for bitcoin startups, and LedgerWallet, which provides smartcard security for bitcoins, has managed to avoid the majority of regulation due to the services it offers. CEO Eric Larcheveque mentions that staying in Europe has helped the company tremendously:\n\n“We… have access to a large range of state-sponsored grants, helping us fund R&D or develop production facilities.”\n\nWill Europe eventually be the ultimate bitcoin haven? List your comments below!', 'Blackmailing Ashley Madison users for Bitcoin may be on the rise after a report last week noted that more users are starting to pay up on the demands.\n\nNetwork security firm Cloudmark, Inc. Software Engineer and Research Analyst Toshiro Nishimura said that thousands may have been extracted from those seeking to buy the silence of only one particular blackmailer he had traced online.\n\nReports of Ashley Madison cheaters being blackmailed first emerged August 23, when it was reported that blackmailers are sending emails to users of the site saying that they will not expose their membership of the extra-marital affairs site in return for a specific Bitcoin payment, usually 1 Bitcoin plus a fraction of a Bitcoin, with the fraction acting as the identifier as to who was paying to not be exposed by the particular blackmailer.\n\nThe tracking of the particular blackmailer noted that the Bitcoin addresses were all different and freshly generated, meaning the user had no previous activity on the Bitcoin Blockchain that could be traced. However, unlike earlier reports, the emails consistently demanded “exactly 1.05” Bitcoins from their targets, allowing a search of the Bitcoin Blockchain to see how common payments of that exact amount were.\n\nAccording to Nishimura, Cloudmark found 67 suspicious transactions totalling 70.35 BTC or approximately $15,814 within the extortion time frame of approximately four days paying 1.05 BTC to addresses, with no previous activity, and with two or fewer transaction outputs; the latter is important as it indicates the people making the payments were either new to Bitcoin, or as a good as new, a more likely profile for the victim of the extortion.\n\nOf particular note, transactions matching the above pattern usually came in at a rate of approximately 5.3 per 100,000 transactions, versus 8.9 during the extortion period.\n\n“For a spammer with pre-existing infrastructure and tools, this extortion campaign could have yielded a worthwhile sum for very little effort.,” Nishimura noted. “All the blackmailer had to do was download the Ashley Madison data, extract the email addresses, generate a Bitcoin address for each victim and send out the emails.”\n\nLegal redress\n\nAlthough it’s unlikely that many victims of this blackmail for Bitcoin scheme are likely to come forward and make formal complaints with law enforcement, if they do there may be hope in tracking down exactly who the blackmailer or blackmailers are.\n\n“In order to go deeper into this analysis, the next step would be to follow the trail of Bitcoins leading to each suspicious address to see if they are connected on the Blockchain to each other or any other known suspicious addresses, Nishimura added. “Such analysis could potentially help law enforcement to deanonymize and pursue the perpetrators.”\n\nIf you’re an Ashley Madison user targeted by these sorts of extortion attempts our advice is simple: don’t pay up because it’s not as if the person targeting you can stop someone else exposing your cheating or attempted cheating via the site given the information is publicly available.', 'Cloud storage, whether it be for backups, syncing devices, or sharing data with trusted parties, is becoming common and useful in our daily lives. For those of us that have more than one connected device, a drive in the cloud could be indispensable.\n\nHowever, in the wake of Edward Snowden\'s revelations, privacy concerns have left a sour taste in many users\' mouths. Snowden revealed that some providers, like Dropbox, are ""hostile to privacy,"" referring to the storage company\'s lack of encryption and willingness to share personal files with authorities, and perhaps other parties, such as advertisers.\n\nAt the time, Snowden famously advised the world to use “Zero-Knowledge” private cloud storage, specifically endorsing a cloud storage solution named Spideroak.\n\n""Spideroak has structured their system in such a way you can store all of your information on them with the same sort of features that Dropbox does, but they literally had no access to the content. So while they can be compelled to turn it over, the law enforcement agencies still have to go to a judge and get a warrant to actually get your encryption key from you.""\n\n\n\n- Edward Snowden\n\nEncryption alone isn\'t enough for many privacy-minded people. Zero-Knowledge Privacy (ZKP) services have been popping up to fulfill the promise made by encryption to protect the privacy of data. Using open source code as promoted by the Zero-Knowledge Privacy Foundation, when such services properly implement ZKP standards, anyone can be sure that they and they alone have access to their own data in the cloud using these services.\n\nAt the time of Snowden\'s endorsement, the only mainstream-ready ZKP service was Chicago-based Spideroak, and their business immediately boomed. In the remainder of 2014, the company signed up over 1 Million users. Several other large companies have also appeared since, offering a similar ZKP service.\n\nSync is the most recent service to do so, and on Wednesday the Ontario-based company announced they are now accepting bitcoin payments.\n\n“Sync.com, the 100% private cloud storage and file sharing platform with over 100,000 users, announced today they now accept Bitcoin as a payment method, via BitPay. With Bitcoin, our customers can enjoy absolute privacy in the cloud for both their data and payments.""\n\n- Sync\n\nLaunched as a proof of concept in July 2013, Sync\'s ZKP platform is now used by over 100,000 individuals and businesses. This growth, along with the growth of Spideroak and the other ZKP services, demonstrates the significant awareness and demand for data privacy protection in the cloud.\n\nUsing bitcoin to pay for ZKP services makes a lot of difference for those who truly care about their privacy. Since no personal information is attached to a bitcoin transaction by default, it does not require giving up personally identifiable information during signup of any web service.\n\n""Protecting customer data is our number one priority here at Sync. As it should be for any business storing sensitive customer information in the cloud,"" said Sync\'s CEO, Thomas Savundra. ""And while we continue to offer traditional forms of payment such as credit card, Bitcoin is a win for our customers, and a win for privacy in general.""\n\nDespite a few critics who claim that ZKP is not quite as safe as advertised, using bitcoin to pay for a well-vetted ZKP service like Sync or Spideroak is a means to protect a user\'s personal information. However, Spideroak only briefly accepted bitcoin as a test in 2013, and doesn\'t offer the option on their site today.\n\nThis could makes Sync a more attractive ZKP service for bitcoiners and other privacy advocates. Sync offers five Gigabytes of private cloud storage for free, forever, with upgraded plans up to two Terabytes for $98 per year. By contrast, Spideroak\'s free service only lasts 60 days and their largest plan, at five Terabytes, costs $279 per year, payable by credit card only.\n\nThere is also a ZKP service that is more popular than these two. According to Alexa rankings Kim Dotcom\'s New Zealand-based Mega is one of the planet\'s top 450 most popular websites. The site provides every visitor 50 Gigabytes of free drive space forever, while having the most intuitive interface imaginable.\n\nIn addition, Dotcom is a huge bitcoin supporter, proudly offering bitcoin payment options for all of his products. Mega\'s upgrade plans can be considered expensive, as a four Terabyte plan goes for approximately $400 annually. It is also not ideal for a Backup solution, having a user interface designed specifically for file sharing.\n\nSwitzerland-based pCloud also accepts bitcoin payments. The company doesn\'t enable ZKP by default, but for $4 a month they\'ll turn their “Crypto” service on for you which does. Their base plan is a free 20 Gigabytes forever, but without paying for the Crypto upgrade it\'s very similar to an unencrypted Dropbox account. pCloud\'s largest personal plan is only one Terabyte for about $95 per year.\n\nFor those who don\'t require the super-high levels of privacy that Zero-Knowledge solutions offer, but prefer more security than Dropbox, there are a few bitcoin-accepting solutions that aren\'t ZKP.\n\nBackupvault is a London-based data backup-focused cloud service which announced they accept bitcoin in December. They also claim to offer 256bit encryption on all data as well, starting at $10 per month.\n\nThere is also Datashell, a UK-based cloud storage service that is dedicated to offering bitcoin and litecoin payment options. Although they have no free level of service, Datashell\'s unique offering places no limits at all on space nor bandwidth consumed. Instead of charging for space, their three levels of service, starting at about $55 per year, limits the number of devices you can backup or share cloud drive service with. To turn on or off the 256-bit encryption is an option at Datashell, free of charge.\n\nIf ever there was a unique use-case for bitcoin, privately paying for a service like ZKP storage is a great example. As more of our data moves online, the importance of ZKP storage services will grow. People using these services may become familiar with the benefits of using bitcoin to help keep their data private.', ""In our age of Spotify, most artists fail to get a fair deal. But with help from coders, Imogen Heap is leading the fightback, using a technology that could revolutionise the way music is made and sold\n\nWhen was the last time you bought a CD or a record? Chances are, you’re listening to more music than ever, but buying less of it. In 2012, for the first time, digital sales of songs – such as iTunes – surpassed physical sales. More likely still is that you were on YouTube or Spotify, which host hundreds of thousands of songs, played billions of times. It’s a golden age for music.\n\nExcept plenty of musicians don’t agree. Over the last year or so, there’s been a growing public chorus of complaints from artists themselves, who have reached a tipping point of dissatisfaction about their industry. One of them, Imogen Heap, who’s “fed up of hearing herself complain”, is trying to change it instead.\n\nHeap is renowned for being inventive. She’s an award-winning songwriter and performer, having released four solo albums that have enjoyed commercial success in the UK and the US. She self-released her 2005 album Speak for Yourself long before it became popular to do so. She’s also the only female artist to have won a Grammy for engineering, and over the last six years has been designing and producing some musical gloves, along with the rest of her MiMu team, that allow the wearer to sculpt and manipulate sound on and off stage with gestures.\n\nImogen Heap: 'I've just done a poll with YouGov to find out about my fans' Read more\n\nBut these endeavours are likely to pale in comparison to her current project: to bring to life an entirely new landscape for distributing and monetising music and all its related data and content. Spurred on by the technology originally designed by libertarians to create the crypto-currency bitcoin, she’s releasing her next song, Tiny Human, as an event and an experiment. What she hopes to emerge is the core of a revolutionary system she refers to as Mycelia. It could completely transform the music industry.\n\nMusic is in many ways a bellwether for the digital revolution. The products of many creative industries – art, music, books, papers, films – which were once solely physical objects, shipped, bought and carried home, are now digital files available on demand at next to no cost. Because digital files can be reproduced and shared infinitely and easily, the result in almost every industry has been more consumption and lower average returns, fuelling fears about how the people who make this stuff – the writers, artists and musicians – will get paid for it.\n\nThe modern music industry was created at a time when it made economic sense to produce a million copies of one vinyl record, and copyright could be successfully enforced. But as the industry went digital, the whole way music was made and sold changed. In the early 00s, many feared the music industry would soon wither away as free streaming services and pirated content made music, de facto, free.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Imogen Heap demonstrating her musical gloves.\n\nSpotify, iTunes and YouTube, to their credit, came up with ways of monetising music again, turning pirates into paying customers. Spotify charges premium users a monthly fee to listen to everything on its catalogue (non-paying users have to listen to adverts) and then shares out 70% of its income to whoever holds the copyright. YouTube, which has many more users but no paid-for premium service, came up with something called Content ID. Videos uploaded to YouTube are scanned against a database of files that have been submitted to the company – and the copyright owner gets to decide what happens to his or her content: whether to remove the material, “monetise” it by allowing advertising to be shown alongside it and accepting some percentage cut, or leave it and collect data about usage. This has breathed new life and money into the industry. Spotify has paid $300m (£196m) in royalties in the first three months of 2015. YouTube has paid out more than $1bn (£654m) since Content ID started seven years ago.\n\nBut the streaming and revenue-sharing deals that are now so important for the industry have also brought into sharp relief just how opaque and complicated the whole system is. The structure of modern music production is Kafkaesque. An artist might sign a deal with a record label. In between them and the music fan there could be the label’s parent company, distributors and hundreds of music services, each taking a cut. There are sync rights, mechanical royalties, performance royalties. Consumers and music services pay different amounts for streaming, downloads and physical sales, and different amounts again to songwriters via collecting societies and publishers. Different deals can be struck in different territories. Add to that a mild obsession with non-disclosure agreements and it can be close to impossible for musicians to work out what they are owed.\n\nThere’s no single bad guy here – it’s just not in anyone’s interests to make it easier. What should be a simple transaction looks more like a derivatives and futures market. According to Heap, “more and more third parties jump on board to help the artists, or labels, navigate and collect feedback or money, but it just adds to the noise and confusion, further widening the gap between fan and artist and the journey of their music. I feel digitally torn apart; and in the data-driven era, the movement of music, money and feedback should be frictionless. A total rethink is in order.”\n\nThe more layers of bureaucracy, the more finely sliced the cake, especially as a growing proportion of money is coming from streaming services. David Byrne, of Talking Heads, estimates that only 15-20% of Spotify’s payments make it through to the artists.\n\nI feel digitally torn apart; and in the data-driven era, the movement of music and money should be frictionless\n\nThere is money to be made if you can accumulate enough viewers, of course. When Gangnam Style reached more than 1bn views on YouTube, its makers, PSY, were believed to have made an estimated $800,000 to $2m in revenue. But that’s the exception. The brave new world of streaming and advertising might work for some, but there is a very long unprofitable tail. According to the website Information Is Beautiful, for a signed US solo artist to earn minimum wage from streaming, their songs would need to be heard more than 1m times.\n\nBut what constitutes a “fair” amount under the revenue share model? No one really knows. Although YouTube doesn’t release figures detailing how much ad revenue it receives for specific artists, it maintains that the rights holders always earn more than the company does. What’s more, people have been predicting the death of the creative industries for at least 15 years, and yet US Occupational Employment Statistics suggest there are still plenty of artists out there. It’s just that they are finding new ways of making money. According to Jeremy Pritchard from Everything Everything, eight years and three albums into their career, they still haven’t made any money from their record sales. They get by thanks to live shows. “We did 130 in 2013,” he tells me. And spend five minutes on Bandcampcorrect or YouTube and you’ll notice a remarkable amount of interesting, innovative and exciting new sounds and songs.\n\nEither way, most seem to be able to agree that, even if musicians are not on the breadline yet, the way music is currently distributed and paid for is complex and inefficient. And it’s about to get worse, according to Alan Graham, co-founder of OCL, a company that provides technology that allows users to legally create new works while compensating artists via micro-payments. He’s been working in technology for more than 20 years, and has noticed that increasing parts of the net are “walled gardens”, private networks protected by encryption and privacy tools: “And if you can’t see infringement, you can’t enforce it.” (Earlier this month, Facebook promised to do more to crack down on video piracy on its site after it was found that the majority of the videos are shared without the copyright owner’s permission.)\n\nMoreover, says Graham, what happens if ad blockers get more popular, or are introduced as default into new browsers? Or – and there are signs of this – if people just stop clicking on adverts? The entire advertising revenue model is out of the window. Perhaps this is one reason that YouTube plans to roll out a trial paid-for ad-free subscription service later this year.\n\nEvery centralised effort to resolve this sclerotic mess always seems to flounder. Last year, the Global Repertoire Database, an ambitious attempt to build a single online copyright and information portal for all musical works, collapsed after six years and £8m in investment. Last month, the rights group PRS sued the streaming service SoundCloud for not paying its members royalties. (SoundCloud claims it doesn’t need to, since it merely hosts, not owns, the content on its platform.). “It’s all egos,” one industry insider told me.\n\nOne day, I hope for a Mycelia-like place to exist. Huge, beautiful, rich, colourful, loved, tended for\n\nThese twin concerns – opaqueness and a general sense of unfairness over pay – are what seems to be sparking the artists’ rebellion. When Apple Music announced it would allow users a free three-month trial of its new streaming service – and that artists wouldn’t be paid for those three months – Taylor Swift threatened to pull her music from the store. Apple quickly backtracked. Other well-known stars, such as Prince, have pulled their music from streaming services, claiming it to be unfair. A number of new technology firms have sprung up, spotting the opportunity for new revenue models for the industry, such as Kobalt, which allows artists to access a database that records every time their work is streamed, broadcast, sold, reused and publicly broadcast.\n\nBut Heap is taking another line: using her latest song as a test case to try something completely new. “I’ve reached a point in my career where I can take risks,” she tells me in her home-cum-recording studio. “And as life does in nature, music will find a way. We are in a tricky transitional phase, especially for new talent, and I want to help move things along so we don’t miss a generation of great music.”\n\nFollowing the release of last year’s album, Sparks, Heap began mulling over some ideas on releasing future music. She wanted to be able to simply upload a single authenticated version of a song or album that everyone could draw from in one place, instead of supplying her song to multiple services and locations. She also felt there was more than just the music to share: cover art, credit information, brands of instruments used, licensing information. She got chatting with a musician friend, Zoë Keating, who was similarly frustrated, and Keating mentioned blockchain technology. “I started researching the tech,” says Heap, “as I realised that the building blocks for a sustainable, useful ecosystem for music was coming into view. So I decided to release my new song in the way I think things should go, and help build the place I want my music to be a part of.”\n\nHardly anyone outside a smallish group of programmers and tech geeks has heard of blockchain, but those who have are unusually excited about it. To learn more, I met with Vinay Gupta, who’s part of a group called Ethereum, which is developing blockchain technology. Last year, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin won the world technology award for IT software. In practical terms, Ethereum does two things. First, it’s building a new web out of the spare power and hard drive space of millions of connected computers that its owners put on the network. Because it runs with strong encryption and the network is “distributed” across all those individual computers, it’s more or less impossible for anyone to censor or control what’s on it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Heap at the 2010 Grammy awards, where she won the best engineered album. AFP/Getty Images\n\nSecond, it allows people to create immutable, public transaction records. The problem with digital records is that they can be copied and so are not really owned by anyone. Borrowing the idea from the digital currency bitcoin, Ethereum records information on a public database in a chronological way that prevents copying, tampering, fraud or deletion. It’s a new anonymous, decentralised, uncensored internet, and a new way of controlling and storing digital information. It’s not designed for music – it’s designed for whatever people want to use it for. One key aim is to create purer, more efficient markets. But it just so happens to be perfect for what Heap is planning.\n\nWhen Heap heard about Ethereum, she arranged to meet Gupta and others to discuss how it might work for music. I asked if I could join them, as I have been following the development of blockchain technology closely since my last book The Dark Net. I suspected that Heap and Gupta might actually come up with a plan, and I wanted to document it. In a series of late-night emails after rehearsals, she sketched out a vision of how a new blockchain model, which she called Mycelia, might work for music. Gupta, a tech scene veteran who’s hard to impress, told me her ideas were “as impressive a piece of engineering imagination as I’ve seen from anybody in years”.\n\nBecause Heap now produces her own music independently she’s not contracted to release her song via the usual route. Instead, she will be placing the studio-recorded song, video, live performance and all Tiny Human-related data as files on her website, open to those developing new tech for the blockchain. All the taggable associated data that could interest fans or potential clients (film and TV, brands, other artists), such as the lyrics, photographs, the instruments she used, the musicians who played, etc (“I think I’ll add this article too,” she told me) will prove inspirational, she hopes.\n\nCrucially, she’ll also include simple contracts, revealing under what terms the music would (ideally, as this is an experiment) be downloaded or used by third parties, such as advertisers, and how any money earned will be divided up among the creatives involved. All payment received – using crypto-currencies – will be routed to the recipients, as set out in the contract, within seconds. (It typically takes between weeks and months for royalty payments to work their way through the chain at the moment.)\n\nImogen Heap: 'Unless somebody else hears it, music is like a joke without a punchline' | Q&A Read more\n\nTaken together, this means transparency and clarity can be introduced into the music industry; a decentralised registry will make it easier to locate the owners of the song to obtain a legal licence to use it; money can be quickly sent where it needs to go with far fewer intermediaries; and there will be a far richer ecosystem of data and information around each song.\n\nHeap is a technology whiz, but she knows this isn’t something she could tackle on her own – its success depends on diversity and collaboration. Indeed she’s inviting techies and hackers to spend the day with her to collectively build Mycelia, or something similar, using Tiny Human as the test case.\n\n“I want hackers to take my song, and then try whatever they want, to use it how they want, and to work out what we can do. We’ll see what they come up with, and take it from there – working together to build an open platform for everyone.”\n\nWhere “there” is exactly is not quite clear, although Heap is ambitious. “One day, I hope a Mycelia-like place will exist: huge, beautiful, rich, colourful, loved, tended for; holding all music-related information ever recorded anywhere; connecting artists and fans and enabling the artist to be the best at their job, with incredible feedback loops, connecting dots that exist in ways we can’t even imagine today.” (The name Mycelia refers to the enormous thread-like vegetative part of fungus that can stretch for miles underground.)\n\nWhen she tentatively mooted Mycelia online, it struck a nerve. She has already been contacted by dozens of tech companies small and large who are currently developing services on the blockchain and are prepared to try and build something with her.\n\nPhil Barry is one of them. He founded a platform called Ujo earlier this year, which uses the Ethereum blockchain to allow stakeholders to record their rights, to publish policies on how they want their music to be used (what price, what terms and so on). Ujo’s specific trick is creating smart contracts that automatically send payments to rights holders. He was introduced to Heap by Gupta when it become clear that Barry was working on something similar to what she had dreamed up. Barry suggested to Heap that she should let different platforms, including his own, try to build Mycelia, with the hope of creating a single, open, free platform – which led her to releasing Tiny Human this way. (He has a team of people already working on it.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Live at London’s Royal Albert Hall in November 2010. Photograph: Christie Goodwin/Redferns\n\nHow disruptive could all this be? Dramatic, Barry thinks. “Anyone on the existing system that adds value will survive. But all the people between the artists and the consumers are at risk. But if record companies can identify talent better, or add value in marketing, they can sell those services.”\n\nGupta, for his part, thinks that every single creative industry that relies on digital content might one day use this blockchain technology to get artists paid and create a purer, more transparent marketplace between them and the consumer. “All of the content verticals are in trouble,” he says. “Advertising is a shit business model, as no one likes ads. Music, video, photo: they are the same really – it’s just digital files being shuffled around different computers.”\n\nOthers take a slightly more moderate line. Alan Graham’s project OCL also uses the blockchain, but it’s more focused on allowing rights holders to create and deliver multiple types of content via an app or platform in a way that means it can be tracked and monetised quickly and efficiently through micropayments. OCL is trying to work with existing companies and so-called “legacy” systems and contracts as a bridge, rather than redesigning the system from scratch. For example, it can be integrated with Spotify or Snapchat.\n\nThere are lots of uncertainties. Heap tells me she’s not expecting Mycelia to transform the industry overnight. Many artists have to try to build this place for themselves, together with coders and developers, and one key challenge is to keep it in the hands of the artists and music lovers and not one company. The blockchain is not magic, and what matters most is whether consumers use it, and how existing companies with their legacy contracts and market power react if they do.\n\nThe greatest unknown is not whether the technology will work – I’m confident that it will – but whether the people who listen to music actually care about any of this. Music listeners are an unpredictable bunch – although they like to pirate, they also like to pay for artists they genuinely like.\n\nAre you sure people will want to pay for something they are now getting for free, I ask Heap.\n\n“I don’t think it’s that simple,” she says. “It’s not about paying or not paying, it’s how and who gets what. There is plenty of money being made out of the music that we make, but it isn’t getting back to us. It’s about creating a fair trade industry for music, an ecosystem that makes sense. If people knew a radio station, a platform or a device was using a fair system, and that artists were being recompensed for their work directly, they’d go for it over another that didn’t.”\n\nWhile doing the interviews for this article, I came to realise that maybe this uncertainty is part of the fun. Everyone I spoke to seems to agree something has to change, though no one can quite work out how, and that makes it a strangely exciting time. Heap told me several times that she still can’t imagine exactly how the future of the music industry is going to really look, “but a lot of us feel like there is an alternative out there, and that this type of technology could be it”.\n\nTechnology is too often viewed as either the saviour or wrecker whenever things go wrong. It’s sometimes both. Digital technology has for a long time been seen by the artists as part of the problem facing their industry, but now it could be the solution to the very difficulties it’s helped create. “For the first time I think the future is almost blindingly bright for our industry,” says Heap. “But we musicians have to sort this out, because no one else is going to do it for us.”\n\nTiny Human will be released at a Guardian Live event at Sonos Studio, London on 2 October."", 'Ein Update soll Bitcoin technisch zukunftsfähig machen, bewirkt aber etwas ganz anderes. Die Community ist gespalten und der Kurs geht in den Keller.\n\nBitcoin steht unter Druck. Seit Monaten diskutiert die Community über die Zukunftsfähigkeit des digitalen Geldes, findet jedoch keinen Kompromiss. Mit Bitcoin XT haben zwei Kernentwickler nun einen Lösungsvorschlag vorgelegt, der die Community polarisiert, für Kursverluste sorgt und zeigt, wie schwer es sein kann, Entscheidungen in einem dezentralen System zu treffen. Aber es besteht Hoffnung.\n\nDer Kampf zweier Fraktionen um die Zukunft von Bitcoin\n\nNicht nur die traditionellen Börsen stehen massiv unter Druck, auch Bitcoin verzeichnet starke Kursverluste. Rund ein Drittel seines Wertes hat die digitale Währung innerhalb von sechs Wochen verloren. Im Gegensatz zu den Turbulenzen an den etablierten Börsen, lassen sich die Gründe bei Bitcoin klar beschreiben.\n\nZum einen tritt im Bundesstaat New York die BitLicence genannte Regulierung der Bitcoin-Geschäfte in Kraft, die viele Unternehmen nicht hinnehmen wollen und sich deshalb reihenweise aus einem der wichtigsten Finanzplätze der Welt zurückziehen. Ein klarer Rückschritt für Bitcoin auf dem Weg zur anerkannten und respektablen Finanzinstitution – immerhin hatte die New York Stock Exchange erst Mitte Mai dieses Jahres einen Bitcoin-Preisindex aufgelegt.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Kurs leidet auch unter der laufenden Abstimmung (Screenshot: finanzen.net)\n\nEinen viel größeren Einfluss auf den fallenden Kurs hat jedoch die seit gut anderthalb Wochen laufende Kampfabstimmung um die Zukunft von Bitcoin, in die sich die global agierende Community selbst hineinmanövriert hat und in der neben technischen, ökonomischen und individuellen Interessen auch Egos und persönliche Befindlichkeiten aufeinanderprallen. Das macht die Lage unübersichtlich und erzeugt eine enorme Unsicherheit, die den Preis der Währung drückt. Denn eine Frage lässt sich bisher nicht beantworten: Wird Bitcoin diese Krise überstehen und wenn ja, auch die Community?\n\nAnzeige\n\nDer eigene Erfolg ist die größte Herausforderung\n\nKonkret geht es um Folgendes: Die Blockchain wird, so wie sie derzeit konzipiert ist, auf absehbare Zeit zu klein. Denn mit steigenden Transaktionszahlen, die die wachsende Verbreitung der Bitcoins mit sich bringt, wird auch mehr Speicherplatz benötigt, die Transaktionsdaten in der Blockchain festzuhalten. Bisher können einzelne Blöcke nur maximal 1 Megabyte groß sein – eine künstliche Verknappung, um das Bitcoin-Netzwerk unter anderem vor Spam-Transaktionen zu schützen, die mittlerweile an ihre Grenzen stößt. Deshalb muss eine Lösung her. Doch hier endet der Konsens der Community.\n\nEs herrscht Uneinigkeit darüber, wie die Blocksize, also die Größe der Blöcke, angepasst werden soll. Für diesen Schritt muss nämlich das Bitcoin-Protokoll selbst verändert werden. Eine Hardfork wäre notwendig, die die Bitcoin-Blockchain in zwei Versionen spalten würde: eine mit Blöcken, die weiterhin nur maximal 1 MB groß sein könnten und eine mit potentiell größeren Blöcken. 8 MB stehen als Vorschlag im Raum ebenso wie 20 MB. Auch die Frage wie künftig weitere Hardforks vermieden werden können, wenn die Blocksize eventuell erneut angepasst werden muss, wird diskutiert. Soll die Block-Größe in periodischen Abständen automatisch wachsen, sich je nach Bedarf dynamisch anpassen oder soll die Community zu festgelegten Zeitpunkten immer wieder aufs Neue entscheiden?\n\nEin Problem, zu viele Lösungen\n\nDas sind nur einige Möglichkeiten, die seit Monaten diskutiert werden und deren Vielzahl es schwer macht einen Konsens zu erreichen. Denn eine Hardfork ist nicht ohne Risiko. Immerhin gäbe es für einen kurzen Zeitraum zwei Varianten der Bitcoin-Blockchain und solange das Netzwerk sich nicht auf eine Version geeinigt hat und die andere verwirft, ist Bitcoin potentiell angreifbar. Deswegen gibt es auch Argumente, die gleich ganz gegen eine Erhöhung der Blockgröße sind und die Skalierbarkeit des Bitcoin-Netzwerkes über technische Ergänzungen wie das Lightning-Netzwerk oder Sidechains sicherstellen wollen, obwohl sich beide Konzepte noch in einem sehr frühen Stadium befinden und niemand sagen, kann, ob sie später überhaupt leisten können, was ihre Visionäre heute versprechen.\n\nGavin Andresen hat mit Bitcoin XT einen Lösungsvorschlag gemacht. (Foto: Web Summit / Flickr)\n\nDas macht es äußerst kompliziert. Denn es gibt zwar ein klares Problem, aber viele Interessen und noch mehr Lösungsvorschläge, als dass eine Lösung der Blocksize-Problematik greifbar erscheint. Vor allem, da es bei Bitcoin keine zentrale Institution gibt, die den Entscheidungsfindungsprozess zielführend moderieren könnte. Die Blocksize-Debatte tritt daher seit geraumer Zeit auf der Stelle und um diesem Stillstand entgegenzuwirken, haben Gavin Andresen und Mike Hearn, zwei der Kern-Entwickler von Bitcoin, die Initiative ergriffen und mit Bitcoin XT einen konkreten Lösungsvorschlag gemacht, wie das bisherige, Bitcoin Core genannte Protokoll, zukunftstauglich angepasst werden könnte.\n\nBitcoin XT vs. Bitcoin Core\n\nWichtig in diesem Zusammenhang ist zu wissen, dass es sich dabei vorerst nur um einen Vorschlag handelt und nicht, wie vielfach berichtet, bereits um eine Hardfork der Bitcoin-Blockchain. Denn nur wenn 75 Prozent des Bitcoin-Netzwerks auf Bitcoin XT umsteigen, wird der Patch aktiviert werden und das auch frühestens am 11. Januar 2016. Bitcoin XT hat bislang also vor allem zwei Funktionen: als Abstimmungstool Mehrheiten in der global verstreuten Bitcoin-Community organisieren und als provozierender Vorstoß die zerfahrene Blocksize-Debatte wieder auf den Weg zu bringen, an dessen Ende eine mehrheitsfähige Entscheidung steht.\n\nDer konstruktive Stich ins Wespennest\n\nAllerdings ist dieser Weg noch lang. Denn wie sich an den starken Reaktionen auf den Bitcoin XT-Vorstoß zeigt, ist auch das möglicherweise ein Vorschlag der niemals eine Mehrheit finden wird. Die Kritiker bemängeln lautstark, was an Bitcoin XT alles schlecht ist. Die Befürworter verteidigen hingegen engagiert den ersten konstruktiven Vorschlag, der immerhin eine bessere Option sei, als so lange nichts zu tun, bis die Blocksize-Problematik irgendwann unlösbar werde.\n\n„Es ist noch lange nichts entschieden“\n\nLive-Stresstests als demokratisches Prinzip\n\nEs ist also noch lange nichts entschieden und es ist nicht unwahrscheinlich, dass Bitcoin XT am Ende nicht die erforderliche Mehrheit finden wird, um in dieser Form umgesetzt zu werden. Nichtsdestotrotz kann es dennoch ein Erfolg sein. Denn was die provozierte Kampfabstimmung zwischen Bitcoin XT und Bitcoin Core in jedem Fall schon jetzt erreicht hat, ist, dass sie wie ein Siedesteinchen die gesamte Bitcoin-Community in Aufruhr versetzt und gezwungen hat, sich inhaltlich zu positioniert. Das ist schon viel. Denn es reduziert die bisher unüberschaubare Vielzahl von Lösungsmöglichkeiten und spitzt die Blocksize-Debatte auf konkrete Vorschläge zu, die eine wirkliche Chance haben eine Mehrheit zu finden und verhilft anderen guten Vorschlägen wieder zu mehr Rampenlicht.\n\nSollte Bitcoin XT also scheitern, könnte sein Vermächtnis die Grundlage für einen tragbaren Kompromiss sein. Doch bis zu diesem Kompromiss bleibt der Bitcoin-Kurs unter Druck und es stellt sich die grundsätzliche Frage, ob solcherlei Abstimmungs-Experimente, bei denen binnen sechs Wochen 30 Prozent des Bitcoin-Werts vernichtet werden, grundsätzlich ein praktikabler Weg sind? Bisher konnte Bitcoin immer einen Konsens finden. Das ist die große Stärke des Protokolls. Jetzt muss allerdings auch die Community zeigen, dass sie dazu auch in der Lage ist und zu welchem Preis.', 'CNN is jacking up its rates for advertising slots during the GOP debate that will air on the network September 16, according to Advertising Age.\n\nDonald Trump sent out a tweet on Saturday crediting himself for this boost in ad revenue and hinting again that CNN should make a hefty donation to charity.

The company is zealously also striving to raise $20 million via issuing 100 million new shares to the public at 20 cents each.\n\nAs per the plan, the company is hoping to start trading on the Australian Securities Exchange starting November 11, 2015.\n\nIt should be noted that it was Digital BTC, another Bitcoin company, that took the honor of being the first company to be trading on the local share market. This Bitcoin miner has been on the market since June of 2014.\n\nBitcoin Group claims that it at present produces about 1.57 percent of the total amount of Bitcoin in the world. The company operates Bitcoin mining equipment at six sites in China and Iceland and is now planning to invest $18 million of the funds raised from its market listing will into the Bitcoin mining equipment and facilities.\n\nThis clearly proves that despite all odds, the faith in the Bitcoin industry remains strong.\n\nEarlier we had reported that the Australian Securities and Exchange Commission (ASIC) has barred the Bitcoin Group from publishing any statements regarding the initial public offering (IPO) of its shares. The reasons for issuing this interim “stop order” however were not disclosed either on the ASIC or on the Bitcoin Group’s website.\n\nPrior to this, Bitcoin Group, according to the ASIC, was also caught distributing its IPO on social media channel “WeChat” before it registered itself as an Australian company, and before the submission of its formal disclosure document to the authorities.\n\nThe Bitcoin Group was founded in the year 2014 and it cites that its goal is “to make trust more accessible via Bitcoin’s underlying Blockchain technology.”\n\nThe company also proudly claims that within a year, “it has built a cash flow positive and profitable business which we’re listing on the ASX as a truly public company where the co-founders are sharing over 90% of the equity with the public upon completion of the offer.”', 'No place on the planet has welcomed digital currencies as warmly as the Isle of Man.\n\nThe Isle of Man is a strange place. Home to four-horned sheep, cats without tails, and perfectly preserved Victorian-era steam locomotives, this rock in the middle of the Irish Sea is perhaps best known for hosting the world’s most dangerous motorcycle race, the Manx TT.\n\nIt’s also a place where, after you take a 70-minute flight from London, a car service called The Lady Chauffeurs will meet you at the airport in a silver Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Imagine my surprise, then, when I’m greeted at arrivals by Keith, who, while courteous, impeccably dressed in a gray suit, and an able driver, is most decidedly not a lady. “All of our regular drivers are busy,” says an apologetic Nula Perren, who owns the company and has accompanied Keith to the airport. Not that I mind. I didn’t choose The Lady Chauffeurs for its ladies; I booked for the bitcoin.\n\nRolling hills meet the sea at the town of Peel, on the island’s western coast. Photographer: Will Sanders\n\nLady Chauffeurs is one of a growing number of businesses on the island that accept the digital currency. Bitcoin startups tend to cluster where the venture capital money is: London, New York, San Francisco. Taking on these behemoths might appear to be a stretch for a tiny British protectorate that can seem more time capsule than Tomorrowland. Yet the Manx government is indeed seeking to make the island the world’s foremost hub for the technology. Some 25 startups working with digital currencies or the blockchains that underpin them are already based here—and that number is growing steadily.\n\nAs our S-Class glides toward Douglas, the island’s capital, passing green hills speckled with sheep, Perren explains that her car service caters exactly to this crowd of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and bitcoin enthusiasts. Many of these newcomers (or “comeovers” as Manx natives term them) are young programmers and tech-savvy professionals from the U.S., Canada, and Brazil who first arrived for jobs in online gambling. During the past decade, some of the world’s biggest such companies have relocated here—including Rational Group, which owns the websites PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker—making the island as important to online poker as Las Vegas and Macau are to bricks-and-mortar casinos. Perhaps unwittingly, they’ve also played midwife to the island’s cryptocurrency community. Although most online gaming companies won’t accept bitcoins, the digital currency is popular among the island’s tech set, and some devotees have traded their jobs for startups dedicated to digital currencies.\n\nBitcoin Island: Cryptocurrency on the Isle of Man\n\nNick Williamson, a toussle-haired American who dropped out of Illinois Institute of Technology to play professional poker, is one of them. In 2011, PokerStars lured Williamson here with a job managing its nontournament cash games. “As long as you can find a chance to get off the rock from time to time so you don’t get cabin fever, it’s great,” says the 29-year-old Midwesterner. His lapel pin implies even more enthusiasm for his adopted home; it’s the Isle of Man’s triskelion, a vaguely creepy heraldic symbol of three disembodied, armored legs.\n\nWhile the island is better known for its steam locomotives, the Manx Electric Railway also operates a 17-mile line from Douglas to Ramsey. Photographer: Will Sanders\n\nWilliamson became interested in bitcoin for its potential to revolutionize online poker, perhaps one day eliminating the need for a neutral party to administer the game and verify players’ stakes. After moving to the island and messing around with the bitcoin source code in his spare time, he started writing his own blockchain protocol. In November 2014, he left PokerStars to focus on Pythia, a Manx startup he founded that provides off-the-shelf software customers can use to create and run their own customized blockchains.\n\nTo prove the feasibility of Pythia’s protocol, Williamson found an unusual partner: the Isle of Man’s government. The government is creating a register of the island’s cryptocurrency companies—and, as a pilot project, that register will itself be stored on a blockchain created using Pythia’s protocol. This will make the Isle of Man the first government anywhere to use a blockchain to store official data, Williamson says.\n\n“It just demonstrates our bona fides,” Brian Donegan, an official who helps spearhead the island’s pitch to cryptocurrency businesses for the Department of Economic Development, says of the blockchain pilot. “But it also signals that we have a balance between the importance of regulation and being open for business.”\n\nThe way Donegan sees it, while the U.K. dithered next door, publishing hand-wringing white papers about how to approach bitcoin, the Manx government plowed ahead. In less than a year, it created a regulatory framework and passed legal changes through the Isle of Man’s parliament, the Tynwald, which dates back more than 1,000 years and claims to be the world’s oldest continuously operating legislature.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges must now abide by the island’s anti-moneylaundering and know-your-customer requirements, with the Isle of Man’s financial regulator enforcing compliance. “To keep crime out and protect the consumer is our absolute priority,” Donegan says.\n\nEric Hollreiser, communications director of Rational Group, says he sees parallels between the government’s creation of a regulatory regime for online gaming a decade ago, which helped legitimize the entire sector, and what’s happening today with bitcoin, which also has a Wild West reputation. “That was the tipping point in our decision to locate here,” the Los Angeles expat says of the e-gaming regulations.\n\nE-commerce already accounts for more than 20 percent of the Isle of Man’s £4 billion annual gross domestic product.\n\nThere’s more for fintech entrepreneurs to like about the Isle of Man than its regulatory regime. The three fiber-optic rings that connect the island to Ireland and the U.K. provide unusually powerful bandwidth. Electricity is plentiful and reliable—as are the island’s ultrasecure, resilient data centers. And then there’s the island’s tax structure: no corporate tax; no capital gains or dividend taxes; and low rates of personal taxation, topping off at 20 percent, less than half the highest rate in the U.K.\n\nSt Mary’s Isle in Douglas Bay, which once offered refuge to shipwrecked sailors. Photographer: Will Sanders\n\nThe Isle of Man’s swift acceptance of digital currencies comes at a time when the protectorate is under increased scrutiny from the U.K. and other governments for its status as an offshore tax haven. The island—which has enjoyed three decades of continuous economic expansion and has a history of embracing emerging technological innovations, such as satellites and cellular service—is also seeking to further diversify its economy, and e-commerce (which includes online gaming) already accounts for more than 20 percent of the Isle of Man’s £4 billion ($6.2 billion) annual gross domestic product. (Financial services account for about 35 percent of GDP, while other professional services—including law and accounting—make up about 20 percent.) The Manx government wants to avoid the fate of Jersey, another British protectorate and offshore financial center, which faces a potential £125 million budget shortfall by 2019, in part because the U.K. has cracked down on tax avoidance strategies that rely on offshore funds.\n\nA customer pays for coffee with bitcoins at Java Express. Photographer: Will Sanders\n\nBut doesn’t regulation undermine the whole point of bitcoin, which was founded on the libertarian promise of unshackling money from government oversight? It’s a question Charlie Woolnough hears often. The Manx native helped set up CoinCorner, a bitcoin exchange, on the island in 2014 as well as the Manx Digital Currency Association, which represents the island’s nascent cryptocurrency community in discussions with the government and regulator.\n\nWoolnough says submitting to “an intelligent regulatory regime” is the only way bitcoin will gain widespread acceptance. “Otherwise, bitcoin could become just the plaything of the dark Web,” he says, referring to the constellation of illicit Internet sites run by anonymous servers. A lanky 39-year old, Woolnough spent a decade working in the hedge fund industry in London before returning to the island in 2013 because he felt it offered his family a better quality of life. Since coming back, he’s become a bitcoin guru, educating many islanders about the cryptocurrency. Of the few Manx retailers that accept bitcoins, most have begun doing so after Woolnough helped connect them to CoinCorner.\n\nNot that the digital currency is exactly ubiquitous yet. My Lady Chauffeurs taxi ride; a couple of cappuccinos at Java Express, a Douglas cafe; and a few pints of Manx-brewed Okells at Douglas’s Thirsty Pigeon pub were the only things I managed to actually buy with bitcoin during three days on the island.\n\nAs Woolnough tucks in to a lunch of locally caught hake at The Little Fish Café, a forest of sailboat masts swaying in Douglas’s North Quay behind him, he says he hopes that bitcoin becoming a regulated industry on the isle will also unlock access to mainstream Western European banks. CoinCorner, like most European bitcoin exchanges and digital-wallet providers, has an account with a small Eastern European bank, which deters some customers and business partners who would prefer the added comfort of dealing with a bank whose brand they recognize and respect.\n\n“You have these debt crises going on; these things couldn’t happen if everyone used bitcoin.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency community congregates at The Thirsty Pigeon, where bitcoins buy pints. Photographer: Will Sanders\n\nThe new regulations divide the Isle of Man’s burgeoning bitcoin fraternity. “You can buy a Rolex or diamonds without going through an extensive know-your-customer process, and these things are much less traceable than bitcoin,” says Isle native Adrian Forbes. The founder of TGBEX, Forbes sells physical bitcoins or—rather, as his lawyer always reminds him to clarify, lest he be classified as a foreign exchange operator—“decorative, metal novelty tokens.” Each token is engraved with a bitcoin private key that enables a purchaser to transfer a set amount of the currency to a digital wallet. Forbes does the engraving himself in a tiny office decorated with CrypArt lithographs that incorporate QR codes for bitcoin digital wallets.\n\nA bitcoin true believer, he sees the digital currency as a step toward a better world: “It’s a global currency that can’t be manipulated by any government, can’t be devalued on a whim,” he says. “You have these debt crises going on; these things couldn’t happen if everyone used bitcoin.”\n\nForbes grew up on the Isle of Man but left to work in financial services in the U.K. and Ireland before returning in 2013. Being on such a small island has big benefits, he says. “You can meet people at the very top of government, they will listen to you, and you can get things done quickly,” he says.\n\nUnlike locals Forbes and Woolnough, Gareth Jenkins, a 35-year-old British programmer and computer game developer, first set foot on the Isle of Man in September 2014 for Crypto Valley Summit, an industry conference. He came to get exposure for his startup, EVA Plexus, which created a protocol for storing data on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nJenkins fell hard for the place; he went home to England, packed his bags, and moved here. “I like that Douglas is a small town that doesn’t feel like a small town,” he says from a perch in Noa Bake House, a hipster bakery, cafe, and flower shop near the town’s waterfront.\n\nHipster bakeries, locally brewed beer, ultrafast broadband—the Isle of Man has everything a bitcoin hub needs, plus some seriously strange charm.\n\nThis story appears in the October issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine.\n\nA car service called The Lady Chauffeurs accepts bitcoins, one of a few island businesses that do; Manx cats, a domestic breed that originated on the island, lack tails.

Photographer: Will Sanders', 'Travis Patron is a digital money researcher and author of The Bitcoin Revolution: An Internet of Money. Here he explains why bitcoin may facilitate a taxation environment subversive to national governments and argues that cryptocurrency is already taxed by default.\n\nAs the age of cryptocurrency comes into full force, it will facilitate a subversively viable taxation avoidance strategy for many of the technically savvy users of peer-to-peer cryptographic payment systems.\n\nIn doing so, cryptocurrency will act to erode the tax revenue base of national jurisdictions and, ultimately, reposition taxation as a voluntary, pay-for-performance function.\n\nIn this post, I\'d like to cover some of the benefits such a strategy will have for cryptocurrency investors, why our notion of taxation is ripe for disruption, and why cryptocurrency is already liable for taxation by default.\n\nAlthough investors have been lured by the siren song of tax havens for as long as governments have existed, none have existed with the legal and structural characteristics such as those found in cryptocurrency.\n\nBy operating behind a veil of cybersecrecy, it is reasonable to forecast the impracticality of systemic taxation on these types of financial assets from national jurisdictions. Individual enforcement of taxation is likewise impractical due to ideological backlash governments would receive for targeting individuals who avoid national taxation via information technologies.\n\nEven so, many jurisdictions have already declared digital currency transactions (something which occurs between consenting parties on a network which no one owns) to be taxable under current legal frameworks. Yet how can the state lay claim to the right to tax that which they do not issue and cannot control?\n\nRunning the numbers\n\nIt has been said that compounding interest is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. When we apply the black magic of compounding returns to the profit-maximizing actions of consumers, we see quite clearly why every user aware of the benefits of using cryptocurrency, even if only for the tax-savings, will opt to do so over traditional fiat money.\n\nThe allure of avoiding the clutches of national taxation is strong enough that any rational consumer will make cryptocurrency a portion of their financial portfolio given they have the sufficient technical understanding.\n\n""Each $5,000 of annual tax payments made over a 40-year period reduces your net worth by $2.2 million assuming a 10% annual return on your investments,"" reports James Dale Davidson in The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age, ""For high income earners in predatory tax regimes (such as the United States), you can expect to lose more of your money through cumulative taxation than you will ever earn.""\n\nAs I explained in the report Bitcoin May Become A Global Reserve Instrument, never before has there existed a tool that can preserve economic and informational assets with such a high degree of security combined with a near-zero marginal cost to the user.\n\nThis revolutionary capability of the bitcoin network does, and will continue to provide, a subversively lucrative tax super haven in direct correlation with its acceptance on a worldwide basis.\n\nGovernment response\n\nMany government agencies have already cued in to the tax avoidance potential of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. However, it would seem they misjudge this emerging threat looming over their precious tax coffers.\n\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in the United States (FINCEN) for example, issued guidance in 2013 on cryptocurrency taxation, yet makes a false distinction between real currency and virtual currency.\n\nFINCEN states: ""In contrast to real currency, \'virtual\' currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency.""\n\nIt continues: ""Virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.""\n\nWhat these agencies fail to realize is cryptocurrency is not virtual in any sense of the word. Indeed it is as real, and perhaps even more real, than traditional fleeting fiat currencies.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency offer a near-perfect alternative to traditional tax havens which are being tightly controlled by the new laws associated with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).\n\nIn his report Are Cryptocurrencies Super Tax Havens?, Omri Marian makes clear the pressure for financial institutions who interact with the US banking system to hand over account holders, and for a crackdown on offshore tax havens with the enactment of FATCA in 2010. He states:\n\n""Tax policymakers seem to be operating under the faulty assumption that cryptocurrency-based economies are limited by the size of virtual economies. The only virtual aspect of cryptocurrencies, however, is their form. Their operation happens within real economies, and as such their growth potential is, at least theoretically, infinite. Such potential, together with recent developments in cryptocurrencies markets, should alert policy-makers to the urgency of the emerging problem.""\n\nCurrent payment processors such as BitPay have recently revealed that government agencies are watching cryptocurrency transactions through the bottlenecks and exchanges where it can be tracked and traced with a high degree of transparency.\n\nIt should not come as a surprise that governments are watching cryptocurrency, nor that companies are complying with their laws, but understanding why national governments require users of the bitcoin digital economy to cut them a slice of the pie while they contribute nothing to the operation, and in many cases, hinder the adoption of this technology, remains an utter mystery.\n\nOld laws seldom resist the trends of technology. The attempt of government agencies to levy taxation on cryptocurrency transactions directly is as futile as sweeping back waves of the ocean. No matter the size of broom, state actors will be overrun by continuously expanding waves of cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nInterestingly, the same happened with the fax a few decades ago, as James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg explain in The Sovereign Individual:\n\n""In the 1980s, it was illegal in the United States to send a fax message. The US Post Office considered faxes to be first-class mail, over which the US Post Office claimed an ancient monopoly ... billions of fax messages later, it is unclear whether anyone ever complied with that law.""\n\nCryptocurrency taxation by default\n\nEvery transaction you send with bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is taxed by default.\n\nIn the realm of digital currency, the taxation represents the transaction fee which the user decides to (or decides not to) attach to each payment.\n\nThis user can decide to attach a large fee or no fee at all. In doing so, the miners of the network will choose preference for the transactions with a larger fee attached, and will work to confirm these payments sooner than those with smaller fees.\n\nThis transactions queue represents a voluntary, pay-for-performance taxation structure where the performance derived from the system is dependent upon how much taxation they pay.\n\nWhen we come to understand the systemic resilience to judicial intervention, it becomes quite clear that cryptocurrency taxation will remain a voluntary, pay-for-performance function of the network itself.\n\nNo longer will taxation be enforced through coercion, but become a voluntary act towards increased system performance.\n\nMake no mistake, in a crypto-anarchist jurisdiction where there is no means to confiscate or control property on behalf of another individual, the need for the state will cease to exist.\n\nMass taxation on digital currency is not feasible through judicial enforcement while individual enforcement is bound to prove ineffective. You, or anyone motivated to retain their net worth, will find a subversively lucrative tax haven in the realm of cryptocurrency.\n\nNB: This article should not be construed as encouragement to not pay your taxes.\n\nTax image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Pretty much throughout the entire week we saw markets range up and down between predefined parameters, without really breaking out in any direction. However, over the weekend, we finally saw some action worth noting. Price looks to have made a medium-term recovery, and – with any luck – we can see a continuation of this recovery throughout today’s European session and beyond. So, with this said, what are the levels we are keeping an eye on in the bitcoin price today, and where will we look to get in and out of the markets according to our strategy? Take a quick look at the chart.\n\nAs you see, early-morning action on Sunday brought us to trade around midday highs of 244.19. From this level, we have since corrected slightly, and reached intraday lows of 238.4 for earlier this morning. These are the two levels that we will be keeping an eye on as we head into today’s session.\n\nWe will initially look for a break above 244.19 put us long towards a medium-term upside target of 250 flat. Quite a lot of room to the upside here, so stop loss somewhere around 242.00 is warranted. Looking the other way, a break below 238.4 full short towards 233.88 to the downside. Hopefully the overarching bullish momentum will carry through, however, and we want you to get in and out of the trade. An alternate range bound trade is available for those looking for a little more action – long a bounce from support at 238.4 forward a target of 244.19. Conversely, short on a correction from resistance towards a downside target of support at 238.44. Either of these trade, a stop loss just the other side of the key levels in question should keep things attractive from a risk management perspective.\n\nCharts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Nevertheless, that attitude seems to be changing and currently many known Banks and other financial institutions are exploring and researching the potential of blockchain technology.\n\nBankinter was the first bank to openly fund a bitcoin company, followed by UBS and BBVA who revealed to be researching the blockchain technology. Other Financial Institutions are researching blockchain technology to develop new apps while Citi’s Innovation Labs, is already testing its own cryptocurrency, Citicoin.\n\nToday, the remittances market represents a $582bn sector waiting to be disrupted by bitcoin. Now the multinational investment bank AXA, who is also a leading insurance brand, is looking to use bitcoin to cut ongoing expenses from the remittance market.\n\nOne of the general partners of its VC fund revealed that the Multinational Investment Bank is extremely interested in using bitcoin to cut expenses with international remittances.\n\nAn inside source revealed:\n\n“we are very interested in how bitcoin, and more generally cryptocurrencies, might be used in the remittance market.”\n\nEven though these rumors have been confirmed, so far we haven’t seen any bitcoin or blockchain startups being funded by AXA funding, but it looks like the Bank is already in negotiations with several remittances companies.\n\nIt seems that AXA is looking at digital currency as an investment hypothesis. If this is going to be done the Bank will use AXA Strategic Ventures, the bank’s $223m fund, and its accelerator, AXA Factory to lead the way.\n\nAside from bitcoin’s use in the remittance market, AXA is said to be researching other potential uses for blockchain technology in fields such as insurance, real estate, wealth management and intellectual property. Curiously, AXA today announced the creation of Kamet, a €100m InsurTech incubator dedicated to conceptualizing, launching and accompanying disruptive products and services for insurance clients.\n\nThis comes as excellent news for bitcoin enthusiasts since it is the first time in bitcoin’s history that a large Bank is openly interested in bitcoin the currency rather than wanting to use the bitcoin technology. Let’s hope this can open the way for more Banks and financial institutions start using bitcoin.\n\nSource & Image', 'Chosun, the largest and most popular online news publisher in South Korea has reported that law enforcement is about to begin investigations on altcoin pump-and-dump and bitcoin Ponzi schemes.\n\nThe Bank of Korea will support local law enforcement and agencies with the investigation and will provide the necessary infrastructure and technology to search for scam bitcoin projects and programs.\n\nThe joint investigation will also focus on the trading of altcoins that have no value, or are suspected of being a pump-and-dump scheme.\n\n“According to our sources, there are 676 altcoins, including bitcoin, listed on coinmarketcap.com.

Furthermore, there are 550 altcoins that have extremely low daily trading volumes,” said the article.\n\nThe Bank of Korea and the local police already have started looking into several different altcoins that have been used over the last few months and are discussing with local enforcement whether to launch a full investigation on these altcoins and on the individuals or organizations that have been promoting the use and trading of altcoins that have recorded substantially low daily trading volumes over the past 48 hours.', 'As those in the finance industry are just now starting to realize, Bitcoin and its associated technology can be a boon to faster, more efficient business. Yet, there are plenty of other global industries that could use a technological upgrade, like global shipping. Industry leader UPS executive Rimas Kapeskas apparently sees the forest through the trees in a recent corporate blog about UPS, Bitcoin, and the future of the shipping industry.\n\nUPS Exec sees Bitcoin bringing the world closer together\n\nRimas Kapeskas is the Managing Director of the UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund and his post on the UPS Corporate blog site “Longitudes” focused on how the company can improve through new technologies. He clearly sees the limitations of rather ancient technologies like credit cards that create issues with account settlements that can take days and currency exchange rates that increase costs and waste time. Bitcoin would certainly be a quantum leap above such problems.\n\nA virtual currency like Bitcoin could open up an array of new markets: t.co/HY9jIRSJwb pic.twitter.com/AvgR0tI1ut — UPS Longitudes (@UPSLongitudes) September 5, 2015\n\nKapeskas astutely points out that other industries are moving into the digital currency space. The world’s largest financial corporations like Barclays, Citigroup, NASDAQ and IBM have made inroads as well as over 100,000 mainstream retailers like Microsoft, Dell, and Expedia. He sees an opportunity for UPS to grow faster and stronger with this cutting-edge technology.\n\nKapeskas:\n\n“From our vantage point, the driving force globally is that all companies and consumers can easily do business with one another. In other words, it doesn’t matter where those goods are coming from – UPS can provide the transportation solutions to ensure speedy delivery. We just need the technical and regulatory advances that will allow global financial transactions to happen.”\n\nThe blog also comes across as a history lesson for other UPS execs, going over the advances made by the M-Pesa in Kenya, and even linking to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin white paper. Bitcoin has certainly made a positive impression upon many global executives who take the time to learn the broad strokes of it, and Kapeskas is no different. He seems ready to welcome a future that has Bitcoin as a global system of exchange that can bridge businesses and people of all nations together.\n\n“Virtual currency seems like a logical next step, one that could bring markets closer together and facilitate faster trade,” writes Kapeskas. “Usually, the advances that stand the test of time are the ones that most effectively eliminate barriers and make commerce easier – perhaps that’s why global trade is so ready for a global exchange system that enables seamless transactions.”', 'The payment world has evolved from cash transactions into a cashless ecosystem, as customers want to check out and pay for their goods with as little friction as possible. Contactless payments are on the rise in various countries, and in the United Kingdom, the average contactless payment transaction limit has been increased by 50%. Regardless of this change, additional infrastructure is required for merchants who want to make use of this system.\n\nAlso read: Hackers Steal Record Number of Apple Accounts with IOS Malware\n\nNot all Payment Terminals Support the new Limit Automatically\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, card payment terminals are a very common sight, as less consumers use cash payments year over year. From a convenience point of view, card payments seem to make a lot of sense, but they could be improved by not having to show your card to a cashier. As a result, contactless card payments were born and have become a major trend in the UK.\n\nRaising the transaction limit from 20 GBP to 30 GBP was a much-requested feature, with the average supermarket purchase coming in at GBP25. By keeping the limit below that threshold, customers were forced to resort to “standard” card payments. The new limit has gone into effect immediately, and should be available at most retail locations right now.\n\n\n\nHowever, that all depends on the software installed on the payment terminal at a location. According to The UK Cards Association, some payment terminals might not be updated to support the new limit, and the required over-the-air update could take up to a few weeks to be put in place. Needless to say, this delay will be a cause for much chagrin and frustration, for both customers and merchants alike.\n\nIt has taken a while for the contactless payment limit to be raised to 30 GBP, especially considering how the proposal was announced back in February of 2015. After a major spike in contactless payments — some of which can be attributed to Apple Pay and Barclays’ bPay service — the change was finally made a few days ago.\n\nOne of the main concerns regarding contactless payment was whether or not instances of fraud numbers would increase. Up until this point, fraud cases have been “extremely infrequent,” accounting for one penny per every 100 GBP spent. The UKCA seems confident this number will remain this low for the foreseeable future.\n\nCostless Bitcoin Payments a More Viable Alternative\n\n\n\nContactless payments are not a new technology; Bitcoin has been providing this functionality for quite some time. Whenever a Bitcoin user wants to make a payment, either in-store or online, there are no payment details to deal with. By scanning an automatically generated QR code, users can use the camera on a mobile device to complete their transactions.\n\nSome mobile Bitcoin wallet providers, such as AirBitz, integrated NFC and Bluetooth payment capabilities several months ago. The best part about accepting Bitcoin payments as a merchant is that no additional infrastructure is needed. Furthermore, Bitcoin transactions invoke minor transaction fees, and funds can be converted to fiat currency and deposited into a bank account the next business day.\n\nTo this very day, the number of retailers accepting Bitcoin payments remains fairly low. More educational efforts are needed to show consumers why Bitcoin is a viable alternative compared to card(less) payments. But one thing’s for sure: payment technology is evolving at an accelerated pace, and cash transactions will become obsolete sooner rather than later.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on raising the contactless transaction limit? Do you use this type of payment, and if so, what are your experiences so far? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nSource: Wired UK\n\nImages courtesy of Mint Payments, Expertmarket, Shutterstock\n\nOriginally posted on: Contactless Payment Limit Increased in UK, Bitcoin a Viable Alternative', 'After a lot of pressure from the developer community, Safaricom has announced it will be releasing the MPESA API.\n\nThe MPESA API platform comes as a result of a recent upgrade that Safaricom conducted on its MPESA platform. The old system, which the company described as G1, could only handle payments through what is known as Instant Payment Notification or IPN. To enable IPN the system had to create a number of workarounds to automate the payments. However, with the new system known as G2, they have solved this issue.\n\nG2 does much more. As the use of MPESA has grown, so has the potential uses for the technology, such that no serious institution in Kenya can do business without integrating MPESA into their customer relationship model. Due to the growth it is now necessary to enable MPESA handle B2C, C2B and B2B transactions. This will now be possible through the MPESA API.\n\nSome of the possibilities that the MPESA API now promises include automated payment receipt processing which will be very useful for utility bills, mobile, and e-commerce. The system comes with better security and validation that did not exist in the previous system.\n\nAnother ability is automating the payment of disbursements. This would work in business to consumer transactions. The MPESA API enables developers seamlessly integrate different aspects of the payment process, and lastly the API will also enable reversals much more smoothly, in a case where, for example a customer pays for goods and services that are no longer offered by a merchant.\n\nPossibilities to Integrate Bitcoin\n\nClearly, the release of the MPESA API presents clear opportunities for merchants and developers, and the possibility of integrating mobile payments into the block chain. While we can only dream up the kind of innovations that the MPESA API will spawn, its release to the public is now a clear sign that MPESA has come of age and is ready to go global.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Ethereum took its first steps towards simplifying its user experience this week with the release of an EthereumWallet beta, a RushWallet version for the Bitcoin 2.0 platform. CoinTelegraph decided to take a look at the 3 wallets that are aiming to end the era of command line and complex usability for Ethereum users.\n\nCoinTelegraph has previoualy covered the disruptive potential of Bitcoin 2.0 platforms like Ethereum. However, before we can create the decentralized applications and organizations, we must first make these tools easy to use. And while Ethereum holds a lot of promise, most would admit that it’s not quite ready for the lay consumer.\n\n\n\nHence, the following three organizations are actively working so that everyone including grandma can start using Ethereum.\n\nEthereumwallet.com by KryptoKit\n\nCEO of KryptoKit and Ethereum Co-Founder Anthony Di iorio, released Ethereumwallet.com on September 4, which functions as a cross platform client-side web wallet.\n\n\n\nSimilar to RushWallet for Bitcoin, EthereumWallet beta allows the creation of wallets based on a URL book marking system. You can, of course, send and receive Ether and encrypt your private key at creation.\n\n\n\nAmong the current features the wallet supports include:\n\nCreate wallets, send and receive Ether;\n\nClient side wallet creation and transaction signing. (keys are never sent to external servers);\n\nCode is completely auditable through “View Page Source”;\n\nWallets can be created off-line by downloading the web wallet (Ctrl + S).\n\nNo username or log in information required, based on bookmark client side links.\n\nSome of the upcoming features yet to be released include:\n\nExport wallets;\n\nQR code support with android apps;\n\nCross platform support through soon to be released KryptoKit, iOS, and Android wallets.\n\nFor more details, see Ethereum team’s reddit post.\n\nEthereumWallet.org by Allen Dunkley\n\nDeveloper Allen Dunkley told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Around half a year ago we found out about Ethereum and were fascinated. Recently they decided to release the wallet to the public. And we were a bit scared off from the complexity the console wallet was tied to. So we decided to build a secure web wallet (for us) so we could handle our ETH transactions with ease.”\n\nThe wallet can perform a variety of basic functions like wallet creation, sending and receiving, all client side and open source.\n\nUnlike KyptoKit's ether wallet, Dunkley has expressed an active interest and development in supporting Ethereum's second generation features with an easy to use interface.\n\n\n\n“Our plans for the future (and this is what we are currently working on) is the interaction with Smart Contracts,” he explains. “This means not only the creation of a smart contract but also the interaction with present ones. Here we plan that (based on the type of the contract) a web [graphic user interface] is automatically generated so that users may view all stored data as well as call contract functions with ease.”\n\nDunkley adds:\n\n“We really hope that the community joins the project: more manpower means more results. Everyone is invited to fork the code and suggest improvements.”\n\nAmong the most noticeable features of Dunkley's EthereumWallet are:\n\nOpen source. Developers are encouraged to fork code and collaborate;\n\nClient side wallet creation and transaction signing;\n\nWallets can be created off-line by downloading the web wallet (Ctrl + S);\n\nEncrypted version of wallet stored on server with Google Authenticator 2FA;\n\nPass phrase seed backup.\n\nMyEtherWallet\n\nLast but not least it Myetherwallet.

ShapeShift is an exchange that allows users to transfer Bitcoin for dozens of other cryptocurrencies without any accounts or personal information being shared.\n\nBarry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group and Roger Ver were the lead investors in this round. Bitfinex, Bitcoin Capital led by Max Keiser and Simon Dixon, Mardal Investments, Bruce Fenton, Trevor Koverko, and Michael Terpin also invested in the funding round.\n\n“ShapeShift demonstrated an entirely new way to think about asset exchange,” said Zane Tackett, Director of Community and Product Development at Bitfinex, in a statement. “We’ve known Erik for a while now and he’s knocked it out of the park with this one.”\n\nAccording to the company, the exchange has experienced 100x growth since its launch in August 2014. In July, it had over $2 million in USD-equivalent volume, which was a record for the company.\n\nWhat makes ShapeShift unique is that exchanges are instantaneous and require no personal information. Further, ShapeShift doesn’t actually hold any of the currencies; it simply facilitates the trade from one coin to the other. At present, there are over 40 different digital currencies. This means that ShapeShift offers over 940 different trading pairs. That is greater than any single exchange on the market.\n\nHowever, one type of currency cannot be traded. ShapeShift has a strict “no fiat” policy, which means that if a user wanted to buy bitcoin with US dollars, they’d be unable to. Instead, the user would have to first buy it from another company and then they could trade on the ShapeShift exchange.', 'The original online payment platform, PayPal, has decided to leave the populous island of Puerto Rico next month. The commonwealth has imposed a 2 percent take on any money transmission, forcing Paypal’s hand. So what does this mean for those who need to send money from Puerto Rico?\n\nPuerto Rico Begins Capital Controls\n\nWhen a country’s economy or currency is struggling or on the brink of collapse, the citizens start to move money out of the nation to protect their savings from the devaluation. Nine times out of ten, the economic downturn is caused by poor governance and economic policy, not the citizens. Therefore, the people would rather invest their money in appreciating assets, not poor leadership and economic decline.\n\nGreece, Argentina, the United States (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA) and now Puerto Rico have recently used legislation to force capital controls on citizens, or even people living and working overseas.\n\nPuerto Rico passed a law, originating from House Bill 2191 last December, wherein all peer-to-peer transactions are now taxable at a 2% rate. PayPal had the following response:\n\n“Due to new government policies in Puerto Rico, we have made the difficult decision to no longer offer our person-to-person payment service to our Puerto Rican customers as of November 1, 2015. Our customers in Puerto Rico will no longer be able send money to friends and family abroad with Venmo or PayPal, but will be able to continue to use PayPal to pay for goods and services and receive payments. We regret any inconvenience this may cause our valued customers in Puerto Rico.”\n\nThe fact that this only affects outbound peer-to-peer monetary transfers demonstrates the true intent of this law to extract “additional sources of income” from Puerto Rican citizens. Here is the direct quote of intent from the legislation itself:\n\n“This Legislative Assembly deems it necessary to establish recurring sources of income by imposing special charges on certain transactions carried outside and inside the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico. […] it is in the public interest to impose charges on transactions originated in the local jurisdiction involving assets that no longer circulate in the local economy (bold type)[…].”\n\nThe bitcoin alternative\n\nWhere does bitcoin fall into this? It would make a perfect substitute for Paypal, as many in the West feel it is destined to replace PayPal in years to come. Not only would it work in a faster and more secure fashion completing within 10-60 minutes instead of 1-7 days, but it would be fairly difficult for these cryptographic funds to be taxed by government. Maybe the world’s most technologically advanced nation, the United States, could actually watch every transaction, and figure out where it came from and from whom, but Puerto Rico?\n\nIn reality, taxing each bitcoin transaction would be quite a feat to accomplish for any government, regardless of where you are. Every time a government makes an economic mistake, and imposes a new tax to cover for it can force the citizens to make economic countermeasures against such impositions.\n\nPayPal will end its service for Puerto Ricans moving money off of the island on October 30, 2015.', 'Bitcoin is being hailed as a technology which has the ability to improve archaic payment systems and stimulate innovation using smart contracts.

The course will be taught by Dr. Dan Boneh, and is available to students enrolled in the university’s Cyber Security Graduate Certificate.\n\nOther universities are also offering course on bitcoin and the blockchain, including MIT, Duke University, Stern Business School at New York University, Princeton University, the University of Maryland, the University of Nicosia, and Coursera.\n\nNYU Stern are yet to announce whether they will repeat a course they ran last year, ‘The Law and Business of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies.’ They will, however, be conducting a two day course ‘Digital Currency: Revolution in Money and Payments,’ which will cost US$3,600. Stanford’s ten week course costs US$3,960, Princeton’s seven week ‘Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies’ course can be accessed for free via Coursera.\n\n“This course introduces participants to digital currencies and emerging mobile payment systems. Based on new applications of information technology, these virtual currencies attempt to remove money and banking from the control of sovereign governments, and they represent one of the most disruptive innovations ever in consumer finance. The underlying distributed ledger technology has many other potential applications in diverse areas such as property registration, accounting and auditing, gambling and financial derivatives.” - NYU Stern\n\nIt isn’t just the Universities that are tackling blockchain technology. Pavel Kravchenko has been touring Europe, sharing his knowledge by giving free lectures and creating courses.\n\n- Kravchenko\n\nKravchenko has experience in information security, including cryptography and public key infrastructures. He also has a Radioelectronics PhD from Kharkiv National University. “I am passionate about the idea of cryptocurrency and its applications to real world (smart contracts, digital law etc) so I decided to share as much information as I can,” said Kravchenko.\n\n- Kravchenko\n\nKravchenko’s topics include the blockchain, mining, proof of work, multisignature, ledger based systems, smart contracts, anonymity principles and cryptographic mechanisms. “So basically in the lectures I answer all the questions about the industry in a logical sequence,” said Kravchenko. “I am trying to answer all possible questions people can have, going from general info of what Bitcoin is, to how it works, and why it works like this.”\n\nThe offline lectures, which Kravchenko has taught in the past, have attracted a diverse audience, consisting of students, lawyers, economists, bankers and entrepreneurs. While his average class size is 20 people, the first lectures were attended by more than 80.\n\nFive universities have shown an interest in Kravchenko’s course. Two preliminary agreements are in place with universities, in Helsinki and Lichtenstein. He believes it is increasingly important for universities to provide educational opportunities in the bitcoin space, “Education itself plays many roles. It spreads knowledge, motivates people for further learning and achievements and improves soft skills.”\n\n- Kravchenko\n\nKravchenko is also building a research lab in Kharkiv, Ukraine. He already has six students working full time and another three as part time researchers. “The interesting thing is that old students are sharing knowledge with young that brings network effect - from September one of them will conduct full course in a local college.”', 'The UK government might be the next entity that starts using the Bitcoin blockchain for non-monetary purposes. Every day we see more news that makes us think, “Man… How many things can the blockchain do? What all is it good for?” With what appears to be constantly-growing capabilities, it’s no wonder the budding technology has so many advocates.\n\nAlso read: How the Blockchain may be the Future of Wall Street\n\nSeveral businesses orient themselves around blockchain technology and swear by its safety, calling it the most secure platform in existence. In 2014, Business Insider released an article listing the top ten most promising blockchain businesses making headway through the digital currency realms, and it’s hard to disagree at first glance. Number three on the list is San Francisco-based Kraken, who earlier this year announced it would accept the bankruptcy claims of defunct exchange Mt. Gox, take over its fallen accounts, and offer free trade credits to former users.\n\nBI also placed Coinbase and BitPay on the list. Coinbase is arguably the largest platform for customers to buy and sell bitcoin. The company is now expanding into Canada and Singapore. On the other hand, the majority of businesses accepting bitcoin do so through the aid of BitPay. Thus, it’s probably safe to say that these two financial entities deserved their spots on BI’s list.\n\nYoung and old, many out there swear by the blockchain and attest to what it can do. Now, is it possible that maybe the UK government itself is looking into the blockchain for record-keeping purposes?\n\nThe Government Digital Service, a branch of the UK Cabinet Office, explains in a blog post that it is currently exploring the blockchain and its potential use in managing, formatting, and ultimately improving the government’s multiple registers used in the organization of pertinent records. At this time, no solid decisions have been made, and the blog makes it clear that blockchain usage is merely being “examined.” Paul Downey, a technical architect, and a “doodling hacker living in Berkhamsted, England,” as his website states, mentioned:\n\n“Technically we are aware of how protocols such as the blockchain demonstrate how proofs could be distributed, and certificate transparency demonstrates how to use distributed copies to highlight where a canonical source of truth has been tampered with, but these are only two of a number of different models for increasing the trust in integrity of record we’ve started to explore.”\n\nJudging by these words, it will likely be some time before anything is officially decided. However, the blog post clearly acknowledged that the blockchain can take on the task, and the posting has stimulated support from the cryptocurrency community in the UK. A spokesman for the UK Digital Currency Association, for example, applauded the government’s willingness to look into bitcoin technology for its needs, saying that there is “no better way” to deliver a public register than through the blockchain. The spokesman continued to say:\n\n“In the developing world, the blockchain is a necessity to regularize title and ownership, in the developed, it is all about efficiency and ease of access.”\n\nWill the government eventually give in and fully admit to the blockchain’s capabilities? Or will it turn away and look for other means?

It also believes that the digital currency can be used to help those whom the traditional financial sectors, such as banks, have so far not been able to reach.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is known as ‘Mining.’ It is a process by which the transaction records are added to the public ledger via computers solving algorithms. Mining is used while producing Bitcoin and it requires complete dedication as it demands full concentration of the pupil who wishes to learn about it. The initial investment in Mining can come to anything between a few dollars in a mining pool, to several thousand dollars for a physical miner.\n\nBesides this aspect, mining also needs continuous investment in computer hardware and electricity.\n\nThere is another way to achieve the same result and it can be attained at a lower cost and energy input and that method is known as ‘Proof-of-Stake.’ This method is less demanding on an individual however, there are some who feel that this method is not sturdy as it is not establishment-centric, but user oriented, with the amount of interest an individual receives being much higher.', 'Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast host Trace Mayer interviewed legendary cryptographer Adam Back on his role in the creation and deployment of some of the most potent privacy software to ever affect the world of Bitcoin. A transcript of the podcast is published in We Use Coins.\n\nTrace Mayer is an entrepreneur, investor, journalist, an expert on the Austrian School of economic thought of Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises, and a staunch defender of freedom of speech.\n\nAdam Back is the inventor of Hashcash, the proof-of-work system used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of the mining algorithm. “To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back’s Hashcash,” wrote Satoshi Nakamoto in the original Bitcoin white paper.\n\nBack is also one of the authors of the Bitcoin Sidechains white paper “Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains,” released in October, and one of the founders of Blockstream.\n\nBlockstream, which in November closed a $21 million seed-funding round with nearly 40 high-profile investors, develops open-source software to implement sidechains and accelerate developments in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nBlockstream recently announced Sidechain Elements, a sidechain development framework with open-source code and a developer sidechain for testing, featuring intriguing new possibilities such as confidential transactions. Blockstream also isworking on lightning networks, a somewhat-related concept that shows great potential for Bitcoin scalability.\n\n“We’re going to be having a full week with [Back] on the podcast discussing confidential transaction, sidechains and the lightning network along with some of his other innovations and thoughts on bitcoin and where it’s going,” Mayer announces at the end of the interview.\n\nIn fact, the conversation doesn’t go – yet – deep into ongoing technology development. Rather, it’s a recap of the history of cryptography and P2P technologies in the last couple of decades, and – especially – a thoughtful and passionate defense of the techno-libertarian ideas that are dear to both Mayer and Back. Today, with the original pro-privacy, anti-bureaucracy spirit of Bitcoin is threatened and cornered by governments, banks and sanitized “permissioned” blockchains, it’s refreshing to follow Mayer and Back – to the future.\n\nCryptography pioneers and “cypherpunks” such as Phil Zimmerman, David Chaum, Nick Szabo, Hal Finney, Wei Dai, Stefan Brands, and other affine spirits since the days of Alan Turing, wanted to make society better – by writing code. Phil Zimmerman’s PGP was one of the first cryptographic codes able to change society for the better.\n\n“[PGP was] a way for you to have privacy or anonymity via email,” says Back. “So it’s a simple piece of technology, but they have this kind of mantra cypherpunks write code, which is to say, you know, you can go lobby all you want but what ultimately changes the game is deployment of technology.”\n\nBack tells the story of Hashcash, PGP, David Chaum’s DigiCash and Stefan Brands’s electronic cash system, Bitcoin precursors such as Nick Szabo’s bit gold and Wei Dai’s B-Money, leading to Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper.\n\n“So they were a number of people in the cypherpunks list who were talking about designs, and some of them were anonymous because it’s cypherpunks, and they developed the remailers so they were kind of practicing their own technology,” said Back. “So there was some kind of jovial or joking comments from anonymous people that are actually insightful, technical, cryptographic protocol comments from anonymous people. And, of course, we don’t know who they were. Potentially some of them Satoshi, right?”\n\n“Unless you are Satoshi,” says Mayer at that point.\n\n“No comment on that,” replies Back. “Don’t like to speculate on who Satoshi might be. I think it’s probably a good thing that Satoshi is anonymous because you know there’s a lot of political pressure that could land on somebody who is seen to somehow have control and all sorts of things.”\n\nToward the end of the podcast, Back mentions privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies and recent developments in cryptography that could be applied to new version of Bitcoin, including Zerocoin, Zerocash, and zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs).\n\nIt’s interesting to speculate on the possibility to implement Zerocash as a sidechain interoperable with Bitcoin. Hopefully, Back will say more in the forthcoming podcasts.', 'For most of us, figuring out the value of something that we want, comes from research. If you want a new set of wine glasses, you check the price online. Perhaps you consult a catalog. If the set of 8 stemware goblets that you like are a current model from a major company, there are probably many places to buy them. If there are multiple Ebay sellers and many recently completed sales, then you can establish the value with precision.\n\nI’ve written a lot of Bitcoin articles on this Lifeboat Blog and elsewhere, so, let’s dig a bit deeper this time. Let’s talk about from where value really comes.\n\nSupply and Demand\n\nIn the end, an item’s value is a direct result of supply and demand. It’s no different with a currency. And let’s be clear: Despite a raging debate, Bitcoin is a currency and not just a payment instrument. How can I be certain? Try this mental exercise—\n\nWestern Union money orders and Amazon Gift cards are each trusted monetary instruments. They facilitate cash transactions. But are they currencies with inherent value? If so, there would be no need to denominate them in units of fiat currency.\n\nA money order is only worth something before it is redeemed. The gift card is only worth $500 when it is purchased or received as a gift. As the $500 is depleted, it becomes worthless. Eventually, it is just a piece of plastic. But like a dollar bill, a bitcoin can be circulated over and over. You may believe that its value comes from the government, but more realistically, its value arises from brand recognition and from pure supply and demand—not from a trusted redemption authority.\n\nBitcoin isn’t the first ethereal stash of bits with value. But it is more durable than others. The latest Pixar film on DVD or On Demand from your cable service provider has value. But piracy reduces the value dramatically. The supply is no longer scarce (no matter the demand) because of the ease and willingness to replicate digital files in any quantity. A Picasso painting is very rare, but it is so scarce, that we cannot gather enough data points to establish a stable value. Even worse, it’s not portable, divisible or fungible and it is nearly impossible to validate in the hands of the average person.\n\nBut, commodities like iPhones, Doritos tortilla chips—or even non-branded things, like Idaho potatoes, have a large and fluid market. These things have very measurable value and we can track the change in value over time.\n\nPeople like to think that money is different than other commodities. In practice, it differs only by its handling characteristics: Compared to a Picaso painting or a new iPhone 6, currency has these properties. It is:\n\nportable\n\nfungible\n\ndivisible\n\nwidely recognized\n\nresistant to forgery\n\nbacked by something tangible\n\nBitcoin has all of these characteristics. In fact, it surpasses your national currency in every way. But many people are confused about that last niggling detail… Aristotle called it “intrinsic value”. They worry that there is no gold—or at least the promise of a stable government—to establish and stand behind the value of a bitcoin unit (BTC). The concern is understandable, but it is wrong.\n\nRecall that value arises through supply and demand and not simply because of authority or promises. The real question is “Can we trust that the supply is limited and that the demand is durable?”. That is, will my coin be recognized, coveted and honored in the future?\n\nThe Case Against Bitcoin as a Currency\n\nHere are some frightening facts (frightening for some cryptocurrency enthusiasts and early adopters): Bitcoin is manufactured out of thin air. It lacks the underpinnings of a traditional currency. Referring to that last item on Arisotle’s list above, Bitcoin seems to fail the test of intrinsic value, because it lacks at least one of these properties:\n\nA fractional reserve requirement\n\nAn edict to remit taxes in Bitcoin\n\nA promise of a trusted authority\n\nAny claim of pegging it to the value to some essential commodity (intrinsic value)\n\nBitcoin doesn’t even offer a perception of uniqueness. The formula is open for anyone to copy. You could create a competing ‘Bob-coin’ tomorrow.\n\nIn the absence of at least one of these things, detractors claim that Bitcoin lacks a foundation—and so it is effectively worthless. But value does not come only from authority. It comes from trust and is goverend by supply and demand.\n\nIn fact, math may be a more trusted ‘authority’ than the directors of your national treasury and reserve board. Supply and demand leads to more tangible value than bankers, especially if the math leads you to believe that the demand will continue to outpace the supply. In fact, this is the primary reason that you are comfortable with a $20 bill in your pocket. You have a pretty good idea, that next week, it will still buy 2 movie tickets or 2 pizzas.\n\nBitcoin has achieved a “two-sided network effect” (Google the term and the economist “Marshall Van Alstyne”). It has captured the public imagination more than Picasso. It cannot be manufactured. With a reasonable understanding of wallets, it cannot be seized, stolen or lost.\n\nThe ability to mine new bitcoins is capped with a total supply of 21 million units, and so there is no opportunity for governments to inflate it through mismanagement of taxation or spending. They cannot even inflate it with good intent (for example, when they need to repair a bridge or provide for the poor). Instead, the ability to pay for these services (and all other government functions) forces them to live within a balanced budget. Spending cannot outpace the revenue generated by taxes and bonds. In a Bitcoin economy, the bonds will more likely be paid back by user fees rather than the future debt of unborn generations.* You get the point: Because governments no longer control the printing press, they cannot make hollow promises and then kick the problem into the next administration. With a limited money supply that everyone recognizes as money, governments are forced to live within their means.\n\nWhat About Uniqueness?\n\nThe last item in the list above decries Bitcoin’s lack of uniqueness. You cannot mint your own bitcoins of course—but you can create an equivalent bitcoin ecosystem yourself. If your name is Bob, you can call it Bobcoin. Many countries and organizations are already doing this.\n\nThis is really no different than the US Dollar or your own national currency. The government note is difficult to counterfeit, but so is your own signature when placed on a fancy printed currency (Let’s call it a Bob-Buck). The problem is that the dollar is widely recognized, trusted and accepted, but few people other than your kids are collecting Bob Bucks.\n\nYou would face the challenge of spurring adoption. Whether it’s Bob Bucks (paper) or Bobcoin (cryptocurrency), how will you get the world to covet, mine and trade your new currency? That’s the point of a two-sided network. It becomes increasingly more difficult after one method rises to the top—especially if that method is open, transparent and extensible. Bitcoin is open. It is subject to worldwide scrutiny. But this works both ways. Bitcoin can also add incremental improvements that are part of any pretender to the throne.\n\nBitcoin is not just a transient coin-du-jour. It evolves and so it will not die.\n\nHow Can the Value be Measured?\n\nI get this question a lot, and so I am adding the answer here. There is no need to measure the value of Bitcoin or define debt. Its value floats with supply and demand like a true world currency. Because the supply growth is capped and well understood, it is resistant to manipulation. As time goes by, it becomes far less likely to exhibit wild swings in value.\n\nA few years from now, if Bitcoin spikes or tanks by 10% in a short time, you will be more likely to wonder “What is affecting the dollar?” (or Euro), rather than “What is affecting Bitcoin”. Consumers will budget for the cost of a new car or refrigerator in BTC rather than dollars or Euros. You will even see catalogs that print prices in BTC and honor them for the life of the catalog or online sale. After all, in an international market, it makes sense to quote a price in units with no geopolitical boundaries, just as we quote time in UTC (formerly called GMT).\n\nAre these predictions crazy? They are not even bold. For us, here at Lifeboat Foundation, they are rather obvious. If we can be accused of dreaming, it is because we are ahead of the game. Look ahead, yourself. The signs are clear…\n\nIf Bitcoin has Value, What is the Value?\n\nAs Bitcoin adoption moves past enthusiasts and early adopters, the capped supply of coins (21 million, max) will be spread thinner and thinner. This doesn’t play out like a classic shortage, because unlike a supply squeeze on food or medicine, you can work with a smaller piece of the pie each year. The piece needed to pay for a car or an iPhone simply gets smaller as the unit price floats higher and higher.\n\nLast year, I set up an equation to predict how high Bitcoin will float in 5 or 10 years. It involved a lot of WAGs (wild *ss guesses). Although I am a pundit, I am not a mathematician, and so the attempt was incomplete. No need to rehash that exercise.\n\nAs Hysteria Withers, Bold Becomes Mundane\n\nEventually consumers, banks, brokers, and governments will recognize that Bitcoin is a far greater opportunity than it is a threat. It pulls the world together by decoupling currency controls from national agenda, inflation, manipulation and loss (You can back up your Bitcoin. Try doing that with your paper money or a defunct bank).\n\nPhilip Raymond is CEO and Co-Chair of CRYPSA,\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Standards Association.\n\n_____________\n\n* This is just one reason why an eventual transition to Bitcoin (as currency, and not just as a payment instrument) is in the national interest. It demonstrates to citizens that monetary policy is backed by more than growing debt, inflation or the promises of transient officials. It returns any government or economic entity to a non-inflationary, limited-supply pie. The pieces of pie can grow in value, but the pie cannot be watered down by printing more ingredients, counterfeit or even by enemy action.\n\nFurther Reading', 'Ed Moyse is fizzing with ideas. Still only 25, he already has a track record for creating business startups with a twist. Last year Moyse and his business partner, Harry Huang, won the Varsity Pitch award with Wyre, a mobile app that enables users to pay merchants using the internet currency bitcoin. But that wasn’t his first – or his last – eye-catching business idea.\n\nWhen Moyse and his friend Ross Harper graduated from Cambridge in 2011, neither could face what Moyse describes as the “conveyor belt of being shipped off from Cambridge into the City”. They thought it would be fun to instead create a business with no funding whatsoever that would bring in enough money to support them for a year. “We didn’t take a gap year before university, so we saw it as a chance to take one after university,” says Moyse.\n\nWinning press coverage\n\n\n\nThe business they came up with was BuyMyFace, which Moyse describes as “the craziest idea we could think of”. It entailed selling advertising space on their own faces for a year – each day, for a fee, they would paint a different brand logo on their faces and upload the picture to the BuyMyFace website, including a link to the brand’s website.\n\n\n\nMedia interest in the story was huge, and they attracted advertising spend from big names such as Paddy Power and Pipers Crisps. “We made enough to pay off our student debts and had a really fun year as well,” says Moyse. “The company paid for us to go travelling, skiing and skydiving – it was great.”\n\nSerial entrepreneur\n\n\n\nAt the end of the year, the pair decided to try a new venture. At the time, mobile games were “serious business” and by now they knew they were good at PR, so they set up a mobile game development company. This didn’t work out, however: “Things slowly went pear-shaped because neither of us could code anything, so we had to hire a whole development team to code it for us, and sadly it never got released.”\n\n\n\nMoyse moved back in with his parents and taught himself to code. He successfully launched some mobile games, made money and moved out again. It was then that he decided to work on a bigger project. He was interested in bitcoin, an electronic currency used for making payments on the internet, but difficult to use in the real world. Moyse got in touch with Harry Huang, a Cambridge friend working for Goldman Sachs as a software developer, and together they developed Wyre. Merchants who downloaded the app would be able to accept bitcoin payments from customers and their business would appear on a virtual map showing potential customers which businesses took bitcoin.\n\nFacing the competition\n\n\n\nAfter some early success, the pair entered Varsity Pitch, a competition run by the National Association of College & University Entrepreneurs (Nacue) inviting students and recent graduates to submit a video pitch for their business. Moyse says the experience of entering was valuable – he and Huang are still friends with some of the entrepreneurs they were pitted against – and both the publicity and the £10,000 prize money came in useful for developing the business further.\n\nMoyse thinks one of the reasons Wyre won was that their pitch put a strong focus on finance. They received good mentoring from BIPB, the sponsors for their category: “They told us the first draft of our financial plan was shockingly bad and we went back to the drawing board.”\n\nBut although Wyre was doing well, Moyse and Huang have put it aside – at least for the time being. While trying to find technology journalists interested in writing about the business, they hit on another idea.\n\n\n\nThey developed a software tool to search the TechCrunch news website to identify those journalists who wrote about bitcoin, and then added another 20 publications. Realising that the software would prove useful to small businesses or PR firms wanting to identify journalists interested in particular areas, they put the search engine, now called Hey Press, on to Product Hunt, a site for showcasing and sharing new products. The response was so good they developed it further. Now PR firms can take out an annual subscription to the service.\n\nHey Press was followed with JournoRequests. Journalists posting requests for experts or case studies on Twitter use the hashtag #journorequest, but it can be difficult for PR professionals to keep track of the requests, particularly as many are irrelevant. Moyse and Huang created a software script that delivers Twitter requests using the #journorequest hashtag to the PR professional’s inbox, filtering out requests of little interest. A PR firm interested only in business and finance alerts, only receives requests relating to those areas.\n\nJournoRequests has already developed a subscriber base in the UK, and Moyse sees opportunities to expand to the US. By the end of the year they expect to have a turnover of £40k – not bad for a business just a few months old.\n\nThe beauty of both Hey Press and JournoRequests is that very little infrastructure is required to support them – Moyse and Huang have turned down offers of investment. There is no fixed office: Moyse lives and works in Dorset, while Huang is based in China. Wyre, meanwhile, is on the backburner because of worries about the potential security issues relating to storing large sums in bitcoin – though Moyse thinks it’s possible they’ll revisit the idea in future.\n\nMeanwhile, they are delighted with the way their business is working out: “For the time being our focus has to be on Hey Press and JournoRequests. It’s working, it’s growing, loads of people are using it and we’re really happy with it.”\n\nThis year’s Nacue Varsity Pitch is now open for entries.

While an official in 1968 at a local bank in Washington State franchised by Bank of America to issue BankAmericard, Hock became chairman on a committee to create what would become Visa in 1976. Hock is open-minded and outspoken. He has even spoken favorably of the online digital currency Bitcoin.\n\n“Bitcoin is one of the best examples of how a decentralized, peer-to-peer organization can solve problems that these dated organizations cannot,” Hock once said. “[Bitcoin] presents incredible opportunities for new levels of efficiency and transparency in financial transactions.”\n\nIn a 1996 Fast Company article, many of Hock’s beliefs were made clear. He developed the concept of a chaordic system, fusing chaos and order, comparable to Prigogine’s dissipative structures theory.\n\n“We are at that very point in time when a 400-year-old age is dying and another is struggling to be born — a shifting of culture, science, society, and institutions enormously greater than the world has ever experienced,” Hock told Fast Company. “Ahead, the possibility of the regeneration of individuality, liberty, community, and ethics such as the world has never known, and a harmony with nature, with one another, and with the divine intelligence such as the world has never dreamed.”\n\nHock oversaw the creation of Visa, which resembles a distributed organization. The Fast Company article revisits one of Hock’s favorite things to do with a conference audience:\n\n“How many of you recognize this?” he asks, holding out his own Visa card.\n\nEvery hand in the room goes up.\n\n“Now,” Hock says, “how many of you can tell me who owns it, where it’s headquartered, how it’s governed, or where to buy shares?”\n\nConfused silence. No one has the slightest idea because no one has ever thought about it.\n\nHe never wanted Visa to be a traditional public-facing entity. “In Visa, we tried to create an invisible organization and keep it that way. It’s the results, not the structure or management that should be apparent,” Hock said.\n\nHock holds a distrust of authority. Before he worked at the Seattle bank where he would soon become chairman of the Hock Committee to oversee the development of Visa, he turned down three jobs in finance,\n\neach time raging that the hierarchical, rule-following, control-everything organizations were stifling creativity and initiative at the grassroots — and in the process, making the company too rigid to respond to new challenges and opportunities.\n\nCommand-and-control organizations, Hock says in the Fast Company article, “were not only archaic and increasingly irrelevant. They were becoming a public menace, antithetical to the human spirit and destructive of the biosphere. I was convinced we were on the brink of an epidemic of institutional failure.” The Visa bylaws he drafted encouraged member banks to innovate and even compete with Visa.\n\n“Members are free to create, price, market, and service their own products under the Visa name,” Hock said. “At the same time, in a narrow band of activity essential to the success of the whole, they engage in the most intense cooperation.” Hock saw himself as solving two problems faced at the organizational level: power and complexity.\n\n“It was beyond the power of reason to design an organization to deal with such complexity, and beyond the reach of the imagination to perceive all the conditions it would encounter,” he said. “The organization had to be based on biological concepts to evolve, in effect, to invent and organize itself.” He explained some of the inspirations behind the Visa model.\n\n“Visa has elements of Jeffersonian democracy, it has elements of the free market, of government franchising — almost every kind of organization you can think about,” the well-read leader once said. “But it’s none of them. Like the body, the brain, and the biosphere, it’s largely self-organizing.”\n\nIn may 1984, a 55-year-old Hock left Visa and disappeared. He later explained his thinking in his acceptance speech as a laureate of the Business Hall of Fame: “Through the years, I have greatly feared and sought to keep at bay the four beasts that inevitably devour their keeper — Ego, Envy, Avarice, and Ambition. In 1984, I severed all connections with business for a life of isolation and anonymity, convinced I was making a great bargain by trading money for time, position for liberty, and ego for contentment — that the beasts were securely caged.” An old partner and friend of Hock recalls his philosophy\n\n“He really means you to blow up the whole organization. He really wants you to dissolve the power relationships — everything,” according to MIT’s Peter Senge. Senge recalls the way in which Hock once addressed a room of CEOs. While explaining his ideas, the CEOs rejoiced, thinking they had found the secret to a functional organization.\n\n“Great! This is how to create a learning organization that can grow at 20% per year! He’s found the keys to the kingdom!,” the CEOS thought. Until Hock finished, that was. There was one problem for the CEOs in Hock’s model.\n\nYou’ll never be able to justify paying a CEO $1 million a year to run this kind of corporation, Hock said.\n\n“You could almost see the excitement ebbing,” Senge told FastCompany.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"

Subscribe\n\nNo one expects average Americans to abandon their credit cards in favor of more secure Bitcoin payments anytime soon, although they might be smart to do so. But the cryptocurrency is on a faster track in parts of the world where users often don\'t have bank accounts, let alone their choice of 2% cash back or frequent-flier miles for paying with plastic.\n\n""Africa just skipped landlines and went to wireless,"" observes Brad Stephens, cofounder and managing partner of San Francisco-based Blockchain Capital, an early-stage investment fund. ""They\'re essentially skipping traditional banks. They don\'t need branches, and they don\'t need tellers. They\'re going straight to the bank in your pocket in a decentralized, nonbank way.""\n\nPalo Alto-based Xapo offers both a Bitcoin ""wallet"" and a Bitcoin ""vault"" to customers in 180 countries. CEO Wences Casares says that more than 90% of the Bitcoin stored in its vault is owned as a speculative investment by hedge funds, family offices and high-net-worth individuals from wealthy countries. Meanwhile, more than 90% of customers for Xapo\'s transactional wallets are from developing nations, including India, Russia, Brazil and Indonesia. Typically, he says, these customers have a smartphone but no credit card, and want to shop online. -- L.S.', 'A number of large UK corporations and institutions, such as Lloyds Bank and BAE systems, have reported a “marked increase” in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks from the Bitcoin extortionist group DD4BC, which has been operational since last year. The increased aggressions appear to be concurrent with reports from other organisations. A cybersecurity case study released by Akamai identified 114 DD4BC attacks against the company’s customers since April 2015, with 41 cases taking place in June alone. In comparison, there were only 5 attacks in January and February 2015.\n\n""The latest attacks—focused primarily on the financial service industry—involved new strategies and tactics intended to harass, extort and ultimately embarrass the victim publicly,” said Akamai Security Division executive Stuart Scholly in a press release.\n\n58% of DD4BC\'s targets are financial institutions, according to Akamai. The group begins with ransom emails that state their demands, which vary anywhere between 1 and 100 bitcoins (about £160 to £16,000), a deadline for compliance, and warning of a “small, demonstrative attack.” Should the victim prove uncooperative, the figure is raised and a more forceful show of force is made. This technique is particularly effective against financial institutions as DD4BC threatens to publicise their attacks, negating the institution\'s reputation and trustworthiness.\n\nAkamai reports that DD4BC—which stands for ""DDoS for Bitcoin""—has been observed utilising the typical scripted attacks found on the DDoS-for-hire market, and have mainly made use of three attack types: NTP floods, SSDP floods, and UDP floods. The largest attack so far was measured at around 56.2Gbps. The company warns that copycats may enter the fray. Fortunately, in part because DD4BC has begun to target enterprise-level organisations, law enforcement agencies appear to have finally taken notice. The UK’s National Crime Agency, which itself was target of a Lizard Squad DDoS last week, informed Bloomberg that it was “aware” of the group’s activities.\n\nA number of businesses have complied with DD4BC\'s demands, but one former victim tried a different tack, placing a bounty of 100 bitcoins (~£16,000) on the group in the hope that someone might come forward with details of who\'s behind the attacks. Bitman, a large Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer, then added 10 Bitcoins to this figure. So far, despite a number of potential leads, the bounty hasn\'t been claimed.', 'What Is The Difference Between Bitcoin, FOREX & Gold? ‘A Tripod Theory’ [Revised]\n\nWritten By: Patrick “PK” McDonnell\n\nAs Bitcoin and it’s counterparties known as “altcoins” enter the mainstream many investors are seeking information on the mechanics of trading these revolutionary peer-to-peer niche oriented decentralized global cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin, forex and gold have many similar yet distinct differences that make each a unique and viable investment vehicle. Bitcoin is a “hybrid” of both forex and gold structured to trade like a stock with stop loss protections and profit objective orders which help preserve capital and ensure profits through forex like market volatility.\n\nBitcoin like gold is viewed by some as a viable long-term storage of wealth with many enthusiasts dubbing it “digital gold” due to the mining aspects involved that reward virtual miners Bitcoin for solving encrypted mathematical equations while keeping the underlying network (the blockchain) in sync. In theory, “Like gold as the supply becomes more and more limited the demand can increase value over time.” Bitcoin has a cap in place that will only allow 21 million coins ever to be mined giving it a controlled supply and rarity unlike the never ending printing of US Dollars.\n\n“Because the monetary base of Bitcoins cannot be expanded, the currency would be subject to severe deflation if it becomes widely used.”\n\nAt the time of this writing exactly 14,594,075 Bitcoins were in the hands of the public leaving only 6,425,925 left for mining. Analyst’s believe the true value of Bitcoin will be recognized when the very last coin is rewarded. Chris Dixon a Silicon Valley Bitcoin enthusiast and VC thinks a single Bitcoin could be worth $100,000 USD while some have predicted $1,000,000 USD. Learn More>\n\nNOTE: One must remember to avoid confusion that Bitcoin first is a “currency” recognized by the US Government quoted as such, “decentralized virtual currency” with all US transactions subject to taxation by the IRS. It is designed to be a “decentralized” peer-to-peer monetary network that is disruptive to the traditional “centralized” money system. Much like Uber has disrupted the taxi industry, blockchain technology has disrupted the financial sector. Initially, the US Government tried disruption of Bitcoin but the underlying algorithm is open-source making it available to anyone in the world with an internet connection who chooses adoption. So just like forex and gold who both share Bitcoins “decentralized” nature they were forced to recognize, tax, and enforce regulation initially in The State Of New York State with Ben Lawsky, NYS’s former financial regulator leading the pack.\n\nSo what truly differentiates Bitcoin from Forex and Gold?\n\nBitcoin vs Forex\n\nThere is no real difference between Bitcoin and forex trading. Like Forex, The price of Bitcoin is determined by supply-and-demand factors of the currency markets. With forex you can trade leveraged contracts increasing your potential of gain and risk utilizing margin trading ratios. Bitcoin can be margined, it is structured identical to stock market trading with the extreme price swings and volatility that come with currency speculation.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins have recently announced their upcoming launch of “Gemini” the NASDAQ of Bitcoin. As the demand for Bitcoin or forex increases, the underlying price rises, and when the demand decreases the price declines. Unlike forex, Bitcoin has a limited supply in circulation with new Bitcoins being created at a predictable and decreasing rate as referenced above.\n\nThe main difference between Bitcoin and forex is liquidity factors. Forex is an estimated 5 trillion market depending on who is reporting the daily turnover figures while Bitcoin is a relatively new and smaller market valued at 3 billion. Bitcoin demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stabilized. Bitcoin value is based off the macroeconomics of the underlying cryptocurrency eco-system while forex pairs work off the economic fundamentals of individual countries traded. Due to Bitcoins relatively small market compared to forex and existing models, the market price may go up or down in response to relatively insignificant amounts of volume creating a volatile trading atmosphere.\n\nBitcoin can be traded 24/7 while forex can be traded 24/5 in response to traditional financial institution schedules.\n\nBitcoin vs Gold\n\n“Bitcoins” are a form of digital or virtual currency stored in an encrypted wallet which may be bought, held, sold or traded via peer-to-peer and/or established cryptocurrency exchange services. Bitcoin has a value which is determined by the normal supply-and-demand factors of the currency markets and represents a form of currency which is “decentralized” meaning it is outside the control of governments and central banks. The value is “directly” pegged to the US Dollar and can be converted to $USD just like $CAD, $EUR, $JPY or any other traditional fiat currency.\n\nAll alternative cryptocurrencies or “altcoins” are pegged directly to the value of Bitcoin making it the $USD of the cryptocurrency market. The underlying success of any cryptocurrency is determined by geographical and mainstream adoption combined with consumer confidence, merchant acceptance and real-world use thus creating a viable payment platform and true storage of wealth with trading market capabilities fueled by a thriving and innovative decentralized economy.\n\nNOTE: Bitcoin is “virtual” in form and “not” a physical instrument such as gold. Bitcoin is more like forex compared to gold minus the enormous leverage provided through FX contracts. Many are confused due to cryptocurrency enthusiasts posting photos all over the internet of actual physical Bitcoins which are nothing more than pictures. Some choose to engrave their wallet addresses on gold coins or other types of precious metals merging both values into one unit.\n\nBitcoin wallets are controlled by two addresses: “Your public and private keys.”\n\nI once met an early adopter of Bitcoin who had his public key (address) tattooed on his right forearm and his private key (address) on his left. So Bitcoin can basically be stored anywhere users choose. Your safest and securest bet is offline “cold storage” also known as a paper wallet which should be stored in a secure and moisture free area to avoid water damage of your keys. Offline cold storage protects your Bitcoins from online theft and hack attacks which have be duly noted in the media lately.\n\nPublic Key (Incoming Deposits & Sales) – Your public key is also known as your “address” or “addy”. This is a unique set of numbers or QR code that you show to people in order for them to send you Bitcoin payments.\n\nPrivate Key (Outgoing Withdrawals & Payments) – Your private key is what shows the blockchain network that you own the Bitcoin in your wallet.\n\n“Your private key needs to be kept safe, show it to no one!” If you lose it or someone acquires it your Bitcoins are lost with absolutely “no” recourse like losing a traditional hand purse or wallet full of $USD on the street.\n\nNOTE: You could think of your public key (address) as your bank account number and your private key (address) as your bank account password. The main difference is that you can create an “unlimited” amount of Bitcoin public and private addresses to “segregate” your personal and business finances.\n\nEx: Business, Checking (Bitcoin debit card w/ATM privileges), College, Savings, Retirement Accounts, etc.\n\nOwning a Bitcoin wallet is consistant with controlling your own “personal decentralized bank” without all of the restrictions and centralized controls put in place by the forefathers of finance.\n\nTo sum things up… Bitcoin is a virtual floating exchange rate pegged to the $USD like forex with “no” underlying physical asset to base its price off and gold is a tangible currency backed by a physical commodity. Anyhow, both investments price valuations are dictated by investor confidence and overall market sentiment. In regards to Bitcoin or gold, stability should be one of the first aspects considered. While some believe Bitcoins offer the ability for a better currency, others prefer to rely on gold’s historical track record.\n\nBitcoins are still in their infancy and have many more years to go before investors will see a reliable track record while gold has been accepted the world over for thousands of years. This planet only has so much gold and it’s difficult to locate, mine and refine. These factors make it a rare commodity and therefore give gold its value. Modeled after the process of gold mining, Bitcoin has a controlled and limited supply with “electronic” mining capabilities. Gold has long been the smartest choice to represent “money” due to its durability, rarity and ease of divisibility. Gold is known to provide safety, security and stability against inflation and a struggling economy.\n\nIs Bitcoin viable? Only time will tell…\n\n#KNOWYOUROLEINBTC\n\nCOYOTE AFTER THOUGHT???

However, bitcoin offers several advantages over this online payment method that could eventually allow the cryptocurrency to establish dominance. Is it really possible?\n\nPerhaps one big thing going for PayPal is that it hasn’t really been heavily linked to illegal dealings the way bitcoin did with Silk Road. This sets bitcoin back by a number of notches, as the cryptocurrency has to prove its legitimacy and security before gaining mainstream adoption.\n\nCompetition from Bitcoin\n\nBut while PayPal has been an established company for quite some time, processing majority of online transactions in the past few years, both PayPal and bitcoin are actually almost on a level playing field when it comes to security. Both systems can still be vulnerable to penetration, as PayPal and bitcoin strive to strike the balance between accessibility and confidentiality.\n\nWhen it comes to ease of use, PayPal was already off to a running start, as the company has been able to fine-tune its operations and user interface, even developing a peer-to-peer system of transactions called PayPal.me. This service is similar to bitcoin wallets, although identities still need to be confirmed for PayPal.\n\nBitcoin also has price volatility going against it, with some customers hesitant to trade their cash for a cryptocurrency that fluctuates largely in value. Similarly, there is a bit of friction for some merchants accepting bitcoin payments since there is no guarantee that they can liquidate those funds at similar rates during which they received them.\n\nWhen it comes to online merchants, both payment schemes have made considerable progress in integration. Several startups in the cryptocurrency industry have focused on creating platforms and developer kits that could pave the way for seamless implementation on the merchant’s website while PayPal has offered various options for payment processing as well.\n\nFor now, it’s too early to tell whether bitcoin can eventually overtake PayPal and even more difficult to predict when this might take place.', 'In many recent articles, Bitcoin Magazine reported the trend toward private, “permissioned” non-Bitcoin blockchains, supported by Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters, among others. Permissioned blockchain developments for banks and financial operators have been started by giant Swiss bank UBS, Bitcoin exchange itBit and more.\n\nPermissioned blockchains would offer the advantages of digital currencies powered by public blockchains – fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared ledger – without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be a node on the network anonymously.\n\nInstead of anonymous miners, only banks and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate transactions in permissioned blockchains.\n\nWhile Wall Street seems determined to go ahead with permissioned blockchains, it’s wise to bear in mind one simple fact: Bitcoin works. While closed, permissioned blockchains might theoretically work tomorrow, Bitcoin works in practice today, and perhaps the chaotic anarchy of the Bitcoin network is the very reason it works.\n\nThat’s the opinion of former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis, who is persuaded that private, permissioned blockchains might fall short of their objectives. “It could end up being very similar to centralized payments networks we have right now, without the benefit of the network effect of bitcoin,” he said.\n\nNow, legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo has weighed in on current issues in the Bitcoin space, including permissioned blockchains, in an interview published inInternational Business Times titled “Nick Szabo: If banks want benefits of blockchains they must go permissionless.”\n\n“[Bank] bureaucracies are so heavily invested in the expertise and importance of local regulations and standards that it’s extremely difficult for them to cut the Gordian knot and implement seamless global systems,” said Szabo. “So they keep trying to re-inject points of control, and thus points of vulnerability, into blockchains, e.g. through ‘permissioning’; but this nullifies their main benefits, which come from removing points of vulnerability.”\n\nOn the contrary, according to Szabo, the banks should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\n\nIn his book “Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the inside story of the misfits and millionaires trying to reinvent money,” The New York Times technology and finance reporter Nathaniel Popper argued that Szabo is the most likely person behind the pseudonymous identity of Bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. A recent interviewwith Adam Back – another legendary cryptographer – underlines the key contributions of Szabo in the developments that led to Bitcoin. Szabo’s positions are taken very seriously within the Bitcoin community.\n\nIn the International Business Times interview, Szabo also weighs in on another very hot topic: the block size. Szabo is against Gavin Andresen’s BIP 101 proposal to increase the maximum block size from the current 1 megabyte to 8 megabytes, and double it every two years after that until it reaches 8,192MB. Andresen didn’t just submit a proposal, but actually launched Bitcoin XT as an alternative to Bitcoin Core, which angered other Core developers and notable members of the Bitcoin community.\n\nAccording to Szabo, a large increase in block size would sacrifice security for performance.\n\n“If you reduce the redundancy of messages to allow for larger block sizes, beyond the growth of limiting-resource technology, that reduces the automated integrity that makes Bitcoin distinctive in financial IT,” he says.\n\nAmong the proposed block-size tweaks currently on the table for discussion, Szabo prefers Bitcoin Core developer Peter Wuille’s proposal, BIP 103, which would increase the block size limit by only 17.7 percent per year starting in 2017.\n\nIn 2001, Szabo spoke of smart contracts that solved the problem of trust by being self-executing, and having property embedded with information about who owns it. For example, the key to a car might operate only if the car has been paid for according to the terms of a contract.\n\nNow, Szabo expects emerging “Bitcoin 2.0” smart contracts platforms likeEthereum to have a disruptive impact on financial and legal systems, comparable to that of Bitcoin itself. “[E]ventually more so, since Ethereum’s more flexible and general language can facilitate a much wider variety of commercial and other formal relationships.”', 'According to one of the Juniper Research’s reports, Bitcoin cryptocurrency ecosystem will have nearly 5 million active users by 2019; chiefs of some of the world’s leading finance organizations, including Nasdaq and Westpac, believe Bitcoin technology will be a major disruptor for the traditional banking sector; the first quarter of 2015 reported a 51% increase in investments made into the Bitcoin sector.\n\nThrough a few examples quoted above, it becomes evident that Bitcoin, after all, is gaining traction into the mainstream business circles. From stock firms to a simple t-shirt seller, everybody is getting involved in this new disruptive payment technology. In this article, our focus, however, is one such industry that has made Bitcoin popular among international traders.\n\nBinary Options and Bitcoin\n\nThe relationship between binary options and Bitcoin goes way back to 2013, when Plus500 and IG had consecutively announced that they were supporting leveraged Bitcoin trading on their respective online platforms. What followed later was a flock-walk, where most of the leading binary option brokers were — in one way or another — are integrating Bitcoin. These firms include AvaTrade, Nadex, Tradesmarter and many others.\n\nBitcoin As Payment Solution\n\nInterestingly, it is not just the trading features that attract binary options brokers toward Bitcoin; but instead, they are also much fond of using the digital currency for depositing and withdrawing clients’ funds. Bitcoin truly emerges as a viable and cheaper payment solution to these brokers, for the other methods usually look heftier in terms of commissions, and also takes days and weeks to complete the money transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, takes only minutes while transferring funds from one place to another and is completely secure.\n\nAs a result, forex and binary option brokers are beginning to explore the advantages of Bitcoin as an payment alternative. Just recently, FXPrimus had announced that it is introducing Bitcoin deposits features on its platform. Prior to that, UpDown had also made a similar announcement.\n\nNote: It is very important you choose a reliable forex and binary options broker which allows you to use Bitcoin in a safe and secure manner.

The virtual bitcoin debit card has until now existed in the realm of possibilities largely due to the idiosyncrasies of the global financial system.\n\nE-Coin solves a problem that has affected bitcoin users worldwide. Bitcoin users have had to cope with limited spending opportunities. By combining bitcoin with VISA, users of the virtual prepaid card will now be able to perform all the normal transactions that ordinary cardholders are able to do such as load funds, withdraw, and shop online. The most exciting aspect about E-Coin is its merging of the traditional financial architecture with the new reality of digital currencies. E-Coin currently has about 20,000 customers spread out in 173 countries worldwide.\n\nSetting Up E-Coin\n\nTo set up an E-Coin account is easy and straightforward. It was a process that took this writer less than five minutes. Like all other similar products, the E-Coin virtual debit card is subject to withdrawal and spending limits. However these can be increased after submitting verification documents.\n\nThe E-Coin card is bound to excite developers and the general crypto community since it now allows anyone to spend bitcoin at any website that does not accept it as yet. In addition, it can also be used for third-party services such as PayPal and ApplePay.\n\nE-Coin also offers physical bitcoin debit cards. The platform is simple to use, and promises customers hassle-free and instant conversion between bitcoin and the three fiat currencies currently available, the dollar, the pound, and the euro. E-Coin is at present not available in some key markets such as the US and India.\n\nCCN interviewed Dmitry Lazarichev, co-founder and spokesperson for E-Coin and the following were his responses to our questions.\n\nHow long have you been working on this product?\n\nOne year.\n\nIn your press release, you said that there have been inconsistencies and friction in the global financial system. What are some of those inconsistencies and friction that you have encountered?\n\nThe main problem is that several countries and big markets such US and India are closed for us.\n\nDid regulators in the US and India explain their reasons for denying you access?\n\nWe’d need banking partners in these regions to deal with local complaints.\n\nNow that you’ve sealed this partnership with Visa, could we expect to see partnerships with MasterCard or American Express down the road?\n\nYes, we might start to work with MC (Mastercard) soon.\n\nIn addition to the planned mobile app that you plan to release, could we expect an API that will extend the functionality of your product?\n\nOur mobile app will be ready in 2-3 months and we also offer APIs for partners.\n\nThere are several countries in which E-coin is not available. Would you give an approximate time-frame in which you will cover those markets?\n\nIt is a very good question.

He said:\n\n""That\'s obviously done for reasons of ease – you don\'t have to re-invent the wheel every time there\'s a new disaster ... on the other hand, what that means is our options are limited and that, in turn, has limited the options of the people who have been affected by the disaster.""\n\nUSAID\'s Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance, Food For Peace and Global Development Lab echoed Currion\'s assertions that cash can be more beneficial than gifts-in-kind, noting that, under the appropriate circumstances, cash-based interventions can stimulate local economies.\n\nCurrently, aid cash is either distributed directly, transferred into a bank account or into a mobile money system such as Kenya\'s M-Pesa or through the use of vouchers, which can be reimbursed at local merchants.\n\nBitcoin\'s chance\n\nWith aid groups looking to deliver funds in the cheapest and most efficient manner, it is not surprising some incumbents are searching for alternatives, seeking to leverage existing and new technologies to improve the way in which aid is distributed.\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to be lauded by banks and with bitcoin\'s potential to serve the unbanked being continuously highlighted by enthusiasts, the question that remains is how – or whether – both can be applied in the global aid sector.\n\n""I think the idea of using cryptocurrencies as a kind of managed response – as a halfway between vouchers and cash – has got a lot of potential,"" said Currion.\n\nCurrion recognises that, with new technologies come new challenges, but he believes cryptocurrencies can provide a way of ""distributing cash more safely, more quickly and more cheaply and in a way that\'s much more easy to manage"".\n\nIf you can reach agreements with local merchants, he added, you are actually able to protect vulnerable communities from market volatility by using cryptocurrencies instead of fiat cash.\n\nHowever, he understands the importance of there being multiple aid channels and methods, so he sees cryptocurrency aid operating alongside fiat aid, not instead of it.\n\nBlockchain\'s transparency\n\nAccording to Currion, there\'s also potential for blockchain technology to be used in the sector: ""The second approach is using the underlying blockchain technology for various kinds of tracking. That could be registering and tracking displaced communities of refugees, but most importantly it could be tracking funding.""\n\nHe added:\n\n""One of the things I think has strong potential in the sector is using blockchain technology to track assets as they move through the system. In particular, with funding, this could offer a much better way, a much more detailed overview of where the money is going, how it\'s being spent – and that obviously contributes to accountability, to transparency and to the effectiveness of the aid overall.""\n\nReflecting on some of the issues facing aid organisations, Currion noted how difficult it was to account for the destination of funds. ""It\'s not because anyone is trying to obscure it, it\'s just because the system is really complicated.""\n\nA new agency\n\nAnn Kim, portfolio director, public sector at IDEO, an award-winning global design and innovation consultancy, told CoinDesk both bitcoin and its underlying distributed ledger could help the sector in ""multiple compelling ways"".\n\nShe said:\n\n""First it gives people and organisations a new kind of agency. The most exciting area is offering a huge leap for the unbanked. There is the question of bitcoin being more widely accepted, but assuming we can get there, bitcoin is the MVP [most valuable player] of the bank account.""\n\nThe blockchain, she added, offers new levels of transparency. ""International development has had its share of corruption. The blockchain enables new kinds of capabilities, like smart contracts, that could tie funds to agreed-upon activities to ensure that all partiers are accountable.""\n\nAnother idea, Kim said, was smart escrow, whereby a donor sends funds to a particular project. ""Through this digital escrow system, funds could be released on specific milestones reached.""\n\nDuring her presentation at an event hosted by Microsoft’s Civic Innovation team, Kim touched on the possibility of piggy backing on users\' every day behaviour. She said this idea was borne out of an exploration at IDEO Futures Bits + Blocks Lab that looked into different ways of connecting average citizens with humanitarian causes.\n\n""Donations as they stand now are often provoked by crises or making end-of-year donations in times of taxes,"" Kim said, adding:\n\n""In addition, donors are increasingly looking at donations as investments. Charity is a broken model. In an age where people are demanding more and more transparency – where their food comes from, where their clothing is made – they also want to know how their money creates impact.""\n\nDonors, she added, also want to feel more proximity to recipients. ""On top of all this, people want giving to be easy. With the blockchain, there are whole new possibilities for designing for these user needs.""\n\nKim told CoinDesk that a team in the Bits + Blocks Lab has created an early prototype which piggybacked on a very common everyday habit: opening the fridge.\n\n""When I open my fridge to get a snack, could there be a way that triggers an automated micro transaction to give to a food-related cause?""\n\nAlthough Kim said additional work was needed, she noted this was a way to start moving towards the right direction, thinking about the entire donation process differently and better connecting donors to the actual end goals of development and aid.\n\nRoom for improvement\n\nFor Currion, it\'s about building a portfolio of different options when it comes to financing and distribution.\n\n""Aid organisations need to have a range of tools at their disposal and to choose the best type of response for a particular situation. I think we stand a better chance of meeting the needs of people more effectively.""\n\nCurrion acknowledged that the current humanitarian system is outdated, but any potential changes need to be assessed with both caution and flexibility.\n\n""The test for new technologies like mobile money, e-vouchers and digital currencies that offer innovative solutions is whether they can be safer and more cost-efficient for both the beneficiary and the host institution,"" said the digital finance team at USAID\'s US Global Development Lab.\n\nCurrion agrees, stating that when having technology-driven discussions, it is important to not feed the hype machine, rather, the key is to ensure the requirements of those in need are still being met.\n\n""It is very exciting to talk about this stuff, I get excited by it, you have to always remember that at the other end of this there are people who may have lost absolutely everything and hype doesn\'t help them. We have to make sure that our ideas are grounded.""\n\nThis topic will be discussed further at Consensus 2015 in New York on 10th September.

09/10/2015,"['Early reports indicate that the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has indicted Mark Karpeles, the CEO of the collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, with embezzlement. These formal charges follow months of allegations of fraud, which culminated in Karpele’s arrest by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.\n\nKarpeles was arrested on August 1st but had not been formally charged until today. Liquidations proceeding for Mt. Gox are ongoing and a report detailing creditors claims of $22 billion against the company was released earlier this week. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, citing losses of over 750,000 bitcoin held on behalf of customers.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Karpeles is charged with embezzling over $50 million from Mt.

Law Enforcement on the Blockchain\n\nThe next session, titled Unprecedented Transparency? Law Enforcement on the Blockchain, featured Kathryn Haun, of the US Dept. of Justice; Tigran Gambaryan of IRS Criminal Investigations; Catherine Pelker of the FBI; and Jason Weinstein, of Steptoe and Johnson and was led by Jerry Brito of CoinCenter.\n\nHaun said the US Dept. of Justice had used blockchain analysis in its Ripple investigation and during the investigation of Silk Road\'s Baltimore Task Force, which led to the identification of illicit activity carried out by former agents Carl Mark Force and Sean Bridges.\n\nDespite not divulging specifics about the investigation, Haun was able to determine that this had been the first time blockchain analysis had been used in a public charging document.\n\nSpeaking from her experience at the FBI, Pelker pointed out ""blockchain analysis is a powerful tool, but it is not a magic solution to any of our issues"", and highlighted her need for bitcoin exchanges to both collect data from customers and subsequently analyse the blockchain.\n\nHowever, Weinstein highlighted the need for law enforcement and regulators to be able to police both the on and off ramps.\n\n""The policing of the on-ramps is important because when you do blockchain analysis you reach the point where you need to connect that to a person,"" he said.\n\nFor Haun, the emergence of technologies has two-fold implications. On the one hand, she said, new technological developments may enable crimes. Alternatively, these technologies also provide another avenue for law enforcement to explore and use in their investigations.\n\nShe added:\n\n""It gives law enforcement another area to mine for information about those committing criminal activity.""\n\nIn terms of what\'s currently missing, Haun highlighted the need to train more agents and people in the government about bitcoin\'s distributed ledger and how to analyse it.\n\nAccording to Weinstein, the benefits of being able to use the blockchain in law enforcement investigations lie in the fact the distributed ledger eliminates issues around data retention and the barriers imposed by geographical borders.\n\nPelker, however, noted the blockchain\'s borderless nature ""cuts both ways"", explaining it can be very difficult to actually progress with an investigation if the agency does not know the country it needs to issue the appropriate request to.\n\nFurther challenges, Gambaryan said, revolve around the issue of presenting blockchain analysis as evidence in court, noting:\n\n""The information available is very limited and, in more complex cases, following the money is still a challenge.""\n\nThe critical path to bitcoin mass adoption\n\nUp next, Michael J Casey from MIT Media Lab moderated a discussion about bitcoin mass adoption, featuring panelists Connie Chung of Expedia; Jon Downing of Visa Europe Collab; and Vinny Lingham of Gyft.\n\nCasey, who recently closed the door on an 18-year journalism career, opened by noting how the perception around bitcoin had changed in the last couple of years.\n\n""At the end of 2013, we all thought of it as a currency, as means of exchange that would challenge the dollar ... we used to get very excited about merchant adoption announcements"".\n\nNowadays, the consumer story is still very much alive, he said, but it looks very different.\n\nChung noted that bitcoin payments at the online travel giant typically decreased in line with the digital currency\'s drop in price. Despite this, she said Expedia – which integrated bitcoin payments in June last year – had seen ""steady usage"".\n\nFor Lingham, offering bitcoin paying customers a discount is important and worked very well for Gyft, he said:\n\n""If you don\'t simplify the use [of bitcoin], why would people want to use it as a currency? Realistically, as a merchant, we are saving interchange fees, so, why not give it back to the customer?""\n\nWith regards to potential use cases, Lingham also explained how the digital currency may help people living in emerging countries, such as Africa, who want to purchase items online from US retailers:\n\n""Most US retailers will not ship anything [to countries in Africa such Nigeria] because of credit card fraud. There are a million people living in Africa, this is a very strong use case for bitcoin.""\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Visa Europe Collab, Downing – who noted bitcoin volatility was currently a key issue – said the organisation sought collaboration with all the key players in the ecosystem and it is exploring several opportunities, including micropayments, international payments and smart contracts.\n\nMoving on to the notorious chicken-and-egg debate, which seeks to determine whether mainstream adoption is down to consumers or merchants, Downing drew on the comparison with contactless debit cards and how these first needed to be issued by banks for consumers to subsequently use them.\n\n""It\'s finding those cases where people feel like using that technology on a day-to-day basis, that it is going to be used reliably and that it is beneficial to both parties.""\n\nA $1.6 Quadrillion Opportunity\n\nThe morning\'s sessions were rounded off by Hans Morris of Nyca Partners, who spoke to Blythe Masters of Digital Asset Holdings; Houman Shadab of New York Law School; and Brad Peterson of Nasdaq.\n\nMorris began by addressing the need to eliminate opacity in reconciliation. The decision to replace a working system is not one to be taken lightly, he said, as it could take a major firm approximately three-to-five years to do so and there\'s a high failure rate.\n\nShadab said blockchain technology was being discussed as a direct result of the financial crisis. What blockchains are trying to do, Shadab said, is to ""take away back offices"".\n\nPeterson joined the conversation by giving an overview of Nasdaq and its involvement with the sector:\n\n""We really have to master this [blockchain] technology ... we looked at where we could find alignment with this technology and fit it into something that we are already doing as part of our business.""\n\nMasters, who spent 20 years working at financial services in JP Morgan, touched upon her first impressions of blockchain technology:\n\n""When I first came across blockchain technology I was frankly quite surprised and taken by the potential for a technology to check a lot of boxes that represent very real and very current points of pain the existing financial and market infrastructure and ecosystems.""\n\nFor her, these points of pain include a generally depressed revenue environment, rising costs associated with compliance and regulation, inefficient infrastructure. ""Firms are being asked to capitalise for more risk,"" she added.\n\nSome regulators whose focus lies on systemic risk, Masters added, also see the benefits of this type of technology and the potential it has both to eliminate friction and reduce risk.\n\n""The journey has commenced and is well under way, it will succeed and the upside is enormous.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Kadhim Shubber in New York and Philip Stafford in London SEPTEMBER 10, 2015 6 Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker now leading a blockchain start-up, has cautioned that the US is likely to lag behind other countries in using the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency bitcoin to modernise their securities markets. Ms Masters has become the most high-profile former banker to join a rapidly growing industry of technology companies, venture capitalists, banks and exchanges all investing in ways to harness the latest computing trends from Silicon Valley to Wall Street. Blockchain, the technology on which the controversial bitcoin digital currency sits, has been touted as a way to save banks billions in costly back office procedures such as clearing and settlements and loan processing. Such a move could overhaul some of the financial industry’s most entrenched and inefficient practices. But Ms Masters damped hopes that the US could lead a potential\u200e revolution. “There are jurisdictions outside the US where it will happen quicker and that’s because there are markets where there is a vertical integration all the way from the exchange through to the custodian’s custodian if you will,” she said on Thursday at a conference organised by CoinDesk, an industry news site. “There the decision-making process is contained within a smaller number of bodies and there are a couple of jurisdictions with very supportive governments that are driving that. So I think you will see it outside the US probably before you see it meaningfully in the US,” she added. Clearing of securities in US markets is largely processed via the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. Other clearing houses around the world, including in the UK and Germany, clear both securities and derivatives and have closer links with their settlement houses, which speed up the time it takes to post collateral from customer accounts. While stock markets have been reshaped by high-frequency trading that takes place in milliseconds, the transfer of many financial assets still takes days if not weeks as a result of legacy back office systems. Securities deals in the US typically take up to three days to settle, a process known in the markets as “T+3”, while waits of 20 days or more are typical in the settlement of loans. “T+3 is not particularly satisfactory, but it isn’t profoundly broken,” Ms Masters said. “If you look at the loan market that is operating at a T+20 — plus plus plus — basis and the consequences of that are impacting the economics of the business materially and adversely, that’s going to have to change whether it’s distributed ledger technology that fixes it or not,” she added. Ms Masters’ Digital Asset Holdings is just one in a crowded field of companies vying to develop products to replace existing securities trading systems. Duncan Niederauer, a former chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, has invested in Symbiont, which is developing a platform that uses blockchain, while Nasdaq has partnered with US start-up Chain for a private share-trading platform earlier this year. On Wednesday, Chain announced $30m in new funding from investors including Visa, Nasdaq and Citi Ventures. Banks too are exploring the technology’s potential through their own innovation arms and incubators, but there is still scepticism about blockchain start-ups promising to transform their businesses with shared database technology. “Am I going to go rip out all of that legacy infrastructure and start sharing it with other banks anytime soon? I think that’s a five to 10-year dream,” said Simon Taylor, blockchain and distributed ledger lead for Barclays, in a later panel discussion at the same conference.', 'Case has raised $1m in additional seed funding.\n\nThe figure adds to the $1.25m in capital the New York-based startup secured in June and brings its total amount raised to $2.25m. The seed round, now closed, was led by Future\\Perfect Ventures, a New York venture firm whose portfolio includes industry startups such as Abra, Blockchain and Blockstream.\n\nOne of a growing number of bitcoin hardware wallet providers, including companies like KeepKey, Ledger and Trezor, Case is distinguished by a product designed with advanced security features such as biometrics and veteran entrepreneur and CEO Melanie Shapiro, who previously founded and sold social client startup Digsby.\n\nIn statements, Shapiro suggested that the funding seeks to move the startup past its competitors by catering to both consumers and enterprise bitcoin and blockchain firms.\n\nFor example, the company announced yesterday it had participated in the issuance of shares in Pivit, a newly launched public opinion marketplace. Pivit had its private investor shares recording on distributed ledger technology developed by Digital Asset Holdings (DAH).\n\nShapiro said:\n\n""Bitcoin and other distributed ledger technologies facilitate the transfer of digital financial assets within cryptographically secured, immutable environments. Case acts as a secure signing device that streamlines this process without increasing the risk of compromising sensitive data.”\n\nThe share issuance comes as capital markets-focused blockchain startups continue to explore the viability of issuing private shares on distributed ledgers.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Few groups have been as early and as active in attempting to understand the implications of digital currency and blockchain technology as US law enforcement.\n\nDespite expanded use and investment, cryptographic currencies such as bitcoin continue to be widely used for illicit activities. Dark market operators and extortionists were early and aggressive in their attempts to capitalize on the digital payment network and its cash-like approach to transactions, a trend that continues.\n\nAs evidence, the Department of Justice, US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (DOJ), appointed Kathryn Haun as its first Digital Currency Crimes Coordinator this June. The position finds Haun heading up a multi-agency task force in San Francisco and comprised of representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Secret Service (USSS), among several other federal and state organizations.\n\nIn an interview, Haun countered some of the misconceptions that have sometimes proliferated among the technology\'s enthusiasts, many of whom seek to portray the interests of her agency and the US government as at odds with a currency that operates without government backing.\n\nHaun stressed that the DOJ and others tasked with policing financial crimes have finite resources, and are not engaged in pursuing a broad agenda against bitcoin. Rather, she suggested that the agency she works for and the wider digital currency and blockchain community share a common ground, arguing that a safer environment for consumers, with clear regulations to separate bad actors, is in the best interest of all.\n\nHaun told CoinDesk:\n\n""Everyone benefits from clarity. The players in the ecosystem, the businesses, the government – everyone benefits from knowing which laws and regulations apply for digital currency and how those laws apply.""\n\nHaun portrayed efforts by agencies such as the DOJ as supportive of the goal of clarifying the application of existing US laws and regulations on the matter. Further, she emphasized that while the DOJ does not write the law, it does play an active role in presenting US judges with cases that will inform future rulemaking.\n\nStartup compliance\n\nAccording to Haun, an example of the balance federal agencies are attempting to strike is the DOJ\'s joint effort with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that ended in Ripple Labs and a subsidiary being fined $700,000 for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nHaun suggested that, while Ripple Labs may have been investigated for conduct that occurred early in its days as a digital currency-focused startup, it was not part of any ""particular special initiative or drive"" to examine the entire industry.\n\n""Due to Ripple’s extensive remedial efforts, including its commitment to enhancing its existing anti-money laundering and know your customer procedures, among other factors, we decided not to prosecute Ripple criminally but instead reached a settlement agreement,"" Haun explained.\n\nHaun pointed out that there were no indictments or criminal charges brought against Ripple Labs or its executives, framing the resolution as a compromise between a US agency with a responsibility to ensure financial firms are compliant with the law and a startup that was operating in a fast-moving environment.\n\nShe said this reflects the understanding among financial agencies that smaller or early-stage companies may not necessarily have one employee whose only job is to serve as an AML or compliance officer.\n\n“Perhaps that individual has a number of different roles in the company. But the fact that a company is small or just starting out doesn’t mean it doesn’t need to have a compliance program in place, because these are important issues for a company of any size or stage to have addressed in the beginning,” she continued, adding:\n\n“As is often said there is no one-size-fits-all compliance program, and at the end of the day it depends on any given entity’s customer base, risk level and other factors unique to that entity.""\n\nInvestigation pipeline\n\nHaun further expanded on how cases are brought to her attention as Digital Currency Crimes Coordinator, suggesting that they are sourced through a variety of means.\n\nAgents may receive leads directly from financial institutions, or develop them through other sources. Alleged victims, she said, may sometimes report crimes directly to the department through federal and local law enforcement.\n\nUltimately, she stressed there was no one answer to how leads for cases were developed and no one particular investigative agency with sole responsibility for bringing the investigations.\n\n""It’s like asking ‘which agency handles crimes committed with cash?’"" she said. ""The answer is that no one single agency or unit alone does – as with other forms of payment, crimes committed with digital currency or using new financial technology span many areas, and accordingly, numerous different agencies and units within those agencies are involved in these investigations.""\n\nAs evidence of this, she pointed out that some of the digital currency cases publicly prosecuted so far have been markedly different in subject matter, categorizing the case against former DEA Special Agent Carl Force and former Secret Service Agent Shaun Bridges as fundamentally a public corruption case, while Ripple Labs was more a white collar matter and Silk Road more a global narcotics conspiracy.\n\nAlthough the department has seen an influx of extortion scams involving bitcoin, she said the nature of illegal activities committed with the technology is capable of expanding across ""almost all varieties"" of crime.\n\nAs for companies that have relocated outside the US in a protest of increased laws and regulation, she suggested that this doesn\'t necessarily play into the agency\'s considerations about enforcing existing laws.\n\nHowever, she did stress the wide mandate the DOJ has to prosecute criminal activities does not depend solely on physical location of an individual or entity, adding:\n\n""Let\'s say an exchange is engaged in laundering illegal proceeds, and the underlying criminal activity is here, that under the law is sufficient to affect the jurisdiction of this district. Likewise if the exchange is doing business in the district or purposefully directing their business activities here, that may also be sufficient. The law is not such that a company has to be physically headquartered here in order to fall within the jurisdiction here.""\n\nRole and responsibilities\n\nThe new role is an outgrowth of Haun\'s experience with transnational and organized criminal syndicates, identity theft, money laundering, and cybercrime; all specialties that led her to an early awareness of the technology.\n\n""About three years ago, I started focusing on the area of digital currency and mobile payments. We saw more organized criminal enterprises were turning to the deep web to buy and sell their goods and services, and also we started to see a lot of overlap with marketplaces where you could buy illegal items with bitcoin or other digital currencies,"" she recalled. ""So, I started asking ‘What is bitcoin?’""\n\nToday, Haun\'s role, while constantly evolving, has her coordinating the district\'s cases involving digital currencies and new financial technologies; keeping abreast of new developments in the industry and conducting training with other agencies on the technology.\n\n""The office was very supportive of the efforts to focus on these new technologies. That makes a lot of sense since our district covers the entire bay area and in many ways Silicon Valley is ground zero, where a lot of the action and investment in this sphere is happening in the US,"" she explained.\n\nHer personal education process, Haun said, continues to this day. She attends conferences as her casework allows, and presides over regular meetings (she did not comment as to how regular) of a task force where government agencies share information on cases involving digital currencies.\n\nAccording to Haun, the task force started as an informal group of government agents who needed to better understand how to navigate the complexities of investigating and prosecuting crimes in this environment. Early questions, she said, focused on subjects ranging from how Tor mail accounts worked to best practices for seizure warrants for cases involving bitcoin.\n\nHaun is also involved in attempts to bring together law enforcement officials with members of the bitcoin and blockchain industry. However, she emphasized that such professional outreach is focused on uniting participants in both fields toward common goals for the public good.\n\nHaun concluded:\n\n""We have to be able to do our job irrespective of whether we face criticism. We can\'t shy away from prosecutions that might be unpopular. Our job is to pursue justice and enforce the law.""\n\nKathryn Haun is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Banks and governments are warming up to the possibility of leveraging the power and resiliency of the blockchain to implement smarter financial systems that permit faster and cheaper local and global transactions, permanently recorded in a tamper-proof blockchain. At the same time, financial institutions and states find some aspects of Bitcoin worrisome.\n\nOne concern is that the Bitcoin network relies on anonymous miners to validate transactions. This concern is addressed by various concepts and implementations of “permissioned blockchains” that are popping up, which would offer the advantages of digital currencies powered by public blockchains but be restricted to banks and vetted financial operators. Permissioned blockchains have been supported by Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters, andcriticized by Jon Matonis and legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, among others.\n\nAnother concern is the privacy and semi-anonymity of Bitcoin. Many governments have expressed the position that private digital currencies shouldn’t be tolerated because they can facilitate criminal activities and money laundering, and make tax collection much more difficult. So, on the one hand governments wish to modernize the financial system with blockchain technology, but, on the other hand, they want to remove privacy.\n\nConcepts and implementations of blockchains without privacy, where all users are explicitly identified, and all transactions traceable by the government by design, are beginning to appear.\n\nThe website of “identifiable digital currency” GreenCoinX highlights a statement of Bill Gates in a 2014 Bloomberg TV interview:\n\n“The customers we’re talking about aren’t trying to be anonymous, they’re willing to be known, so Bitcoin technology is key, and you can add to it or you could build a similar technology where there’s enough attribution where people feel comfortable that this is nothing to do with terrorism or any type of money laundering,” said Gates.\n\nGreenCoinX, developed by GreenCoinX Inc., a company jointly owned by lead developer Nilam Doctor and investment company GreenBank Capital Inc, has digital identification built-in.\n\n“Other cryptocurrencies are not identifiable and, therefore, those cryptocurrencies are not only susceptible to be used for illegal purposes, but are not easily taxable by governments,” state the developers. “These concerns make global acceptance of cryptocurrency transactions more difficult. GreenCoinX provides a solution by adding email and phone identification to all GreenCoinX transactions. Those intending illegal activities will likely not use GreenCoinX as they can be easily identified. Furthermore, global governments will be able to collect taxes based on GreenCoinX transactions with country-by-country rules for each type of transaction.”\n\nGreenCoinX is clearly and unambiguously targeted at governments. The developers hope that governments around the world will adopt their digital currency to automate tax collections in the context of an efficient digital economy. The government section of the GreenCoinX website invites all governments to contact the developers to build custom implementations of GreenCoinX tailored to specific national requirements and laws.\n\n“GreenCoinX is flexible and modifiable such that each government can decide what identification rules they require for a GreenCoinX transaction and what country-specific taxes should be attached to each transaction,” reads the call for interest. “Additional parameters can be added on an as-needed basis depending on the requirements of each country.”\n\nThe GNU Taler project, promoted by the Free Software Foundation and developed in the GNU framework in collaboration with INRIA, is a new free software system for electronic payments under development. Unlike BitCoin or cash payments, Taler will be aimed at ensuring that governments can easily track their citizens’ income and thus collect sales, value-added or income taxes. Taler will not be a new currency, but use an electronic mint holding financial reserves in existing currencies such as U.S. dollars, euros or bitcoin.\n\nThe government section of the GNU Taler website notes that, with Taler, the receiver of any form of payment is known, and the payment information comes attached with some details about what the payment was made for. “Thus, governments can use this data to tax businesses and individuals based on their income, making tax evasion and black markets less viable.”\n\nHowever, GNU Taler is different from GreenCoinX because, while it doesn’t protect the identity of the merchant, it does protect the identity of the customer. The identity of a customer won’t be revealed to the merchant, and the government won’t be able to learn how consumers spend their electronic money.\n\n“To facilitate [end user anonymity], we are developing a system for anonymous payment called GNU Taler,” said Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman in a comment posted to the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies website. “With anonymous payment, we can put an end to surveillance-based web services that collect dossiers about their users.”\n\nThe GNU Taler project seems an interesting attempt to put together two conflicting requirements – anonymity for consumers and ability for the government to tax merchants. However, the government doesn’t want to know only how much a merchant earns, but also who buys what. Therefore, it seems likely that governments would prefer simpler systems with no privacy at all, such as GreenCoinX.', 'Coinalytics has raised $1.1m as part of a seed round led by Palo Alto-based incubator The Hive.\n\nFounded in April 2014, Coinalytics describes itself as a ""real-time intelligence service"" for blockchain platforms.

09/11/2015,"['Japanese prosecutors have charged the head of collapsed Bitcoin exchange MtGox with embezzlement, amid fraud allegations over the disappearance of hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-worth of the virtual currency.\n\nThe indictment of France-born Mark Karpeles, 30, comes after he was taken into police custody in Tokyo last month over the affair. He remained in custody on Friday but has the option of petitioning the court for release pending trial.\n\nThe charges are tied to allegations that Mr Karpeles falsified data, while another relates to claims he pocketed millions of dollars of Bitcoin deposits.\n\nHe has been held without formal charge for six weeks, as allowed under Japanese law.\n\nMr Karpeles was first taken into custody over claims he fraudulently tinkered with data and transferred funds to other firms controlled by him dozens of times between 2011 and 2013.\n\nHe was later rearrested for allegedly pocketing about 321m yen (£1.7m) worth of Bitcoin deposits, extending an initial three-week incarceration, during which time police likely grilled him over the incident.\n\nBitcoins are generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the world, and are not backed by any government or central bank, unlike traditional currencies.\n\nTokyo-based MtGox shut down last year after admitting 850,000 coins - worth around $480m (£311m) at the time, or $387m at current exchange rates - had disappeared from its digital vaults.\n\nThe exchange, which once said it handled around 80pc of global Bitcoin transactions, filed for bankruptcy protection soon after the cyber-money went missing, leaving a trail of angry investors calling for answers.\n\nThe company initially said there was a bug in the software underpinning Bitcoins that allowed hackers to steal them.\n\nMr Karpeles later claimed he had found some 200,000 of the lost coins in a ""cold wallet"" - a storage device, such as a memory stick, that is not connected to other computers.\n\nBut the whereabouts of the money and Mr Karpeles\' involvement appear far from solved.\n\n""I\'m happy the police have made breakthroughs on investigating the missing fiat money, but it would be unsatisfying if after all this time all we get is a conviction for manipulated records and embezzlement only amounting to a fraction of all the money people lost,"" Bitcoin investor Kim Nilsson told AFP.\n\n""It may be better than nothing for the people who want to see someone held responsible, but I think we should be expecting more.""\n\nYoshimitsu Homma, head of Japan Digital Money Association, called Mr Karpeles\' arrest ""good news"".\n\nBut ""the issue is in the past for the virtual currency world itself, and more people are getting interested"" in digital money, he added.\n\nThe case presented a complex challenge to Japanese police, as financial watchdogs around the world struggle to work out how to regulate digital money, which started to appear around 2009.\n\nInvestors have called on the firm\'s court-appointed administrators to publicise its data so that experts around the world can help analyse what happened at MtGox.\n\nIn a recent interview with Japan\'s top-selling Yomiuri newspaper, Mr Karpeles\' mother said her ""genius"" son learned computer languages at age three and started making simple programmes of his own two years later.\n\nIn 2006, Mr Karpeles - who reportedly lived in an $11,000-a-month Tokyo penthouse - wrote on his blog that computer crime was ""totally contrary to my ethical principles"".\n\nBut four years later, a Paris court sentenced him in absentia to a year in prison for hacking. He had travelled to Japan to work for a web development company in 2009 and later got involved with the Bitcoin exchange.\n\nBackers say virtual currencies provide an efficient and anonymous way to store and transfer funds online. But critics argue the lack of legal framework governing the currency, the opaque way it is traded and its volatility make it dangerous.\n\nBitcoin\'s reputation was also damaged when US authorities seized funds as part of an investigation into the online black market Silk Road.', 'JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described the situation in the simplest terms. ""Silicon Valley is coming,"" he said.\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders this past spring, Dimon warned the Wall Street old guard that their way of doing things was under siege from ""hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money."" Traditional banking was facing a world of more ""seamless and competitive"" alternatives. JP Morgan, he said, would work to modernize its own services and, if need be, partner with those same Silicon Valley startups striving to undermine the way the banking industry has long done business.\n\nHis warning, it turns out, did not go unheeded. Over the past several months, Wall Street has embraced the new wave of Silicon Valley fintech with remarkable speed. The latest example: earlier this week, a small San Francisco outfit called Chain said it had received $30 million in funding from such names as Nasdaq, Citi Ventures, Capital One Financial, and Visa.\n\nWall Street has embraced the latest wave of Silicon Valley financial tech with remarkable speed.\n\nChain helps build financial systems based on the blockchain, the online public ledger that underpins the bitcoin digital currency, a technology that could bring more efficiency and security not only to the way we exchange money, but to the way we trade other financial assets, including stocks, bonds, and futures. Nasdaq, the company behind the Nasdaq stock exchange, is already partnering with Chain to build a digital marketplace for shares in private companies, and Chain CEO Adam Ludwin says that other investors are using the company\'s tech to create their own systems atop the blockchain idea.\n\n""All of our investors are either existing partners with commercial engagements, or they are serious prospective commercial partners, where we had already had discussions about engagements,"" Ludwin says. It\'s telling, he says, that six big financial institutions have bought into a high-risk, early-stage startup at the same time. ""They don\'t just want ROI on an investment. They want to build.""\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange has invested in the San Francisco bitcoin infrastructure company Coinbase. Goldman Sachs has backed bitcoin consumer services company Circle Internet Financial. And Digital Asset Holdings, an outfit led by former J.P. Morgan Chase exec Blythe Masters, is developing a ""cryptosecurity"" systemsimilar to the one fashioned by Nasdaq and Chain. In the world of bitcoin alone, Wall Street is pushing forward in myriad ways.\n\nMarkets, Streamlined\n\nThe blockchain is essentially an online ledger governed by cryptographic algorithms. In the case of bitcoin, this ledger tracks the movement of digital currency, but it can also oversee, well, anything else that has value. The hope is that in bringing things like stock trading onto this cryptographically secured online database, we can streamline the markets in enormous ways.\n\nIn applying the blockchain to the Nasdaq Private Market, Nasdaq and Chain aim to provide a better way for companies to manage their shares before going public. Typically, pre-iPO companies do this in ad hoc ways (think: computer spreadsheets). The blockchain can provide a more efficient way of trading stock and auditing trades. Georgetown professor of finance James Angel, who specializes in the nuts and bolts of trading systems, calls private stock markets ""the perfect application for the blockchain.""\n\nBut as Nasdaq\'s chief technology officer Brad Peterson says, this is merely a first step. The company indicates it will eventually use the blockchain protocol to overhaul its public stock market as well. In creating a need cryptosecurity outfit called TØ.com, online retailer Overstock.com is already well down this path. At the same time, it\'s building a blockchain-based system that oversees stock loans (another enormous market).\n\nThe flip side is that the bitcoin blockchain isn\'t always as secure as some would lead you to believe—and it\'s doesn\'t operate at speeds suited to the public equities markets. But these are the kinds of things Chain aims to fix. In essence, it offers technology that lets companies run their own private blockchain networks and connect their network to each other in faster and more secure ways.\n\nAnd Money Too\n\nAmid the rise of systems from Nasdaq, Overstock, and others, the prevailing trope is that the blockchain is reinventing the equities markets, but not necessarily the way we exchange currency. But Ludwin downplays this characterization.\n\n""What we\'ve built—and only work on with most of our partners—are blockchains that can issue assets of many different kinds,"" he says. ""You have to be able to trade not only one security for another, but for currencies. What you will see are networks that can handle transactions involving all currencies as well as other types of financial instruments.""\n\nIn should be said, however, the equities markets are particularly ripe for change. Trades on the public stock market take as many as three days to settle, and the blockchain can potentially remove this seemingly anachronistic lag time. Today, stock settlement is overseen by an organization called the DTCC, and it\'s telling that even the DTCC is publicly singing the praises of the blockchain. Silicon Valley is coming. And the arms of Wall Street are open.', 'Abra has closed a “highly oversubscribed” Series A funding round, securing just over US$12m. The remittance startup is currently beta testing an app that uses Bitcoin technology to send money around the world. Investors in this round include Arbor Ventures, RRE Ventures and First Round Capital. The company previously raised US$2m in a seed round, earlier this year.\n\n- Jim Robinson, RRE Ventures Managing Partner and Abra Co-Founder\n\nAbra is perhaps one of the most ambitious companies in the Bitcoin remittance industry, seeking to create a global network, rather than focus on a specific regional market. Despite being indicated as one of the obvious use cases for Bitcoin and blockchain technology, Bitcoin based remittance services have yet to gain any significant traction.\n\nThe company launched earlier this year at the Launch Festival, a largest startup conference, and won ‘Best Overall Company.’ The companies CEO, Bill Barhydt, is also co-founder and chairman of Boom Financial, an international mobile money transferring service. Boom followed a similar premise to Abra, allowing the transfer of money internationally through mobile phones, and raised a total of US$17m.\n\nThe startup’s app works through a network of tellers, who are essentially money agents like Western Union’s or MoneyGram’s. Users can send or receive money through them, via the app. Abra holds that its innovation is in the use of bitcoin to settle transactions between the various agents around the world in the background, meaning tellers and users don’t touch the digital currency. Although Abra is primarily targeting emerging markets and cash-based economies, the app allows people to load their credit or debit card to send funds. The startup says the service will be “private, secure, and instant” and will not charge any fees.\n\n“Technically put, Abra is digital cash stored directly on your phone, guaranteed in US Dollars. Abra app-based transfers use the blockchain to settle, and transactions are published directly to the blockchain from your phone. Abra’s back-end servers never touch consumer’s money or their transfer requests. The value of the holdings in your wallet do NOT fluctuate with the value of Bitcoin for at least 3 days after initial deposit onto your phone,"" wrote Barhydt in a RRE Ventures blog post.\n\n- Bill Barhydt, Abra CEO\n\nThe startup said it will soon announce the general availability of the Abra App in its initial launch markets, having already received registrations from tellers and users in over 80 countries. The firm has been running beta tests since March, in Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.\n\nWei Hopeman, of Asian venture firm Arbor, commented “Arbor sees huge potential for the Abra business model globally, but especially in China and Southeast Asia, which are traditionally large cash economies but leapfrogging into mobile payments and bypassing traditional banking and card infrastructure at an accelerating rate. Making cash mobile will unlock a lot of opportunities in these markets and across the region.” Singapore-based Jungle Ventures and Australia-based Carthona Capital also participated in Abra’s Series A.\n\nIn comparison to companies outside of the Bitcoin industry, but still part of the remittance field, Abra’s funding round holds its own. TransferWise secured €6m during it’s A round, Azimo US$11.1m, and Remitly US$11.25m. These companies are among the most prominent startups trying to disrupt consumer money transfers today.\n\nCompared to that of other bitcoin remittance startups, Abras funding round is unprecedented. African startup BitPesa raised $1.1 million in its Series A earlier this year, while Southeast Asian BitSpark and North American Align Commerce each raised an undisclosed “six-figure” sum as part of their respective Angel rounds. Despite being one of the oldest companies in the space, Filipino service Coins.ph has yet to announce a public round.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether digital currency remittances will provide a dramatic cut in remittance fees for the world’s poor. And the idea is not without its critics, doubts, or stumbles.\n\nEarlier this month bitcoin remittance startup Beam announced that it would be dropping the digital currency for international debit and credit cards instead. Some of the reasons the startup gave included that bitcoin was too expensive, because of the exchange between local currencies and the digital currency, a lack of adoption among merchants and its volatility.\n\nThe firm has now moved away from money remittances and instead offers “value remittances,” which allow people outside of a country to give services or goods, or pay bills directly, but not money. It is a model followed by a number of companies because of reduced fees and easier regulation.\n\n“Using an international debit or credit card, you can pay for utility bills, top up airtime, send gifts or even get errands done back home in Ghana,” Beam CEO and cofounder Falk Benke told Disrupt Africa.\n\n- Falk Benke, Beam CEO and Co-Founder\n\nYakov Kofner, money transfer analyst and founder of remittance fee comparison app, SaveonSend, has been among the biggest critics of the digital currencies advantages, having previously said that the case for bitcoin remittances is unproven and its model has yet to be properly thought out.\n\nKonfer makes the case that the transfer of money internationally is not a large proportion of costs for remittance companies, and thus using bitcoin wouldn’t mean a large reduction in fees for consumers. In his opinion other factors are responsible for the cost of remittances, including regulation.\n\n“It becomes apparent that most of [remittance companies’] costs are related to payments for receiving from and discharging funds to customers, customer acquisition, channel infrastructure, customer service, and risk-management-compliance, not in recording transactions or moving money cross-borders,”wrote Kofner in a blog post. “Hence, providers are eagerly looking for more cost-effective ways to collect and distribute funds vis-a-vis customers, acquire customers, deploy offline and online channels, service customers, manage risks of releasing funds before getting paid… not functions where bitcoin seems to be offering a distinctive cost advantage.”\n\nAfter Beam announced it would be dropping bitcoin, Benke wrote on Twitter that although harsh, Konfer’s opinion is “pretty much in line with my personal thoughts.”', 'India may only be the 10th largest economy in the world, but it is the fourth-fastest-expanding, with a forecasted GDP growth of around 5.5% this year. As the country’s major cities are becoming financial powerhouses, it’s little wonder the world’s largest democracy is beginning to take to Bitcoin.\n\nCoindesk, a digital currency news site, listed India as the fourth-most-likely nation in the world to see mass adoption of Bitcoin, behind Argentina, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Some bricks-and-mortar stores have started to accept Bitcoins for payments. ePaisa, a mobile brand, began offering customers the chance to pay in Bitcoins last month. A QR code is scanned using the customer’s wallet app, transferring the currency on-the-spot.\n\nSchools, too, have begun to consider Bitcoin. Dharwad International School in Karnataka began offering Bitcoins for this year’s annual fees. Considering the population of 1.25 billion, which is set to overtake China’s by 2022 – and that India’s remittance industry is calculated at a massive $50-70 billion – it’s no surprise many experts are touting South Asia’s giant as home of the next Bitcoin boom.\n\nIndian banks scrimp on services, and payment platforms such as PayPal can be difficult due to their tendency to freeze transactions. A number of Bitcoin-related firms have emerged in the past few years, to fill that gap.\n\nOne of them, Unocoin, has seen usership rise by 35% per month. It now serves over 20,000 customers, and expects that number to double by the end of this year. “With such a large portion of India being unbanked, we believe that an open source, decentralized digital currency and payment protocol that is nearly free to use and instantaneous to transfer will have huge positive implications for the country,” says founder and president Sunny Ray.\n\nRay and others will have been buoyed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) chief Shri R Gandhi’s comments about the cryptocurrency, made at a Mumbai banking expo on August 25th. “Digital currencies and crowdfunding have the potential to support criminal, anti-social activities like money laundering, terrorist funding and tax evasion,” he said.\n\n“While we do not have any reported instances of crowdfunding in this respect, cryptocurrencies have been widely suspected to finance criminal activities,” added Gandhi. “We have to be carefully and critically watching these developments.”\n\nHis comments on corruption were well-founded. India, despite huge development since the economy was liberalized in 1991, remains one of the world’s most corrupt nations. It is placed 85th of 175 at Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. A 2014 Council on Foreign Relations article claimed that official wrongdoing could cost India $200 billion, or around 10% of its GDP, by 2017.\n\nEven recently-elected prime minister Narendra Modi has become entangled in corruption cases. “The system isn’t subject to bribes,” Megha Mehta, a recent graduate from Rajasthan, says. “The system is bribes.”\n\nMupparaju Siva Kameswara Rao, founder of BTCXIndia, the county’s largest Bitcoin wallet, agrees that Bitcoins could answer some of India’s economic ills. However, he says, the RBI “have so far been fairly vague when it comes to any concrete directions for industry. I think what the community is struggling with the most is the lack of clear guidance on the regulatory side, and we hope to get a more detailed legal framework established soon.”\n\nBTCXIndia requires all potential customers to complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) form upon sign-up, which comprises a number of personal and professional details. “By requiring this amount of verification we make it very hard for unscrupulous users to create accounts,” he says. “We also manually review the information provided in every KYC form before an account is approved for trading.”\n\nNews that some of India’s multinationals, such as Tata and Infosys, plan to adopt Bitcoin, is “a great thing,” adds Ray. “We have been working towards driving bitcoin adoption in India for nearly 3 years and the fact that these heavy weights are now chiming in is a validation of our message.”\n\n“I think they are focused on Blockchain rather than Bitcoin,” says Sandeep Goenka, co-founder at Zebpay. “The zeitgeist that Blockchain, the network behind Bitcoin will be bigger than Bitcoin, the currency, is wrong. But in any case, when reputed companies like this enter the space, it helps to improve the perception of Bitcoin in India.”\n\nPrecise data on Bitcoin usage in India is hard to find, adds Goenka. But it is “a fraction of China.” Blockonomics, another Bitcoin startup, claims that it sees around $4-5 million moving in Bitcoins each month in India. The country en masse, also, is a traditional slow-adopter of new technology, and most experts agree the situation will be little different with Bitcoin.\n\nBut the banking needs are there: fewer than 35% of Indian households maintain bank accounts, and less than 20% owns a debit or credit card. Much of India’s population is still rural. Those of them who suffer from financial disinclusion may have an alternative with Bitcoin.\n\nMonsoon season has just finished in India. Now that the rain has fallen, it seems an ideal time for Bitcoin to move in on an economic powerhouse. “I have a feeling that it will be an exciting journey from the currency from here,” says Rao.', '', 'Bitcoiners got to participate firsthand in the latest CoinWallet stress test on the Bitcoin network Thursday. In a collective exercise, Bitcoiners flooded the network with thousands of transactions as they tried to access 200 free bitcoin (worth about $48,000) from free keys and addresses being released into the system by CoinWallet.\n\nIn what one commentator could describe only as “[expletive] crazy”, Bitcoiners helped CoinWallet test the bitcoin network, and although there are still 84,000 transactions awaiting confirmation at the time of publishing, the network seems to be in good shape.\n\nThe U.K.-based exchange saved itself a lot of work by simply counting on human nature to respond in a predictable fashion and go after the free bitcoin.\n\nAnd in the end, forum comments show that the system was mostly unaffected and people were still able to trade bitcoin. As one commenter noted: “Even though under DDoS attack, the Bitcoin network still worked better than the Commonwealth Bank today!”\n\nThis comes as the Bitcoin community is coming closer to some resolution after a vigorous and open discussion and will be meeting in Montreal this weekend in aScalability Conference to try and resolve the ongoing debate about Bitcoin’s blocksize.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin businesses seem to be adjusting fine, although some have had to increase their fees to get transactions processed.\n\nMycelium’s Dmitry Murashchik told Bitcoin Magazine that he didn’t see much of an effect on their systems.\n\n“I think stress tests are fine. How else will you find problems?” he said.\n\nJack C. Liu from OKCoin told Bitcoin Magazine they didn’t see much of an impact, and, in any case, they use a dynamic fee structure to handle any surges.\n\nCoinWallet has made its point, and the network has survived, and there can be no doubt about the enduring popularity and enthusiasm for owning bitcoin.', 'Mercator Advisory Group is an established advisory and consultancy firm in the financial industry. The specialised payment and banking analysis group began studying blockchain technology in early 2014, releasing it\'s first research note shortly after,\'Global Digital Currency Regulations: Divergent Paths’.\n\nIn the latest note Tim Sloane, Mercator Advisory Group VP of Payments Innovation, provides an overview of what Mercator terms “the Bitcoin economy,” which links the attributes of value, transactions, fees, and Bitcoin miners in a balanced choreography.\n\n- Global Digital Currency Regulations: Divergent Paths\n\nThe 12 page note include 3 exhibits, and provides the group’s definition of sidechains, the identification of technological mechanisms for their implementation, and new approaches to sidechains that have been documented, ""with identification of where they will likely add significant value and where they continue to risk breaking the Bitcoin economic model.""\n\n- Mercator Advisory Group\n\nIt appears that Mercator believe VC investment has the potential to cripple Bitcoin, with high volumes of low value transactions. “The Internet is simply a network enabling interoperability between cooperating entities. This is totally unlike Bitcoin. This Note evaluates the potential impact if new solutions with significant volume embed proof of ownership into the Bitcoin blockchain for long-term assets, such as stock holdings, property, or car titles,” states the company.\n\nIn the note, Sloane evaluates the reported ""brittleness"" of Bitcoin’s current choreography, and documents examples of situations that tested its brittle nature. The report takes past events into consideration, and gives an overview of sidechains, identifying where they could add value and where they could risk breaking the Bitcoin economic model. Mercator Advisory Group intend to make educated recommendations to new businesses for managing these potential risks.\n\n- Tim Sloane, VP, Payments Innovation\n\nSloan focuses on the business impacts of new technologies and their potential for issuers, merchants, card networks, acquirers, and the vendors competing on this tech driven landscape.', 'At the crux of the block-size limit debate in Bitcoin is an argument between scaling and securing the network. Although raising the block-size limit would allow more transactions to be processed in each block, it could also limit the ability for individuals in some parts of the world to run a full node or participate in the mining process. This problem would arise due to the increased costs of processing a greater number of transactions every 10 minutes as a full node.\n\nBlockstream co-founder and President Adam Back recently discussed the security vs. scalability debate on an episode of Epicenter Bitcoin, noting that increased centralization due to a raised block-size limit could be even more problematic when factoring in all of the other forms of centralization that already exist in the digital cash system:\n\n“One of the challenges we’re facing right now with the block size is that decentralization is already under stress. There’s a certain amount of centralization that’s crept in — sort of boiling the frog.”\n\nBack, who created Hashcash (the proof-of-work system used by Bitcoin), then pointed to three specific areas of Bitcoin that already are experiencing problems related to centralization.\n\nMining Pools\n\nThe problems associated with the centralization of Bitcoin mining pools are generally known by the overall Bitcoin community. Whenever a mining pool gets close to 51 percent of the overall network hashrate, there are usually more than a few panic-induced posts on various Bitcoin forums warning of a possible 51 percent attack.\n\nWhen it comes to the fundamental problems associated with large mining pools owning a majority of the network hashrate, Back seems concerned about the ability of those pools to introduce restrictions on certain types of transactions on the Bitcoin network. He stated the following during his interview:\n\n“There are a number of quite high percentage hashrate pools and vertically integrated miners such that, arguably, it would only take a policy decision by maybe three to six of them to fairly, practically implement a policy.”\n\nBack also was quick to note that such a policy implementation would not be completely successful due to the reality that the nefarious mining pools would not be mining every single block on the blockchain:\n\n“Part of the way that Bitcoin achieves policy neutrality is that there are different people who process the transactions, so potentially even if 75 percent of the hashrate wanted to freeze or block a Bitcoin payment — let’s say Wikileaks had received a payment and someone wanted to stop them spending it — still, the remaining 25 percent would eventually process the transaction. So, it would just be delayed, not blocked. Nevertheless, there is a degree of centralization there.”\n\nASIC Mining Hardware Manufacturers\n\nAnother problem Back sees for Bitcoin in terms of centralization has to do with the companies building the hardware that people use for bitcoin mining:\n\n“Another kind of metric is the number of ASIC manufacturers that are selling direct to the public or to small businesses or people that would buy $10,000 or $100,000 worth of mining equipment and put it in a small warehouse or garage or something. The number of independent ASIC manufacturers is, I think, decreasing. There are still a couple that will sell to the public, but there are also more that have turned their attention to vertical integration or have merged or been bought and a few that have gone bankrupt through poor timing in the market.”\n\nOne of the key issues here is that the most efficient mining equipment is becoming centralized in fewer and fewer hands. The fear is that it is becoming much more difficult for the average person to get involved in securing the Bitcoin network through mining — even if they’re willing to put up the relatively large amount of capital needed to build a mining facility. This could eventually lead to issues similar to the policy-related problems covered by Back when referring to mining pools.\n\nLack of Full Nodes\n\nThe third type of centralization that Back sees in Bitcoin is the dwindling number of full nodes. A full node is a node that enforces all rules of the Bitcoin protocol and contains a full copy of the blockchain. Back explained that these nodes are helpful in keeping miners honest:\n\n“Another very interesting one that people are, I think, largely not aware of — which is behind some differences in opinion, I think, at the protocol level — is this concept of running a full node (sort of an auditing node). The percentage of economic interest in the network that is validating transactions that it receives via its own full node — I think we’re seeing evidence that that is falling as well. That is an interesting and necessary part of the Bitcoin security picture — that the proportion of economic interest in the network that is relying on a full node that is under its control or is trusted by it should be relatively high. If it falls too low, there is no longer a security assurance for users because the miners are providing a service to users — particularly for SPV users. If there are no auditors, there’s no kind of checkpoint; there’s only miners balanced against other miners.”\n\nWhen asked to define Bitcoin at the start of the Epicenter Bitcoin interview, Back was sure to make the point that decentralization is the core value proposition of the peer-to-peer cash system. Censorship resistance is what separates Bitcoin from other online payment systems, such as e-gold and PayPal, so it’s easy to see why Back believes the preservation of decentralization is of the utmost importance.', 'In recent years, there has been a lot of enthusiasm for how cryptocurrencies will create new platforms, markets, and economies. But what will the future of commerce and, indeed, the world look like? A vital question, and one that really hasn’t been answered.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRight now, the playing field is a virtual Wild West. The developers behind Bitcoin and Ethereum believe their respective creations can be the platform for everything, and their most vocal chorus of fanboys are crypto-enthusiasts and venture capitalists. But MIT’s Media Lab and the Digital Currency Initiative, in partnership with various other departments, is hoping to change the dialogue, bringing a more balanced approach to imagining the future of commerce. The Media Lab is now offering two courses. The Future of Commerce (MAS.S63) will explore how blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum disrupt existing markets and financial services, and allow graduate students to build new business models, products, or technical concepts. More specifically, students will be taught to imagine the future of money, markets, transactions, and marketplaces, and issues like commerce, security, and privacy. The other course, Blockchain Technologies (MAS.S65), is a deep technical dive into the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin and other digital currencies. The focus will be on how to scale projects on the blockchain while keeping them secure and private. Students will also learn how to design applications on the blockchain; a great idea since this type of technology can sound rather esoteric—though perhaps not to MIT students. David Shrier, the Managing director of MIT Connection Science and one of the creators of the program, tells Fast Company the two courses are complementary. “[Future of Commerce] will help build a company or product/service and [Blockchain Technologies] provides strong technical capabilities around the blockchain,” he says. “Your CTO might take both. Your CEO (unless technical) would probably take the Future of Commerce.” MIT’s David Shrier Origin Story Shrier says that a number of different strands converged in the formation of the courses. For years, the Media Lab had researched not just blockchains and digital currencies, but the future of commerce: predicting markets, harnessing crowds, tuning networks of financial traders to financial policies, and how people could reliably and securely take a currency out of a central ledger (i.e., a central bank). With the Bitcoin blockchain, the last point was suddenly a reality—a decentralized currency that simply exists “out there in the cloud,” as Shrier put it. The creation of the Digital Currency Initiative within the Media Lab, in collaboration with Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and MIT Sloan School of Management, also played a part. Add to this a considerable amount of student interest and the emergence and maturation of peer-to-peer networks, and a course on the blockchain became a no-brainer for the Media Lab.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“We want to try and bring all of these things together under one roof, and help inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs,” says Shrier. “We hope to attract MBAs, engineers, designers, and community leader-oriented individuals who are all interested in innovating commerce. The idea is to build multi-disciplinary teams that will work in different problems and hopefully come up with some solutions.” So, what will set the future digital currency CEO apart from more traditional CEO of the 20th and early 21st century? Brian Forde, director of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, wagers that the “Bitcoin CEO” will be similar to a CEO of a company that already uses emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, the sharing economy, and so on. Forde, the former White House advisor for Mobile & Data Innovation, says the reason for this is that there is no specific plan that can serve as a model for future blockchain-based companies. “You’re breaking existing business models because you have access to new, colorful technologies that haven’t previously been created,” Forde says. “You can’t just read a Harvard Business Review case study to look at past examples because you’re going to be breaking new ground. So, you’ll have to be thoughtful about the implications of what you’re doing and what you can’t see around the corner.” Infinite Space Forde draws a parallel between the blockchain and the creation of a “relatively infinite amount of storage” online for very low cost. At one point, no one could have imagined it. Now we have platforms like YouTube, Dropbox, and others. Similarly, Forde says that no one could have imagined the transaction infrastructure of a bank or credit card company, and now we have that in the form of the blockchain. This gives startup entrepreneurs access to an infrastructure that can scale to a similar size without the cost of building bank infrastructure to process transactions. What happens when the the cost of that infrastructure goes to near zero, and new business models emerge out of this? That’s the question Forde and Shrier hope to answer in the Future of Commerce course by sparking student imagination. Not surprisingly, that imagination will have to be tuned to various frequencies. Indeed, the future Bitcoin CEO will have to understand cryptography, data, privacy, computer science, economics, monetary policy, design, and various other topics.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDirector of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative Brian Forde “The toolkit is going to have be pretty big,” Forde says. “No one’s a jack-of-all-trades, but you have to have at least a basic understanding of those different areas, which is what makes it so exciting. “It’s going to require us collaborating with MIT’s Sloan Business School and the schools of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science,” Forde adds. “And that’s why we have 15 professors working on this because they all come from different disciplines, and it’s going to require all of their insights to be able to build a Bitcoin-based company in the future.” Though there is a particular emphasis on commerce when Shrier and Forde talk coursework, don’t mistake the new MIT program for an academic pipeline for-profit ventures. There is a big social dimension at the heart of MIT, and this bleeds into the Digital Currency Initiative and the two new courses. Shrier thinks a better way of describing the program’s goal is as inspiring the next generation of “innovators.” This person could be a community or entrepreneurial innovator. Shrier points to Development Ventures, a course led by instructors Joost Bonsen and Sandy Pentland (one of four Future of Commerce teachers) to emphasize MIT’s commitment to positive social change. In this action lab, students build a venture with one design constraint: It must solve a problem that impacts at least one billion people in the least wealthy countries around the globe. “Similarly, with future commerce, we’re not restricted to for-profit business models,” Shrier says. “There have been some interesting innovations around using these democratized currencies to build stronger senses of community.” “One of the students in Development Ventures created a mobile phone-based company, Assured Labor, that helps people find jobs,” Shrier adds. “They partnered with a big telecom and piloted it in Nicaragua and it did really well, and then it got deployed in Mexico and now is one of the biggest platforms in Latin America. That’s another example of future commerce—making it easier for people to transact and connect with each other to get jobs.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nShrier imagines a world where communities develop their own currencies, based on the blockchain, for a local co-op. This arrangement would essentially create a new version of the barter economy that, he says, “can serve to both build a sense of collaboration and (in theory) hedge against an inflationary currency issued by a central bank—as long as the community holds a constant internal exchange rate”. Enhanced Prosperity These commerce innovations wouldn’t be designed or intended to make money themselves. Instead, Shrier said they would serve as a foundation for improving the flow of goods in and out of a community, “enhancing prosperity” in the process. Shrier also sees examples of future commerce in social entrepreneur Duncan Goldie-Scot’s Mobile Microfinance Ltd., a U.K.-based nonprofit that seeks to facilitate microfinance as an engine of economic growth in Africa; and Donors Choose, a website that connects international donors with classrooms with very specific educational needs. “Now, technology lets us take a digital currency and give it to a poor community in Ecuador so they can have their own community-building currency that can bring people closer together,” Shrier adds. “You can do a lot in Africa and Asia, and we find it exciting that we can drive global change.” Forde also believes blockchain technology could be used to distribute social welfare in developing nations, evolving it from a cash process into a digital process. More than 2 billion adults around the world do not have access to a bank account, Forde notes, making it difficult to both receive social welfare and drive economic growth through traditional savings and borrowing mechanisms. A future blockchain innovator could help solve this problem. Forde also says the blockchain could help with issues arising out identity. For example, Forde notes that approximately 33% of children under the age of 5 do not have a government-issued ID. According to UNESCO research, he says, “exclusion from social services, due to lack of formal citizenship status and ID, is the single greatest risk factor contributing to the trafficking of girls in places like Thailand.” So maybe, just maybe, a future blockchain innovator could tackle human trafficking. And that’s the type of lateral thinking that Shrier and Forde want to bring to the Media Lab’s new blockchain courses.\n\nadvertisement', 'In February, Bitcoin Magazine reported Google’s preliminary announcement of Android Pay. In June, we reported the official announcement of Android Pay at the annual Google I/O event on May 28 and 29, where Google revealed more information on its upcoming payment platform.\n\nOn Thursday, September 10, Google announced that it is beginning to roll outAndroid Pay.\n\n“We’ll be rolling out gradually over the next few days, and this is just the beginning,” notes the announcement. “We will continue to add even more features, banks and store locations in the coming months, making it even easier to pay with your Android phone.”\n\nAndroid Pay works with all NFC-enabled Android devices (running KitKat 4.4+), on any mobile carrier, at every tap and pay-ready location across the U.S. Android Pay will support credit and debit cards from the four major payment networks: American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa, issued by the most popular banks and credit unions.\n\nExisting Google Wallet users will be able to access Android Pay through an update to the Wallet app. For new users, Android Pay will be available for download on Google Play in the next few days. Currently, seven out of 10 Android phones in the U.S. are equipped for Android Pay, and the app will come pre-installed on new NFC-enabled Android phones from AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless.\n\n“Starting Thursday, shoppers will be able to use their phone to pay at more than one million retail stores in the U.S. that have point-of-sale registers equipped with near field communication technology, known as NFC,” Fortune reports. “Android Pay incorporates fingerprint biometrics to authenticate payments, whereby people verify their identity by pressing their finger onto their phone’s screens.”\n\nAndroid Pay is, evidently, Google’s response to Apple Pay. The two systems are remarkably similar, but Android Pay seems more flexible – as is usually the case when comparing Apple’s walled garden to Android’s more open ecosystem. Android owns a much larger slice of the mobile devices market, especially in the developing world where mobile payments are growing faster. According to IDC, Android dominated the smartphone market with an 82.8 percent share in the second quarter of 2015, and it’s the only mobile OS whose share is growing, while iOS, Windows Phone and Blackberry are all declining. Android Pay could, therefore, boost mobile payments.\n\n“Android Pay doesn’t store or transmit your credit card number,” notes The Wall Street Journal. “Instead, like Apple Pay, it relies on an industry-standard approach called ‘tokenization.’ After you enter a card into Android Pay, the app generates a unique code called a token. Each card has its own token, and each token is specific to each Android. When you make a purchase with Android Pay, this token is used to create yet another temporary token to complete a purchase.”\n\nAfter launch, Android Pay will support in-store payments in more than 1 million checkout stands in the U.S. that currently work with Android Pay. Besides adding more stores, Google will enable in-app payments via Android Pay. The feature, according to the Android Pay developers website, is coming soon. “Android Pay requires no changes to your payment processing,” reads Google’s invitation to developers wishing to integrate Android Pay into their apps. Apparently, Google will offer developers the possibility to channel all sorts of payments in their apps through the enhanced authentication and security features of Android pay, and leave the rest as it is.\n\n“Leading payment gateways and processing platforms are also adding support to make it even easier for developers to enable Android Pay,“ says Google. Bitcoin-friendly companies Braintree and Stripe are among the payment processors integrating Android Pay in their platforms.\n\nIt is also possible that Bitcoin wallet and payment apps developers will integrate Android Pay. According to information currently available, it appears that Bitcoin operators will be able to do so.\n\n“We are doing it in a way so that anybody else can build a payments service on top of Android,” Sundar Pichai – who was announced as the next Google CEO in August – said in March. That seems to imply that any external Bitcoin service will be able to integrate Android Pay. More will be known when further details of the Android Paydeveloper program are released.']"
09/12/2015,"['Does the Bitcoin community need another wallet? Amsterdam-based BlockTrail reckons there’s space for another player, despite some sizable and well-funded wallet entities already — such as Blockchain.info and Coinbase, to name two. The former has raised around $30 million to date, according to Crunchbase, and apparently racked up around 4 million users; while the latter has some $107 million in funding and circa 2.5 million users.\n\nOther pretty visible wallets include Circle and Xapo, and there are of course scores of smaller wallet apps. (Albeit bit-player wallet apps might not be the kind of place you want to store your Bitcoin wealth.)\n\nThe new Dutch challenger BlockTrail, which has been live in the Bitcoin analytics space since 2014 — and is backed by €500,000 in seed funding from its co-founder Lev Leviev (who also founded Russian Facebook rival Vk.com) — has just launched a multi-platform Bitcoin wallet (iOS, Android and web) which it claims is more secure than some existing alternatives, owing to implementing multi-signature and HD wallet, which earlier-to-market Bitcoin wallets may not have.\n\nAnd which it says is more in keeping with the decentralized spirit of Bitcoin — since users of its wallet create and store their own private keys, rather than trusting in it to be a central key control and coin repository — a la Coinbase, for instance. Update: NB: Coinbase does, however, offer a multi-signature vault product for pro users which also lets users keep their own encryption keys (although the vault has a withdrawal wait period so does not function in the same way as an instant-access wallet). Of the vault it notes: “Coinbase has no ability to move funds (which means you are safe from Coinbase being hacked, going bankrupt, or anyone seizing your bitcoin). It also means that you as a customer have much greater responsibility in storing your backup key securely. If you lose this backup and forget your multisig password, Coinbase cannot help you recover your bitcoin. For this reason, we only recommend this feature for advanced users.”\n\nThe advantage of a decentralized wallet, according to BlockTrail co-founder and CEO Boaz Bechar, is that the BlockTrail wallet user retains control over their Bitcoins, and can’t be locked out by a centralized service provider should that entity decide they need to freeze your account, say, or be told to by the authorities. Or should they be hacked. Or else vanish into the ether taking your coins with them — a la the Mt. Gox exchange saga. The nascent Bitcoin landscape has had more than its fair share of Wild West moments already.\n\nOf course some people might want the reassurance of trusting a large, well-funded entity that has insurance underwriting the risks of hacking so the company can claim it will reimburse users for any lost Bitcoins. But as BlockTrail’s co-founders point out, that’s not so very different to trusting a traditional bank. And if it’s centralized financial control you’re after then why are you even involved with Bitcoin at all? (Well, presumably you might just be a currency trader trying to profit off Bitcoin price fluctuations, rather than a decentralized cryptocurrency ideologue. But still, they have a point.)\n\nThe whole reason why people get into Bitcoin is to no longer be dependent on a bank. The motto that I like about Bitcoin is ‘be your own bank’. You don’t want to be part of a financial system that keeps you hostage when they own your funds.\n\n“The whole reason why people get into Bitcoin is to no longer be dependent on a bank,” says BlockTrail CTO Ruben De Vries. “The motto that I like about Bitcoin is ‘be your own bank’. You don’t want to be part of a financial system that keeps you hostage when they own your funds.”\n\n“People [in the Bitcoin community] know us, and there’s reason to trust our brand and use our apps. But in the case of Bitcoin you don’t even need to trust us, so if we were to disappear… people still own their Bitcoins. We cannot run away with their Bitcoins. And they could still use the app and restore their wallets even without us, which is really what makes us special,” adds Bechar.\n\nA decentralized wallet does have some potential draw backs though, on the usability front — given the service can’t carry out certain actions immediately as it does not hold the coins itself. So there’s likely more back and forth between the wallet and the user when they want to do things with their coins, say like sending them to someone else or instantly selling them. Although BlockTrail argues that multi-signature and HD wallet now make it easier for a decentralized wallet to smooth out these sort of usability wrinkles.\n\nIs BlockTrail targeting its wallet at core Bitcoin community users, or trying to cast a wider net to more mainstream consumers who might be thinking about starting to dabble with BTC? Initially they say the target is Bitcoin savvy types, perhaps developers who have already been using its Bitcoin API and blockchain explorer. But they add the aim is to reach out beyond existing well-informed Bitcoin nerds — and are in fact touting ‘UI simplicity’ as one of their differentiators, despite being a decentralized wallet service.\n\n“We are interested in bringing Bitcoin to the masses, to the widest audience possible,” says Leviev. “For example one of the functionalities that’s available and we’re going to improve is that you can send Bitcoins to anyone in your contact list even if they don’t have a wallet downloaded.\n\n“So initially you will basically get an SMS saying ‘hey try out this wallet and get a Bitcoin that I’d sending you’, and that’s how we think we can build from the existing community to a wider audience.”\n\nSuch features are possible on BlockTrail’s wallet from the get-go because it’s benefiting from later developments in Bitcoin’s infrastructure, according to the team. “Because we came in a little later than a lot of the other wallets we’ve been able to think about things better, so we also have a lot of these convenient functionalities in our app,” argues de Vries.\n\n“We differ from Blockchain wallet because we use different technology from them. They came around when HD wallet and multi-signature wasn’t yet around… We were able to start off our infrastructure built on multi-signature and built on HD wallet. And this offers users a better all around wallet and technology,” says Bechar.\n\n“The space is very fragmented. There’s not that many big players that offer a good technology for the user and we think there’s space for a product like ours which offers better security and stays true to Bitcoin’s values by allowing users to keep their private keys,” he adds.\n\nFrom an operations point of view, BlockTrail’s decentralized approach is clearly a lot leaner than the likes of Coinbase — the team is only around six staff at this stage (vs Coinbase’s up to 250 circa 110 staff). And it also claims it does not need to shell out such big sums on regulation and compliance, and so doesn’t need to have as much investor capital in the bank.\n\n“[Coinbase] operates more like a bank. And we don’t really offer these services. We will plan to offer them later on, through partners, but our operations are very different — even though the product might seem the same to a person who is not very familiar with Bitcoin,” says Bechar. “We don’t have the kind of operation that requires compliance officers. And a large team of operations such as when you run a big exchange like Coinbase. They have multiple different products. It’s a different operation.”\n\n“The regulation mostly comes into play when there’s an exchange of some sort from a cryptocurrency to a fiat currency. Currently at the way we’re structured we don’t provide this service. And while we do have plans to provide this we’re going to do it through third parties and partners that we’re working with,” he adds.\n\nTo be clear, although it does not have access to its users Bitcoins, BlockTrail is not ‘zero knowledge’ — it can see your transactions and knows how many Bitcoin you are storing in the wallet. And given its wallet is a mobile phone app, it’s not the kind of place a clued up Bitcoin user would want to store huge amounts of coins.\n\nIf you have serious BTC wealth you’d be storing the majority in an offline desktop client (with two-factor authentication enabled, and likely other limits — such as on which IP addresses can access it and where coins can be sent). So a mobile Bitcoin wallet like BlockTrail would only be useful as a repository for a subset of your coins — say, if you want to have some handy for trading/day to day use.\n\nBut for less well-heeled Bitcoin owners, Bechar reckons BlockTrail could be their sole wallet. “I think most people will find they’re using one wallet, and when we get to the mainstream users they’re using one wallet and will have these spending limits [such as daily caps] to keep them more secure,” he says.\n\nBlockTrail is hoping to grab 100,000 users by the end of the year. The team says it is open sourcing its wallet code too, to further bolster trust in its claims.\n\nThe wallet is free to use, with the business model focused on monetizing via — as Bechar puts it — “added-value financial services”, via third party partnerships with Bitcoin brokers. The aim being to make it easier for newbies to buy and sell Bitcoins — and for BlockTrail to take a small per transaction fee for that added convenience.\n\n“It’s not going to be an exchange, but it’s going to be an easier way to buy and sell Bitcoin,” says Bechar. “We’re looking to do that through parties that already provide this functionality… There’s brokers worldwide, for example here in the Netherlands there’s a company that sells Bitcoins so we integrate with them. So we’re looking to do this through a global partnership network with brokers.”\n\n“The exchanges are the best place to buy your Bitcoins at the best rate but they require a lot of effort, of signing up, verifying your ID, verifying your address, then having to do bank transfers to them. It’s a lot of hassle. Also it scares people because… it’s just not an easy way. So using an exchange is really if you’re a trader,” adds de Vries. “[Brokers] are a lot easier to use because you don’t have to go through all the pain that most exchanges have. So we want to partner with these companies… Every country usually has a few, and they’ve all figured out how to work within their own regulations.”\n\nHe points out that working with local partners agains contrasts with Coinbase’s approach — since it’s taking on the challenge of complying with all relevant Bitcoin regulations itself. “They’re really going [U.S.] state by state, having to deal with all the different rules in every state, spending millions on just all this crap basically and they’re barely moving to Europe because here again they have to go country by country figuring out what the rules are, how the banks are going to respond when they want to do this. So that’s why if we can use local partners… that allows us to get into that country quickly and without too much hassle.”\n\nAt this stage BlockTrail has “a few” such partnerships inked in Europe, and none in the U.S. as yet, so will be looking to build out this partnership network — assuming it can first galvanize a solid user-base behind another decentralized Bitcoin wallet play.\n\nThis article was edited to clarify that Coinbase does offer a decentralized vault product, in addition to a Bitcoin wallet in which it holds the users’ encryption keys', 'The block-size limit debate has dominated Bitcoin blogs, forums, chat rooms and meet-ups for months on end, while many of Bitcoin’s brightest minds are gathering in Montreal to discuss the issue face-to-face at the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop this weekend.\n\nSo far, however, the two sides of the debate have made little progress coming to a consensus. At least for some part, this seems to result from a difference of visions – visions that are based on a different set of priorities.\n\nOne of these visions – represented by Bitcoin XT developers Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn – is straightforward and clear. For Bitcoin to succeed, they believe it needs to grow, preferably fast. And for Bitcoin to grow fast, it needs to be cheap, accessible and easy to use. This, in turn, means that the block-size limit needs to increase in order for more transactions to fit on Bitcoin’s blockchain, for fees to remain low, and without having to rely on complicated and far-off alternative solutions. This could mean that some aspects of the Bitcoin ecosystem need to specialize further, but that was always to be expected.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, a majority of Bitcoin’s most active developers think it’s not that simple. For them, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is sacrosanct, and they believe that an increase of the block-size limit represents a trade-off with this core feature. Some of these developers – perhaps best described as Bitcoin’s “decentralists” – even warn that too big an increase could destroy the system as a whole.\n\nBut for many outside this select group developers it still seems unclear why, exactly, big blocks could pose such a grave threat. To find out, Bitcoin Magazinespoke with four of the most prominent of these decentralists: Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille, Bitcoin Core developer and long-term block-size conservative Peter Todd, hashcash inventor and Blockstream founder and president Dr. Adam Back, and well-known cryptographer and digital currency veteran Nick Szabo.\n\nMining Centralization\n\nAccording to decentralists, the problem of big blocks is essentially twofold. On one hand there is the basic assumption that bigger blocks favor bigger miners – presumably mining pools. On the other hand is the fact that bigger blocks complicate mining anonymously.\n\nThe main (though not only) reason bigger blocks favor bigger miners has to do with latency. As the block size increases, so does the time it takes for a newfound block to transmit through the Bitcoin network. That is disadvantageous to all miners, except for the miner that found the block. During the time it takes a new block to make its way through the network, the miner who found the block gets a head start mining on top of the new block, while other miners are still busy mining on top of an older block. So as a miner find more blocks, it gets more head starts. And as a miner gets more head starts, it finds more blocks. Meanwhile on the other end of the equation, smaller miners find fewer blocks and, as a result, have more trouble turning a profit, ultimately causing them to drop off the network. Bigger blocks tend to centralize mining.\n\nThis problem is worsened, moreover, if a miner wishes to remain anonymous, and wants to use Tor. Since latency on the Tor network is always higher, the problem as described above is simply magnified. If smaller miners are disadvantaged by bigger blocks to the point where it’s hard to remain profitable on a regular connection, miners using Tor don’t even stand a chance.\n\nNeither of these arguments against bigger blocks is controversial in itself. The controversy lies in the question how big is too big. Andresen and Hearn believe an increase to 8 megabytes or even 20 megabytes should be OK, and assume that it’s fine to grow this limit to 8 gigabytes over a 20-year time period.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Dr. Pieter Wuille explained why this assumption is not shared by decentralists.\n\n“It is obvious that block propagation is too slow already,” Wuille said. “A recent software update revealed that several mining pools maintain arrangements where they share block headers – the minimal required part of an actual block – the moment they find a new block. All miners in on the deal then start mining on top of that block header instead of waiting for the full block to propagate over the network – waiting would cut into their profits too much.”\n\nExplaining why this is a problem, Wuille continued:\n\n“This practice is harmful for Bitcoin, as it requires a lot of trust among miners. They no longer verify the validity of blocks individually, and instead just rely on their peers. But validating blocks is supposed to be a miner’s main task on the Bitcoin network…”\n\nMoreover, decentralists warn there might be no turning back once bitcoin mining has become too centralized. At that point, the remaining miners could have created a deadlock on the mining market, essentially preventing newcomers to compete profitably.\n\nCore developer and long-time block-size conservative Peter Todd told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“The big concern we have here is, as we reduce these security margins, we’ll see the already worryingly small number of pools decrease even further. Even more concerning though, is that while currently it’s pretty easy to start a new pool if an existing one ‘goes rogue,’ bigger blocks can make it much more difficult to do so, because from the beginning you’ll be much less profitable than the big pools.”\n\nAnd while it has been suggested that miners can connect to a VPS if they prefer to remain anonymous rather than connect through Tor, this is not quite satisfying for decentralists either. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, hashcash inventor and Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back explained why.\n\n“It is technically possible to mine using a VPS (Virtual Private Server), but miners who do so are not choosing their own transactions,” Back emphasized. “Instead, they connect to a server that does this for them. It’s another form of centralization, at the extreme. And we already see this happening due to bad connectivity in some countries, where miners use VPS services set up in another country to win some time and increase profits…”\n\nRegulation\n\nDecentralization – and anonymity – might be sacrosanct for decentralists, but that does not mean they are goals in and of themselves. Instead, decentralists cling to these properties because they believe the health of the Bitcoin network relies on them. It’s only through decentralization and anonymity that the system can remain free from outside influence, such as government regulation.\n\n“Bitcoin achieves policy neutrality by decentralization of mining,” Back explained. “If one miner won’t mine your transaction, another will. It’s an additional benefit if miners are many, geographically dispersed and anonymous, since it’s complex to coordinate a policy imposition on many small geographically dispersed miners. And it’s even more complex to impose policy on someone who is anonymous.”\n\nIf, on the other hand, Bitcoin reaches the point where only a handful of professional miners will be able to profitably partake in the process of Bitcoin mining, and if these miners are no longer able to do so anonymously, decentralists worry that Bitcoin’s fundamental properties might be at risk.\n\n“It is pretty clear that forcing the Bitcoin protocol to implement anti-money laundering policy and blacklisting of funds is a long-term goal of governments, which can be done by pressuring mining pools,” Todd explained. “Being able to tell regulators that pressure will simply cause pools to leave regulated jurisdictions is important, but without anonymity, there really aren’t that many jurisdictions to run to.”\n\nFurthermore, once more that half of all hashing power is effectively regulated, authorities could even demand a complete freeze of certain funds, Back explained:\n\n“If more than 50 percent of mining is subject to policy, it can actually censor any transaction by ignoring – orphaning – blocks made by other miners. We don’t know if that would happen or not, but given the fact that it would be within their technical power to do it, it should be expected that regulators demand their regulations achieve an effect.”\n\nMoreover, once this sort of regulation does set in, decentralists believe it will probably be too late to fix. Bitcoin would be caught in a regulatory trap without even noticing it – until the trap closed.\n\nBack continued:\n\n“If Bitcoin is already at high policy risk – sort of effectively centralized but not experiencing the side-effects of that yet – and then the policy problem arises, the properties of Bitcoin are lost or eroded. How can you fix it at that point? Suddenly decentralize it? It’s uncertain that the parties who are at that point under central control over the Bitcoin network have the free choice to work to decentralize it. They would have been regulatory captured.”\n\nFull-Node Centralization\n\nBut even mining centralization and regulation might not be the end of it, decentralists warn. Ultimately, over-sized blocks bear with it another – perhaps even bigger – risk: full-node centralization.\n\nFull-node centralization could be an even bigger risk than mining centralization, decentralists argue, as full nodes effectively verify the consensus rules Bitcoin plays by. These consensus rules enforce that Bitcoin has a 1MB block-size limit, but also that the block reward halves every four years, or that the total supply of bitcoin will not exceed 21 million. And – importantly – being able to verify these rules is what makes Bitcoin a trustless solution. In essence, full nodes allow users to check that Bitcoin does as promised.\n\nBut as it becomes expensive to run a full node, decentralists worry that verifying the consensus rules could become reserved to a small elite. This could have several consequences.\n\nAn obvious consequence would be that it injects trust in the system. Instead of using trustless full nodes, users would, for instance, use web-wallets – which obviously require a lot of trust in the service. But even solutions such as Simplified Payments Verification (SPV) nodes are no better in this regard, as they do not verify the consensus rules either.\n\nPeter Todd explained:\n\n“SPV nodes and wallets are not a trustless solution. They explicitly trust miners, and do no verification of the protocol rules at all. For instance, from the perspective of an SPV node there is no such thing as inflation schedule or a 21 million bitcoin cap; miners are free to create bitcoins out of thin air if they want to.”\n\nAnd while the cheating of SPV nodes could be seen as a short-term problem, some decentralists argue that a drop in full nodes might even have more severe consequences in the longer term.\n\nAccording to Wuille:\n\n“If lots companies run a full node, it means they all need to be convinced to implement a different rule set. In other words: the decentralization of block validation is what gives consensus rules their weight. But if full node count would drop very low, for instance because everyone uses the same web-wallets, exchanges and SPV or mobile wallets, regulation could become a reality. And if authorities can regulate the consensus rules, it means they can change anything that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Even the 21 million bitcoin limit.”\n\nIt is of vital importance for the health of the Bitcoin network, therefore, that it remains possible to run full node anonymously, Todd urged:\n\n“Like mining, having the option to run full nodes totally ‘underground’ helps change the discussion and gives us a lot of leverage with governments: try to ban us and you’ll have even less control. But if we don’t have that option, it starts looking like regulation efforts have a decent chance of actually working, and gives governments incentives to attempt them.”\n\nCommenting on the block size limit debate itself, Back added:\n\n“I believe that the unstated different assumption – the point at which views diverge – is the importance of economically dependent full nodes. It seems that Gavin thinks a world where economically dependent full nodes retreat to data-centers and commercial operation – and basically all users can only get SPV security – is an OK trade-off and cost of getting to higher transaction volume a year early. But most of Bitcoin’s technical experts strongly disagree and say this risks exposing Bitcoin to erosion of its main differentiating features.”\n\nTrade-Offs\n\nSo what if decentralists are right? Bitcoin mining, and perhaps even running a full node, is reserved to specialists working from data centers. Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policy might be imposed, and perhaps the protocol rules are regulated to a certain extent. Sure, it would be a blow for drug dealers, CryptoLocker distributors and extortionists, but Bitcoin would still be a global, instant and cheap payments system. In a way, Bitcoin might actually be better of without these outlaws. Right?\n\nWell, not according to decentralists.\n\nMost decentralists maintain that Bitcoin’s distinguishing features are not its global reach, its instant transactions, or its low costs of use. Instead, they argue, Bitcoin’s single most important distinguishing feature is its decentralized nature. Without it, there would be no reason for Bitcoin to even exist.\n\nWell-known cryptographer and digital currency veteran Nick Szabo explained:\n\n“In computer science there are fundamental trade-offs between security and performance. Bitcoin’s automated integrity necessarily comes at high costs in its performance and resource usage. Compared to existing financial IT, Satoshi made radical trade-offs in favor of security and against performance. The seemingly wasteful process of mining is the most obvious of these trade-offs, but it also makes others. Among them is that it requires high redundancy in its messaging. Mathematically provable integrity would require full broadcast between all nodes. Bitcoin can’t achieve that, but to even get anywhere close to a good approximation of it requires a very high level of redundancy. So a 1MB block takes vastly more resources than a 1MB web page, for example, because it has to be transmitted, processed and stored with such high redundancy for Bitcoin to achieve its automated integrity.”\n\nThe crucial importance of this trade-off, was seconded by Wuille:\n\n“If we were to allow centralization of mining, we simply wouldn’t need a blockchain in the first place. We could just let a central bank sign transactions. That would allow us much bigger and faster blocks without any capacity problems. No variable block times. No wasted electricity. No need for an inflation subsidy. It would be better in every sense, except that it would involve some trust. Really, if we don’t consider centralization of mining a problem, we might as well get rid of it altogether.”\n\nSzabo added:\n\n“These necessary trade-offs, sacrificing performance in order to achieve the security necessary for independent and seamlessly global automated integrity, mean that Bitcoin cannot possibly come anywhere near Visa transaction-per-second numbers and maintain the automated integrity that creates its distinctive advantages versus these traditional financial systems.”\n\nBitcoin versus bitcoin\n\nThis leaves us with one last question. If “Bitcoin cannot possibly come anywhere near Visa transaction-per-second numbers” as decentralists claim, then what is the point of it all? Why even bother building software, investing in startups, and spend time evangelizing Bitcoin, if it inherently doesn’t scale?\n\nThe point of it all, for decentralists, lies in a classic distinction: the distinction between Bitcoin the network and bitcoin the currency.\n\nBitcoin the network, decentralists argue, is fundamentally designed as a settlement system, not as a network for fast and cheap payments. While maybe not the most typical decentralist himself, a recent contribution to the Bitcoin developer mailing list by Core developer Jeff Garzik perhaps explains the decentralist perspective best.\n\nGarzik wrote:\n\n“Bitcoin is a settlement system, by design. The process of consensus ‘settles’ upon a timeline of transactions, and this process – by design – is necessarily far from instant. … As such, the blockchain can never support All The Transactions, even if block size increases beyond 20MB. Further layers are – by design – necessary if we want to achieve the goal of a decentralized payment network capable of supporting full global traffic.”\n\nBut, importantly, this vision of Bitcoin as a limited settlement network, does not mean that bitcoin the currency cannot flourish beyond these built-in limits.\n\nAs explained by Szabo:\n\n“When it comes to small-b bitcoin, the currency, there is nothing impossible about paying retail with bitcoin the way you’d pay with a fiat currency – bitcoin-denominated credit and debit cards, for example, with all the chargeback and transactions-per-second capabilities of a credit or debit card. And there are clever trust-minimizing ways to do retail payments in the works. Capital-B Bitcoin, the blockchain, is going to evolve into a high-value settlement layer, and we will see other layers being used for small-b bitcoin retail transactions.”\n\nOr as Garzik elaborated:\n\n“Bitcoin payments are like IP packets – one way, irreversible. The world’s citizens en masse will not speak to each other with bitcoin (IP packets), but rather with multiple layers (HTTP/TCP/IP) that enable safe and secure value transfer or added features such as instant transactions.”\n\nMoreover, decentralists contend that even these upper layers could include most of the advantages that the Bitcoin network introduced. Once fully developed, technological innovations such as the Lightning Network and tree-chains should allow users to transact in a decentralized, trustless, and even instant fashion – while ultimately settling on the Bitcoin blockchain. While it is true that on-chain transactions will cost more as room in blocks becomes scarce, decentralists maintain that it is the only way to keep that chain decentralized and trustless – and that that does not need to be a problem.\n\n“Yes, on-chain transaction fees will rise,” Todd acknowledged. “But that changes what you use Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain layer for, and how often – not whether or not you can transact at all. A world where you can send anyone on the planet money directly on the blockchain for five dollars – or for near zero via caching techniques like Lightning – is a very good option, and it will buy us time to develop techniques to make blockchains themselves scalable …”', ""DASH has released a decentralized voting and fund allocation mechanism that could bypass the internal tensions of Bitcoin and its dramatic block size debate.\n\nWho will decide?\n\nA great deal of attention has been going to Bitcoin's blocksize debate, which includes fundamental aspects of how Core Development is funded, distributed, and by whom. While Bitcoin is going through the computer science equivalent of group therapy, DASH, the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has released a Decentralized Governance by Blockchain System while taking notes from Bitcoin's internal turmoil, in an attempt to completely bypass it.\n\nA few of the problems with decentralized and open source projects are development planning, funding and fund management. Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen have argued that Bitcoin needs a benevolent dictator, a notion that enough people have recoiled from as evidenced by the low popularity of Bitcoin XT.\n\nThe notion nevertheless highlights the need for a swift and reliable decision making process. Consensus is great for many things, but fast decision making is not usually one of them.\n\nThe most common approach to this problem is the creation of not-for-profit foundations tasked with maintaining the core protocol and promoting the project at hand. However, as demonstrated by the controversies involving the Bitcoin Foundation, these are not connected to the users and community in any meaningful way.\n\nFor example, three of Bitcoin's core developers are now funded by the MIT's Media Lab, Digital Currency Initiative, an arm of MIT Labs, lead by White House advisor, Brian Forde. His proud connections with the executive branch are bound to set off some people's alarm bells – to put it nicely.\n\nGranted, funding of Bitcoin Core is already decentralized, according to Jeff Garzik, who claims that it is “spread across several companies/entities.” However, this still relies on human organizations and processes that are susceptible to censorship, human error, and back room deals, which is far from ideal. But what must be noted is that this is now avoidable.\n\nDASH: the game & the players\n\nDASH's new Decentralized Governance by Blockchain (DGB) was clearly designed with this problem in mind. But to get an idea of how it works, let’s take a quick look at DASH's network set up, since it does have some notable differences compared to Bitcoin.\n\nDGB could be thought of as a mathematically enforceable and fully transparent democratic process. It is a blockchain hosted voting system with decentralized fund management built in.\n\nDASH is comprised of three types of 'nodes' - three different ways in which the DASH software clients can be used, with specific roles and responsibilities on the network.\n\nThe first are miners, who provide proof-of-work security to the cryptocurrency in a similar fashion to Bitcoin, though instead using X11, an algorithm designed and believed to be ASIC resistant. Miners provide computing power in exchange for a regular payment from the network to the tune of 45% of the block rewards.\n\nThe second are full node wallets, which host the accounting ledger (blockchain) allowing users to access the network, use the currency and further decentralize it.\n\nAnd the third and most innovative element of DASH are its “Masternodes.” These are regular full nodes that anyone can run, but with the difference that they host a 1,000 DASH collateral, equivalent to roughly US$2,500 at current rates (works with cold storage). The collateral earns hosts the right to provide services to DASH users at a profit – 45% of block rewards. Services such as DarkSend — the feature that brought DASH to fame — as well as Instant Transactions, the controversial 4 second transaction locking feature.\n\n45% Mining Reward 45% Masternode Rewards for Proof\xadof\xadservice 10% Decentralized Budget System\n\n\n\nThe 1,000 DASH collateral is intended as a security mechanism, making it prohibitively expensive to cheat the system by attempting a 51% attack. In practice securing this upper layer of applications with Proof of Stake.\n\nThere are currently over 3,000 Masternodes live, roughly half of the amount of active full nodes of the much older Bitcoin network.\n\nDecentralized Governance by Blockchain\n\nDGB is built on top of this network of Masternodes. It allows anyone to propose changes or upgrades to the currency. Initiatives the community deems necessary, be it legal, marketing or otherwise, can also be submitted to the network directly through the blockchain, while 10% of the block rewards go towards funding elected proposals.\n\nProposals are then voted on by the community on a monthly basis. Masternode hosts are the only parties with a right to vote on these. Their choices are Yea, Nay, or Abstain.\n\nProposals must have at-least 10% more Yea votes then Nay and must also compete with other submissions for a grand prize of roughly 8,000 DASH a month, or today's US$19,000.00 dollar equivalent.\n\nIf MN Hosts take back their collateral, i.e. disconnect from the network, their vote is disabled until they return.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization\n\nOne possible problem this system might run into might be voter apathy. What is the incentive for Masternodes to vote? It could be argued that since DASH is effectively at the mercy of other voters now, then that will be enough for them to be alert and willing to participate. However, this remains to be seen.\n\nThe cost of submitting a proposal is 5 DASH, but these units are destroyed, instead of serving as an incentive to do something else, like vote. Which is similar to how Augur's wisdom of the crowd system works.\n\nSo just how well this system will work remains to be seen. If successful, it could potentially make decisions like the block size debate much more efficient and provide a unified means of communication on the blockchain itself.\n\nThe fact that DASH is officially funded by the blockchain itself — the value of its units supported by a democratic process of investment election — may mean that DASH is a kind of evolving and adaptive, living organism. Or at the very least, a clear cut example of the mythical and up until now imaginary, Decentralized Autonomous Organization."", 'The British monarchy is richer than ever. Queen Elizabeth became the longest serving royal ever on September 9 after 63 years on the throne. Reuters found that the British monarchy has benefitted from an increase in house and land prices especially in the wake of the 2007 global financial crisis.\n\nThe queen has made headlines by using thrifty space heaters to keep her “chilly” palaces warm. In recent days, however, she has made headlines for a different reason: her family’s vast wealth after years on the throne. According to spokespeople, the queen is actually thrifty, owning little more than a few race horses.\n\nThe Reuters estimate posits that, based on the monarchy’s interests, the monarchy now has nominal assets valued at approximately 22.8 billion pounds ($34.8 billion). The family is on the top 20 global rich list. Knowing how much the monarchy is truly worth is not easy, however, since many assets are owned privately, like the Crown Estate, which is the main investment institution of royal wealth and is owned in the interests of the nation by the monarchy until their reign ends.\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace, the 11.5 billion pound Crown Estate does not belong to the monarchy, although it does pay for repairs on the queen’s palaces and other desires. Other sources of wealth for the queen are the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, two private estates valued at 1.3 billion pounds. The monarchy’s centuries-old treasure trove, known as the Royal Collection, has an estimated value of 10 billion pounds, according to Brand Finance. The consultancy places the monarchy’s tangible assets at 20 billion pounds.\n\nNeither the Reuters nor Brand Finance conjectures of royal wealth include Buckingham Palace, Windsor nor Balmoral in them. So, realistically, royal wealth far exceeds these estimates. Crown Estate owns much of London’s property, such as half the buildings in the exclusive St. James area of central London.\n\n“You would be hiding behind nomenclature and history to suggest that the Crown Estate is in any way an asset of the queen’s,” a palace spokesman said.\n\nThe Crown Estate’s property has doubled in value to 11 billion pounds in the years since the 2007 financial crisis, according to the estimates. “Over the last decade the business has moved from being a traditional landed estate to an active investor and developer,” said a Crown Estate spokesperson. The Crown Estate’s 285.1 million pound net annual profit this year is a record.\n\n“The queen’s wealth is hidden in smoke and mirrors,” said Philip Beresford, the author of an annual rich list published since 1989 by the Sunday Times newspaper. Conjecturing about the monarchy’s true wealth is pretty pointless considering its comprised of works that are essentially priceless.\n\nThe Royal Collection, for example, contains work by Rembrandt, Poussin and Leonardo da Vinci. The Crown Jewels, including the largest flawless cut diamond in the world and the 530-carat First Star of Africa, are also, basically, priceless.\n\nImage from Shaun Jeffers / Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Big Data is rapidly altering many facets of society in ways that most people have not even begun to realize. As these changes are occurring, and various sectors of society are coming to terms with this new reliance on previously unimaginable volumes of data, new challenges are emerging. Among them is the question of how all of this data is to be secured. The main problem is that many of the companies and other entities adopting Big Data strategies are doing so without developing the necessary security structure they’ll need to ensure the integrity of the data they collect and store. Fortunately, Bitcoin’s blockchain may end up serving as a model for the type of solution the world needs to address this growing security need.\n\nAt this point in history, it is pretty much a given that the average person has little familiarity with things like Bitcoin and blockchain. That stands in stark contrast to people who spend their time contemplating lofty concepts like Big Data and all the other dramatic technological changes that promise to reshape society in the coming years. For those people, cryptocurrency and the encryption systems used to generate, authenticate, and secure it are being increasingly seen as more than just a new type of monetary unit. They’re also being viewed as a possible solution to some of the most pressing concerns many companies, governments, and individuals currently express about the security of all that new data.\n\nAnd make no mistake, security is an enormous concern among those whose interest in Big Data extends beyond mere curiosity. Oracle's Vice President of Big Data and Advanced Analytics, Neil Mendelson, is on record expressing serious concerns about how the private sector race to implement Big Data strategies to achieve new insights and growth is often outpacing efforts to secure all of that new information. That concern is apparently shared by industry groups such as the Cloud Security Alliance.\n\nThe fact is that the very thing that makes Big Data so attractive to industry – its diversity in terms of format and source, its reliance on cloud infrastructure on a massive scale, and its real-time accessibility thanks to information streaming – are also the very things that create new security challenges for everyone involved. Add to that the fact that nearly half of all enterprises have yet to implement actual policies for the management of information, relying instead on outmoded schemes designed to protect systems rather than data, and you have a clear recipe for potential disaster.\n\nMIT Media Lab’s Brian Forde is someone who has obviously given this problem considerable thought. He’s spent a great deal of time recently detailing his aspirations for something he calls Open Data 2.0, which would rely on a blockchain database model for managing this vast array of data.\n\nAs he envisions it, this new platform would be developed in conjunction with both non-profit groups and governments, and would provide the type of transparent authentication system that the global marketplace so desperately needs in this era of Big Data. As the director of the Digital Currency Initiative, Forde has offered his unique insight into just how Bitcoin’s blockchain could be the solution the world needs as it struggles to manage and secure records and authenticate everything from personal identities to individual records and transactions.\n\nAnyone with even passing familiarity with blockchain can at least begin to see where Forde is going with this idea. After all, it is blockchain technology that makes Bitcoin viable in the first place. As a universal ledger, blockchains differs dramatically from the controlled, closed ledgers that humanity has relied on for virtually its entire history.\n\nThose ledgers, controlled and operated by organizations ranging from banks to utilities, governments, and even online companies, are centralized for security reasons. Of course, that centralization necessarily empowers those gatekeepers charged with maintaining the ledgers, much to the chagrin of those who find themselves locked out of those systems for one reason or another.\n\nForde has been very clear in his belief that the answer to a whole range of Big Data problems can be found in the use of what can only be considered the core of Bitcoin’s success. Blockchain‘s universal ledger system has a whole host of advantages that closed ledgers lack, most notably the reliance on protecting and verifying each record transaction rather than simply trying to secure the ledger itself.\n\nAs Forde envisions it, blockchain technology could be used universally by companies and governments, and could help to eliminate the current reliance on closed-ledger verification systems that have thus far failed to provide any real security against problems such as identity theft. Because blockchain operates without closed-ledger restrictions, records are authenticated across a wide network of computer users in a chain that offers sequential security. The fact that old records can never be changed or removed provides an additional level of security against manipulation that ledger systems do not provide.\n\nThe MIT Digital Currency Initiative is at the forefront of this new push to expand the use of blockchain technology, and is continuing its efforts to educate and inform governments at every level to spark the interest needed to make this vision a reality. With Connecticut’s recent government decision to incorporate the bitcoin blockchain into it's survey result verification strategy, that interest may finally be emerging. If the concept behind Open Data 2.0 can begin to attract more widespread support in both the public and private sectors, then many of the most pressing security and efficiency concerns raised by the rise of Big Data may eventually be put to rest."", '', 'Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nKUCHING: Investors today are feeling the pinch in their investments whether they are playing in the stock market, commodities or generally in businesses across the country.\n\nWhether it was the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the free-falling ringgit, the hike in inflation or the drop in global economic indicators – a myriad of factors come to play when it comes to figuring out why investments are being chipped away by the economic gloom that is overcast in today’s fiscal climate.\n\nThe situation looks difficult for investors trying to find the right safe haven to protect their asset worth.\n\nFrom one end, Malaysians feel the pinch as they struggle to keep up with increasing expenses.\n\nOne such factor is the declining ringgit, highlights iMoney (https://www.imoney.my/) editor Iris Lee.\n\n“Some are of the opinion that if you just stay put in Malaysia and buy products made in Malaysia, you won’t be affected by the declining currency.\n\n“But this can’t always be the case since much of what we use is still imported,” she told BizHive Weekly in an interview recently.\n\n“No matter how hard you try to avoid buying imported products, we may not be able to avoid products made with imported materials.\n\n“Unfortunately, the majority of imports and exports in this country are still heavily traded in US dollars.\n\n“Some importers and distributors may even stop distributing certain products due to the fluctuating currencies to avoid risk.\n\n“Not just consumers, businesses with foreign debts or dealings will find it hard to stay afloat due to the dismal ringgit against the US dollars.” Even if you’re not mainly affected by the falling ringgit, Lee said there was uncertainty in the market due to other factors like the implementation of GST and the large jump in inflation has increased the cost of living.\n\n“It’s a double whammy – your domestic consumption is hurt along with your ability to consume imported goods.\n\n“So, yes it is harder now.\n\n“Remember that saving alone is not enough. In these trying times, we need to protect our money more than ever.\n\nProtect it from the rising inflation, the sliding currency, and also the uncertain market.\n\nInvesting in stable instruments is the mantra right now.” Red flags in global markets On the other end, global markets do not bode well for investors.\n\nLast week, Asian stocks witnessed a bout of volatility as further evidence of slowing growth in China’s economy brought uncertainty to global markets.\n\nAn early sell-off followed a cheerless day on markets in the US and Europe as clouds gathered over the worldwide economy, amid mounting signs of stumbling growth. Other currencies also followed suit with the ringgit.\n\nLast week, the Australian dollar – which is heavily linked to demand for the country’s abundant natural resources – plumbed six-year lows with figures out of Canberra showing the economy logged a slower-than-expected 0.2 percent quarterly expansion.\n\nThis came after Canada officially entered recession, hit hard by stubbornly-low oil prices.\n\nWhile the Shanghai stock market is somewhat decoupled from the real economy – many analysts and players acknowledge it is akin to gambling – wild ructions there are seen as worrying indications of Beijing’s ability to manage structural changes, as highlighted in last week’s feature in BizHive Weekly.\n\nCommentators say China’s high government-spending model of the last three decades is unsustainable, and needs to morph into consumer spending.\n\nThey point to the country’s huge population as a vast, under-tapped source of demand that could offer opportunities for growth; but fears abound that Communist Party managers are struggling to shepherd the changes.\n\nHowever, not all is doom and gloom for investors as pockets of opportunities persist.\n\nBizHive Weekly talks to a few investors and specialists on what investment opportunities stay above the float.\n\nPerseverance in properties\n\nThe glaring drop in the ringgit’s value could not be more prominently felt in any other sector than in properties, largely due to its high base value.\n\nAccording to AllianceDBS Research Sdn Bhd, developers have incorporated more ‘affordable homes’ into their project pipelines to tap on still-robust demand for ‘affordable properties’ from genuine homebuyers.\n\n“Value-for-money properties priced at below RM700,000 per unit as different property hotspots continue to be well-received, especially township developments with lifestyle amenities,” outlined analyst Quah He Wei in a September 9 report.\n\n“However, pricing will remain a major determinant of sales because of accelerating supply over the next two years.” Property investors within Sarawak itself will likely see a slowdown in property launches as channel checks by BizHive Weekly notice delays in launches within Kuching itself.\n\nCertain industry players have confirmed this to be due to construction costs.\n\n“There are less buyers in the market now post-GST as construction costs have increased,” the source said, declining to be named.\n\nEarlier this week, Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Chua Tee Yong said it has been a challenging time for developers, especially those with new projects as imported materials would be more expensive.\n\n“The current situation has also derailed consumer sentiments in the secondary market, resulting in a slowdown in price growth.\n\n“However, for foreign investors, the Malaysian property market seems cheaper now but that doesn’t warrant the government to revise the minimum RM1 million property price eligible for foreign ownership as it does not contravene with local demand, he said.\n\n“Most of the (local) demand is for properties between RM500,000 and RM1 million. That consisted of the bulk of purchases recently.\n\n“So, I think the RM1 million figure is still relatively looking okay at this juncture,” he said to reporters at the launch of the Board of Valuers, Appraiser and Estate Agents’ new office and the fifth edition of the Malaysian Valuation Standards on Tuesday.\n\nIncrease in foreign interest\n\nWith the ringgit hitting record lows against a basket of weighted currencies especially the Singapore dollar, investing in Malaysian properties could not have come at a better time.\n\n“A confluence of a strongly regulated Singapore property market where prices are still not tapering to significant lower levels, against a much cheaper ringgit is in effect payday for Singaporeans and Singapore residents with limited funds,” highlighted Vinod Nair, founder and chief executive officer of MoneySmart.sg in a Bernama interview.\n\n“This is because they are now able to buy luxury properties in key Malaysian cities like Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya and Penang.” Vinod said the topline property categories to consider would certainly be luxury condominium developments in the central business district areas and landed property in posh enclaves like Bangsar and Damansara Heights for instance.\n\nHe further noted that foreign direct investments were a powerful tool for Malaysians to hedge against the ringgit.\n\n“If the cost of buying a Malaysian property is reaching record lows, then an eventual currency correction which will eventually happen, may slow down property sales.\n\nIskandar Malaysia, for example, does have a lot of unsold developer units, so now is the perfect time to offload inventory.\n\n“Ultimately, now is the time to review the capital gains tax – maybe a reduction or a temporary reprieve might be an excellent idea to attract buyers,” he said.\n\nStill a good bet\n\nFollowing the weakening ringgit, some investors have express concerns of their investment in Iskandar Malaysia.\n\nDespite all these, Vinod finds that Malaysia is still an attractive investment for property buyers.\n\n“For those who have already invested, the best advice would be to wait out this bad period.\n\n“I don’t envision the Federal Government of Malaysia rolling out capital measures like cash injections or pegging the ringgit, so really this is an exercise in patience for existing investors.” Lee from iMoney concurred with this view, noting that investing in properties has always been one way to protect your money through the currency volatility.\n\n“There has been talk recently that the property market was approaching a bubble and it looks like it’s about to pop with the recent slowdown,” she pointed out.\n\n“Due to that, one may opine that investing in local properties may not see as much profit as before when it comes to capital appreciation.\n\n“Generally, capital appreciation within the local property sector can range between five and 15 per cent per year, on average.\n\nIn a good year, it could increase to between 20 to 25 per cent.\n\nIn a bad year, maybe just five per cent.\n\n“Of course, for those with capital and strong holding power, there could be gains to be had in investing in this down market but it’s not clear when the rebound is due to happen.”\n\nDigital currencies: Dessert or Devil’s fruit?\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies as a new investment tool raises many questions for new investors, being a new form of digital currency and its key distinguishing feature is that it is decentralised and operates completely peer to peer.\n\nThis means there is no need for a central bank or authority and instead operates by way of consensus among its users.\n\nOne of the issues of digital currencies, before the creation of Bitcoin, was that it always required a central issuer that needs to be trusted.\n\nIn the same way we trust governments not to simply create money for specific people or to make your bank balance disappear, you would then have to trust whoever who created the coin not to secretly enrich themselves.\n\nThis was a major problem since with little regulation the creator of a purely digital currency can easily manipulate balances, trades and prices without the knowledge of other holders of the digital currency which is the case with many scam or fake cryptocurrency coins, highlights Reuben Yap, a local investor in digital currencies and industry observer.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies solve this problem by having all its users maintain a copy of the ledger which records all transactions made through it (called the blockchain) and using mathematics and encryption technologies to prevent manipulation, secret changing of balances or issuance of new coins,” he detailled to BizHive Weekly.\n\n“A proper cryptocurrency cannot even be manipulated by its creator.\n\n“What makes it an interesting investment option is that there are very low barriers of entries and you can invest any sum of money into it unlike other investment options which often require a minimum investment.” As this is mostly unregulated, Yap says no one can stop you from storing, sending or transporting cryptocurrencies and many use it to move money internationally almost instantaneously and with very low fees.\n\n“If done correctly, this can be a lot faster and cheaper than using traditional money remittance options such as telegraphic transfers,” he added.\n\nCryptocurrencies also have high volatility and prices can swing widely which means you can either make a lot of money very fast or lose it very fast too.\n\n“To put this into context, the price of Bitcoin which is already considered to be one of the most stable cryptocurrencies can vary in double digit percentages in one day.\n\n“I would consider it a very high risk investment and honestly it is not the right tool to hedge against a depreciating currency,” he forewarned.\n\n“However, because of cryptocurrencies’ relatively small market capitalisation, it remains quite easy for people with a lot of money to artificially inflate or dump market prices on exchanges much like penny stocks on the stock exchange.\n\n“So, although cryptocurrencies are very difficult to manipulate in terms of its own balances, its ‘real world’ value can be subject to market manipulation by big players especially with the smaller cryptocurrencies and is often referred to as ‘whale manipulation’ or “pump and dump”.”\n\niMoney’s Lee concurred with Yap, adding that the beauty of Bitcoin is that it is not controlled by any central bank and as such to a certain extent, Bitcoin is immune from currency wars.\n\n“However, the extreme fluctuation in the beginning has many people steer clear of it as an investment.\n\nBut based on observations, Bitcoin appears to be relatively stable recently in its very short history, and this has made it more appealing to people as a sort of safe haven currency.\n\n“On paper, Bitcoin can make a good long-term investment because it has a finite supply, and as a result its value would likely increase when it is more widely used.\n\n“Also like metal commodities, Bitcoin can still be highly volatile (though by other tech related factors) over the long-term and investors should look at the bigger picture.\n\n“If you are on the right side of the trade, it can be profitable. However, always look at your overall investment portfolio, your risk appetite and how bitcoin fits into everything before deciding on something as new as this.\n\n“In these times, it’s may not be the best solution as an investment instrument but presently it is another alternative for those looking for a stable currency to park their money with.”\n\nThe many, many kinds of Coins\n\nBitcoin is by far the biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap of US$3.3 billion.\n\nIt is the first decentralized cryptocurrency that started it all and has the widest merchant adoption with big companies such as Dell, Microsoft, Expedia and Overstock accepting the currency.\n\nIt is also the easiest cryptocurrency to buy with fiat money (USD, MYR, SGD etc) and in Malaysia we have several BitCoin exchanges such as BitX.co, Coinbox.biz and BTC.my.\n\nLocally in Malaysia, we have IPMart (smartphones and consumer electronics), BolehVPN (internet privacy services), HostPro2U (web hosting) being some of the larger merchants accepting BitCoin.\n\nIt stands to be the cryptocurrency with the best chance of widespread adoption and there is a great deal of investment being put into developing services around it such as BitPay and Coinbase.\n\nRecently Barclays bank, one of UK’s largest banks will begin to allow charities to accept BitCoin late this year with a formal rollout early next year.\n\nOne BitCoin today is worth about US$225. All other cryptocurrencies besides BitCoin are referred to as ‘alt coins’ short for ‘alternate coins’.\n\nSome are minor modifications of BitCoin that still use the majority BitCoin’s base code (LiteCoin, DogeCoin), others have more extensive modifications while still using BitCoin’s base code (Dash, PeerCoin) while others are coded from the ground up (Ethereum, NXT, NEM, Bytecoin).\n\nThere are many other coins out there some which serve specific purposes such as Storjcoin for cloud storage and NameCoin which allows people to register domain names using its currency and operates as a decentralised DNS.\n\nThere are hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there, some which are solely created to enrich the coin creators.\n\nThe vast majority of alt-coins die a natural death when there is no more interest or development so investors must be careful when deciding to invest in a cryptocurrency.\n\nTips when investing in Cryptocurrencies\n\n1. Invest in well known cryptocurrencies with a decent market capitalization and do your research\n\ncoinmarketcap.com and coingecko.com are excellent sites to serve as a starting point in determining which coin to invest in.\n\nThese coins have lower risks of dying and are less likely to be scams (though it is by no means a sure thing).\n\nFact check their claims and do a Google search if there has been any scam claims.\n\nMany scam coins such as Utoken and OneCoin (http://cointelegraph.com/news/114399/one-coin-much-scam-onecoin-exposed-as-global-mlm-ponzi-scheme) capitalise on the fact that most people don’t understand cryptocurrencies and make very lofty claims that can be exposed with some research.\n\nConsider joining cryptocurrency communities such as https://www.facebook.com/groups/bitcoinsarawak/ to find out more and ask more experienced people.\n\n2. Don’t believe anyone who ‘guarantees’ price appreciation\n\nThere is no such thing as a guaranteed price increase of the coin, and anyone who can do that is either a fake cryptocurrency or just making promises that they can’t keep.\n\nThere’s a lot of fake cryptocurrencies out there claiming to be the next ‘BitCoin’.\n\nIn Malaysia there are already a few claiming about ‘coin IPOs’ and fancy names such as ‘coin split’.\n\nNo one can predict the markets unless they are the market themselves.\n\n3. Invest at your own risk\n\nCryptocurrencies are not regulated at all in Malaysia and if anyone scams you, legal remedies are few and far between.\n\nAlways err on the side of caution and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\n4. Store your cryptocurrencies securely\n\nStore cryptocurrencies in secure computers and make regular encrypted backup.\n\nWhen storing large amounts of cryptocurrencies, consider using hardware wallets such as Trezor (https://www.buytrezor.com/) or printing paper wallets (https://walletgenerator.net/) and storing them offline where they can’t be hacked.\n\nDon’t store large amounts of cryptocurrencies in exchanges or web wallets as if those exchanges or web wallets go bust or are hacked (which is very common), there is very little recourse to recover them.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples is Mt. Gox, which was then the largest BitCoin exchange which lost some US$460 million worth of BitCoins due to an alleged hack. Only transfer what you need to convert.\n\nThere has been an increase in awareness of digital currencies in general but unfortunately this due to the rapid proliferation of scam coins which often compare themselves to BitCoin.\n\nAs such there is a very limited understanding of what cryptocurrencies actually are beyond their existence and a very surface understanding.\n\nThe main issue of this stems from people looking to get into cryptocurrencies for pure profit instead of taking the time to understand it which makes them very vulnerable to scams.\n\n5. Appreciate that cryptocurrencies are very volatile in price\n\nHigh volatility means high risk and high reward.\n\nThose with some understanding of technical trading may have an advantage in reading trends in short term trends and prices.\n\nAlways have a stop-gap loss point and don’t invest more than you can lose.\n\nGoing for the gold\n\nMetal commodities such as gold are another area of interest for investors, being the “original” form of investment since time immemorial.\n\nGold has always been an investment favourite as a vehicle to hedge financial uncertainty or to capitalise on price movements.\n\niMoney’s Lee observed that prices of hard commodities, such as oil and metals, had fallen from year-to-date highs.\n\n“Some may have opined that now is a good time to buy due to the lower prices, but there is also a fear of continuous fall across all metal commodities and we’re not quite sure they’ve bottomed yet,” she observed.\n\n“Like all commodities, metal commodities are highly volatile asset classes, and one should only invest if one truly understands the risk and volatility involved.” Lee went on to add that commodities do not move in lockstep with stocks and bonds, so adding commodities to a portfolio tends to increase the portfolio’s diversification.\n\n“To manage the risk better, investors can get commodity exposure through stocks of companies that profit from natural resources, such as mining company.”\n\nSave and diversify\n\nIn a nutshell, having savings is perhaps the most important advice one can give to the general public/consumers at large to survive this period.\n\n“Having savings is extremely important now.\n\nAs times look to be getting hard, having a contingency fund can help you manage your finances better against whatever may come,” affirmed iMoney’s Lee.\n\n“However, savings alone isn’t enough.\n\nYou need to have a robust investment portfolio to protect your money against inflation (that’s on the rise).\n\n“It’s difficult but it’s extremely important to balance out liquidity through your emergency funds and investments in order to stay ahead of this poor economic environment.”\n\nFor those with an existing investment portfolio, Lee said it was time to review it in lieu of the recent changes in currency.\n\n“For example, if you’re investing in Malaysian companies that are exposed to declining oil prices or are heavily reliant on US dollar imports you may want to reassess your holdings.\n\nWeigh every financial decision wisely because every sen counts today.”', 'La pépite française Ledger a de grandes ambitions. Cette start-up veut fournir des solutions de sécurisation du bitcoin (monnaie virtuelle) aussi indispensables que les routeurs Cisco pour le web. Rien de moins.

Le patron de la start-up rappelle que la clé privée donne accès à ce cash décentralisé et a sa valeur intrinsèque.', 'The six-year bull market that began its charge in 2009 is a great example of an investing axiom: The longer a market rises, the more dangerous it becomes.\n\nThat’s because “momentum investing” — jumping into stocks that have done well in the recent past — can be both profitable and seductively reassuring right up to the point of maximum risk.\n\nWe all know that rising prices increase risk, but many investors fail to appreciate that they also lead to lower expected returns. Stocks may earn an average of 8% to 10% a year over the long run — but only when you pay the average price. These kinds of returns do not apply to any and every price in the market cycle.\n\nIn other words, when the market rises, investors take on greater risk for smaller expected returns. At some point, you have to ask yourself if the potential payoff is fair compensation for that extra risk.\n\nA practical technique to employ once your risks exceed your reasonable profit potential is to begin systematically selling off portions of your position. This incrementally scales back your holdings (and loss exposure) without having to guess the market’s next move.\n\nThe downside is that while this strategy reduces your market risk, it increases your opportunity risk, which can lead to a huge amount of regret if the market climbs sharply higher. When asked how his family had become enormously wealthy, Baron Rothschild allegedly responded, “We always sold too soon.” For the rest of us, selling too soon can be an agonizing experience.\n\nA disciplined asset allocation strategy with regular rebalancing can address this problem. A dramatic increase in the value of one asset throws your portfolio out of balance and requires selling some of the appreciated asset to buy more of the cheaper ones. Supporters of rebalancing call this “selling high, buying low.” Clients sometimes refer to it as “selling my winners to buy losers.”\n\nMany people find it more tempting to believe they can just finesse major market moves, skillfully collecting every last drop of upside but getting out before it’s too late. The “fully invested bear” is an example. These investors (and more than a few advisors) say they “expect things to end badly,” but they remain fully invested because the market still has profit potential.\n\nClearly, these fully invested bears want to exploit any remaining profit opportunities. That suggests they believe one of two things will happen:\n\nWhen the market tops out, they will be caught fully invested and pay a heavy price. They will know when to sell, so they’ll avoid serious losses.\n\nSince no one would choose the first option, these investors must expect that they will detect a sell signal. Ask what that signal might be, and you are likely to get a response similar to Justice Potter Stewart’s definition of obscenity: “I’ll know it when I see it.”\n\nHistory exposes these sell signals as fantasies, but they remain a well-accepted belief among advisors and investors alike. Full disclosure: For a large part of my career, I believed in them too.\n\nSPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT\n\nBitter experience taught me the truth of the Wall Street saying “Nobody rings a bell at the top.” Others confidently await the arrival of Wall Street’s version of Quasimodo, the bell-ringer of Notre Dame.\n\nBut Quasimodo never shows up when you need him.\n\nMore From NerdWallet:', 'La gente (en la comunidad Bitcoin) nos conoce, y hay razones para confiar en nuestra marca y el uso de nuestras aplicaciones.

09/13/2015,"['Bitcoin has made a lot of progress over the last six-plus years. It has gone from a Western-based invention used by a few computer guys like Satoshi Nakamoto, the late Hal Finney, and Mike Hearn to a mostly Chinese-mined digital currency, with millions of users, worldwide. The final frontier is acceptance and use in “The Third World,” where traditional banking is the exception, and economic development is more of a need than a societal given.\n\nRecently, Bitcoin has begun to see fledgling use in some countries of Africa.\n\nMeet Sinclair Skinner. He is the founder of BitMari, and his company is looking to bring Bitcoin into the African mainstream. He connected with me on LinkedIn, and I interviewed him about how things are progressing in the country for his business and the local interest in “The Future of Money.”\n\nZimbabwe: From economic ruin to cutting-edge global economics\n\nThe tumultuous history of Zimbabwe has been well documented when it comes to financial difficulty. Since their Zimbabwe dollar collapsed in 2008, the country is just now starting to recover and rebuild a working currency around the U.S. Dollar. Using the South African Rand for smaller purchases and the U.S. Dollar for larger ones, this has been the short-term solution. As has been reported her before, the U.S. Dollar has its own problems, and may not be viable long-term, so others see a future in a digital currency that could work better over time.\n\n“In 2009, after the collapse, instead of continuing to try to bail out their currency, the [Zimbabwean] people did the unthinkable, they went on without it!”\n\nCoinTelegraph: Can you go over the history of Bitcoin in Zimbabwe?\n\nSinclair Skinner: Many have joked about the Zimbabwe quadrillion note. However, much of this intellectual sarcasm has missed the brilliance and courage of the Zimbabwe government and people. In 2009, after the collapse, instead of continuing to try to bail out their currency, the people did the unthinkable, they went on without it!\n\nZimbabwe, free of the yoke of a nationalized fiat currency, is poised for a revolution more dynamic and defining then the 1980 victory of the Chingaria freedom fighters that lead to the Lancaster Agreement, that was left unfulfilled.\n\nThe difficult work of the freedom fighters being completed has left a firm and stable foundation for the indigenous people of Zimbabwe to move forward. Now, we have the ability to move faster, more directly, and more collectively to continue to raise the quality of life for this nation state and for all post-colonial economies around the world.\n\nZimbabwe with “dollarized"" currency is one of the few international economies. Zimbabwe currently uses the South African Rand, U.S. dollar and Botswana pula currencies. Now with the high amount of cell phone penetration the many unbanked are turning to mobile banking and are the driving force of this economy. Again, the Freedom Fighters will operate from the bush, back roads, small towns to create a critical mass that will continue to free Zimbabwe’s economy.\n\nCT: Please provide your company\'s history and a progress report of how your business is doing in the Bitcoin market in 2015. How is it helping Bitcoin grow in the area and helping the people save money?\n\nSS: Our team is lead by indigenous Zimbabweans who have extensive knowledge of local technology, regulations, and markets. This is a great advantage in working with local regulators and institutions. Furthermore, Zimbabwe remittance fees, when using a traditional measure like Western Union, can be more than 15%!\n\nBitmari will increase bitcoin adoption by solving a real problem by reducing these fees and generating real financial opportunities for local financial institutions. By working with the government and local major financial institutions, we are able to leverage existing customers, networks and trust to encourage the use of our platform. Success in Zimbabwe will demonstrate a model that will be able to be used in other countries in the region and throughout the world.\n\nCT: I noticed there seem to be a lot of steps to actually doing transactions. can someone just send Bitcoins and not go through you to do the currency exchange? Can the service be shorter or less complicated?\n\nSS: We will continuously improve and streamline the transactional steps:\n\nPerson has bitcoins and wants to send money to their family in Zimbabwe; Person sends Bitcoins directly to BitMari; BitMari converts the coins into USD; BitMari delivers USD to the family via cash pick-up at a bank.\n\nThe KYC and AML are very important to get right with new clientele. Perkins Coie is our counsel and is continually vetting our compliance through all Zimbabwean remittance regulations. We are working closely with the Zimbabwe Reserve Bank and local financial institution to introduce our bitcoin remittance platform so we are following guidelines that provide the local authorities the confidence that bitcoin is a useful and secure technology. As we successfully progress, we see the institutional acceptance growing and economic demand growing.\n\n“More and more bitcoin-based solutions will be developed and proven in Zimbabwe.”\n\nCT: What is your forecast for Bitcoin in the country over the next 1-5 years? Are you seeing a real enduring interest in the new payment option?\n\nSS: Most people of the world face economic environments more similar to Zimbabwe than the U.S. or the UK. Bitcoin in Zimbabwe will fuel a Fintech movement that will make Zimbabwe a powerhouse in the Fintech arena. Zimbabwe has the strong fundamentals of a high literacy rate, high telephony penetration, an international economy with multiple currencies a highly professional diaspora and true sovereignty. More and more bitcoin-based solutions will be developed and proven in Zimbabwe.\n\nThey say necessity is the mother of invention. Well, desperation is it, father. We see bitcoin as a real benefit to the many successful land reform farmers who will one day be able to use bitcoin to more freely trade their commodities on the international market.\n\nCT: Are there other companies in the region Westerners should know about, maybe not in your niche, but related Bitcoin service industries?\n\nSS: Tawanda Kembo is working on a project and is the Godfather of Bitcoin in Zimbabwe. He has a startup BitFinance as well as a very strong local following. The creativity and brilliance of Zimbabwe make it a great development in Fintech. The country has been bold in overcoming the economic crisis with boldness and ingenuity that Greece and many other countries could learn.\n\nWe think our Bitcoin company will be important to the already upcoming economic rebirth Zimbabwe. The vast Zimbabwe tech talent will continue build on the wisdom and experience from its economic crises to build many more useful applications of blockchain technology with the credibility of real world experience to back it up.\n\n“Bitcoin will be the technology that unifies a ‘United States of Africa.’”\n\nCT: What do you think Bitcoin will be to Africa in 5 years?\n\nSS: Technology changes the world in ways that politics, militarism, and economics can\'t. Bitcoin will be the technology that unifies a ""United States of Africa."" The African Union (AU) has actively pursued ways to eliminate the border impediments to trading within the African continent.\n\nCurrently, African trade is set up to benefit the West and not the African countries. Bitcoin is a new technology that will overcome the political and nationalistic inhibitors as well as the neocolonial banking infrastructure that undermine Africa\'s development.\n\n****\n\nSinclair and BitMari have now set up a Startjoin account for crowdfunding investment. For those who would like to help Zimbabwe continue their economic revolution through Bitcoin, go to startjoin.com/BitMari', 'After receiving US$13.7m in previous funding rounds, the San Francisco-based startup Chain Inc. announced on Thursday that it has raised another US$30m in equity funding, and this time from some of the biggest names in the financial sector, including Visa, Nasdaq, Citi Ventures, CapitalOne, Fiserv and French telecom Orange.\n\n- Adam Ludwin, Chain CEO\n\nThe Chain platform was created to enable banks and financial institutions to create, issue, store and transfer digital assets on private networks purpose-built for a given market. These networks typically will not use bitcoin as a currency but are based on the bitcoin blockchain and protocol, and can also be interoperable with other open digital currency networks, including other Chain clients.\n\n- Ludwin\n\nChain is also considering the use of sidechains, or other blockchains that connect to the Bitcoin public blockchain to share its\' value while being tailored to specific uses or industries. “Ultimately, this question of the public Bitcoin blockchain versus a private permissioned ledger is somewhat like VHS versus Betamax,” Ludwin has stated.\n\nWhile at first it may sound unlikely for legacy banks and payment networks to fund their own disruption, Blockchains will be much cheaper for everyone to use than older financial instruments like credit cards. The banks, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express all collect 1% to 3% of domestic credit and debit transactions, generating more than $70 billion a year in fees in the U.S. market alone. “That’s a tax on all payments,” Wedbush analyst Luria told Forbes. “With Bitcoin that goes practically to zero.”\n\n“The days of [banks] holding onto people’s money a little bit longer and benefiting from that, or charging people fees and high margins on exchange rates, are going to end,” predicts Susan Athey, Board member at Ripple Labs and professor of the economics of technology at Stanford’s business school.\n\nEric Piscini, a principal in banking tech at Deloitte, gives a slightly different view of this, citing intentional auto-deconstruction. “The big financial companies need to be involved early to identify where blockchain will eat their profits, and then they must decide, ‘Should I cannibalize myself instead of waiting for someone else to cannibalize me?’”\n\n- Ludwin\n\nChain launched with 15 employees and three founders in 2014, immediately working with banks and other leading institutions. US$43.7m in backing and a list of investors packed with big banks and financial institutions puts Chain on the forefront of Bitcoin-finance industry relations, but there is competition in the sector.\n\nItBit, the first bitcoin exchange to open on Wall Street, announced an upcoming product it calls Bankchain. Rather than using the public Bitcoin blockchain, it will use its\' own permissioned ledger to do many of the same functions that Chain does, so it has yet to be seen if this business model is a threat to Chain.\n\nSan Francisco-based Ripple Labs also uses its own protocol and permissioned, distributed ledger that is not an actual blockchain. Their different internal structure may be of competition to Chain for the purpose of Forex and perhaps internal settlements.\n\nFormer JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters\' Digital Asset Holdings appears to be more in competition with Chain than the rest, have aquired permissioned ledger company HyperLedger. The company recently announced that a portion of it’s latest US$5m funding round has been issued utilizing distributed ledger technology.\n\nDespite plenty of competition, It\'s not much of a mystery why Chain is the company that so many financial behemoths are reaching out to in the Blockchain space. Chain made some key deals early on.\n\nIn June, Nasdaq announced that it has chosen Chain as a technology partner for its Private Market. As Ludwin recently told Nasdaq.com in an interview, “We believe in the power of blockchain technology to transform how financial assets are transferred, but it has to be done with the right partners to ensure it gets off the ground.”\n\n- Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq CEO\n\nWith a plan to go fully live in November, Nasdaq will offer blockchain-based trading for shares of pre-IPO private companies, including Uber and Airbnb. Greifeld hinted about the many opportunities using the blockchain, saying “[Blockchain] is the biggest opportunity set we can think of over the next decade or so.”\n\n""Chain is collaborating closely with us to increase efficiency in the capital markets,"" said Brad Peterson, Chief Information Officer, Nasdaq. ""We see their platform helping us accelerate our time-to-market across our various blockchain initiatives. We are excited to further our partnership with them through Nasdaq\'s investment in the company.""\n\nPopular gift card service Gyft, with its 300 big-box retailers and restaurant chains, announced that it is using Chain as well. CEO Vinny Lingham says that it offers Gyft a cheaper, more secure solution that will allow Gyft to sign up thousands of small merchants, alongside it’s current larger merchants today.\n\n- Vinny Lingham, Gyft CEO\n\nAnother backer is French telecom company Orange, which suggested it might be looking at a way to integrate the technology into its mobile offerings. ""We believe in the disruptive potential of the blockchain. Becoming a key partner and investor in Chain will help us to learn faster and perform tests around this technology,"" said Orange\'s Deputy CEO Pierre Louette.\n\n- Pierre Louette Orange Deputy CEO\n\nGlobal payments, processing, and risk management mainstay Fiserv is another investor that saw an opportunity in Chain. ""Blockchain technology presents a new opportunity to enhance the financial services experience,"" stated Fiserv CEO, Jeff Yabuki.\n\n- Jeff Yabuki, Fiserv CEO\n\nCredit giant Capital One\'s venture capital arm couldn\'t resist backing Ludwin and his team as well. ""Chain provides a developer-centric technology platform that is as intuitive as it is powerful,"" stated Adam Boutin of Capital One Ventures.\n\n- Adam Boutin, CapitalOne Ventures\n\nVisa also partnered with Chain. Jim McCarthy, the executive Vice President of innovation and strategic partnerships at Visa said that ""Visa\'s investment in Chain underscores our long-standing commitment to explore technology, like the blockchain, that could have the potential to advance secure and convenient digital payments for our clients and their customers.”\n\nHe went on to categorize this investment as “an extension of the work that the company has done with other technology partners such as Apple, Google, Samsung, Stripe and Square.”\n\nApproaching new markets is another reason Visa is interested in Chain. “Business-to-business spending or business-to-government spending is a much larger pie where we have very little penetration,” McCarthy continued, “and that might lend itself to an area where it can leverage the blockchain.”\n\nCiti, the largest bank grabbing a slice of the Chain pie, seems to be getting involved to test out the blockchain across a whole range of innovations. ""Blockchain technology represents a fundamental, generational shift for financial services, and Chain\'s platform is enabling and accelerating this transformation,"" stated Ramneek Gupta, Managing Director of Global Venture Investing at Citi Ventures.\n\n- Ramneek Gupta, Citi Ventures\n\nAll of Chain\'s investors will be meeting twice a year in what has been named the “Blockchain Working Group.” Meetings will be composed of the latest developments in distributed ledger technology, and each company will have the opportunity to present to each other and also get updates directly from a Chain officer, since the companies themselves will not be joining its board.', 'Billed as a potential venue for debate on more heated issues surrounding the long-term viability of the bitcoin network, Scaling Bitcoin saw a who\'s who of developers decamp to Montreal to talk about the underlying technical issues facing bitcoin yesterday.\n\nOften reduced in conversation to mentions of its price or market cap, Scaling Bitcoin succeeded at showcasing the breadth of challenges posed by bitcoin\'s approach to incentivizing disparate parties to maintain a common and equally beneficial distributed resource.\n\nHeld in Montreal, day one of the much-anticipated event focused more on how incentives for network participants should be balanced and less on the positives and negatives of any of the competing proposals – whether Bitcoin Core, its alternative BIP proposals or Bitcoin XT.\n\nThe more vitriolic parts of the discussion were confined to afternoon workshops on topics including the level of trust and privacy the bitcoin network requires between users and how relations between miners and developers should be managed.\n\nHeld under Chatham House Rules, the discussions were transcribed, though no names were able to be assigned to the content. Nonetheless, some of the more direct statements to the significance of bitcoin\'s challenges were made during the presentations on these roundtables.\n\nThere, one prominent academic appealed to the overall spirit of the event, stating:\n\n""In bitcoin, technical decisions actually have real economic consequences. Science compels us to hold these conversations to a higher standard, but those technical decisions should be made by actual measurements and not appeals to emotion.""\n\nOthers spoke to the value of the day\'s denser, earlier topics including the need for a greater knowledge of how often inefficiencies in the mining network – such as orphan blocks not ultimately included in the chain – are produced, and the communications delays that result in miners in different locations globally receiving delayed information about the network state.\n\nElsewhere, the need for continued communication among stakeholders at events such as Scaling Bitcoin was addressed.\n\n""It\'s not just about changing the blocksize,"" a participant said. ""It\'s about proving that when critical issues arise we can resolve them.""\n\nBitcoin-NG debuts\n\nPerhaps the most newsworthy event of the day came during the ""Testing, Simulation and Modeling"" section of the day\'s content when Cornell computer science post-grad Ittay Eyal presented Bitcoin-NG, a new proposed solution to scaling the bitcoin network.\n\nDeveloped by Adem Efe Gencer, Emin Gün Sirer and Robbert Van Renesse, Bitcoin-NG seeks lower latency, higher throughput and better security on the bitcoin network by proposing changes to the bitcoin mining process.\n\nThe proposal recommends breaking up the process by which miners are provided both a reward for finding a ""nonce"", the arbitrary number that decides who wins the 25 BTC reward distributed every 10 minutes, and the process by which those winning miners determine the transactions added to the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin-NG would create two types of blocks: key blocks, which contain no content but elect a ""leader""; and microblocks, which would contain only transaction content.\n\n""Only the leader can generate the private blocks,"" Eyal explained. ""The interval between the key blocks would be 10 minutes, while \'microblocks\' come in every 10 seconds.""\n\nUnder the system, keyblocks would be given the rewards from the mining block, while 40% of fees would go back to the leader and 60% to those who submit microblocks.\n\nThe proposal is still in its early stages and no white paper has yet been released.\n\nEconomics and incentives\n\nThe economics and incentivizes portion of the day saw three talks by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen, physicist and entrepreneur Peter R and researcher Miles Carlsten.\n\nAll three talks focused on how miners – the parties on the bitcoin network that process transactions – should be compensated, and how the larger network can expect these parties to behave when as existing incentivize structure may alter, whether that\'s as expected under the current bitcoin design or under an alternative proposal.\n\nCohen\'s talk, entitled ""How Wallets Can Handle Real Transaction Fees"", focused on exploring how the bitcoin network might be shaped should the number of transactions sent to miners routinely passes the 1MB cap for information included in new blocks.\n\nOverall, Cohen was supportive of the idea that the community allows the cap to remain at 1MB on the basis that this would help ascertain whether fees could one day replace block rewards.\n\n""If we hit blocksize limit and get real transaction fees, the idea is you should have a market where some transactions never happen because they don\'t pay the fee and you get an equilibrium price. We don\'t know what fees should be until we run the experiment and see what prices end up happening.""\n\nCohen advocated for upgrades to bitcoin wallets that would allow users to more flexibly interact with the bitcoin network by setting minimum and maximum fees and a length of time before the transaction would be canceled should the fee be too low to incentivize its inclusion in a block.\n\nFinding a free market\n\nAnother interesting take on issues surrounding the network came during Peter R\'s talk on how the economics of the bitcoin network could be expected to work should the community decide to remove a blocksize limit, essentially restoring the network back to its state before the cap was introduced as a way to combat spam.\n\n""Most people think miners find the nonce,"" Peter R said. ""Miners have another job as well, they produce a new type of digital commodity called block space, or \'room for transaction data.\'""\n\nFrom there, Peter R delved into the economics of supply and demand, suggesting that the market could be expected to a find an equilibrium even without a cap on block size.\n\n""Economists struggled with this problem, too,"" he said. ""They postulated a new law called the law of supply. It says producers will only plant more apple trees if they make more money for doing so. Supply and demand intersect at free-market equilibrium. Even though demand can be considered infinite, we still get finite amount of production.""\n\nWith this as a backdrop, Peter R ended by calling the blocksize a ""political measure"" that no longer had a clear benefit for the network other than reducing potential productivity.\n\nHe ended the session by announcing the forthcoming launch of Ledger, a peer reviewed bitcoin journal that will seek to highlight the best white papers and research produced by the technology\'s enthusiasts.\n\nPart-time miners\n\nThe imbalances that could be created by poorly aligned incentives in the network were touched on most directly by Miles Carlsten, who presented research conducted jointly with fellow Harry Kalodner and Arvind Narayanan.\n\nCarlsten discussed the non-network-related issues those who process transactions on the network face, including the cost of electricity and hardware. He evoked the idea of a gap that will occur as miners begin to selectively contribute to the network at times when the expected reward outweighs the cost.\n\n""This issue is made worse by the fact that hardware is becoming commoditized, which increases vulnerability to attack,"" he said. ""With the majority of miners mining at some gap, if attackers start mining right away, what fraction of the hashrate do they need to perform 51% attack? The fraction of hashpower quickly drops from 50%. This is a real threat to the security of bitcoin, as blocks must be immediately profitable to mine.""\n\nMost notable was Carlsten\'s contention that these issues could occur as quickly as in 2016 when the reward the network produces every 10 minutes will decline from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.\n\n""We think a gap will be profitable at next block halving,"" he said.\n\nAnthropology of open source\n\nRounding out the day\'s session was a talk by activist and author Gabriella Coleman, who provided an overview of how open-source groups have historically responded to governance challenges.\n\nColeman\'s work includes studies on universal operating system Debian and hacktivist group Anonymous.\n\n""I was surprised to hear this was one of the first meetings where developers have come together,"" she told the crowd. ""It\'s pretty rare to have an open-source community that doesn\'t meet. Those that don\'t meet often crumble and fall away.""\n\nColeman suggested that, based on historical precedent, bitcoin is unlikely to function on a governance model in which a ""benevolent dictator"" can sufficiently oversee the project.\n\n""Benevolent dictators can work if there\'s a founder, but usually that style of governance is matched with other types of governance,"" she said, adding:\n\n""Something like bitcoin where there is this mythical character, you don\'t have that kind of person.""\n\nPresentations from the day\'s event can be found in both written and video form.\n\nImages by Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The task is often hard because the basic concept of money itself is not visualized. I would say the best thing to do in this situation is to ask the following: do you understand the money in your own pocket?\n\nTypically the answer is “well no”, which is somewhat amusing. However, this lack of knowledge regarding the money we use every day is a sign that this subject was never properly taught.\n\nThis information was never shared in schools for a reason: because understanding the basic concepts of your money and economy is sovereign power. The concept of Bitcoin is hard to conceptualize when you don’t know about the very basics of your own money.\n\n[tweet_box design=”box_02?]Understanding Bitcoin is a hard task. But do you understand the money in your own pocket?[/tweet_box]\n\nQuantitative easing\n\nFiat money or paper dollars are inflationary. They can be represented in bills or online digits in bank accounts, and are produced centrally by the central banking system.\n\nThese private banking institutions create legal tender for citizens to use in their monetary transactions on a day to day basis. The money is printed with no transparency. Experts have said that billions of dollars are printed every month, or created in the wild world. Fiat money relies on central banking, which is sponsored by the governance in a geographical region. This in turn creates a monopoly on the tender we use everyday, and creates harsh boom and bust cycles in our economy.\n\n“The printing of vast amounts of fiat has created giant subsidies of fractional banking on the human system.”\n\nGovernments have allowed the monetary exchange economy to lean on destroying itself and depreciate in time coincidently with people having little understanding of the printing game itself.\n\nDollar or fiat money is not at all legitimate money when compared to precious metal coin or Bitcoins. The eight percent of hard cash or digits are, in fact, what’s called promissory notes. Where the maker or an issuer promises to pay or make the funds “real”. But the only way they can make these billions of pieces of paper “real” is by ensuring they will be accepted. That’s where governments and law settle: in the fact that they “must” be accepted.\n\nHowever, this is only true to what they say and what they print is nothingness and false promises. Inflation may be the biggest robbery on mankind and understanding it is a must.\n\nProof of work produces\n\nWIth Bitcoin there is only 21 million cryptographically-insured units. A ton of them are lost and the blocks being found by miners are becoming increasingly harder to find. Until one day the very last Satoshi will be found in 2140, and then the units will be fully distributed.\n\nThese coins can never be mass printed or counterfeited as they are validated through proof of work. Unlike the federal reserve, which prints by its own measure. The Bitcoin protocol is the first of its class in technology that can someday allow global consensus without the need for a central third party. This currency is the perfect money because it operates fluidly with the community who understand its three foundations: open source, decentralized and peer-to-peer. These core pillars representing the crypto-world have the power to change every financial sector, making it inclusive for every individual.\n\nBitcoin has the monumental power of filtering its protocol into more than just currency. Which will create a flourishing economy for every person on this planet. The Bitcoin protocol can create decentralized businesses, crowd fund, transparent voting processes, identity and reputation systems and so much more.\n\nTake these things and they create thousands, if not millions, of emerging jobs. It’s estimated that half the adults in the world do not have access to banking. However, many of these people try to participate in e-commerce, but lack the necessary financial tools to trade with. Bitcoin is all inclusive to every single one of these people and operates 24 hours a day. The system allows instantaneous transferring of funds in a peer-to-peer environment with absolutely no third party.\n\nOpen source, decentralized, peer-to-peer\n\nBitcoin can be understood by its deflation rate and shows by example that deflationary spirals are a myth. With a predetermined trajectory that cannot be manipulated by the Fed, the Bitcoin protocol and currency offer us the lasting control over our wealth.\n\nToday’s fiat scheme is destroying our economy and societal infrastructure. By vacating this destructive monopoly we can use a new means of voluntary and universal exchange. One that is founded upon three core ideologies of the free market, which will someday give the means of production back to its individual nodes.\n\nFiat money is printed exponentially and by whim. It’s accepted because the governments are behind it: but it devalue its uses every single waking moment. The idea is not to let our children pay $40 dollars for a loaf of bread, but to break the precedent of busts and hyperinflation. Bitcoin has the means to do that, and the ends are all inclusive for every single person on this planet. The existence of this protocol alone shows the true power of ‘human action’ and should whitewash corruption with a new color of transparency.\n\nWhen you understand the concept of what your money does you can then proceed to spend your wealth wisely. You can say “yes, I know the basic of inflationary and deflationary concepts.” Most people learning the basics about this beast often want to learn more so they can avoid the corruption and pillaging of their assets. With this said, there is a great responsibility in understanding the basic origins of how money is produced. Whether it’s central or decentralized, knowing is half the battle.', 'Since the dawn of digital currency we have always been bothered about the monetary value associated with it. A lot of processing power and electricity is being spent on mining to process the transactions happening over the bitcoin network. Miners have indulged in the process of finding sequences of low hash value with the sole purpose of gaining miner’s fee.\n\nBitcoin value is said to be related to the network size and the number of transactions that happen over the network. Now, what if the same processing power, or even a part of the processing power is diverted for a similar mining process with a social or a scientific cause associated with it. Well, there is one such option available for those who would want to use their processing power for good (I am not saying bitcoin is bad… No way! Bitcoin is awesome too, but in its own way). [email protected], a project by Stanford University started in 2000 has now adopted blockchain technology to create something called FoldingCoin.\n\nMining for the benefit of mankind\n\n[email protected] initiative by Stanford allowed individuals to contribute their spare processing power to simulate complex protein folding. The project didn’t involve any rewards, but just points to keep track of every individual’s contribution to research which can potentially lead to the creation of live saving drugs and treatments for the worst diseases mankind has known. The FoldingCoin can be considered as [email protected] version 2.0.\n\nBuilt on Counterparty, FoldingCoin with the symbol FLDC is distributed on a schedule and offered only to those who contribute cycles to [email protected] project. Once received, people can transfer FoldingCoin to others over bitcoin blockchain and Counterparty protocol. The computational power used in mining FoldingCoin will be harnessed for scientific projects.\n\nIn order to mine FoldingCoin, one has to download FoldingCoin client over [email protected] network and configure accordingly. Once the rig is set up, people can use their mining rig’s processing power on Work Units, which are basically protein folds sent to the client machine by the network. There are FoldingCoin mining groups, just like mining pools on the network which one can join and start cracking the Work Units. Every morning, the user’s wallet will be credited with FoldingCoins proportional to the amount of work done the previous day by the participant. These credits can be sent to others or exchanged for other Counterparty based altcoins.\n\nDigital currency and blockchain technology has a lot more to offer than just money. It can also be part of a bigger picture, adhering to ethical and moral values and contribute to the society and human kind as well.', 'El uso de Bitcoin evita los problemas y molestias referentes al manejo de la moneda tradicional y los problemas cambiarios.

Why is the price going up, and why is the price going down?” Coinalytics founder, Fabio Federici.\n\nAccording to their marketing materials, traditional data analysis approaches come up short when they’re applied to decentralized applications such as the blockchain. Coinalytics purports to succeed in this field through an application of advanced pattern recognition to discover patterns in the blockchain. This would allow them to offer their customers real-time risk assessment in order to react more quickly to market movements, as well as an scalable API that supports “SQL-like” queries.\n\n“The concept of a blockchain is expanding rapidly into classic early technology adoption industries like financial services, supply chain management and the Internet of Things, … We believe that growth will be fueled by an ability to assess risk and make better business decisions, and we anticipate Coinalytics will be an instigator of that ability.” Coinalytics founder, Fabio Federici.\n\nIn May of this year the company debuted a powerful visual analysis tool for the Blockchain —built on top of their API — to selected partners, which was baptized as Jarvis (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System, in a nod to the AI created by Iron Man). They also offer a separate blockchain explorer which allows queries and the ability to explorer interesting addresses, such as which holds the most Bitcoins at the moment.\n\nAbout the Team\n\nCoinalytics was born in 2014 during a Startup Weekend in Berlin, where Federici, working with two other teammates, built a rough prototype that analyzed blockchain data in order to display prices. Their work won them the “Most Innovative Idea” award at the competition and Federici decided to test his idea in Silicon Valley. There the company was eventually accepted into the 500 Startups program alongside other four Bitcoin companies (that was the first year Bitcoin companies were accepted).\n\nCurrently there’s only three members of the team at Coinalytics: Federici manages product development and funding aside from his responsibilities as CEO, Bill Gleim is the Machine Learning Lead Developer and James Edwards functions as the Principal Infraestructure Engineer.\n\nIt looks like they’re looking to expand though, which is understandable following their seed round. Currently they’re looking to fill several positions and details are available on their Jobs page.', 'Bitmain recently announced the Antminer S7 specs using their new BM1385 ASIC. This step is a big one, as the S7 is shipping to anyone around the worl — from small home miners to large data centers. Many other manufacturers are only using in-house or for the certain large mining operations that have announced new chips. Recently, we interviewed Jihan Wu co-founder of Bitmain. After the interview, Jihan sent a Bitmain Antminer S7 to review. The miner is an excellent step up from current offerings on the market. Let’s look at the specifications.\n\nAlso Read: Exclusive Interview With Jihan Wu of Bitmain on S7, Block Size Debate and More\n\nAntminer S7 Specifications:\n\nHash Rate: 4.86 TH/s\n\nPower Consumption: 1210 W (at the wall, with APW3, 93% efficiency, 25C ambient temp)\n\nPower Efficiency: 0.25 J/GH (at the wall, with APW3, 93% efficiency, 25°C ambient temp)\n\nRated Voltage: 12.0V+5%, should not be less than 12.0V\n\nChips per unit: 162x BM1385\n\nDimensions: 301mm(L)*123mm(W)*155mm(H)\n\nCooling: 2x 120mm fan\n\nWeight: 4kg\n\nOperating Temperature: 0 °C to 40 °C\n\nNetwork Connection: Ethernet\n\nDisclosure: Antminer S7 was provided by Bitmain for review.\n\nThe S7 arrived fast and with no damage. The Antminer S7 is built solidly with a dual push-pull fan system. The S7 is roughly the same size as the S5 and packs a lot of power in a small package. The housing has a new twist to it, in that you can connect 3 of them together at the sides with a tongue and groove system. I say three of them, as each controller has the connections to run three S7s at the same time. This stacking option will allow for several different ways to deploy them. We were unable to test how many at a time the controller will run as at this time we only have the one S7. Being able to stack them together even if you are not using one controller for multiple units is a plus. It can make for more secure arrangements in your racks and shelving.\n\nAntminer S7, Powerful Hashing With Lower Power Consumption\n\nThe power consumption to th/s ratio of the S7 shines. While the S5 produced 1.155 th/s at 600 watts, the Antminer S7 is producing 4.9 th/s using 1250 watts with a stock freq of 600. For this review, we used two EVGA Supernova 1300 watt Gold rated PSUs. We will be doing a video demo of the unit with the Bitmain 1600 watt PSU shortly.\n\nThe power connection setup is a bit different than you are used to seeing on Antminers. The beefier controller requires a PCIe connection to feed it power. Each hashing board requires all three plugs connected and uses roughly 405 watts. What we did for this review was connect two of them to one PSU. Then connected the 3rd board and the controller to the other PSU. It is important to remember only to connect one PSU to a hashing board. Do not mix multiple PSUs on the same board. Also of note is to power on the PSU that does not power the controller first. This arrangement will mean the hashing boards are powering up first for the controller to detect when you power on that PSU last.\n\nWhen the Antminer S7 is running, the noise is less than expected for a dual fan unit that is having to dissipate the heat generated in such a small package. Bitmain did a good of pairing fans that are high CFM yet not screaming loud. The S7 is louder than the S5, but not as loud as the S5+. At 4 feet, it registers 66 dB. Most of the noise sounds like rushing air. There is no high pitched whine. While this may not be something you want to put in your living room, but it won’t drive you out of your garage either.\n\n0.25 J/GH on a 28nm Die\n\nBitmain’s simple to use software is on the controller with the current firmware version being dated August 29th. We did not find any bugs or glitches as we sometimes find that some miners have when we get them before the general public. The freq selection is set up simply and offers lots of options, so overclocking and downclocking is simple to do.\n\nThe BM1385 ASIC is built using the 28nm process. In conversations with Jihan, he has stated that the 28nm process can be further optimized and with 28nm being a mature tech chips can be produced faster and cheaper while providing gains in performance. This performance gain is very obvious with the BM1385 ASIC as the power to gh/s ratio at 0.25 J/GH is very aggressive. The larger die size allows for a greater surface for heat dissipation as well. These things add up to an S7 that has a small form factor and solid performance.\n\nThe Antminer S7 is a solid performing Bitcoin ASIC miner that is being sold to anyone. The familiar form factor that Bitmain debuted with the S1 is there. Adding the tweaks of the tongue and groove system on the chassis allowing for easier stacking coupled with a robust controller allow for new options for deployment. The performance is the best on the market right now that you can get your hands on for Bitcoin ASIC miners. Bitmain has stated they will begin shipping the last week of Sept to the first week or so of Oct for batch one. From how the unit we received for review works they have the process down and things look good for their shipping window.\n\nThe Antminer S7 is a solid miner that will fit in well from small to large installations. The ease of use that is one of Bitmain’s hallmarks is there as well. The S7 on stock setting is putting out a reliable 4.9 th/s across Antpool, and Kano.is while pulling 1250 watts. It is a top performer like the S5 before it. The Bitcoin block reward halving will be happening at the end of July 2016 so getting your hands on the most efficient miners you can right now is crucial. The S7 is a great option.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Antminer S7? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nImage Source: Bitcoinist.net\n\nOriginally posted on: Exclusive 1st Review: Bitmain Antminer S7, 4.8+ th/s Using Only 1250 Watts', ""Joe Leahy in São Paulo and John Paul Rathbone in London SEPTEMBER 13, 2015 5 Value investors with strong stomachs and deep pockets are calling a bottom to Brazil’s plummeting markets, despite an economic and political crisis which could see the President impeached and last week led to the country’s credit rating being downgraded to junk. Multinationals such as British American Tobacco and Spanish construction conglomerate Abertis are among those taking advantage of depressed Brazilian asset prices to take locally-listed subsidiaries private. Brazil’s bourse has fallen 36 per cent in dollar terms this year. “It’s a vote of confidence in the underlying business,” said Romas Viesulas, of Nau Securities in London, of the trend towards buying out minority shareholders and delisting local companies. Brazilian assets have plummeted from their 2010 peak, when state-controlled energy group Petrobras raised $70bn in the world’s largest equity offering and the country was viewed an emerging market darling. Today, by contrast, Brazil is engulfed in its worst recession since the Great Depression, a corruption probe has reached into the highest levels of government, and most investors are giving the country a wide berth. “Brazil moves in cycles: smart investors sell at the top, buy at the bottom,” said a São Paulo corporate lawyer. “This time is no different — so long as you can stomach the volatility.” BAT is buying the 25 per cent of its local subsidiary Souza Cruz that it does not own; Albertis and Brookfield Asset Management are buying out the listed shares of local toll road operator Arteris; while Diagnósticos da América is delisting after the medical group’s share price fell almost 60 per cent from its 2010 peak. Mr Viesulas said investors are searching for bargains among so-called “fallen angels” such as Natura, the leading beauty products company, which is trading at a third of its stock market peak with a 7 per cent dividend yield. Other potential targets included companies trading at a discount to asset value, such as GP Investimentos, the private equity firm, and groups with strong balance sheets, such as footwear maker Grendene. Private equity investors are also stepping up their commitments, said Cate Ambrose, president of the Latin American Private Equity & Venture Capital Association. In the first half of the year, they invested $2.3bn, 20 per cent more than in 2014. “There’s never been a better time to invest,” said Ms Ambrose. “You’re going to do really well on the exchange rate and business owners are more incentivised to work with private equity groups and valuations have clearly come down.” The last time the Brazilian real, down by a third this year, approached current levels of close to 3.9 to the dollar was in 2002, a moment often seen later as a once in a lifetime buying opportunity. But back then China’s economy was growing fast and the commodity price boom was just beginning. Ms Ambrose cautioned it was difficult to pick the bottom of the Brazilian market for anyone with less than a 24-month horizon. Brazil's downgrade Play video Alejo Czerwonko, emerging markets strategist at UBS Wealth Management, said he also saw opportunities in the dollar corporate bond market with average spreads on some issuers at 700 basis points, the same as in Argentina, whose economy is in far worse shape. “We don’t recommend broad exposure, we think certain corporates with a relatively stronger balance sheet, relatively lower sensitivity to foreign exchange depreciation, [and] relatively lower dependence on commodities are offering interesting yields,” he said.

09/14/2015,"['Mark Karpelès faces the charges over his role in the collapse of the bitcoin exchange in 2014\n\nThe former head of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, Mark Karpelès, has been charged with embezzlement by Japanese prosecutors, according to reports from the Japanese media.\n\nKarpelès is alleged to have embezzled ¥321m (£1.7m) from the bitcoin exchange, which collapsed in 2014 after revelations of a massive shortfall in customer funds.\n\nHe is alleged to have transferred money from Gox’s bank account to other accounts in October 2013, where it was mainly spent on buying licenses for 3D-rendering software, according to Jiji Press. Some of the money was also allegedly used on an “expensive custom-built bed”, Jiji added.\n\nKarpelès was arrested in August in connection with the loss of hundreds of millions of pounds worth of bitcoin when the exchange collapsed.\n\nAt the time, a spokesman for the Tokyo police said French-born Karpelès, 30, was suspected of accessing the exchange’s computer system in February 2013 and inflating his cash account by $1m.\n\nHe has denied the charges, saying he had intended to pay back the money, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.\n\nIn January this year, Yomiuri said that, contrary to reports from Mt Gox, the vast majority of missing bitcoins from the company’s stash were stolen by an insider, with just 7000 bitcoins, or 1% of the shortfall, attributable to hacking attacks from outside the company.', 'Both the financial services and Bitcoin communities perked up last week when Citi, Nasdaq, Visa and other large financial institutions invested in Chain.com, a Bitcoin blockchain services provider.\n\nIn a year marked by announcements of financial incumbents’ interest in the technology underlying the digital currency — startup investments, lab experiments, board appointments and Nasdaq’s intention (partnered with Chain.com) to pilot using blockchain technology to manage shares in private companies — the funding underscored the fact that Wall Street is serious about using so-called distributed ledger technology in its offerings.\n\nBut while most everyone seems to agree that the technology will disrupt financial services, there’s no consensus as to how it will play out.\n\nWhen researching my magazine article on how this technology will change the industry, Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Pantera Capital, a blockchain investment firm founded in 2013 that has invested in Chain.com, said, “The Chain/Nasdaq deal is a watershed event — a high-profile global brand like Nasdaq is using the blockchain, and using it for something where the blockchain can add a lot of value.”\n\nYet, Wences Casares, who first heard about Bitcoin in late 2011 and is CEO of Xapo, a bitcoin wallet known for state-of-the-art security, said that though the Nasdaq/Chain pilot is a good example for demonstrating the virtues of the blockchain, he doesn\'t view it as significant.\n\n“If you had told me [back in the day] that AT&T was going to be using TCP/IP in the backend to move all their traffic to Europe or over Voice over IP, I would say, that makes a lot of sense. Would that be something that is talked forever and change the Internet? Not really,” he said.\n\nWhile these two views seem to conflict with each other, they could both be right. As the Euro Banking Association predicted in a May report called Cryptotechnologies, a Major IT Innovation and Catalyst for Change, “The first wave [of innovation] will concentrate on deeper automation of existing processes. The second will arise from new innovations based on the application of the exclusive features of cryptotechnologies.”\n\nIn other words, distributed ledger technology is likely to disrupt financial services first by making existing processes more efficient, secure, transparent and inexpensive, and then later by creating new products that we can’t even dream of. So while Chain.com’s work with NASDAQ and the other incumbent players matters for the first phase, the greater innovations may be yet to come.\n\nNasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld said, “I certainly believe that people who worked on ARPANET [which formed the basis for the internet] back in the day didn’t conceive of the internet we have today. We know that blockchain is important … and where that goes over time — unfortunately we don’t have the imagination to predict that.”\n\nHowever, for the first phase, the advantages that financial institutions have and the challenges that they face are becoming clear. Though I only had room to scratch the surface of these ideas in my magazine story, here’s a deep dive into why the financial services industry seems so eager to disrupt itself, and how this first stage of transformation is likely to play out.\n\nWhy Banks Are Funding Their Own Disruption\n\n“For an entire industry to be focused on a new technology within three years [of it being known beyond the initial core of enthusiasts] without it actually even disrupting them even 1% yet is an interesting reality,” says Chain.com CEO Adam Ludwin. For instance, he notes that in 2000 the recording companies’ reaction to Napster was not to invest in digital models but instead to sink money into lawsuits. “Maybe it’s because financial institutions haven’t fully internalized the change to their business model that’s going to happen, and they continue to look at [the blockchain] as just a better database,” he says. “Or maybe they know — they’ve seen the movie. They’ve seen this play out six, seven times across several different industries across the last couple decades. They’ve helped take many of these companies public that have assaulted different industries and they’re smart enough to know they should get ahead of it.”\n\nWhile fear could certainly be playing a role, big players could also be paying attention for a more pragmatic reason: many of the industry’s processes are overdue for an upgrade. “The basic elements of the current value transfer process have been in place for over 150 years,” stated a June 2015 World Economic Forum report, The Future of Financial Services, in its section on how decentralized payment systems like Bitcoin could change financial services. While many people describe the legacy architecture in place today as dating back to the ’70s, the WEF was referring to the fact that transfers facilitated by central authorities such as banks and clearinghouses has not changed in the last 150 years. (Distributed ledger technology can obviate the need for that trusted middleman.)\n\nAnother reason financial institutions have been quick to act could be due to the inroads financial technology (or fintech) companies like Betterment, Square, SoFi, Zenefits and others have made into their territory. In recent years, numerous banks have launched labs and venture arms to test new technology and invest in startups. For instance, in 2010, Citi launched Citi Ventures. “Part of [Citi Ventures’] value proposition to the firm is to make sure that we\'re scanning the horizon of emerging technologies and business models, making sure that we are testing them, that we invest in startups,” says Debra Brackeen, managing director and global head of the Innovation Network. Citi Ventures has not only invested in Chain.com, but is also testing three blockchains and a product called Citicoin and even discussing state-backed digital currencies with governments.\n\nThe company is just one example of how established institutions are pursuing fintech. “Most major financial institutions now have some kind of strategy team or a SWAT team or an incubator of some sort to try to keep the firms abreast of new technologies,” says Susan Athey, economics of technology professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a board member at digital currency company Ripple Labs. She says, of CEOs of top financial institutions, “As opposed to a year or two ago, I\'ve seen a big change in their level of interest and engagement. They have opinions about specific technologies and how they can and can\'t be used.”\n\nWall Street may also be acting fast because much of the industry currently makes its revenues by acting as the middleman. However, the technology itself is likely to take over that role, reducing profits. “The blockchain reduces the settlement window from X number of days to maybe a few hours,” says Eric Piscini, a principal in banking technology at Deloitte. “What\'s very interesting to us is all the financial industry is based on managing that window.” For instance, he says that an international transfer could take as long as five days to settle, during which the counterparty can fail or the exchange rate can change or you can have a credit risk. “You have a lot of people — a lot of people — working on managing that risk,” he says. “By reducing that window from a few days to a few minutes for a few hours, the amount of risk that you\'re taking is completely reduced — even eliminated — and all those people and technologies that you have in place to manage that risk are becoming irrelevant.”\n\nAthey says, “In the future, [people] are going to make a lot of smaller payments. That’s going to increase economic activity … That, in principle, makes a larger pie with lower fees.” So, many of the incumbents getting in on the action today are, in effect, competing to maintain or grow their share of what could someday be a less lucrative pie.\n\nIncreased Efficiency, New Markets: What Early Disruption Will Look Like\n\nHow banks utilize the technology depends on their particular areas of focus. “Some [banks] have management arms, some do trading, some commercial banking, some are big on cross-border payments, some, SME [small and medium-sized enterprises] banking services,” says Barry Silbert, Wall Street wunderkind and founder of SecondMarket, who now heads up Digital Currency Group, which has investments in more than 50 companies in 15 countries and also sees a lot of interest from established financial institutions. “So there’s not any one particular use case that they’re all interested in. The way they look at it is, where are the opportunities to reduce costs without creating incremental risk whether that’s compliance risk or otherwise? Then, where are the opportunities to generate revenue?” Finally, he said, they are looking ahead to that second phase of disruption, when the financial industry, including the digital currency startups of today, offers services we have yet to dream of.\n\nThe first two types of opportunities that Silbert outlines are subsets of the Euro Banking Association’s first phase: improving existing processes. Two partnerships Chain.com has announced are good examples. The Nasdaq Private Market pilot will use a private blockchain network to automate the burdensome process of managing shares of private companies, and Chain.com’s partnership with Gyft, owned by First Data, one of the largest global payment processors, will make gift cards, which are prone to fraud, more secure and cheaper by putting them on a private blockchain network.\n\nEven less obvious beneficiaries of distributed ledger technology are exploring it. “The efficiencies you can drive using the technology are as far-reaching as the Internet,” says Vic Pascucci, head of corporate development at USAA. The banking, investing, and insurance services provider is looking at both the currency and the technology for a variety of services, including insurance, operations and compliance. “So, can we use this to help out in the call center? Yep, we’ll probably look at that,” he says. “Can we look at that in the titling process or in smart contracts or in asset tracking or in claims? We are looking at all these things.”\n\nThe second type of opportunity Silbert mentions, a new revenue stream, would be exemplified by, say, a credit card network using the blockchain to enable micropayments whose value would typically be too small to process in the traditional manner due to the fixed costs of credit card payments. Many of the ideas targeting developing economies fall in this category. “If I’m a large, incumbent commercial bank, five to six billion people that don’t have access to a credit card or checking account but do have a smart phone or cell phone in their pocket, that’s an interesting business opportunity for me,” says Bart Stephens, a managing partner at Blockchain Capital.\n\nDisruption will come from the fact that not all financial institutions will exploit these opportunities, or that some will do so too late. Companies that already have established revenue streams may find it hard to innovate. Their current profits could make them reluctant to capitalize on the new technology. Noting that many of them make money by holding on to the deposits of their customers, Athey says they could be reluctant to cut fees and make money available to customers faster than startups would. “There\'s good reason to think that they may lose share and they certainly will lose fees,” she says.\n\nFinancial Institutions’ Starting Advantages\n\nBut firms that endure the pain of disrupting themselves will have an edge or two in the competition against startups. First, complying with regulations and obtaining the necessary licenses can cost a few million dollars, and maintenance fees can run a few hundred thousand dollars annually. This is not going to be like the first round of the Internet in which websites and social networks could be launched from garages and dorm rooms. This time around, startups that hold clients’ money will need venture capital funding just to be able to afford to comply with regulation. “I joke sometimes with my banking clients and I say, the regulators are your friends in that way,” says Piscini.\n\nIncumbents’ other starting advantage is the ability to leverage their trust with consumers. Though Bitcoin was originally conceived as a way for people to transfer money without the need of an intermediary, leading many in the community to call it the first “trustless” currency because it does not require trust in a third party, the average consumer doesn’t trust Bitcoin the way they do, say, Amex or the U.S. dollar. That makes room for existing companies to create digital assets (like a digital version of an American Express travelers cheque) that consumers will be more willing to use. (This is less the case in countries with unstable currencies or developing economies.)\n\n“If I give you a network dollar, what I’m actually giving you is a digital token to get a real dollar,” Ludwin says. “You need to trust that when you show up at the doors of that brand, if it says American Express dollar or Citigroup dollar, when you go to Citigroup, you need to be able to get a dollar from their vault.” Startups issuing digital assets — whether shares in a company or land titles or energy credits — may face consumer concerns about whether they’ll survive to live up to this promise.\n\nThe Challenges Financial Institutions Face\n\nBut the trust advantage that incumbents have could be short-lived. In the Internet of information (as opposed to the Internet of value), new tech companies have rather quickly garnered consumer trust and taken some share from banks. A recent Javelin Strategy report showed that consumers trust Apple, Google, Facebook, PayPal-eBay and Amazon (80%) with their financial information more than they do banks (44%) or card networks (79%). In fact, over the last four years, trust in these tech firms has almost doubled while consumer confidence in the banks has decreased. So, who garners trust in the long run — existing financial institutions or new digital currency startups — is an open question.\n\nSimilarly, financial institutions can’t be sure that they will capture new markets. Though Bitcoin could potentially allow existing players to tap into markets in developing countries, it could find competition from mobile phone companies. One of the six large companies to invest in Chain.com last week was Orange, which Olawale Ayeni, principal at Orange Silicon Valley, said last week at the Bitcoin conference Consensus, held by CoinDesk, has 240 million subscribers, with 100 million based in Africa and the Middle East, noting that that gives the company ownership of the so-called last mile. “The unique thing about Orange is that we are both in developed markets in Europe and in frontier markets,” he said. “Orange goes to Niger, Senegal, Mali, Côte d’Ivoire, a lot of markets that people don’t understand. We’ve been there for a while. When you talk about things being digital, particularly in frontier markets, people are getting digital via their mobile phones first” — before bank accounts.\n\nThis, he said, is leading to the blurring of the definition between a mobile phone and a bank, particularly in frontier markets. “When people say financial inclusion, a lot of people think about giving you a bank account. But fundamentally, it’s about providing you services like credit, insurance, so that notion of what a bank is in our view is quite different. If we can give you access to the same service and not have a bank in between — we already have the customers, we have the network, we can provide similar services that banks in frontier markets cannot,” he said.\n\nAnd the blurring of that line is not restricted to frontier markets either, he said, noting that Orange is applying for a banking license in France. “We don’t think the banks know more than we do in this new space,” he said.\n\nAnother great challenge incumbents face in trying to harness this technology for their benefit could lie in their willingness to work with each other. “For [shared ledgers] to have traction, there needs to be industry-wide adoption, because if you\'re the only one doing it, in a distributed ledger concept, there isn\'t much to gain from that,” says Bank of New York Mellon chief information officer Suresh Kumar.\n\nOne player in this space, who did not want financial institutions to know that this was his personal view, said that though a number of banks have expressed interest in creating a network themselves, separate from the open Bitcoin blockchain, he doubted it would happen: “I just don’t see a bunch of banks coming together to do anything. In the history of our financial markets, there’s been no examples of a consortium of banks saying let’s go build this together and it getting off the ground in five years and being the best solution.”\n\nPerhaps the investment in Chain.com by Visa, Nasdaq, Citi, Capital One, Fiserv and Orange — none of them competitors — is the first step toward creating such a network. The companies will come together twice a year in a Blockchain Working Group to discuss their learnings.\n\nBeyond companies collaborating, what would really bring us into our digital asset future is government-backed digital currencies. As mentioned earlier Citi already has had conversations with governments about digital fiat currencies.\n\nWhen Ludwin spoke on a panel at Consensus last week, the moderator asked what the government could do to spur the use of blockchains. Ludwin said, ""They could issue U.S. dollars on a blockchain.""\n\nThe audience, moderator and other panelists laughed.\n\n""You laugh,"" Ludwin said. ""Next year, whoever’s organizing the conference -- ask that question again, and see how far we’ve come.""', ""The startup Onename made a big announcement on September 12 at the Blockstack Summit 2015. Co-founder, Muneeb Ali, revealed during his lightning presentation that the Namecoin network is not decentralized and the mining group Discus Fish controls 60-70% of its hashing power. In result, Onename will be switching from Namecoin’s blockchain to Bitcoin.\n\nNews is out. Yes, ID transactions on t.co/QIZbZHoCUy is us migrating 32,000 uses to Bitcoin #blockstack https://t.co/zMJIg00XMv — Muneeb Ali (@muneeb) September 12, 2015\n\nTo the strongest blockchain go the spoils\n\nDuring the Blockstack summit, Ali revealed this information to the crowd and explained the company's decision to the audience to move the project and its “32,000 uses” from Namecoin to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nOnename is a tool that had used the Namecoin blockchain to work with decentralized identity systems (DIS). It uses a unique way to create a ‘name’ or unique profile to accompany your online blockchain verified identity. The open-source identity provider began its project in March 2014 with the ability to create a name instead of a binary number solution or a Bitcoin address.\n\nIn November 2014, when the company announced it closed its first seed funding round backed by Union Square Ventures, it also acknowledged at that time that getting developers to support its project via the Namecoin blockchain would be a difficult task.\n\nHowever, the primary reason for the switch was a large China-based mining operation Discus Fish, which has been noted to be controlling a majority of the Namecoin blockchain.\n\nAli’s partner and Co-founder, Ryan Shea explained:\n\n“A single mining pool has 67% of the hashpower on Namecoin. Namecoin is not decentralized and not secure.”\n\nMany from the community seemed ecstatic about this move and tweeted the news and posted commentary on reddit. One twitter comment stated “To the strongest blockchain go the spoils.”\n\nNamecoin ‘not secure’\n\nNamecoin, the blockchain-based Domain Name System (DNS), was one of the first large-scale altcoins introduced in 2010. The team envisioned a simple decentralized interface that operated as a readable naming system. Unfortunately for Namecoin, Muneeb Ali and his team don’t feel its blockchain is “not secure.” However, they do give credit for their growth to the protocol.\n\nAli says:\n\n“Namecoin deserves full credit for originally solving naming on blockchain. But in the long run, you need to be on the most secure blockchain”.\n\nBut while, some in the Namecoin community member don’t think the mining problem is a big deal with one redditor saying: “Because Namecoin is merge-mined it will only take one more large Bitcoin pool to include it and 51% would likely not happen again.” However, despite this reasoning, the Onename team feels that the Namecoin blockchain has been compromised.\n\nAli added that next week the startup will post a blog with more details on this news. There has been no commentary as of yet from the Namecoin founders."", 'During a recent interview with Epicenter Bitcoin, Blockstream Co-Founder and President Adam Back discussed the various forms of centralization that have crept into Bitcoin. While most of the community is worried about the centralization of mining pools and overall hashing power more than anything else, Back took the time to explain the overlooked importance of having a large number of full nodes on the network. As the blockchain has grown over time, it has become more difficult to process and store every transaction on a local hard drive. Back’s main contention is that full nodes are needed as auditors on the network.\n\nHow Full Nodes Affect Mining Centralization\n\nAlthough miners partially hold each other accountable, Back contends that full node auditors are needed to keep them honest. During the Epicenter Bitcoin interview, he noted:\n\n“If we have a very high ratio of economic dependent auditors, we can tolerate a more centralized ratio of large miners and vice versa because miners fighting against each other — vying for block rewards — partly hold each other honest because the sort of policy of not building on top of incorrect blocks. That’s a consensus rule, right? But what makes that a consensus rule is partly the full node auditors are looking at that.”\n\nFull Nodes are a Key Component of the Block Size Debate\n\nAdam Back then began to talk about full nodes in terms of the block size limit debate. He explained that some proposals don’t seem to fully consider the increased costs of operating a full node that would come with a block size limit increase:\n\n“I think I see in some of the more aggressive block [size limit] proposals articulation of less emphasis on the full node auditors. I’ve seen people be, potentially, quite content for full node auditors to, over time, be only possible in data centers and increasingly high-bandwidth, more expensive data centers.”\n\nBitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto understood that every user would not be able to run their own full node once adoption reached a certain breaking point, and he claimed that there would never be more than 100,000 full nodes on the network back in 2010. Satoshi’s understanding of the potential cost of running a full node is what led him to include an outline for simplified payment verification (SPV) in the original white paper.\n\nAlthough Back clearly explained the need to keep the cost of maintaining a full node low, he also noted that the development community should avoid moving to an extreme in the opposite direction:\n\n“Now, of course, you can’t constrain the network so that somebody on dial-up or a GSM modem or something really low powered and with a Raspberry Pi or something [is able to run a full node] — that would be too constraining and might already run into troubles. But it is a balance and you do want to make it easy and not too onerous to run full node auditors because you want the majority of medium-sized power users and so on to run full nodes to assure themselves more robustly of the security of the system. And actually, the security of the system as a whole benefits from that. It’s not just something they do for themselves. They run it for their own security. The fact that they run it for their own security holds the system secure because they would reject payments that didn’t check out from their full node, and that information would flow back to the SPV users.”\n\nFull Nodes as a Measurement of Decentralization\n\nAnother topic of conversation that has been somewhat popular in the Bitcoin community lately has been how decentralization can be measured in a peer-to-peer digital cash system. Truthcoin Creator Paul Sztorc has written a lengthy blog post on the idea that the cost of operating a full node could be used as a metric for decentralization, and Back seemed at least sympathetic to this idea during his Epicenter Bitcoin interview:\n\n“If you boil it down going down from the requirements about what Bitcoin is and why decentralization and permissionless innovation [are important], you can translate that into what are the mechanisms that make bitcoin secure, and the full node auditors — it’s not just running a full-node, you have to actually use it for transactions. It’s the amount of economic interest that is relying on full-nodes and has direct trust and control of those full-nodes. This is what holds the system to a higher level.”\n\nBack then described the sorts of technical issues that can make it more difficult to operate a full node and degrade decentralization:\n\n“The things that degrade this are things like block sizes getting full, memory bottlenecks, CPU validation bottlenecks, and companies outsourcing running full-nodes to third-parties, or running their entire bitcoin business by API to a third-party. There are some tradeoffs here; the software is sort of technical to run, and some startups may not have the expertise to run any software at all. But I do think we need a high proportion of full-nodes.”\n\nAlthough Back briefly discussed some of the work by Bitcoin Core Developer Gavin Andresen and Bitcoin Core Contributor Matt Corallo that has lowered the bandwidth, CPU, and other physical requirements of operating a full node, it’s clear that there is still plenty of more work to be completed in this area. Much of the Bitcoin scalability debate is focused on the block size limit right now, but the reality is that, as Peter Todd and others have noted, the work by Gregory Maxwell, Pieter Wuille, and other Bitcoin Core developers has been vital in allowing Bitcoin to scale to 1MB blocks. The Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Montreal this weekend should give everyone a clear view at the current options for bringing Bitcoin to millions of new users over the next few years.', 'If the first day of Scaling Bitcoin focused on fostering constructive dialogue, day two moved the conversation toward defining how that dialogue would proceed following the event and how such discussion could coalesce into a clearer vision for the open-source technology\'s future.\n\nTopics of discussion at the event still focused most directly on the larger question of how the bitcoin network could support increased transaction levels. However, these presentations were buoyed by musings on the trade-offs that will need to be weighed should the community want to honor the project\'s original democratizing vision.\n\nFor example, some of the day\'s talks occasionally provided a broad, analytical look at current proposals, delving into the theoretical considerations such as how much capacity the bitcoin network would need to handle at scale and how the metric of scale could be defined.\n\n""When people talk about how bitcoin will have to scale, people throw out something about Visa processing 20,000 transactions per second or something,"" Harry Kalodner, of Princeton\'s Security and Privacy Research Group, said. ""There are other relevant factors though.""\n\nKalodner went on to suggest using the bitcoin blockchain as a domain name storage system might add 294 million transactions to the network, a figure that doesn\'t include expected use cases such as in the Internet of Things. ""There are 245 million cars in the US,"" he added.\n\nIn this light, sometimes contentious approaches to blockchain design such as the Lightning Network, which seeks to add payment channels to bitcoin, and BIP 102, a proposal to increase the blocksize to 2MB, were discussed but with the goal of providing clarity as to their intent.\n\nPaul Sztorc, author of the Truthcoin white paper, spoke about the existential issues facing the blocksize debate, and the need for arguments to be understood as the sum of underlying assumptions that must be qualified and stated clearly.\n\nSztorc told attendees:\n\n""If someone hasn\'t stated what they think the blocksize does for bitcoin, you can\'t tell if what they said was right, or if you agree with the purpose they expressed. Not agreeing on the objective function is almost as bad as not agreeing on the constraint.""\n\nElsewhere, the afternoon sessions featured 12 roundtables held to address community challenges. Some moved toward solutions, such as a proposed set of principals that seeks to help the development community grow.\n\n""We need to have better resources for new entrants to the community, so they can be onboarded to the community without negativity,"" one presenter said.\n\nThe proposed principles are just one initiative that will be developed prior to being presented at a second Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong.\n\nTo be held in December, the event is slated to feature presentations for scaling the bitcoin network, which will be evaluated against criteria developed at this weekend\'s event in Montreal.\n\nBlock size considerations\n\nOne of the day\'s more anticipated talks was by Bitcoin Core developer and BitPay employee Jeff Garzik, whose presentation was entitled ""Issues Impacting Block Size Proposals.""\n\nThis July, Garzik introduced BIP 102, a patch to the bitcoin software that would raise the blocksize limit to 2MB via a hard fork. The short-term solution would alleviate immediate worries about the network reaching capacity, though the specific pros and cons of the measure were discussed only tangentially.\n\n""The trend is pretty clear that we are headed towards the 1MB block size limit,"" Garzik said, warning that user experience on the bitcoin network will decline when blocks hit capacity. This occurrence, he argued, that would necessitate that consumers pay fluctuating fees to execute transactions, something consumers and consumer products aren\'t yet equipped for.\n\n""A wall at 1MB creates chaos as fees shift to a new higher equilibrium. When we hit that wall, businesses or users might be incentivized away from bitcoin by high fees,"" he said, adding:\n\n""If we fail to get to consensus at all, and it\'s incredibly difficult to figure out where to go, and we just sit at 1MB, then that strangles bitcoin growth and adoption because of how toxic we\'re making this.""\n\nGarzik suggested that larger financial entities may be inclined to use the bitcoin network, but that they are currently confined to experiments because doing so would instantly cause the network to hit its transaction processing capacity.\n\nThe talk perhaps best succeeded at showcasing Garzik\'s viewpoint that any and all solutions to bitcoin\'s current blocksize dilemma need to be considered.\n\n""A second course correction hard fork is likely. All the world\'s coffee payments won\'t fit on the blockchain, you must have layer two and all the other scalability solutions,"" he concluded.\n\nPayment channels\n\nOne of the central considerations of the blocksize debate is how many transactions need to be recorded directly onto the bitcoin blockchain. For example, the Lightning Network, currently in development, proposes updating the protocol to support off-blockchain micropayment channels which would then settle on the blockchain.\n\nLed by Lightning developers Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, the talk focused not directly on the project, but the implications for not scaling bitcoin to meet expected demand.\n\n""The underlying assumption in these failure models is the assumption everyone would use bitcoin if they could,"" Dryja said. ""We\'re assuming everyone wants to use this.""\n\nDryja suggested that the community should start first by drawing rough parameters on the size of blocks it is willing to ""agree are crazy"", ruling out sizes of 1 kilobyte or as big as 1 petabyte.\n\nIn between, Dryja spoke about a ""bathtub"" of outcomes, hypothesizing that if the block size were extremely limited, it would grow only 50MB annually.\n\n""[In this scenario], you can run a full node on your phone. But 10 large institutions have private keys. This is a failure because users don\'t have the keys. That was the promise of bitcoin to be your own bank,"" he continued.\n\nIn turn, Poon spoke about the technical limitations of the blockchain for micropayments today, suggested that the cost of using the network for a transaction is 3 cents, making smaller transactions cost-prohibitive.\n\nThe talk was followed by a presentation by Come Plooy of Amiko Pay, a project that aims to be an implementation for Lightning that deals with routing data between payment channel nodes.\n\nBlock size research\n\nThe more experimental aspects of blockchain mechanics were discussed in a series of talks that included Ethereum researcher Vlad Zamfir, Blockstream co-founder Mark Friedenbach and BitFury chief information officer Alex Petrov, among others.\n\nZamfir led off the section with a talk on ""sharding"" blockchains, a process by which nodes hold only a subset of the state and the blockchain. In bitcoin, nodes are currently expected to hold a complete version of the blockchain.\n\n""[With sharding], instead of everyone redundantly doing the same work, we\'re going to share the load but still have an economic assurance even though we\'re not going to validate every transaction,"" Zamfir explained. ""We can get orders of magnitude of transactions per second if everyone isn\'t validating everything.""\n\nUnder the system, miners are assigned shards of the blockchain, he said, before explaining some of the issues inherent in coordinating parties within such a system.\n\n""We need to sample the mining power, which presents a problem,"" he continued. ""We need to split the state space into shards, we need to process transactions within shards, and then deal with attack vectors where not everyone is checking everything.""\n\nElsewhere, Friedenbach spoke about the benefits of having a blocksize on a blockchain network, explaining why the measure was enacted, as well as some of the problems that have resulted from the decision.\n\n""We want to do this because in the early days of bitcoin there are often certain kinds of transactions there are ways to slow down a validator by using a non-standard transaction or filling up a block with tons of spam,"" he said.\n\nWords of warning\n\nWhile mostly well-received, the conference ended on a controversial note, with remarks by Nicholas Negroponte drawing the ire of more anti-government members of the bitcoin community.\n\nFounder of the MIT Media Lab and an investor in WIRED Magazine, he urged the bitcoin community to weigh the societal implications of the technology when making decisions.\n\n""What is the difference between a mission and a market?"" he asked. ""If you\'re after a market, be my guest, but what is going to make bitcoin work is when you think of it as a mission. It\'s going to make the world a better place in a lot of different ways.""\n\nNegroponte also chastised the community for its inclinations to treat the technology as a ""get rich quick scheme"" and to hoard bitcoin due to its expected future value.\n\n""What\'s wrong with being run by the government? If you think the government can\'t run anything, go to Finland and ride a train. There are certain things that governments can run,"" Negroponte said, concluding:\n\n""Screwing it up is the people. It\'s not the technology.""\n\nPresentations from the day\'s event can be found in both written and video form.\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Casey, co-author of The Age of Crytocurrency, gave a keynote address at last week\'s ATM & Mobile Innovation Summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nBitcoin is dead. Well, not really. But these days, it\'s all about the blockchain, baby!\n\nWhen news broke last week that some Wall Street heavyweights had invested a combined $30 million in chain.com, a blockchain developer platform that serves the enterprise market, it represented a ""come to Jesus"" moment not only for the traditional financial industry, but also for those bitcoin enthusiasts who oncewere the sole guardians of the virtual currency\'s underlying technology.\n\nThe cat is out of the bag regarding the power of the blockchain.\n\n""Every bank now is playing with the open source software [of the blockchain],"" Paul Vigna, co-author of ""The Age of Cryptocurrency,"" told the audience at a panel discussion during last week\'s ATM & Mobile Innovation Summit in Washington, D.C. The summit is an annual event co-hosted by the Electronic Funds Transfer Association and Networld Media Group, publisher of Mobile Payments Today, ATM Marketplace, and Virtual Currency Today.\n\n""All the banks are starting to see the benefits of a system of information stored on central location [and capable of] faster transactions,"" Vigna continued. ""That is where the most heat is with bitcoin [today]. [The banks] are not afraid of it, and that is a marked changed because most people on [Wall] Street didn\'t want to know anything about it.""\n\nVigna\'s co-author, Michael J. Casey, gave a keynote speech to kick off the summit\'s second day and joked that their book, published last year, is already outdated in light of the current conversation about the blockchain. The conversation about bitcoin has shifted from a discussion of bitcoin as a payment method to an examination of the underlying technology.\n\nThis is due largely to the fact that consumers in the U.S. are mostly content with their existing options for making payments — i.e., fiat currency and plastic — and don\'t really feel the need for an alternative such as bitcoin. But on the other hand, financial services providers struggling with longstanding issues around payment security and speed do see the blockchin as a possible solution to a persistent problem.\n\n""The \'Eureka!\' moment with bitcoin was the ability to exchange value with others without a third party,"" Vigna said. ""Just the fact they were able to do it was a seismic shift ... you had early adopter types who wanted to have a system where the dollar faded.\n\n""[But] once the early adopters tried to take it mainstream, that\'s where you ran into problems. The systems we have in place now work pretty well in the U.S., and its biggest pop lies in emerging markets.""\n\nDuring his keynote, Casey identified several areas where he believes the blockchain can make a difference in financial services and other areas.\n\nHe summarized the use cases often cited in reference to the blockchain (such as smart contracts), but said he believes that the technology alsocould improve processes in auditing, identity management, supply chain management, and wealth distribution.\n\n""One of the reasons why some people believe the value of bitcoin will increase in the future is because now we\'re recognizing that there are all these alternative uses for the blockchain,"" Casey said. ""We think of bitcoin currency as the first use case application on top of the blockchain ledger. The reason why this is possible is because the blockchain is this transparent, decentralized, always-available, real-time ledger. That\'s a very powerful thing.""\n\nOf course, as more traditional financial companies turn their attention to the blockchain, regulators across the globe will do the same. But right now, most governments still have their eyes on bitcoin as a transaction method.\n\nSome panel discussions at the summit focused on regulation, including the regulation of bitcoin.\n\nThe recent approval of the New York BitLicense has had an adverse affect on the virtual currency industry, particularly in the state.\n\nLeading up to the final set of rules, bitcoin supporters expressed concerns that the proposed New York regulations would be a financial burden on their businesses, and ultimately would force them out of New York, or cause them to stop doing business in the state.\n\nBoth have happened.\n\nFortune recently reported that many bitcoin startups decided to leave New York instead of applying for a BitLicense. Companies such as GoCoin and Kraken are among the companies that have pulled up stakes.\n\nOther states are expected to follow New York\'s lead, thanks to efforts of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.\n\nMargaret Liu, senior vice president and deputy general counsel of the organization, told summit attendees that the group\'s emerging payments task force continues to seek comment on a regulatory framework for participating states.\n\n""It was put out for comment in December, and we received a lot of great comments from the industry,"" Liu said. ""We will soon come out with a final version of it.”\n\nLiu said the framework is not a set of rules, but recommendations that states can use as a guide when setting up their own processes for virtual currency regulation. She added that the recommendations will be similar to banking and money transmitter regulations.\n\nBut a couple of panelists questioned whether applying money transmitter regulations to virtual currency is the best approach.\n\nKim Ford, vice president of public affairs at First Data, said that some states have hesitated to paint virtual currency with a money transmitter brush.\n\n""From First Data\'s perspective and how we view the lobbying field, [this conversation] isn\'t just as easy as taking virtual currency and plopping it into money transmission,"" she said during a panel discussion on Friday. ""There are certain risks and characteristics inherent to virtual currency that are different than the traditional money transmitters.\n\n""If you\'re trying to meld that into one framework, it might arguably put some more requirements on traditional money transmitters that might not be appropriate.""\n\nAnd this could become a problem for a company such as First Data that deals with money transmitter businesses.\n\nSarah Martin, vice president of the Digital Currency Council, noted that a challenge with trying to put virtual currencies in one box (e.g., money transmission), is that instruments such as bitcoin and other virtual currencies are part of a larger conversation about blockchain technology.\n\n""As much as states and other [global] governments are trying to sort out how to appropriately regulate this technology, trying to force virtual currency into money transmission regulation is a little challenging, and perhaps premature,"" she said.', ""Bitcoin wallet addresses have long strings that can be hard to remember, similar to the IP address for a website. It stands to reason that bitcoin needs it's own Domain Naming System (DNS) that allows us to use short, memorable, but unique names to pay people more easily.\n\nThe internet's DNS system is so useful and ever-present that we almost couldn't have the internet without it. That is the assumption underneath the open source, nonprofit, completely decentralized Bitcoin Naming System called BitAlias. By registering a BitAlias, or a ‘username for Bitcoin,’ you would make it as easy for people to send you money as it is for people to see your website.\n\nBitAliases can also be used like a web identification name for authentication to third-party web services. Most conveniently, this can be done with a browser wallet extension, which supports the BitID or Trezor Connect protocol.\n\nWithin a few years we could all be carrying around some kind of gadget or program that allows us to present our private keys for signing all kinds of transactions, such as sending bitcoins and proving, cryptographically, that we are who we say we are. Trezor, Ledger, and KeepKey bitcoin wallets can actually do this today, as can a few bitcoin wallets on Android smartphones as well.\n\nBitID and the Trezor connect protocol both facilitate this rapidly-approaching future by acting as the framework for these key signings. Since BitAliases support these protocols, your BitAlias could theoretically become a very important form of Identification, even allowing you to enter a building or start the engine on a car.\n\nTo register and renew your BitAliases, the price is currently set at 0.0001 bitcoin for one year, with free transfers. So for one year at a time you have to pay about a nickel's worth of non-refundable fees to rent it out, and it becomes instantly available to others if you fail to pay the renewal.\n\nAll fees go to unspendable addresses, that no one will ever be able to retrieve, essentially burning the coins forever. As the creator of BitAlias, Yanislav Malahov, argues “Burning the fee is the most fair and decentralized way.”\n\nThis process of 'burning coins' is nothing new, although many people's first reaction is horror at the waste of a limited supply of money. However, since bitcoins are divisible down to at least 100 million places, (0.00000001) this waste only serves to make all the rest of the bitcoin holders a tiny fraction richer. To prove that point, the BTCBurns website tracks the number of all known 'burn addresses' and they report that so far there have been 2,673 bitcoins burned, out of the 14.6 Million in circulation.\n\nThe registration process for a BitAlias is technical but quick, and involves sending two tiny bitcoin payments in a specific order, with specific data attached to them. The first spend requires your signed signature to be attached, and the second needs the BitAlias being registered, along with the 0.0001 BTC fee. Both go in the OP_RETURN field of their respective bitcoin transactions, and both get sent to the bitcoin 'burn' address.\n\nTransferring BitAliases is a 1-step process, which doesn't even require a fee as long as it's signed with the proper owner's private key. To make this process easy enough for anyone, open source software is being developed to make the process form based.\n\nIn much the same way domain names are traded through marketplaces like Sedo and Snapnames, BitAliases would be tradeable across various marketplaces as well, most likely in some kind of auction. Having fewer parties involved in the transaction makes it faster and more secure than legacy domain name auctions, as does paying in the same currency that you use to secure the name with. The Domain speculation market is huge business today, with some domain names fetching prices of over $10 million on occasion.\n\nBitAlias is the brainchild of Yanislav Malahov, a bitcoin developer from Germany with several wallet projects under his belt, including the first Dogecoin browser wallet, a colored coin wallet, and he was also a founding member of Dark Wallet.\n\nMalahov admits that the BitAlias protocol was inspired by the Namecoin protocol, but changed to use only the Bitcoin blockchain, which has the largest mining network and is the most likely to survive in the long run. He also says that he has tweaked it to make his protocol more simple and more secure.\n\nA few other challengers for Blockchain Identity tools do exist, although they don't offer the same DNS-type of solution that BitAlias is centered around. Onename and Blockstore both offer benefits that BitAlias looks spartan next to, however, both have their downfalls as well.\n\nOnename is the most developed of all blockchain identity projects, having launched their complimentary PassCard service this year, attracting 32,000+ members including many of the bitcoin core developers and Venture Capitalists as customers. More recently, the protocol has been integrated into OpenBazaar.\n\nWhile Onename offers lots of nice features, like a place to include your GPG key, Avatar, and link your social media accounts for further proof, it is more centralized than BitAlias, depending heavily on the Onename.com website. It also does not have any mechanism for a DNS-type browser resolution, and therefore, it doesn't leave any room to create a marketplace for it's names.\n\nBlockstore looked to be the solution to Onename's centralization problem, but is highly technical in nature, requiring command-line access to install and run. However, it is completely distributed, like bitcoin and BitAlias. The major difference is that the open source software behind blockstore relies on a Distributed Hash Table to share data between users, meaning that users will host copies of each others' data. For the purpose of decentralization this is highly desirable, but the project needs much more development to make it user friendly enough for a non-coder to use.\n\nFor both projects there is an additional problem that Malahov points out, however. Their names aren't fully scarce like bitcoins, BitAliases, and Domain names all are. “These systems are unfortunately currently broken, because miners can register names for free. This is known to the developers but they have not fixed it yet,” states Malahov.\n\nMalahov specifically made his system to 'burn coins,' and requires all BitAliases to pay a fee. Onename doesn't charge a fee at all and Blockstore has the miner's loophole, allowing some people to pay a fee while others can register their names for free. That leaves only Namecoin as a competitor of scarce blockchain identity solutions.\n\nThe question remains if scarcity matters for blockchain identity in the same way that it does for domain names or cryptocurrency. If we learn that it does, BitAlias will be in the best position of all blockchain identity platforms."", 'Let’s face it – Bitcoin is mostly dudes.

Cyprus’ University of Nicosia\n\nIn November 2013, the University of Nicosia in Cyprus (UNIC) became the first in the world to accept bitcoin for tuition and other fees, receiving its first payment from a student within weeks.\n\nA few months later, UNIC – the largest independent university in Cyprus and one of the largest English language higher education institutions in Southern Europe – launched a free online course titled Introduction to Digital Currencies aimed at students wanting to gain a better understanding of bitcoin.\n\nThe university also offers a MSC in Digital Currency taught in English.\n\n2. University of Cumbria\n\nThe University of Cumbria became the first university in the UK to accept bitcoin payments for two courses linked to the study of cryptocurrencies at the beginning of 2014.\n\nEarlier this year, the university also announced the launch of a free online Masters-level course that would look at the future of money.\n\nTargeting ""monetary innovators and activists from any political persuasion"", the month-long initiative sought to explore the essence of money and how it has been interpreted over the last three millennia.\n\nDuring the course, pupils reportedly explored the assumption somewhat prevalent in the bitcoin community that money is best understood as an asset with intrinsic value.\n\n3. Simon Fraser University, Canada\n\nIn August last year, Simon Fraser University (SFU) became the first in Canada to accept bitcoin, publicly announcing that it would take donations in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe British Columbia-based institution, home to more than 35,000 pupils, framed its decision as a way of increasing its perception as a forward-thinking institution.\n\nMike Yeung, the president of SFU\'s Bitcoin Club, said:\n\n""SFU is looking to be really innovative and really edgy, and bitcoin is one of those things that is perfect for that.""\n\nFollowing this, the university announced it would start accepting bitcoin payments at a bookstore on campus in May – later installing bitcoin ATMs at three of its stores.\n\n4. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\n\nMIT\'s Coop bookstore began accepting bitcoin payments for items such as T-shirts, textbooks and school supplies in September last year.\n\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, the news came amid growing interest in the digital currency before the launch of its student-run \'airdrop\', which distributed $500,000 in bitcoin among its undergraduates.\n\nMore recently, MIT\'s Media Lab announced the launch of its own bitcoin course, which sets out to inspire the ""next generation of bitcoin CEOs"".\n\nThe institution, which supports several bitcoin core developers, will also be teaching a ""highly technical"" course on coding the blockchain starting this semester.\n\n5. New York University\n\nFounded in 1831, New York University (NYU) – the largest private non-profit institution in American higher education – launched a cryptocurrency course in September 2014.\n\nIts first class of The Law and Business of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies series was taught by Professor Geoffrey Miller to 35 students.\n\n6. Duke University\n\nThe course at Duke University, – where Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam graduated five years ago – was prepared by Finance Professor Campbell Harvey and also launched in September last year.\n\n7. Canada McGill University\n\nCanada\'s McGill University – founded in 1821 – witnessed a 30 mBTC ($7) giveaway for six hundred of its students in January this year.\n\nLaunched by McGill Cryptocurrency Club in conjunction with Montreal\'s Bitcoin Embassy, the event was inspired by the MIT Bitcoin Airdrop.\n\nAs part of the initiative, students also received educational information and invitations to free bitcoin lectures and workshops.\n\nAt the time the McGill Cryptocurrency Club said: ""Our hope is that by running an airdrop, we will bring more students from the informational and communal fringe into the heart of the [bitcoin] community.""\n\n8. Pompeu Fabra University\n\nAlso in January this year, Spain\'s Pompeu Fabra University announced its decision to install a bitcoin ATM on its Poblenou campus, becoming the first higher education institution in the country to do so.\n\nFounded in 1990, the university is home to approximately 10,000 students and has an annual budget of €118M.\n\nAt the time, Miquel Oliver, UPF professor of technology and communications said in a statement that the installation was part of the university\'s wider scheme to introduce pupils to disruptive new technologies.\n\n9. Imperial College, London\n\nImperial College, a leading research university in the United Kingdom, has been researching cryptocurrencies for the last two years.\n\nIt launched the Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering, a dedicated academic research centre and run a cross-departmental bitcoin forum for students and staff.\n\nIn October 2014, the university announced its partnership with Entrepreneur First (EF), a pre-seed investment programme, which focused on spreading the word about bitcoin technology among students.\n\nStudents; Duke University images via Shutterstock and Pompeu Fabra via Flickr.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The remittance services and outlets such as Western Union and Lhuiller (Filipino Local Remittance Service) can be extremely expensive and inefficient, as it requires 5 percent to 12 percent of the entire transaction to be paid as “service fees.”\n\nSatoshi Citadel Industries and its subsidiary company Rebit.ph aims to break this barrier of the Filipino and Canadian remittance markets to enable Filipino expat workers to send and transfer payments with ease. The company is seeking to get a significant share of the Philippines-to-Canada remittance market and process as many remittance payments as possible using Bitcoin technology.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Satoshi Citadel Industries CEO John Bailon explained:\n\n“We’re aiming high. We want to capture as much as we can, and although this seems farfetched, I truly believe that with the current existing technologies, i.e. ubiquitous smartphones and the Bitcoin technology, this is now achievable. The timing is right, and with partners like ZipZap, building the open remittance network on top of the blockchain is now a reality. Cost of remittances is a huge pain point (USD 2B huge) for a lot of my fellow countrymen, and that is what ultimately motivates us to bring a faster and cheaper service to market.”\n\nProcess\n\nThe process of sending remittance or, as the company calls it, a “rebittance,” via rebit.ph is simple. Users can use the ZipZap application which acts as an on-ramp interface for remitters.\n\nThen, the users “are asked how much they want to send in Candadian dollars, plus the corresponding recipient details, and as soon as they hit “send,” the transaction goes through the Bitcoin network.\n\n“In a matter of minutes, we process the transaction at Rebit and cash in PHP is made available for the recipient through whatever payout method the remitter nominated,” Bailon said. “For both remitter and receiver, the bitcoin part is invisible, they don’t have to know how the funds were sent accross the network, what they know is that it’s a more convenient and cheaper way to send money back home.\n\n“Because we use Bitcoin at Rebit, we’re open to receive transactions from any individual or company, effectively an open network for remittances,” explained Bailon.\n\nPossible Expansion\n\nUltimately, Satoshi Citadel Industries intends to expand its services and “target the top 10 locations where there is significant Filipino migrant worker population,” including UAE, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nToday, residents of Australia, Canada, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan and many other Asian countries can transfer and send money using bitcoin to remittance outlets and banks in the Philippines. Through partnerships with local banks and financial institutions, Rebit.ph has made it extremely easy for Filipino expat workers to send payments, and Filipino residents to receive transactions at remittance outlets, which are available across the country.\n\n“By partnering with companies such as ZipZap, we’ve made sending remittances to the Philippines via Bitcoin easy, cheaper and faster compared to traditional methods.. It’s like Western Union, except it’s open to for anyone to participate in. We jokingly call this network the Eastern Union,” added Bailon.']"
09/15/2015,"['Talk to most people about Bitcoin and several things come to mind: a secretive inventor, illicit marketplaces and the failure of one of its largest exchanges. Not exactly the kind of images most entrepreneurs want to be associated with.\n\nBut it turns out that currency might not be the most exciting thing to come out of the Bitcoin craze. Instead, it’s the technology that makes Bitcoin work, known as the blockchain, which will be truly revolutionary.\n\nBefore leaping ahead, a word on how Bitcoin works. Bitcoin, of course, is a digital currency that can be used like cash to pay for a growing number of goods and services. When someone uses Bitcoin to, say, buy a pizza, that transaction is recorded on a “block,” or a file of data. Once a block is full (determined by time — on average every 10 minutes — rather than quantity), the next block to be created incorporates computer code that refers to the preceding block — thereby building a permanent string of records known as the blockchain.\n\nWhat makes the blockchain unique is that instead of using a centralized source, such as a traditional bank, to verify exchanges of Bitcoins, that certification is provided by an army of people worldwide called “miners.” The miners create secure blocks by lending their computing power to solve complex math problems. Each time one of these problems is cracked, a block is added to the chain — and the miners receive Bitcoins for their services. Because the computer code in each universally time-stamped block builds on the previous one, it becomes virtually impossible to go back and alter earlier blocks.\n\nThe intriguing aspect of this for entrepreneurs is that all kinds of other information could piggyback on the Bitcoin transfers recorded on the blockchain. One startup providing this type of service is Proof of Existence, which uses the blockchain to record a cryptographic digest of a document, validating that the user owns that file at that time. It could be useful for verifying material for copyrights or patents, for example. Another startup, Onename, provides customers with a blockchain ID, a kind of digital passport they can use to verify their identities online. Ultimately, identity verification could lead to voting via smartphones.\n\nAt professional-services firm Deloitte Canada, innovation specialist Matthew Spoke is leading a team investigating how blockchain or similar technologies might be used to make audits more precise. “Due to the large number of transactions and the amount of financial information a company has, audits never give you 100 percent coverage,” he explains. Instead, auditors choose a sample from a set of transactions, and they attempt to verify that the company being audited accurately stated its balances for that sample.\n\nUsing the blockchain, it could be possible to independently confirm a broader range of financial transactions for a company. In essence, both parties to a transaction would agree that an exchange took place, and that exchange would be securely recorded on the blockchain.', 'NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ARK Investment Management LLC (ARK), an active manager of thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs), is pleased to announce that the ARK Web x.0 ETF (NYSEARCA: ARKW) has become the first ETF to invest in bitcoin.

And if and when it does, the digital currency will feel the impact.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will vote this week whether to raise the benchmark interest rate from the 0.25% it has been set at since December 2008. While most analysts believe this week's meeting won't bring a rate hike, they concur that it will likely happen by the end of the year.\n\nThe latest dot plot released in the FOMC's summary of economic projections in June indicates that every member expects the benchmark rate to increase to 0.50%-to-0.75% by year's end. And in 2016 and beyond, the expectation is for rates to ultimately settle between 3%-4.5%.\n\nShorter-term rates have already begun to tick up in anticipation of a 2015 rate hike. With a rate increase all but imminent, investors are bracing for change -- including those with a stake in Bitcoin.

Two pieces of evidence point to this hypothesis.\n\nStrength of the U.S. Dollar\n\nThe dollar should benefit from a rise in the federal funds rate, as it is indicative of a strengthening economy and often leads to increased investment inflows.

[The] constantly changing currency rate of Bitcoin against major world currencies is influencing the strain of strings in [the] installation and the way the picks are hitting them. The robotic system of the artwork is directed by a computer algorithm: influenced by dynamic changes of data, the installation sounds like a complex sound instrument.”\n\nMorozov said that the work was co-commissioned by Laboratoria Art & Science Space, a contemporary art organization based in Moscow, and a company called Lykke AG.\n\n“They were asking me to find some idea that will combine art and finances - and I think bitcoin is a very interesting ‘new’ thing that can change society,” he told CoinDesk in an email.\n\nThe result, as the video shows, is a strange, metallic and ever-changing soundscape and an “infinite number of variations and harmonies”, in the words of the artist.\n\n“This piece explores how new technologies and progress in such areas of knowledge as cryptography, mathematics, computer science influence the financial system, inevitably changing the social structure of the society,” Morozov wrote on his website. “These changes can be characterised by growing decentralization, transparency, unfalsifiability, immateriality of values.”\n\nThe work comes months after Morozov exhibited another sound-oriented work called Oil, which, according to The Verge, invited participants to record audio of themselves slowly crushing their smartphone or other possessions with a hydraulic press.\n\nCheck out a performance of the art installation silk below:\n\nVideo Source: ::vtol:: silk from ::vtol:: on Vimeo.\n\nImages via ::vtol::\n\nHat Tip: The Creators Project\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The draft drew from comments made during a subsequent two-month comment period in which both the digital currency ecosystem as well as financial incumbents were able to weigh in on the proposal.\n\nWhile the framework is only a recommendation – state bank regulators can use it as a basis or to craft rules for the technology – it’s publication will likely play a role in how US states move toward finalizing their approaches to overseeing activities that involve digital currency.\n\nThe group recommended that companies involved with third-party exchange or transmission of digital currencies, as well as “services that facilitate the third-party exchange, storage and/or transmission of virtual currency (e.g. wallets, vaults, kiosks, merchant-acquirers, and payment processors)” should fall under the oversight of state bank regulators.\n\nThe group wrote:\n\n“It is CSBS policy that entities performing activities involving third-party control of virtual currency should be subject to state licensure and supervision like an entity performing such activities with fiat currencies. Accordingly, activities involving fiat currencies that are otherwise subject to state laws should be covered if undertaken using virtual currency.\n\nThe text released by the CSBS also included changes to its initial proposal related to permitted types of investment, anti-money laundering compliance, record keeping, supervision and crisis management.\n\nThe latest release also offers insight into the responses the CSBS received as well as how changes were made to the previous version of the framework.\n\nDefinition for \'virtual currency\'\n\nThe text includes the organization\'s definition of a ""virtual currency"" for use by state regulators, which focuses on the unit of account itself rather than the software enabling its use.\n\nThe finalized definition reads:\n\n“Virtual Currency is a digital representation of value used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account or a store of value, but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the United States Government. Virtual Currency does not include the software or protocols governing the transfer of the digital representation of value. Virtual Currency does not include stored value redeemable exclusively in goods or services limited to transactions involving a defined merchant, such as rewards programs.”\n\nThe CSBS noted that one commenter said regulators should adopt common language for this definition ""rather than engaging in haphazard reinterpretation of existing laws"".\n\nAdditional proposals\n\nThe framework includes recommendations for a nationwide data sharing system based on the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System, a network used for financial institution licensing.\n\nThe American Bankers Association indicated its support for this approach earlier this year, and according to the CSBS, several unidentified companies in the digital currency space have voiced support for the proposal.\n\nThe CSBS stated:\n\n“...the Framework recommends the use of a robust licensing system which supports regulators’ ability to share information in real time or close to real time and offers the potential of streamlining all technical aspects of licensing, including application processing, background check processing, reporting and complaint management.”\n\nThe group said that it had altered its previous call for third-party cybersecurity audits to allow for flexibility at the discretion of state regulators.\n\n“CSBS originally drafted a cybersecurity audit requirement, including a provision that the audit be performed by a third party. CSBS recognizes this can be costly and potentially premature for startups. CSBS also recognizes a third party audit is important for riskier institutions. Accordingly, the final framework was modified to provide more flexibility,” the group wrote.\n\nNow, the model suggests that regulators decide on a case-by-case basis whether a third party audit is required or if an internal audit prepared by the licensee would be sufficient.\n\nThe CSBS also indicated that it had received support from comment submitters for a regulatory “onramp” that would allow certain entities to receive provisional approval, an approach adopted by New York in its BitLicense framework.\n\nIn its final regulation model, the CSBS declined to include such language, stating that “state regulators understand the argument in favor of legal and regulatory incubation”.\n\nThe final version of the CSBS Model Regulatory Framework can be found below:\n\nCSBS Model Regulatory Framework\n\nPaperwork image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The Bitcoin story of the summer has been about the future direction of Bitcoin in relation to block size and a potential Bitcoin fork. There has been much discussion on BIP 100, or Bitcoin XT or BIP 101, and a lot of ideas about what will happen next. Bitcoin is a very complex technology, and I get just as overwhelmed as anybody else with the tech bits of it.\n\nSometimes, I write an article to learn about something within Bitcoin just as much as to help others learn about what’s going on in the community. My grasp on what a Bitcoin “fork” was pretty shaky, and maybe yours is, too. So let’s go through what a “fork” is together.\n\nTo fork or not to fork; that is the question\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain has certain agreed upon rules and protocols that all nodes must follow, which are built into the Bitcoin core software. When everyone agrees on these “Rules of the Node,” we have “consensus” or an agreement on how to move forward together. The major power brokers of the Bitcoin protocol, like core developers and the mining community, must be on the same page to ensure everything works properly.\n\nBut sometimes, like with the recent block size debate this summer, we have a disagreement. If this happens and a consensus cannot be formed in the short-term to maintain the status quo for now, a “fork” can develop, much like a fork in the road.\n\nTwo chains or more can be formed, depending on how large the factions are that disagree. The same transactions that normally would go into one block in the chain can divide into two or more blocks, creating a fork.\n\nThe most common cause is changes in the rules based on Bitcoin core software upgrades. For example, Bitcoin Core Version 0.7 and the upgrade to Version 0.8 resulted in a fork in March of 2013. It took about an hour for the fork to be discovered, another 15 minutes to come up with a proposal, and shortly thereafter, a consensus was reached. In this case, the consensus was for the miners to stick with Version 0.7, for the short-term.\n\nWhat about a deliberate fork?\n\nAccidents happen, especially in a new technology that is literally changing the world every ten minutes. What if it isn’t an accident? Maybe some developers want to create an altcoin with a totally different set of rules or use larger blocks going forward.\n\nA lot of what happens next will depend upon the goal of the deliberate fork. Will there be a “soft fork” or a “hard fork”? This is an important distinction. A “soft fork” is simply when the proceeding blocks and protocol are “backwards compatible” with the original protocol. The rules of the new blocks are not so radical that the original software cannot recognize the changes, and they are still valid.\n\nA “hard fork” is just the opposite. This new fork or new blocks are not “Backwards compatible” because the modifications are too extensive. The goal in this scenario is commonly a new altcoin creation, which typically has faster transaction times, more coins, bigger block sizes, etc., so new currencies can be created here.\n\nAs previously mentioned, another common cause is a software upgrade where miners will need to move to the next version of the Core software. Hard forks are not desirable, as a rule, due to the high potential for loss of computing power, transactions, and man hours.\n\nConsensus\n\n“Consensus” is commonly accepted to be 75% or more within the active nodes working on the system. The recent issues with the BIP 100 and BIP 101 proposals have seen a mass of voting take place, and BIP 100 has reached 60% consensus amongst the mining community. This proposal would allow more block size flexibility, without a hard, scheduled block size increase over time, like BIP 101.\n\nThe common refrain from Core developers and Bitcoin technical experts like Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik and Mike Hearn is that Bitcoin is still at “Version 1.0” and is quickly outgrowing it. Bitcoin will go through a hard fork at some point, and it will be for its own good.\n\nIf Bitcoin usage continues to expand, it must grow into Version 2.0, and beyond. Most in the community get that. The only question is how do we get there…together?', 'BNP Paribas Fortis has denied it is exploring the idea of entering the bitcoin space as a digital vault provider.\n\nA spokesperson for the international Belgium-based bank – a subsidiary of BNP Paribas – told CoinDesk the company was not planning to allow its customers to store bitcoin as they would any other asset.\n\nThe spokesperson added:\n\n""I will disappoint you because we do not have a project regarding the bitcoins. So, it\'s not true.""\n\nBNP Paribas Fortis\' denial comes after CoinDesk was contacted by a subscriber to the Bitcoin Brussels mailing list, who claimed to have received an email from a marketing analyst at the bank detailing plans to offer a digital vault solution.\n\nAccording to the subscriber, the message asked readers to register their interest on a Launchrock website – a platform that enables its users to create viral \'Launching Soon\' pages with in-built sharing tools and analytics – by providing their email address.\n\nThe spokesperson for BNP Paribas Fortis attributed the ""confusion"" around the bank\'s intentions to a training excercise:\n\n""As part of training on the Lean Startup, the theme of bitcoin is often chosen as a case study. As part of this training, a hypothesis was tested by posting a web page (not branded) on bitcoiners [sic] forums to analyse the possible interest of these in being able to store bitcoins safe in a bank.""\n\nWatching the blockchain\n\nDespite unwilling to disclose specifics, the spokesperson said the bank was watching blockchain technology to assess how it could be used to speed up business processes and make them less costly.\n\n""But these are only projects and formations,"" they added.\n\nThe comments come after a report in July suggested BNP Paribas was looking to incorporate bitcoin to one of their currency funds.\n\nCoinDesk reached out to BNP Paribas at the time but was unable to verify the news.\n\nBNP Paribas Fortis image via Hadrian / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

09/16/2015,"['Bitcoin is an electronic currency that is neither issued by a government nor backed by a physical commodity. Bitcoin’s underlying technology allows users to transfer funds in an electronic payments network. Ultimately, the technology could have effects far beyond purchases of goods by, for example, improving processes that rely on time-stamped electronic records, such as digital passports or even stock trades. A key aspect of this technology is the blockchain, a publicly available database that records every bitcoin transaction, and many digital currencies now use some version of it.\n\nThe blockchain is maintained by a decentralized computer network rather than by a central authority. A bitcoin transaction is not final until it is included in the blockchain, and no bitcoins exist outside the blockchain. This complete record is distinct from government-issued fiat currency transactions, for which there are no such records.[1] Bitcoin’s process of authenticating each new transaction that is added to the blockchain, commonly referred to as mining, also creates new bitcoins. Every four years, the number of bitcoins produced is halved, until as many as 21 million bitcoins have been created. After those bitcoins have been created, which is expected to occur about 2041, mining will only authenticate transactions. The first bitcoin was created in 2009, and there were approximately 14.1 million bitcoins as of May 2014, as computed at the website bitcoincharts.com.\n\nBitcoin is still in the early stages of development, but bitcoins are already accepted as payment for goods and services by well-known companies, such as Dell, Papa John’s, and Overstock.com, as well as many other vendors. Bitcoin transactions are still a small part of the global economy, and it is difficult to imagine Bitcoin replacing an established national currency, such as the U.S. dollar, as long as the Federal Reserve acts as a moderately good steward of the national currency. Nonetheless, the privately produced cryptocurrency Bitcoin is one example of a market innovation that allows people to choose their own mediums of exchange. Congress should prevent barriers that single out Bitcoin development and impede people from using their preferred medium of exchange.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a privately issued electronic irredeemable currency. Bitcoin is not issued by any government nor backed by any physical commodity. Bitcoin’s underlying technology makes it possible to use bitcoins on an electronic payments network. One key part of this technology is the blockchain, and many digital currencies now use some version of it. The concepts discussed in this Backgrounder apply equally to Bitcoin and any similar digital currency based on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoins are digital and might be thought of as bits that represent money, but they are very different from, for example, a digital Microsoft Word file. Word bits represent a document that can be altered, copied, and sent to any number of people. Anyone who attaches a Word file to an e-mail can still send the original Word file to someone else or use it otherwise. Once a bitcoin is transferred to another person, the original owner can no longer send it to anyone else or use it for any purpose. One of the key reasons why Bitcoin became the first successful privately issued digital currency is precisely because individual bitcoins cannot be copied and re-used even though no central authority is running it.\n\nIf users could re-spend the same bitcoins—that is, “double spend” them—bitcoins would be useless as money. An infinite number of bitcoins could be created at virtually no cost and the value of bitcoins would be zero. Bitcoin’s underlying technology avoids this problem by using a decentralized peer-to-peer computer network rather than a centralized authority to verify transactions. This decentralized network effectively maintains a database ledger that authenticates all bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe ledger is referred to as the blockchain, and all bitcoin transactions are checked against the blockchain to ensure that there is no double spending. This authentication process on the network allows people to make direct digital currency transactions with each other without relying on a third-party intermediary, such as a bank or PayPal. The authentication process is referred to as mining, and it also creates new bitcoins at a pre-determined rate.[2] People who make their computer resources available for authenticating the blockchain, referred to as bitcoin miners, are rewarded with some combination of new bitcoins and transaction fees.[3] Transactions are verified by miners working to solve a computer resource-intensive computational problem built into the underlying Bitcoin protocol.[4]\n\nThis mining process is designed to produce fewer bitcoins as time goes on, and no more than 21 million bitcoins will be created. This maximum number is expected to be reached by approximately 2041. It is easy to verify the exact number of bitcoins in existence at any moment, which ensures that the production of bitcoins follows this schedule. The use of resources to create new bitcoins mimics the extraction of a precious metal from the earth, which accounts for the use of the term “mining.”[5] After the maximum number of bitcoins has been created, transaction fees higher than current fees will compensate miners, who are not employed by Bitcoin, for the resources used to authenticate transactions.[6]\n\nHow to Use Bitcoins\n\nPeople can download Bitcoin client software if they want to use bitcoins. This program, called a “wallet,” connects a user (by Internet) to the decentralized network of all Bitcoin users. The software also generates unique, mathematically linked keys, one public and one private. A user needs both the public and private keys to transfer bitcoins.[7] Once armed with these keys, anyone can obtain bitcoins by either accepting them as payment for a good or service, buying them from another person, or purchasing them on a bitcoin exchange. These public and private keys play an important part in finalizing transactions using cryptographic processes, and ensure that the transactions are valid. Because of this connection with cryptography, Bitcoin and similar currencies are often called “cryptocurrencies.”\n\nWhile not a necessary aspect of using or acquiring bitcoins, bitcoins can be purchased on exchanges. These bitcoin exchanges are similar in some ways to stock exchanges, with people purchasing bitcoins instead of stocks.[8] Similar to stocks on stock exchanges, people who own bitcoins can sell them on an exchange for a preferred currency, such as dollars, other fiat monies, or other digital currencies. When they want bitcoins from the exchange, they can order the exchange to transfer the bitcoins to their wallet.\n\nThe wallet allows users to send and receive bitcoins, as well as to keep track of their transactions. Despite its name, the wallet does not store bitcoins. Instead, the wallet is more similar to a spreadsheet program that keeps track of a balance.[9] All evidence of bitcoin ownership is solely in the blockchain.[10]\n\nThe Blockchain\n\nThe blockchain is a publicly available database that records every bitcoin transaction. Every bitcoin is associated with an address. This address is derived from a public key in a public-key/private-key pairing. The blockchain records every trade of bitcoins from one address to another. A bitcoin transaction is not final until it is included in the blockchain, and no bitcoins exist independently of the blockchain. Each bitcoin is associated with a public key, and each bitcoin user has a private key, known only to the user associated with a specific public key.\n\nBitcoin’s decentralized network creates transactions using public and private keys. When someone decides to send bitcoins to someone else, the user effectively creates an electronic message that can only be authenticated with the correct keys. For example, when Katie wants to transfer bitcoins to Hugh, she creates a message including her address from which she wants to transfer funds, and Hugh’s address as the recipient. She signs the transaction with her private key; her public key can be used to verify that she signed it. She broadcasts this transaction to other nodes on the network. Miners then can verify that this address has the necessary funds and that the transaction is valid. The transaction can then be included in one “block” in the blockchain. Once the transaction is included in the blockchain, Katie can no longer spend those bitcoins associated with that address, and it is Hugh who can now spend them. Bitcoin’s protocol ensures that the blockchain is accurate.[11]\n\nIf a Bitcoin user loses his private key, he permanently loses his bitcoins. If a thief obtains Katie’s private key, the thief can transfer the bitcoins to his own address; there is no mechanism to transfer the bitcoins back. Katie would lose her bitcoins just as she would lose her paper currency if a thief steals her physical wallet. Losing a private key is, in this way, very similar to losing physical currency.[12] On the other hand, all bitcoin transactions can be traced by address. In other words, Katie, and anyone else, can easily discover the address to which her bitcoins were transferred. If the address can be associated with a particular person in the physical world, the thief can be identified. Moreover, all of the thief’s transactions using that address can be determined.[13]\n\nOpen-Source Software and Bitcoin. Bitcoin and the blockchain were developed by programmers and released under open-source licenses.[14] Thus, while the original owners retain a copyright on Bitcoin, there are conditional, free licenses available to the public, and the source code is open-access. Still, none of the software includes patented elements, and no attempt was made to patent the blockchain. Without paying anyone else anything, anyone can access and edit the Bitcoin network. Anyone can also simply copy the code and change it or use it for other purposes—even for starting another cryptocurrency. However, these volunteers must include a copy of the open-source license going forward, a limitation that might fail to encourage as much innovation as a traditional licensing scheme because it lacks the same profit motive. Nonetheless, it would be incorrect to say that no one leads development of software for bitcoin.\n\nInitially, Satoshi Nakamoto led the development of Bitcoin in the late 1990s—it was his proposal—and subsequently he suggested that Gavin Andresen lead development. This development occurs with other core developers and the assistance of anyone who wants to contribute. None of these people, though, owns the source code (the programs). Anyone who does not like a decision made by Andresen and the core developers can take the code and start his own cryptocurrency, but if most people agree with the developers’ decision, there is little incentive to take such action. Some argue that this arrangement gives the core developers (or cliques within that group) de facto control of the Bitcoin network, even if only because people are predisposed to accept developers’ suggestions.\n\nThe developers have made few major suggestions to test this theory, but two recent suggestions are illustrative: One recommendation was widely accepted, while the other has not been met with acceptance even among core developers. In 2013, core developers suggested that a software glitch should be fixed by reverting to an earlier version of the software. This solution was widely accepted even though it required anyone using Bitcoin 0.8 to switch back to version 0.7, and to resubmit trades conducted under version 0.8 so that they could be added to the blockchain based on version 0.7.[15]\n\nMore recently, Gavin Andresen proposed increasing the maximum block size from 1 MB to 20 MB, a suggestion that has sparked much debate among the core developers. While this issue is rather technical, it is one that needs to be resolved if the network is to facilitate increased traffic as Bitcoin use grows. Many developers disagree with Andresen because they feel that increasing the block size too much—or even too fast—could harm network decentralization and security. To date, no group of developers’ view has taken hold, and the debate highlights that major changes to the network are not simply decreed by the core developers.[16] The debate also highlights the fact that any major aspect of the Bitcoin code could be changed in the future, a feature that has to be accepted if such currencies are to become more widespread.\n\nOne reason for the success of Bitcoin is that it is “open source,” a feature that permits development to occur and for improvements suggested by many different programmers to appear in the sole source code.[17] While it is entirely possible to write copyrighted software for Bitcoin that incorporates none of the open-source software created so far, doing so could be counterproductive because core developers generally would be unaware of what that code contains, and might inadvertently make changes that conflict with the copyrighted code.[18] More fundamentally, a major advantage of open-source code is the possible innovation that results from the collaboration of many people on the code, an advantage that could be lost by creating copyrighted software.[19]\n\nCurrent Status of Bitcoin and the Blockchain. Bitcoin is not included in any measure of money today because it is not a generally accepted medium of exchange or a close substitute.[20] It is possible, though, that Bitcoin eventually will be widely accepted and included in standard measures of money. It is difficult to get precise data on the use of bitcoin in exchanges for goods and services, but many large companies such as Microsoft, Dell, DISH Network, and Overstock.com now accept bitcoins.[21] Furthermore, bitcoins can be used indirectly for retail purchases via gift cards at countless major retailers.\n\nThere were about 14.1 million bitcoins on May 9, 2014, as computed at the website bitcoincharts.com. At a price of $241 per bitcoin, this quantity indicates an approximate value of $3.4 billion. This amount, while certainly nontrivial, is much smaller than the value of U.S. dollars as measured by the Federal Reserve’s M2 aggregate,[22] which was $11.8 trillion at of the end of April 2015. Another way of looking at the aggregate value of bitcoins is to compare their value to the value of reserves in the banking system.\n\nThis comparison is suggested by the possibility that bitcoins will be useful in finalizing transactions between other monies. Before the 2008 financial crisis, reserves in the U.S. banking system (primarily clearing balances maintained by banks) were $8.75 billion. The value of bitcoins in March 2014, therefore, represents approximately 39 percent of the value of reserves held by U.S. banks before the crisis. Given the newness of Bitcoin’s technology, this figure seems quite large if the only role of bitcoins is to finalize transactions in dollars. However, bitcoins are not useful only in the United States, and an often repeated and recently explored use for bitcoins is in international remittances and transfers.\n\nBitcoin provides a potentially large advantage to individuals who transfer funds internationally, particularly by offering lower transaction costs for secure transactions.[23] Bitcoin has proven especially beneficial for foreign workers who send money to family and friends in their home country, transfers of funds known as remittances. According to the World Bank, total annual remittances are $430 billion globally, an amount three times greater than the aggregate global aid budget.[24] People in underdeveloped countries depend heavily on these funds. In some developing countries, for instance, Haiti, remittances are one-fifth or more the size of gross domestic product.[25]\n\nHistorically, remittance transfers have been expensive compared to domestic transfers, with a global average transaction cost estimated at 8 percent of the transfer amount.[26] Bitcoin can dramatically lower the cost and time to complete these transfers, and it allows—for the first time—people and businesses with no formal banking relationships to transfer funds easily. Traditionally, people have used wire service companies, such as Western Union, to send remittances. With bitcoins, migrant workers can transfer their local funds into bitcoins, convert bitcoins into their home currency, and deliver money to their family members by one of many less-expensive domestic transfer options.[27]\n\nFuture Uses for Bitcoin and the Blockchain. The blockchain is the major innovation in cryptocurrencies and has many possible future uses independent of any cryptocurrency. Some refer to the future evolution of this technology as Bitcoin 2.0, with a look forward to Bitcoin 3.0, analogous to the development of the World Wide Web and numbering systems used for it.[28] The more obvious possible uses center on the verification that information or a contract exists. For instance, the blockchain could help implement digital passports, copyright registration, or notarized records. It could also be used instead of escrow accounts in real estate transactions. One technology expert recently noted:\n\nThe engine that powers Bitcoin [the blockchain] can be used for a whole array of other applications.… Suppose you replaced the Internet’s centralized Domain Name System [DNS] with a blockchain for Internet names (like Namecoin) such that every DNS request included some proof-of-work effort.… Or you built a new blockchain for crowdfunding. Or you replaced a centralized system which absolutely does need to be scrapped—that horrific barrel of worms known as TLS/SSL Certificate Authorities—with a blockchain-based solution powered at the browser level. Or you built a new distributed email service, with a blockchain for email addresses, and every time you checked your email you contributed to the network.[29]\n\nEven leaving aside Bitcoin 2.0 or 3.0, there are other currencies based on blockchains. There is nothing to prevent these other cryptocurrencies from arising, and many have, such as Peercoin, Litecoin, and Freicoin.[30] For example, someone might start an alternative cryptocurrency because he does not like Bitcoin’s rule for increasing supply over time, with an eventual upper limit of 21 million bitcoins. If Bitcoin is successful, a bitcoin’s value will increase as the economy grows after 21 million have been created. This increase in a bitcoin’s value is deflation in terms of prices of goods and services in bitcoins, which some regard as a bad thing.[31]\n\nBitcoin’s rule for an eventually constant stock of coins is not a necessary part of a currency based on a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies can have alternative rules, such as a constant growth rate similar to Milton Friedman’s proposed rule for the money supply in the United States.[32] For example, Peercoin[33] has an eventual growth rate of 1 percent, and Freicoin[34] has an annual fee of approximately 5 percent for holding freicoins. The Freicoin fee is similar in its effects to 5 percent inflation as far as holders of the currency are concerned. Virtually any rule for determining the quantity of a cryptocurrency is possible.[35] The major requirement is that adherence to the rule be exactly verifiable at virtually zero cost by anyone interested in using the cryptocurrency.[36] This requirement is important because it prevents creation of cryptocurrency in excess of the scheduled amount.\n\nSome have suggested creating state-dependent rules for cryptocurrencies, in which the quantity of the currency increases more or less depending on the behavior of the economy. Leaving aside the problem of which economy is referred to—the U.S. economy, the world economy, or some other entity’s—a major issue with any such rule is whether it would be verifiable. Some have suggested that a successful currency has to include countercyclical responses to be successful. Others have made more limited suggestions. For example, George Selgin, monetary and financial expert at the Cato Institute, recently suggested using the blockchain protocol to adjust mining rewards based on a feedback rule. The general idea is to produce a stable growth rate for the total value of cryptocurrency spending, or a constant rate of deflation or inflation.[37]\n\nIf successful, such a currency could offer a flexible supply without a discretionary central bank.[38] It is not obvious that this sort of rule is feasible even if it might be desirable, but the possibility of using the technology in this way is just one of the reasons why policymakers should resist regulations that stop further innovation. Unsuccessful currencies will affect a few people a little, whereas successful ones can affect many people a lot.\n\nPossible Impediments to Widespread Bitcoin Use\n\nA major deterrent to Bitcoin’s widespread acceptance as a currency is its volatile value. Much like any currency, the market value of bitcoins fluctuates based on supply and demand in an international market.[39] This value can be measured in terms of the dollar, the euro, or any other currency. Compared to the dollar and other well-established national currencies, the value of bitcoins has been relatively volatile over time. For instance, the maximum price for a trade on Bitstamp, a U.K.-based exchange, was $1,163 on November 30, 2013. The price on Bitstamp on March 3, 2014, was $586, a decrease of 50 percent in about three months.[40] It also is true, though, that bitcoins were worth less than five cents in their first trade on an exchange in 2010.\n\nSuch high volatility makes Bitcoin’s widespread use as a medium of exchange less likely, but Bitcoin is a new currency and uncertainty about its long-term value is hardly surprising. Over time, Bitcoin’s volatility is likely to decline, though whether it subsides at positive prices for bitcoins or a price of zero is uncertain. The growth of the number of bitcoins at a pre-determined rate, one key benefit of the underlying technology, also contributes to Bitcoin’s price volatility. In particular, a change in demand for bitcoins can change only its price because the quantity supplied cannot vary from the predetermined number of bitcoins. Other problems that will have to be sorted out over time include security, theft, and consumer fraud issues, such as the theft of 650,000 bitcoins from the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange.[41] Ideally, policymakers will avoid the temptation to resolve apparent problems with regulatory fixes that go too far, thus preventing the further use and development of the bitcoin technology.\n\nRegulatory Issues Surrounding Bitcoin. As with many financial regulatory matters, Bitcoin raises both state and federal jurisdictional questions.[42] Aside from taxes, most federal rules and regulations that apply to Bitcoin deal with money transmission and anti–money laundering (AML) laws. Some of these rules have their genesis in the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) of 1970, an Act originally aimed at deterring foreign banks from laundering criminal proceeds and helping people evade federal income taxes.[43] The BSA gave banks an affirmative duty to report (to the Department of the Treasury) cash transactions of more than $10,000, and it criminalized the failure to report such transactions.[44]\n\nThe BSA was little used until it was amended by the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, an explicit component of the federal war on drugs and organized crime.[45] Finally, in the wake of 9/11, the USA PATRIOT Act levied new rules on an expanded list of financial institutions, and also imposed stricter due-diligence and AML requirements. While there is certainly anecdotal evidence of criminals who would have otherwise evaded justice being successfully targeted by anti–money laundering laws, there is, to date, no comprehensive study on the effectiveness of anti–money laundering laws.[46] Regardless, BSA/AML requirements apply to many firms besides banks, and businesses such as law firms, casinos, and car dealers are now required to report cash transactions of more than $10,000.[47]\n\nThese BSA/AML rules have surely contributed to existing firms’ hesitancy to use the Bitcoin technology, as well as traditional banks’ reluctance to work with Bitcoin-related companies.[48] Firms simply cannot legally transfer any type of funds without knowing their customer and having at least some idea of where the funds originated; Bitcoin transactions do not include the name or any other direct information about the person sending or receiving bitcoins. However, Bitcoin transactions are completed with an address, which is why Bitcoin is often referred to as pseudo-anonymous.\n\nWhile legitimate businesses should not be penalized for failing to know that their customers might have engaged in criminal activity, prosecutors should prosecute criminals for their crimes irrespective of what kind of payment method they use.[49] Regardless of what the optimal AML regime may look like, all financial services companies currently have to adhere to these regulations. Most of the BSA/AML rules deal directly with federal rules for transferring money, and they are spread throughout several sections of the U.S. code.\n\nTitle 18 of the U.S. code, for instance, prohibits the operation of an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and also prohibits the knowing transfer of funds derived from (or intended for) criminal activity.[50] Title 18 considers a business unlicensed if it fails to comply with federal “money transmitting business registration requirements,” or if it operates without a state license if one is required by the state. Additionally, Title 31 of the U.S. code requires money-transmitting businesses to register with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.[51] The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is the bureau within the Department of the Treasury that enforces most of these federal BSA/AML regulations.\n\nCurrent federal policies related to transfers of bitcoins essentially treat cryptocurrency transmissions as electronic transfers of U.S. dollars or other national currencies. Current policy ensures—for now, at least—that federal regulators will not treat individuals who transfer bitcoins to each other as money transmitters. FinCEN’s official guidance states: “A person that creates units of … virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods and services is a user of … virtual currency and not subject to regulation as a money transmitter.”[52] Still, each U.S. state has the ability to create its own set of regulations for cryptocurrencies.[53] As Bitcoin becomes more widespread, states may choose to bring Bitcoin under the ambit of their current laws regarding other financial instruments.\n\nTo date, state regulations have not been overly burdensome for bitcoin users, because most states’ cryptocurrency regulations treat bitcoin service providers as traditional money transmission businesses.[54] This approach might be considered a significant financial hurdle because many cryptocurrency businesses that want to operate on a nationwide level have to register separately in each state as money transmitters. Regardless of the optimal regulatory regime, the overall goal should be to regulate all currencies, even cryptocurrencies, in a neutral fashion. Furthermore, some regulators, such as those in New York and North Carolina, have regulated transmission of bitcoins more explicitly.\n\nNew York’s newly finalized rules aim to regulate “business involving Virtual Currency,” requiring that such firms obtain approval from the New York Department of Financial Services before starting their business in New York.[55] Furthermore, these firms “must obtain the superintendent’s prior written approval for any plan or proposal to introduce or offer a new product, service or activity” or make material changes if New York or New York residents are involved. Bitcoin is an example of a virtual currency, and any business that, among other activities, transmits bitcoins, holds bitcoins for customers, provides exchange services, or administers virtual currency would qualify as a virtual currency business. Requiring such prior approval even for altering the provision of these services has the potential to drastically suppress the innovation of Bitcoin service providers, just as it prevents innovation in other money-transfer businesses. The most likely outcome of these types of rules will be to deny a given state’s residents the benefits of money-transfer services.\n\nRather than using existing statutory authority to create new regulations, the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks has requested that the General Assembly pass a revised bill regulating money transmission businesses. Unsurprisingly, there is some controversy regarding North Carolina’s legislation.[56] A large cryptocurrency money transmitter is in favor of it; apparently, smaller operations are opposed.[57] North Carolina’s proposal deals only with money transmission, which currently is regulated, and does not single out cryptocurrency for special regulation. According to the Commissioner of Banks, the new plan clarifies the money transmissions covered by state law and “defines virtual currency consistently with federal financial regulation.”[58]\n\nOverall, the current approach has worked reasonably well, but there is little doubt that further developments in cryptocurrency regulation will follow. There might be differences between traditional money-transmission businesses and decentralized cryptocurrencies, so a regulatory framework that properly addresses these differences could benefit both consumers and entrepreneurs. The nonprofit Coin Center has proposed such a framework that that might inform policymakers.[59]\n\nAt the very least, Coin Center’s proposed definition of cryptocurrency transmission tries to address some of the key differences between traditional money transmitters and decentralized cryptocurrencies. Additionally, two principles should guide policymakers:\n\nRegulations should focus on whether an intermediary can potentially “lose, misspend, immobilize, or fail to protect a customer’s funds entrusted to them”[60] to the extent that current law does not address the issue. Individuals should not be regulated like money transmitters if they only buy and sell on their own accounts.\n\nThese principles rely on the degree to which a third-party intermediary serves its customers in a positon of trust—in other words, the extent to which they serve a fiduciary role. While a single entity could produce a centrally issued cryptocurrency, no single person or entity controls bitcoin production. Hence, for person-to-person exchanges of bitcoins, no third party has a fiduciary role.[61] For this reason, regulations should not unduly interfere with the ability of individuals to transfer cryptocurrency directly to others. Not all bitcoin transactions are conducted without third-party involvement, such as in the case of some person-to-business payments, and appropriate regulations should apply to intermediaries that consumers trust to protect the value of their assets, whether U.S. dollars or cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the case of intermediaries, regulations should focus on intermediaries’ activities instead of the technology. Consumer protection laws, for example, should encourage disclosure and protect consumers from fraud regardless of whether a third-party intermediary allows consumers to use bitcoins or MasterCard. Even in these cases, though, it is not clear that many new regulations are needed because bitcoin service providers do not operate outside the bounds of the legal system. Fraud is a civil and criminal offense, whether committed by a bitcoin service provider or by anyone else. Nonetheless, regulation could improve rather than hinder the development of Bitcoin if it provides a basic framework that helps consumers distinguish between reputable and fraudulent enterprises.[62]\n\nThe government should not require firms to receive permission for undertaking or ceasing activities or otherwise interfere with entrepreneurs’ operations and innovations in the technology and its adoption. Just as some light-touch regulation has the potential to help Bitcoin technology develop further, regulation can have the unintended effect of moving cryptocurrency development and further innovations out of a state or out of the United States altogether. This negative effect is most likely if regulations focus on (1) controlling developments rather than overseeing them to help consumers distinguish between reputable and fraudulent enterprises, or (2) protecting existing firms from competition.\n\nCapital Gains Taxes. Taxes affect every aspect of the economy, and Bitcoin is no exception. In March 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that it would treat cryptocurrencies as property for U.S. tax purposes, a decision that exposes bitcoin users to certain taxes.[63] In general, the income tax imposes a tax on capital gains when an asset is sold, and the amount of tax is a function of the applicable capital gains tax rate times the net capital gain. The net capital gain is generally the price realized when the asset is sold minus the cost of acquiring the asset, and the applicable tax rate depends on one’s income bracket and whether the asset has been held for more than one year.[64] The tax rate is generally lower if the asset has been held for more than one year. (This case is called a long-term capital gain.)\n\nSince the IRS treats (effectively all) alternative currencies as assets, every cryptocurrency transaction is a taxable event and is reportable on Schedule D of the taxpayers’ Form 1040 (or, if a business, the analogous business tax form).[65] The price realized in dollars when the cryptocurrency is sold, less the cost in dollars of acquiring the cryptocurrency, will give rise to a capital gain or loss. This gain (or loss) may be long-term or short-term, depending on whether the cryptocurrency was acquired more than a year before. If the cryptocurrency is used to acquire a good, service, or asset, the measure of the price realized would be the fair market value in U.S. dollars of the good, service, or asset acquired.\n\nFurthermore, a person using an alternative currency to acquire an asset, good, or service may be deemed as engaging in a barter transaction as part of a barter exchange, particularly if he regularly serves as a “middleman” or buys and sells via an “organization of members providing property or services who jointly contract to trade or barter such property or services.”[66] In this case, a bitcoin user would be required to file a Form 1099-B (Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions) for each transaction, providing the name, tax number, and address of the seller as well as transaction information. Failure to report these transactions is subject to a penalty of $50 per transaction not reported ($100 if the failure was intentional). Those who pay wages or salaries in bitcoins or pay independent contractors in bitcoins would be subject to the same reporting requirements as if they paid in dollars.\n\nThe current tax treatment creates a major barrier to the widespread use of cryptocurrencies (as well as other alternative currencies), and there are at least two possible solutions. To resolve these issues, Congress could adopt a fundamental tax reform plan in which financial transactions are irrelevant to determining the tax base or one in which capital gains are not taxed. The Hall–Rabushka Flat Tax on incomes or a national value-added tax, such as the Fair Tax, in the place of an income tax would accomplish this goal.[67] As a more likely near-term solution, Congress could amend the Internal Revenue Code to make gains or losses nontaxable when they are attributable to the purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies or other alternative currencies.[68] Either way, Congress should remove this tax barrier to the widespread use of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, as well as other alternative currencies.\n\nWhy Shouldn’t People Be Allowed to Use Bitcoin?\n\nMutually beneficial exchange is the central element of economic freedom; this centrality extends to the right to choose a preferred medium of exchange. Many people, even many economists, now assume that economic progress requires government provision of money. Economic theory and a wealth of experience indicate otherwise. It is easily forgotten, but money often developed in private markets and was monopolized later by government authorities who wanted the revenue from creating money.[69] Even today, seigniorage (the profit that government makes from printing money) is a significant means of financing, and is used by the federal government to reduce what it must borrow from the public to fund its debt. The fact that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in most countries tells us nothing about whether people will use them.[70]\n\nGovernment coins have a long history, going back to ancient Athens. Private coins and later private currencies have a long history as well. Many monies were common tender before they were legal tender, and legal tender laws then generally protected government monopolies.[71] The international prevalence of government money monopolies reveals more about the desire of government authorities for revenue than about the preferences of people who use money.[72] At this stage, though, it would be very difficult for any privately produced money to replace an established national currency.\n\nPeople prefer to have their receipts and expenses in the same currency, and there are advantages of using the same currency as used by others.[73] It is hard to imagine Bitcoin replacing an established national currency such as the U.S. dollar if the Federal Reserve acts as even a moderately good steward of the national currency. On the other hand, people might prefer to use bitcoins rather than a currency such as the Zimbabwean dollar, which eventually included bills in the amount of 100 trillion in 2008. Countries with capital controls have found it expedient to attempt to restrict citizens’ use of bitcoins because bitcoins can be used to evade such controls. There is no other obvious economic-policy rationale for restricting use of bitcoins besides shielding the government’s production of money from competition. Monetary policy is likely to be worse when shielded from competition, and better when competing against alternative monies.\n\nAs with any privately produced good or service, no inferior form of money would be expected to replace an economy’s preferred medium of exchange.[74]Allowing people to hold and use the money they prefer will not solve all economic problems, but neither will legal restrictions and government monopoly. Policymakers should apply this perspective to the theoretical case for privately produced money as well as to the history of successful competitively issued money regimes.[75] More than 60 episodes of competitive private note issue have been identified, with well-studied episodes in Scotland, the U.S., Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and Chile.[76] Even in the United States, a federal government monopoly of currency issuance did not exist before 1863.\n\nAlthough competitive note issue in the United States often receives most of the blame for the country’s monetary instability prior to the 1900s, that aspect of the banking system actually worked reasonably well. Government regulations were major causes of monetary difficulties in the U.S.[77] In fact, before the Federal Reserve was created, private clearing houses (and sometimes banks) issued emergency currencies that successfully stemmed several banking panics caused by such shortages.[78]\n\nIn some countries, privately produced money sometimes rivaled government money when the central authority failed to provide an adequate supply. For instance, during the early stages of the industrial revolution in Great Britain, private companies minted coins that were rapidly accepted and ultimately served as a preferred medium of exchange for nearly 40 years, until the government stopped the practice.[79]Aside from the typical metallic and paper money inside a nation’s banking system, there are also many examples of spontaneously developed private monies.\n\nIn the United States, Canada, and Mexico, for instance, thousands of companies created private types of money referred to as scrip. The scrip—very similar to a basic IOU—was intended for use by employees in company-owned stores, had no connection to a bank of any kind, and did not depend on redeemability in a national currency.[80] In the United States, scrip circulated as recently as 1958, and it was sometimes accepted at independent stores.[81] During the 1970s, several Las Vegas casinos produced their own token slot coins intended for use in their respective casinos, but they soon circulated well beyond these locations. Eventually, rival casinos accepted the coins, and various local businesses even accepted them for retail purchases.\n\nOn a much larger scale, private markets began producing money-substitutes in response to the high inflation and related dislocations in the 1970s.[82] The eurodollar market (dollar deposits in European banks), for instance, developed into a wholesale market on which banks, nonbank financial firms, and nonfinancial corporations still rely to borrow and hold deposits. During this same time period, the success of money market mutual funds and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts ultimately forced federal regulators to relax interest rate controls on bank deposits. Even though U.S. regulators gave up trying to limit interest rates on deposits in banks, the U.S. government maintained its monopoly control over currency issue.[83]\n\nWhat Congress Should Do\n\nBitcoin is a privately produced cryptocurrency that is neither issued by a government nor backed by a physical commodity. Bitcoin’s underlying technology is the blockchain, and it could ultimately prove beneficial to any endeavor that relies on time-stamped electronic records. Bitcoin’s success should motivate policymakers to resist burdensome regulations that single out Bitcoin’s development. In particular, Congress should:\n\nFocus on general rules concerning contracts, disclosure, and fraud prevention. Regulations run the real risk of doing nothing but conferring advantages on incumbent money-transmission firms. Many, perhaps most, bitcoin service providers do not undertake a fiduciary role for their customers. Regulations should be guided by the level of control a firm has over customer funds. Government should focus regulatory efforts on general rules concerning contracts, disclosure, and fraud.\n\nRegulations run the real risk of doing nothing but conferring advantages on incumbent money-transmission firms. Many, perhaps most, bitcoin service providers do not undertake a fiduciary role for their customers. Regulations should be guided by the level of control a firm has over customer funds. Government should focus regulatory efforts on general rules concerning contracts, disclosure, and fraud. Remove barriers to entry in the market for money. The privately produced cryptocurrency bitcoin is just one example of a market innovation that allows people to choose their own mediums of exchange. The following barriers should be addressed.\n\nModify Capital Gains Tax Laws. Although it would be preferable for Congress to adopt a fundamental tax reform plan that determines the tax base without regard to financial transactions or leaves capital gains untaxed,[84] Congress should at least amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide that gains or losses attributable to the purchase or sale of alternative currencies are not taxable. Modify statutes concerning coinage to make clear that they do not prohibit honestly making alternative coinage and using it in private transactions. To protect coins issued as U.S. currency by the federal government and to protect those who use them, federal statutes prohibit making counterfeit U.S.-minted coins or otherwise passing off non-U.S.-minted coins as if they were genuine U.S.-minted coins.[85] From their text, the statutes appear intended to prevent any pretense (either by appearance or use) that a non-government coin is a government coin. The statutes do not appear designed to prohibit private contracts in which the parties to the contract choose to accept in exchange for goods or services non-government coins that are clearly identified and understood by all parties to be non-government coins (that is, there is no counterfeiting or deceit involved). However, a recent court case has led to some misunderstanding concerning the permissibility of private minting of, and private use of, non-government coins.[86] Congress should modify federal coinage laws to make clear that such laws permit private minting and use in private contracting of coins in situations that do not involve counterfeiting or deceit. Such modifications would both fully protect the government’s interest in the minting and use of its own coins and the liberty of contract among private parties who wish to use privately minted coins, that are clearly identified as such and understood by all parties to be such, in their commercial transactions. Address bank secrecy and anti–money laundering laws. Cryptocurrencies should not be held to higher or lower standards than traditional financial companies. Legitimate businesses should not be penalized for failing to know that their customers might have engaged in criminal activity. Prosecutors should prosecute criminals for their crimes irrespective of what kind of payment method they use. Congress should also examine the possibility of creating a federal plan for licensing money transmitters so that firms can avail themselves of either the federal plan or states’ plans, just as banks can obtain federal or state charters. Modify legal tender laws to respect freedom of private contracting. Legal tender laws allow courts to force people to accept a certain amount of U.S. currency to satisfy debts even if they contracted for delivery of something else. If people want to transact in cryptocurrencies, gold, or, for that matter, beaver pelts, they should be allowed to do so. Congress should modify legal tender laws to provide for enforcement of the methods of payment for which private contracts provide. Such a modification would protect the freedom of contract among private parties and would not affect the status of U.S. currency as legal tender for payment of taxes.\n\nThe privately produced cryptocurrency bitcoin is just one example of a market innovation that allows people to choose their own mediums of exchange.

Since 2013, there were important measures such as higher taxes, pension reforms, and spending cuts, but Puerto Rico's problems seem too resilient.\n\n- Congressional Research Service Report\n\nPublic sector debt has risen every year since 2000, reaching over 100 percent of Gross National Product (GNP) by the end of 2014.\n\nBanks have also been reducing their balance sheets since 2005, in response to the hit to their capital from lower asset prices. As a result, commercial bank assets have fallen by 30%.\n\nTo combat this downturn in the economic environment, in 2014 Puerto Rico imposed a 2% special charge on all money transfer transactions from Puerto Rico to any entity, person or company abroad, including people in the United States.\n\n- Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico\n\nThe tax must be collected from each eligible money transfer transaction, processed by money service businesses that are duly licensed by the Puerto Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions. PayPal has apparently chosen to opt out of the market.\n\nIn spite of the efforts to stabilize the financial troubles, at the beginning of August this year the Puerto Rican government paid only US$0.63m of US$58m in interest and principal due on bonds issued by the Public Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the island’s Government Development Bank.\n\nPuerto Rico also recently warned that it may “lack sufficient resources to fund all necessary governmental programs and services as well as meet debt service obligations for the fiscal year 2016.”\n\nIn Taiwan, the financial and economic outlook is not nearly as bleak as it is in Puerto Rico. The reasons PayPal has given for Taiwan are a bit more cryptic, stating that they will “be streamlining our services in Taiwan and our system will be enhanced to ensure that domestic commercial payments will not be processed, in compliance with local laws and regulations.”\n\nAlthough PayPal doesn't name the exact law or regulation their change is in response to, it may be in response to a law drafted last year, inhibiting the use of such services for financial products.\n\nThe 'third-party payment services act' was put forward to facilitate Taiwanese domestic payments across the internet. The law was mainly concerned about buying goods online, but left out protection for financial products that it extends to other products, and could be read to mean that payment deposit accounts for purchasing financial management products would not be permitted in Taiwan.\n\nIt appears the law went into effect recently and PayPal has halted all domestic commercial payments in response.\n\n- PayPal\n\nThe island of only 23 Million people has three bitcoin exchanges and over 35 merchants that accept bitcoin directly listed on Coinmap.org. More impressively, various sources report that there are now as many as 17,000 convenience stores across the island with either Maicoin service or Bitoex Kiosks, that allow you to buy bitcoin with cash instantly, and in some cases for only a 1% fee. With such cheap and easy access to bitcoin for everyone on the island, it would stand to reason that PayPal's loss could easily become bitcoin's gain.""]"

Everyone involved with the virtual currency contributes to the way the blockchain verifies each deal. The sheer number of people involved makes it very hard for one bitcoin user to get fraudulent deals verified and approved.\n\nDespite this, Bitcoin has been hit by a series of scandals and thefts although most of these came about because hackers exploited weaknesses on exchanges where coins are traded or in digital wallets where they are held.\n\nMr Rutter said the banks were most interested in the technical architecture underpinning the blockchain that could be adapted for their own ends. The first place the blockchain was likely to find a role was as a log of who bought which stocks or shares, he said.\n\nBy adopting the technology banks could cut the cost of reporting transactions and working out who bought what and when, he added.\n\nNo timetable has been given for when technical trials of the blockchain-like technology might begin."", 'The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has issued its first action against an unregistered bitcoin options trading platform, ordering the startup to cease operations and simultaneously settling the case.\n\nThe CFTC charged San Francisco-based startup Coinflip Inc, which does business under the name Derivabit, and CEO Francisco Riordan with conducting activity related to commodity options, without registering with the agency or meeting rules for exemption.\n\nWith the ruling, the CFTC has also confirmed that bitcoin and other digital currencies are commodities covered by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). In the past, CFTC chairman Timothy Massad had stated that bitcoin was likely to be considered a commodity.\n\nCFTC director of enforcement Aitan Goelman suggested in a statement that the agency will seek to hold digital currency companies to the same standards as more traditional businesses that fall under its purview.\n\nGoelman said:\n\n""While there is a lot of excitement surrounding bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets.""\n\nMore specifically, the CFTC found that Coinflip violated Section 4c of the CEA and Part 32 of the CFTC’s regulations, and that it should have registered as a swap execution facility or designated contract market. The agency also found that Riordan was liable for the violations.\n\nEnding speculation\n\nIn its ruling, the CFTC offered clarity as to the ruling, stating that Section 1a(9) of the CEA defines commodity to include ""all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.""\n\n""The definition of a \'commodity\' is broad... Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are encompassed in the definition and properly defined as commodities,"" the agency wrote.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, New York Law School professor Houman Shadab, who has authored works on the use of cryptographic technologies such as bitcoin for financial derivatives, went on to caution that the CFTC\'s oversight of the technology is limited to these applications.\n\nHowever, he suggested the ruling may have larger implications.\n\n""The action puts to rest any notion that virtual currencies qualify as securities. Otherwise, the Securities and Exchange Comission would be bringing this action, not the CFTC,"" Shadab said.\n\nFor more of the agency\'s views on bitcoin and blockchain technology, revisit our full interview with former CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen.\n\nThe CFTC did not offer additional commentary on the announcement.\n\nMore details on the ruling can be found here.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Krohn then received an email appearing to be from Bailey requesting he review modifications made in a Google document. At the time they were in negotiations about the purchase of BitPay’s magazine business by yBitcoin, according to documents filed by BitPay.\n\nKrohn believes his login credentials were stolen when he entered them to access the supposed document. Besides pretending to be him, Krohn suspects the hacker also obtained details about how BitPay transacts with its customers, like SecondMarket’s advance payment exemption.\n\nOn Dec. 11 someone posing as Krohn emailed BitPay CEO Stephen Pair requesting the transfer of 1,000 bitcoins to SecondMarket at a specified wallet address. It was sent about an hour later and shortly after, Pair received another email requesting he send another 1,000 bitcoins to the same address. That transaction was sent from the company’s wallet on Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.\n\nThe following morning, the hacker again emailed Pair as Krohn, requesting 3,000 bitcoins be sent to SecondMarket at a different wallet address.\n\nWhen the transfer was completed, also from Bitstamp, Pair confirmed the transaction in an email to Krohn and SecondMarket’s Gina Guarnaccia, who denied that her company purchased the bitcoins or that she sent a previous email verifying the 3,000 bitcoins and the wallet address.\n\nBitPay filed a claim for losses days later, which its insurance company, Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company, denied in a June 8 letter. On Sept. 15 BitPay filed a suit against MBIC for breaching contract, bad faith failure to pay and statutory damages. It is seeking $950,000 in damages plus court fees.', 'Bitcoin’s BlockChain technology seems to be attracting Fortune 100 companies from around the world like nothing else in 2015. IBM is the latest industry leader to not only show major interest in Bitcoin’s innovative tech, but they seem to be nearing completion for a new creation featuring it, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBlockchain Technology & Smart Contracts: Perfect Together\n\nMajor banking leaders like UBS, Santander and Barclays have spent the better part of a year working on Bitcoin’s hidden secrets, and how this can help the financial markets become more efficient. IBM seems to be looking at releasing open source software that could be used to create digital contracts. The legendary computer corporation has been working on their own version of the blockchain, and the lead research executive calls the project “experimental.” Arvind Krishna, senior vice president of IBM Research said:\n\n“Blockchain, as a technology, is extremely interesting and intriguing. I want to extend banking to the 3.2 billion people who are going to come into the middle class over the next 15 years. So I need a much lower cost of keeping a ledger. Blockchain offers some intriguing possibilities there.”\n\nThis version of the blockchain would be optimized to create smart contracts or private online contracts, logging transactions between banks and businesses. Particularly useful for large overseas transactions, the funds held in escrow can be released instantly for online payment transfers when a contract’s obligations have been fulfilled by both parties. This would be much more efficient than the slow, ancient wire transfer.\n\nThis is actually IBM’s second foray into Bitcoin technology, following the Adept project from January of this year. Adept is an experiment that monitors connected devices, but this new project is unaffiliated with Adept.\n\nThis blockchain system would not be privately held for IBM employees only, however. It would be publicly recorded and used worldwide like Bitcoin’s transactions are. The problem would be preventing mundane issues like spam and systematic abuse, according to Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center. IBM is working on resolving this issue and may employ a list of third-parties, sub-contracted to manage the digital ledger, kind of like a moderator would an online forum.', '[UPDATE: It appears that Uber has suspended Bitcoin Builder\'s account and thus, the service is no longer operational.]\n\n****\n\nUS-based bitcoin exchange platform Bitcoin Builder has announced their release of a bitcoin service that enables users to pay with bitcoin for Uber rides.\n\nHow it Works\n\nBitcoin Builder created a business account on the Uber network, which allows the firm to display itself as a payment method on the Uber mobile app.\n\nUsers are required to use the Bitcoin Builder multi-sig wallet to associate it with the firm’s Uber business account. After the activation, users will see Bitcoin Builder as a payment option on the “SELECT PAYMENT” section of the Uber mobile application.\n\nThe service works everywhere Uber works, even in countries like India, where credit card penetration is below 2%. According to a report published by The Hindu Business Line, the number of credit cards stood at 21 million by 2014-15. Currently, Uber does not accept debit cards in the country. Uber India takes Paytm, a centralized payment network in India for its local users. But now, Bitcoin Builder’s bitcoin-to-Uber service will give many in India that do not own credit cards or bank accounts an option to pay for the service in another way.\n\n“India needs this service terribly,” said an Uber user in India on Reddit. “Uber does not accept debit cards and many of us don\'t have credit cards…people use cash a lot in India. Bitcoins bought in India are primarily bought in cash. If service like this could be extended to other services, it would be awesome.”\n\nRefunds\n\nIf a user decides to stop using the service of Bitcoin Builder or if Uber decides to cancel the firm’s business account, Bitcoin Builder will refund the remaining balance instantly via bitcoin.\n\n""You can always request all the money remaining in your account back at any time, and it\'ll be paid instantly via bitcoin,” a Bitcoin Builder representative announced. This refund method is similar to Fold’s approach with its discounted bitcoin payment option at Starbucks.\n\nAs of now, all balances are held in U.S. dollars. However, users are allowed to send the bitcoins right before the ride, as Bitcoin Builder accepts bitcoin with zero confirmation. The firm’s representative explained:\n\n“It\'s held in USD […] but you can always just send the BTC in right as you\'re about to ride, we accept it with zero confirmations, so that way you can keep it as BTC as long as you\'re not about to use it.”', 'Users of bitcoin tipping platform ChangeTip can now send tips in US dollars, a move aimed at capturing users who may be wary of digital currency.\n\nCurrently, ChangeTip\'s service – used across 12 social media platforms – denominates tips in bitcoin, or \'bits\' (each worth 0.000001 of a bitcoin). However, in a statement today, the company said it is revamping its platform to support US dollar tips, a move that follows credit card support announced in July.\n\nNick Sullivan, founder and CEO of ChangeTip parent company ChangeCoin, said in a statement:\n\n""While electronic payments are well-established for online purchases, the concept of empowering everyone on the Internet to express gratitude and appreciation for great people, content, causes and contributions using the change in their digital pocket, is unique to social media tipping.""\n\nIn its release, ChangeTip cited survey results that indicate up to 76% of people won\'t use its service because of the digital currency. The remainder (24%) who do try it, it said, ""don\'t feel safe or confident"" sending it to friends. It did not disclose the methodology of its survey, nor its scale.\n\n""People believe it\'s not real money, that it\'s volatile, and that they won’t feel safe using it,"" the statement reads.\n\nTo counteract this, the firm expressed its belief that US dollar users could be introduced to bitcoin as they tip. The release continued:\n\n""When tips are sent internationally, we will be converting USD to bitcoin, showing people the benefits of it as a global currency. When people go to withdraw, they will see that bitcoin is far less expensive than USD to use on our platform as a form of value transfer.""\n\nUsers wishing to send dollar-denominated tips on the platform will need to first load their account with $25 via debit card. A further explanation of how users transact on the service can be found on Zendesk.\n\nA search on the FinCEN database indicates the company has registered as a money transmitter in all US states, though it said regulatory challenges have been a barrier to its US dollar launch.\n\n""Being very transparent, we\'ve been through some serious challenges to get USD to work. The regulatory and banking system challenges have been...an exercise in patience,"" it said.\n\nContent monetization\n\nTogether with the announcement, ChangeTip also revealed it will launch a new product designed to support content creators.\n\nWhile ChangeTip already offers a tipping widget available on blogging platforms such as WordPress, Tipworthy aims to be a content curation offering where users can post links to content they believe warrants additional compensation.\n\nIn statements, the company likened the product to social media giant Pinterest.\n\nUsers are then prompted to tip in denominations of $0.25, $1, $2, $5 and $10. The company said it will also seek to reward users who post content, though no details on this initiative were provided.\n\nChangeTip did not indicate whether tips to the service would be sent to the content creators or the publishing media outlet.\n\nBridges to bitcoin\n\nIn its public messaging, ChangeTip sought to emphasize to existing bitcoin users that the new feature was not intended to move the company away from the technology.\n\nRather, the startup framed the transition as one that would perhaps help it better attack ""consumer perception problems"" bitcoin and digital currencies still face.\n\nChangeTip indicated it is currently working on a ""decentralized"" version of its platform, where users are in control of funds. Currently, ChangeTip processes all bitcoin transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain.\n\n""We are moving small amounts of money, it\'s not feasible to have a 1/10th of a penny tip or micropayment to a publisher be an on-chain transaction,"" the company said.\n\nProposals are currently being considered by the company regarding how it could leverage payment channels on the proposed Lightning Network and other alternatives to further its support for bitcoin.\n\nThe company said it is also working on plans that would allow it to circumvent the traditional banking system, while still offering its full suite of current services.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to comment on this story, though it said CEO Nick Sullivan would seek to answer community questions on Reddit starting at 10:00 EST, 15:00 BST.\n\nDollar image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The new platform launches in this month with a competition in collaboration with the College Cryptocurrency Network .\n\nFor the uninitiated, financial derivatives are simply contracts agreed upon between two parties: whoever holds the asset, in this case, bitcoin, and whoever wants to speculate on the future price of the asset. One of the most popular types of derivatives, a call, is defined as the right to purchase an asset at a preset price, called a strike price, before some date in the future. Should the market price increase above the strike price, the option owner purchases and immediately sells the asset, pocketing the difference.\n\nIn exchange for signing the contract, the option purchaser pays whoever owns the asset a small fee. Asset owners enter into these types of contracts for the guaranteed income, and the option purchasers are incentivized with the large upsides associated with this type of trading. Other popular financial derivatives include puts, where the option owner reserves the right to purchase an asset at a specific price up until a period of time, and futures, where the owner must purchase the asset at a specific price on a specific day in the future.\n\nUsers can purchase financial derivatives offered by Alt-Options in order to both speculate on large bitcoin price movements and decrease volatility. For instance, if a user believed the price of bitcoin was going to increase above $300 sometime in the next six months, he or she could purchase a call at $300 for a small fee. If the price were to reach $350 before six months passed, the user would exercise his option, the bitcoin would be sold on the open market, and the user would pocket $50. If the user’s prediction proved incorrect, the asset owner who sold him the option would simply keep the small fee.\n\nHowever, if a user wanted to protect herself from a price drop below $250 in the next six months, she would purchase a put at $250 on her personal balance of bitcoin on the Alt-Options platform, again paying a small fee. Should the price fall below $250, she would exercise her right to sell her bitcoin for the strike price of $250, protecting her from volatility in the bitcoin market. And while this arrangement may not seem revolutionary, calls and puts play an important role in the world market today by allowing large players to hedge against large swings in the market.\n\nFinancial derivative exchanges have been lucrative for years. Founded in 1898, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange took in $3 billion in 2010. At the end of March 2008, the notional amount of all outstanding positions stood at $81 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nWhile Alt-Options is currently regulated by Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regulations, it has been able to bypass stricter guidelines by using “strong partnerships with regulated (bitcoin) exchanges,” said Alt-Options co-founder Joe Zhou in a recent interview. “There are no specific guidelines regarding digital assets, but we foresee some sort of regulation or set of guidelines from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the future.”\n\nAlt-Options aims to find the same volume that allowed Chicago Mercantile Exchange to prosper with bitcoin trading. With tools typically found on pro-trading platforms and American-style options for retail clients, a team of students is hoping to revolutionize the way mining firms liquidate assets, hedge risk and manage the incredible amounts of bitcoin they generate every day while allowing casual and professional traders to experiment with bitcoin.', 'Budafoods , a certified organic farm and food supplier located in the Sunshine Coast Hinterland, Queensland, Australia, is attempting to create a closed bitcoin economy among farmers and to encourage its partners, supporting businesses and community to accept bitcoin.\n\nOver the past few years, online payment services and platforms such as PayPal and banking systems have negatively affected businesses in the area, including Budafoods and the local businesses the farm supplies. Apart from the substantial fee for transactions and payments, PayPal and the bank transfers have been extremely inefficient, freezing funds for weeks at their will.\n\nIn search for a cheaper, yet quicker, payment method, Budafoods founder Mark Burgunder came across bitcoin, a decentralized currency which enables instantaneous and cheap transactions for merchants and small businesses.\n\n“My main reason for attempting to get others to accept bitcoins is that I love the speed and ease of bitcoin payments and have a distrust of most central banking methods,” Burgunder told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n“On a deep emotional level, fractional reserve banking feels like cheating to me and has only been successful because it benefited the already rich,” he said. “Additionally through experience with credit card processing and using PayPal I have realized that not only are merchants/sellers charged a substantial fee for accepting money, but we also need permission from the banks, credit card companies and/or PayPal to accept payments.”\n\nUnlike most companies that claim to accept bitcoin, Budafoods is not converting the bitcoin it accepts to fiat money.\n\n“In Australia, a surplus of bitcoins wouldn’t be an issue as we currently have a great service available here called Living Room of Satoshi that allows us to make bill payments and electronic transfers to almost any bank account in Australia using bitcoins. We’ve been using this service on a number of occasions already with the largest purchases so far having been for chicken feed and for mobile electric fencing,” Burgunder told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nClosed Bitcoin Economy Among Farmers\n\nAs computer scientist and cryptographer Nick Szabo stated before, suppliers, businesses and customers must all accept and use bitcoin for it to be effective in an economy. Szabo calls this concept a complete closed cycle: store => supplier = workers => store.\n\nBurgunder attempts to implement this concept into the local farm and business networks in Queensland. Currently, Budafoods is trying to convince local businesses in its community to accept and pay them in bitcoin, as it is faster and cheaper than other online payment methods available in Australia.\n\n“We are supplying one of the local restaurants and would be more than happy to accept payment in bitcoins from this restaurant. We feel this should make it easier to allow the restaurant to accept bitcoins from tourists and, in turn, pay us for supplies with the bitcoins they’ve accepted,” said Burgunder.\n\nThe Use of Multi-Sig Wallets between a Supplier and a Business\n\nBurgunder further explained that the use of multi-signature wallets between a supplier and a business will be far more efficient than any other payment method/systems available today.\n\n“I’d envisage in an escrow scenario we’d pay for the purchase into a multi-sig wallet with one of the signatures being ours, with us signing a transaction to release the funds to the supplier once we’ve received the shipment,” explained Burgunder. “With the supplier also having one of the multi-sig keys it wouldn’t be possible for us to just withdraw the funds, giving the supplier certainty that the funds will not disappear on them. I feel this would help incentivize the supplier to assist in speedy and hassle-free delivery as in this scenario it would be in their interest to have the shipment arrive with us in a timely manner.”']"
09/18/2015,"['Many a bitcoin die-hard will tell you that the virtual currency is not only a currency, but also one of the few available for use that can’t be debased by greedy governments.\n\nIt’s perhaps not surprising then, that the most powerful government in the world, at least when it comes to global finance, doesn’t even agree that bitcoin is a currency at all.\n\nOn Thursday, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission announced that it had settled charges against Coinflip, Inc., and its CEO Francisco Riordan for operating an exchange that sold bitcoin options without following appropriate regulations.\n\n“In this order, the CFTC for the first time finds that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities,” the press release said.\n\nLast year, the IRS ruled that it would treat bitcoin as property, not as a currency, meaning among other things that gains from the sale of bitcoins can be taxed.\n\nFor more of Fortune’s bitcoin coverage, watch this video:\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Even now, six years after its debut, some people are uncertain about bitcoin. Many consumers still seem to prefer paying for things with old-fashioned cash and credit, while investors remain divided on whether the computer-based crypto-currency is a financial revolution or just an elaborate, money-burning fad.\n\nFool\'s gold? Possibly. But some experts say there\'s a nugget or two of the real thing in the technology that makes bitcoin work.\n\nThe blockchain, according to its proponents, is an effectively unhackable system that could introduce trust and transparency to any online transaction.\n\nIt\'s a ""key technological innovation,"" according to The Bank of England, and the focus of a joint effort revealed this week by nine of the world\'s biggest financial institutions.\n\nGoldman Sachs, Barclays, UBS and others said Tuesday they have linked with New York-based financial tech firm R3 to develop a way to use blockchain technology in the markets.\n\nBut its most enthusiastic proponents say blockchain technology has even greater potential.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\n\nThe blockchain is the system that keeps track of bitcoin transactions. Think of it as a giant, decentralized ledger that\'s shared and maintained by many different computers in bitcoin\'s online community.\n\nEvery bitcoin transaction that has ever taken place is noted in the ledger and can never be erased. It is constantly growing as more transactions are added in chronological order.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWhen a bitcoin transaction is made, the details are encoded and transmitted across the currency\'s online community. Other computers then try to decode the message. As soon as one succeeds it shows its work to the others, which double check.\n\nThe transaction is approved and the computer that cracked the message is rewarded with some bitcoins as payment for its efforts.\n\nOnce a transaction is approved it\'s recorded in the blockchain, copies of which are maintained separately by computers across the community.\n\nThe computers continually compare their copies of the blockchain, checking for discrepancies.\n\nThe system is considered tamper-proof because any attempt to make a false transaction — say, by spending the same bitcoin twice — would not match the records held, in consensus, by the community. That transaction would be rejected.\n\nWhat\'s the big deal?\n\nProponents say blockchain technology brings ""trust to the trustless world"" of online transactions. Because every part of the system is continually checking the work of the others, the system is thought to be unhackable.\n\nOr at least, insanely difficult to hack.\n\nImagine 100 people witness a car crash. Getting a fake transaction into the blockchain would be like getting a majority of those eyewitnesses to tell identical false accounts of that crash — simultaneously, with no prompting or warning.\n\nThe records are public?\n\nYes, but privacy is maintained. Transactions are noted in full, but bitcoiners use pseudonyms.\n\nHow else can it be applied?\n\nIn any online transaction that requires trust — which is an awful lot of them, when you think about it — we trust that our bank has not been hacked and is showing our actual bank balance. We trust that our anti-virus software is doing its job and all those emails are actually being delivered. That trust is placed in particular, centralized third parties such as RBC, Avast and Gmail.\n\nBecause blockchain technology appears to remove the need for the middlemen of finance — banks, governments, notaries and even paper currency — it\'s thought that its system of decentralized consensus could be applied elsewhere.\n\n""Think about digital signatures, digital contracts, digital keys [to physical locks, or to online lockers], digital ownership of physical assets such as cars and houses, digital stocks and bonds and digital money,"" noted venture capitalist and bitcoin booster Marc Andreessen wrote in a 2014 op-ed for The New York Times.\n\n""All these are exchanged through a distributed network of trust that does not require or rely upon a central intermediary like a bank or broker.""\n\nWhat\'s the catch?\n\nA few things: Critics have already noted that all the electricity sucked up by high-powered bitcoin computers is less than ideal for the environment. (The virtual currency represents a ""real-world environmental disaster,"" according to one Bloomberg op-ed.)\n\nSome also wonder whether a blockchain that never stops growing is sustainable for even the most powerful computers.\n\nAnd then there\'s the matter of why those computers do the work decoding all those transactions. They do it so their owners can earn bitcoins — a currency that, at times, has seemed about as stable as the Somali shilling.\n\nIf bitcoins lose value and those computers can\'t turn a profit for their owners, how long can they be expected to stay with the blockchain gang?', 'Bitcoin lovers have been searching for a way to safely invest in the enormous potential they see in the crypto currency.\n\nBuying actual bitcoins has proven dangerous, to say the least. Just look at the unbelievable turbulence in Bitcoin prices -- the currency\'s value shot up 6,000% in one year before collapsing in value -- and the alleged fraud at the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange that led many investors to lose money.\n\nIn theory, an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that mirrors the price of Bitcoin would offer a somewhat safer alternative. Think: something akin to SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which tracks gold prices.\n\nBut no Bitcoin ETFs have been created. An effort by the twins Cameron and Tyle Winklevoss to do just that has been waiting two years to receive approval from regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission is still trying to figure out how to define and oversee Bitcoin.\n\nThis week, ARK Investment Management announced a full embrace of the digital currency. Its ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW) became the first ETF to invest in bitcoins.\n\n""Current prices present an attractive entry point for our investors,"" Cathie Wood, ARK\'s founder and chief investment officer, said in a statement.\n\nBut before taking a leap, it would be smart to read the fine print of the ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol ""ARKW.""\n\nFirst, it\'s not a pure play on Bitcoin. Even though it announced the Bitcoin play, the ETF is actually an investment in what it calls disruptive technologies. The crypto currency represents just a slice of its holdings, packaged along with Netflix (NFLX), LinkedIn (LNKD) and athenahealth (ATHN), a cloud-based provider of electronic health records.\n\nRelated: Chinese gamblers are all about Bitcoin trading\n\nIt\'s investing in pink sheet security, not actual Bitcoin\n\nSecond, the ARK ETF is not actually investing directly in bitcoins. It\'s buying shares of something called the Bitcoin Investment Trust. Most people haven\'t even heard of that.\n\nThat trust started trading in May on the pink sheets under the ticker symbol ""GBTC."" It\'s got a market valuation of under $40 million and very little trading volume.\n\nThe pink sheets, also known as the over-the-counter market, provide less transparency and oversight from regulators. They\'re like a Wild West alternative to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.\n\n""Pink sheets are where most investors aren\'t willing to tread,"" said Matt Hougan, CEO of ETF.com, a research firm.\n\nGrayScale, which sponsored the Bitcoin trust, defended the decision to list on the pink sheets and noted that a number of major foreign companies such as Adidas (ADDDF) and Roche (RHHBF) list their U.S. shares there.\n\nRelated: Winklevoss twins say Bitcoin will explode beyond $1 trillion\n\nSpotty track record at mirroring Bitcoin\n\nAnother problem is that the investment hasn\'t really mirrored the price of Bitcoin, which defeats the purpose. At times the trust\'s shares have spiked or surged -- even though underlying Bitcoin prices were relatively calm.\n\n""You\'re not really getting Bitcoin here. You\'re getting a Bitcoin derivative that kind of tracks the price of Bitcoin -- but not really well,"" said Hougan. ""There are a bunch of leaps of faith in that chain of command.""\n\nThe ETF company brushed away these concerns, suggesting that price volatility is actually a good sign.\n\nAnother risk for the investment is regulatory. The trust warns investors in disclosure documents that its future may be jeopardized by looming regulation from the SEC.\n\nRelated: Former fed in Silk Road case stole $820,000 in bitcoins\n\nBitcoin is not for the faint of heart\n\nAll of this is on top of the inherent risk that goes into investing in anything that has volatility of Bitcoin.\n\nFounded in 2009, Bitcoin burst onto the financial scene this decade as investors looked for an alternative to traditional currencies. Prices skyrocketed more than 6,000% in 2013 before peaking at nearly $1,250.\n\nAnd then prices collapsed, losing two-thirds of their value last year alone. While Bitcoin has actually calmed down a lot lately, it\'s still down 27% this year to $230 apiece.', 'In the latest sign that the technology behind bitcoin is being embraced by the corporate world, IBM says it’s exploring how the cryptocurrency’s shared ledger system can be used in fields from banking to the Internet of Things.\n\n“It’s a completely novel architecture for business–a foundation for building a new generation of transactional applications that establish trust and transparency while streamlining business processes,” wrote Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director of IBM Research, in a blog post Wednesday. “It has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of getting things done.”\n\nThe notion of a blockchain was first developed by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto to record transactions in the currency without the need for banks or any central authority. All transfers of Bitcoin are announced to the currency’s network of users, and Bitcoin miners are rewarded with newly generated coins for bundling those transactions into specially formatted records called blocks. New blocks need to satisfy certain mathematical properties when taken in conjunction with those already generated, and the complete historic transaction record is known as the blockchain.\n\nRival cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Dogecoin each have their own blockchains, and various projects have experimented with using blockchains to store data besides financial transfer records. A project called Namecoin uses its blockchain to record Internet domain name registrations, and the Ethereum project allows its blockchain to store simple programs called “smart contracts” that can automatically transfer funds when certain conditions are met.\n\nTo IBM, which has seen data processing systems evolve from the mainframe-based systems of the 1960s and ‘70s to today’s distributed SQL databases, the blockchain concept might just be the next big thing in sharing data. The company says blockchains future blockchain-based systems could make it significantly easier to share records and execute all kinds of transactions, including those based on more traditional currency.\n\n“We always have our eye out for the next innovation around these things,” says IBM Middleware CTO Jerry Cuomo. “When you look at blockchain—that notion of a decentralized database that is peer-to-peer and based on shared ledger and public and private key cryptography with smart contracts—it kind of turns the model on its side a bit.”\n\nCuomo says IBM’s working on proof-of-concept projects with clients in a variety of industries to explore how blockchain technology can make their businesses more efficient.', 'Although some individuals in the Bitcoin community believed that nothing would come out of the recent Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Montreal, it seems that some progress was made in finding a compromise between the small-block decentralists and the big-block progressives.\n\nMultiple discussions between some of the key minds in the Bitcoin Core development community took place at the event this past weekend, and it seems the overall goal was to find the key areas of agreement between all of the contributors’ wide-ranging points of view. Rumors were originally swirling around a possible implementation of Adam Back ’s 2-4-8 block-size limit increase proposal, but it appears that the area of agreement is more general than that.\n\nA Short-term Bump in the Block-size Limit\n\nInstead of implementing a long-term solution as soon as possible, the majority of Bitcoin Core contributors are interested in a short-term fix. When reaching out toBlockstream co-founder and President Adam Back to clarify some of the rumors that were swirling around the Montreal workshop, the longtime applied cryptographer pointed to a short summary of the discussions between Bitcoin Core contributors posted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list by Bitcoin Core DeveloperJeff Garzik . In his summary, Garzik noted:\n\n“Many [are] interested or at least willing to accept a ‘short term bump,’ a hard fork to modify block size limit regime to be cost-based via ‘net-utxo’ rather than a simple static hard limit. 2-4-8 and 17%/year were debated and seemed ‘in range’ with what might work as a short term bump – net after applying the new cost metric.”\n\nThe 2-4-8 plan is Adam Back’s simple fallback plan of increasing the block-size limit to 2 megabytes now, 4MB in two years, and 8MB in four years. This is similar to Garzik’s BIP 102 , which simply increases the block-size limit to 2MB on November 11, 2015. The 17 percent per year plan is in reference to Bitcoin Core Developer Pieter Wuille’s plan to increase the block-size limit in accordance with technological advancements. The 17 percent per year number is based on data publicly released by Cisco on an annual basis.\n\nAvoiding an Endless Block-size Increase\n\nBlockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core Contributor Matt Corallo also chimed in in regard to the Scaling Bitcoin discussions on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He noted that there does not seem to be widespread consensus on the idea of a block size that continues to grow over time. He noted:\n\n“Still, the ‘greatest common denominator’ agreement did not seem to be agreeing to an increase which continues over time, but which instead limits itself to a set, smooth increase for X time and then requires a second hardfork if there is agreement on a need for more blocksize at that point.”\n\nMore Work to Be Done in Hong Kong\n\nThere are bound to be more discussions before the next Scaling Bitcoin event in Hong Kong, but that’s where real proposals can be presented alongside test results based on the guidelines for scaling outlined in the Montreal event. Although some view a small block-size limit increase as nothing more than “kicking the can down the road,” the reality is that more time is needed to fully develop long-term solutions, such as the Lightning Network or flexcap , that could help Bitcoin scale to millions (or even billions) of users over time. For now, it seems that a simple block-size limit increase to 2MB or 4MB is an area where many notable Bitcoin Core developers and contributors have found some common ground.', 'However, a significant issue has been the restriction on availability, since these cards cannot currently be shipped to US addresses. Efforts to resolve that obstacle are presently underway, and may offer at least a partial solution to that limitation.\n\nWhile the number of businesses and stores that accept Bitcoin payments is increasing with each passing month, the ability to freely spend digital currency in everyday life is still restricted. To combat this obstacle, a number of companies have offered Visa or MasterCard debit cards linked to a digital currency wallet to allow conversion to fiat money on the fly. This allows you to spend digital currency as you would any fiat currency, or use ATMs to withdraw cash.\n\nOne of the major issues preventing widespread adoption of digital currencies like Bitcoin is the current complexity involved in utilizing cryptocurrency in the same way that we use fiat currency. As many commentators have noted, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of businesses and organizations that accept digital currency as payment, and that is a necessary and welcome trend. Still, that alone does not and cannot offer the ubiquitous public acceptance that cryptocurrency will need to one day be as well-regarded as today’s fiat money. And until that acceptance is achieved, the perception of digital currency will continue to be shaped by the need to constantly exchange one type of currency for another using a process that remains anything but elegant. Fortunately, some progress is finally being made in that area.\n\nSeveral companies have begun to offer a debit card linked to a digital currency wallet. These cards are VISA compliant, and allow fast transfer of funds between the digital currency wallet and conversion to fiat currency on the card. The card can then be used just like every other debit card to pay for goods or withdraw funds at a normal ATM. This provides a solution to one half of the digital currency conundrum - getting it and using it to pay for things. However, the availability of these cards remains limited, with some countries simply not having access to the cards. Worse, the list of countries lacking access to this option includes Bitcoin’s biggest market, the United States.\n\nIn an attempt to overcome this obstacle, the same debit cards are being offered in a virtual format. Instead of receiving tangible cards, these cardholders are issued VISA card numbers in a digital format, which they can then use to make purchases via the phone or through online portals. Obviously, these digital cards cannot be utilized in the same way that physical cards are used at ATMs or in physical stores, but they do offer a solution that can help millions of people gain greater access to cryptocurrency spending power. So while this may not be a complete solution to the usefulness dilemma, it is at least a step in the right direction.', 'Lee Munson is the founder of <a href=""http://www.security-faqs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Security FAQs</a>, a social media manager with BH Consulting and a blogger with a huge passion for information security.', 'Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.\n\nThe bitcoin and blockchain industry have a new major newsmaker: distributed ledger startup R3CEV.\n\nLeaving behind a week filled with impressive funding rounds, the coverage over the last few days has been largely dominated by the company\'s partnership with nine well-known banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs.\n\nJournalists from across the world jumped at the chance to cover the news – perhaps still a sign that mainstream media will deem industry events newsworthy if traditional finance is involved.\n\nIn stark contrast, more negative news events received less attention, and were far more focused on the other half of the blockchain – bitcoin, the digital token for which the blockchain acts as a ledger.\n\nBitPay\'s phishing attack – which resulted in the loss of $1.8m – received less widespread, but more derisive coverage. Elsewhere, reports about Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles\' charge with embezzlement carried over from last week.\n\nR3CEV\'s big score\n\nThe news that nine of the world\'s biggest banks had partnered with distributed ledger startup R3CEV caught the attention of the Financial Times\' Philip Stafford, who began his piece emphasizing the group\'s intention to drive the adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nStafford wrote:\n\n""Nine of the largest investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, are planning to develop common standards for blockchain technology in an effort to broaden its use across financial services.""\n\nStafford continued to note that the blockchain, which he described as bitcoin\'s underlying ""computer network"", had caught the eye of the financial services industry in the past six months for ""its potential to overhaul the sprawling and complicated network of bank payments and settlements"".\n\nInterestingly, the journalist\'s assertions follow on from Blythe Masters\' comments during a panel at Consensus 2015 – CoinDesk\'s inaugural conference held in New York last week – where she noted how distributed ledger technologies could serve to eradicate the pain points affecting the financial industry and its ecosystem.\n\nThe article, which then went on to give an overview of the financial industry\'s interaction with blockchain technology, also noted:\n\n""Banks, exchanges and settlement houses are exploring ways to harness the much-hyped technology to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading old back-office systems and outsourcing billions of dollars in costs to automatic execution of contracts.""\n\nEfforts from Wall Street\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\'s Paul Vigna was also quick to point out Wall Street\'s increasing interest in blockchain technology:\n\n""This year has seen a number of efforts on the Street, from both startups and established banks, to use blockchain as the basis of new platforms and products.""\n\nExamples cited by Vigna included Blythe Masters\' appointment as CEO of Digital Asset Holdings and itBit\'s plans to reveal its own distributed ledger, BankChain.\n\nOn the topic of scandal, this week\'s coverage also regurgitated Mark Karpeles\' charge with embezzlement, widely covered towards the latter half of last week.\n\nDevil and angel image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Early adopters such as Overstock and Dell computers have been joined by Microsoft, and even academic institutions such as the University of Nicosia in Cyprus now accept the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut in order to spend it, you need to accumulate it. What better way to accomplish that than actually being paid in the currency as part of your salary? A few employers are leading the way in this regard, such as software-as-a-service (SaaS) software vendor Buffer, Structur3D Printing and Wisconsin-based coffee company Colectivo.\n\nSetting Up the Currency\n\nSo how can you set things up so your staff can be paid in the currency? There are a few payment processors currently operating, including BitPay and Wagepoint, that will work with your accounting department to lay the foundation. These processors handle all the various Internet banking transfers for each of your employees that want to be paid with the cryptocurrency. Wagepoint alone said that it processes more than $75,000 in bitcoin salaries, which is still minuscule but indicates that it is a growing trend.\n\nBitcoin has some advantages that regular currencies don’t currently have. The fees to transfer your money into bitcoin are minuscule, even if you have to move money internationally. The transactions happen within seconds, which is great for our up-to-the-nanosecond population that can’t wait for anything, and it has a lot of support from the software community, with dozens of apps and service providers offering support.\n\nRisks of Bitcoin\n\nWhile being paid at least in part in the currency could connote a coolness factor, there are some risks. First, its value is very volatile: In the past, it has fluctuated between a few hundred dollars to more than $1,200 per bitcoin. That is a wider range than most government-backed currencies trade at. Second, because of these variations, you could end up seeing your stash of the currency drop to below what you would have gotten had you been on a straight dollar or other government-backed currency.\n\nBut if your home currency is going through some rough patches, it might make sense to hedge your salary with some bitcoin. There are laws about minimum wage requirements that could be triggered if you have a significant portion of your wages being paid in the currency and the value drops low enough.\n\nIn addition, transactions can’t easily be reversed, unlike typical credit card transactions — that could be awkward in certain situations. And then there’s what happens at tax time.\n\nTax Implications\n\nWhat are the tax implications? Taxing authorities have different approaches, which vary by country and the currency in which your employees are paid. Some treat bitcoin as a fringe benefit rather than as part of their wages, while others look at bitcoin as a barter transaction. That’s what the Canadian revenue authority is currently doing, meaning that you must include the value of the barter as part of your income calculations.\n\nStill others look at bitcoin ownership as a capital asset — similar to a stock or mutual fund — and taxes are assessed based on gains or losses when bitcoins are converted into your domestic currency. For help with this situation, you might want to look into a service called Libratax. This is a cloud system that connects to your employees’ bitcoin addresses via the Blockchain, downloads their transactions and automatically calculates the gains and losses.\n\nBitcoin is exciting and has gotten some important mindshare from a number of places. But the risks might outweigh the rewards, so it pays to move cautiously when it comes to actually compensating your staff with this currency.', 'When you decide to trade in Bitcoin, you must know that there are currently many options available for individuals looking for Bitcoin exchanges. However, there are always a chance of you stumbling upon an exchange that is nothing but scam. We have seen multiple events in past that conjointly point to the same “scandalous” conclusion — people losing money. Therefore, it becomes necessary to research a bit before zeroing-in on a Bitcoin exchange.\n\nAs a Bitcoin news website, our search for such a reliable exchange has now brought us on the doors of Cryptonit. Looking at their website, one can see how the exchange caters for traders wishing to trade between multiple fiat and cryptocurrencies. These assets include: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Namecoin, Dogecoin, as well as US Dollar and Euro.\n\nBackground\n\nFor once, Cryptonit gives an impression of being the earliest of cryptocurrency exchanges. Launched in 2012, the trading platform is owned and operated by UK-based Cryptonit Solutions Ltd. As an exchange, Cryptonit works in close collaboration with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Since the UK’s regulator has exempted Bitcoin exchanges from obtaining a regular license, Cryptonit is permissible to offer Bitcoin trading services throughout Europe.\n\nDue to its involvement in sending/receiving fiat currencies, the exchange has successfully registered itself with the HM Revenue and Customs as a Money Service Business with a status “Bureau Da Exchange” Their status can be accessed at HMRC website by entering their MLR number 12761601.\n\nOverall, Cryptonit is in perfect sync with the ongoing Bitcoin regulations in the UK, meaning a low risk profile for traders.\n\nNo Red Flags\n\nEver since its inception in 2012, Cryptonit is running smoothly and steadily without bumps. The exchange has an SSL certificate, which is nothing less than a virtue. It is further equipped with a two-factor authentication that protects users from fishy login attempts. This parameter means a lot, considering the track record of many other exchanges that have lost the clients’ money to security loopholes. To make things further secure, Cryptonit has also integrated Google Authenticator and Yubikey.\n\nDeposits & Withdrawals\n\nThe liquidity of Cryptonit is top-notch, for the exchange brings innumerable options for traders to deposit and withdraw money without any delays. For instance: the exchange offers international deposits and SEPA at 0%. It also has a reliable bank in Germany that offers a possibility to pay instantly via SOFORT. Here are the details:\n\nDeposits\n\nAstroPay 2.5% (USD only)\n\nInternational Wire Transfer / SEPA 0%\n\nDengionline 0%\n\nMoneyGram 10% (USD and EUR)\n\nCredit Card (Visa/MasterCard) 7.4% (USD and EUR) Saturday Special – 4.9%\n\nOKPay 1% (USD and EUR)\n\nPayeer 9% (USD and EUR)\n\nPayPal WPS 9.8% (USD and EUR)\n\nPerfect Money 3% (USD and EUR)\n\nSkrill 14% (EUR only)\n\nSOFORT Banking 2.9% (EUR only)\n\nWestern Union 15% (USD only)\n\nVoucher 0%\n\nWithdrawals\n\nPayPal 2% (USD and EUR)\n\nSkrill 8% (USD and EUR)\n\nInternational Wire Transfer 0%\n\nSEPA 0%\n\nOKPay 1.5% (USD and EUR)\n\nPerfect Money 1.5% (USD and EUR)\n\nPayeer 1% (USD and EUR)\n\nWestern Union 20% (USD and EUR)\n\nMoneyGram 20% (USD and EUR)\n\nQIWI 5% (USD and EUR)\n\nPaxum 4.5% (USD and EUR)\n\nWebMoney 3% (USD and EUR)\n\nVoucher 0%\n\nAffiliation Programs\n\nApart from Bitcoin and altcoin trading services, Cryptonit also offers three types of affiliate programs. The Option I, as the company refers it program, offers 0.05% commission to those individuals who brings new clients through a referral link. Moving further, the Option II allows developers and programmers earn by integrating Cryptonit trading in their bots, scripts, trading software, mobile applications. This program is only available for approved affiliates.\n\nThe third and the last affiliate program is Option III. This options allows approved affiliates to register Cryptonit users remotely. All affiliates need to do here is to refer Cryptonit to potential users directly from the mobile application. If the potential user converts into sales, then the affiliate is awarded with a 0.05% commission on all the transactions conducted by the new user.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Cryptonit is a decent and harmless Bitcoin and altcoin trading platform. Its user-interface is navigable and intuitive; the liquidity is top-notch; and the security features are good enough to confirm traders a peaceful sleep each night.']"
09/19/2015,"['There are multiple ways for virtual currency enthusiasts to support the Bitcoin network. Not only can they spread the word about Bitcoin and try to “convert” as many people as possible, but there is also the option of running a Bitcoin node. In recent months, it has become clear the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B is more than capable of running a Bitcoin node. With a touchscreen for this little device to be released soon, visually monitoring a Bitcoin node is just $60 USD away.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase Steps into Canada, Eh\n\nRunning a Bitcoin Node on the Raspberry Pi 2\n\nOne of the main reasons why few people decide to run a Bitcoin node on their computers is due to the blockchain size. As of press time, the blockchain approaches the 50GB threshold, containing all transactions from back in 2009 up until this very moment. Especially on older hard drives, indexing the blockchain can take quite some time.\n\nEven though a Bitcoin Node does not slow down most modern computers, the machine needs run non-stop. Doing so draws a lot of electricity from the wall, and costs can ramp up to a significant amount over time. Granted, not every Bitcoin node needs to be accessible 24/7, but it is considered a good practice to let it run for as many hours in a day as possible.\n\nWhen the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B launched earlier in 2015, there was a good bit of interest from the Bitcoin community. With more powerful hardware compared to its predecessor, the question became whether or not this tiny PC could run a Bitcoin node. Lo and behold, the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B is perfectly capable of doing so, with performance to spare.\n\nSolving the storage problem for the blockchain is a different matter, though. A Raspberry Pi 2 Model B will support micro SD storage or USB sticks, both of which can be used to store all necessary data. For those among us who are a bit more tech-savvy, connecting a hard disk or a solid state drive is an alternative option as well.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to this: a $35 device can act as a full Bitcoin node while consuming far less electricity compared to a computer or laptop. Powering a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B can be done through a USB cable, which can be plugged into a hub, monitor, tv screen, or even a wall plug with a USB connector.\n\nMonitoring Your Bitcoin Node on a 7 Inch Screen\n\nTo make the idea of running a Bitcoin node on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B even more attractive, it will soon be possible to monitor a node’s status on a 7-inch touchscreen. Earlier today, the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced that it will be releasing a touchscreen display for this mini computer, at the price point of $60.\n\nWith an 800×400 resolution and 10-finger capacitive touch capability, the new screen for Raspberry Pi owners holds a lot of potential. Included in the package will be a board to both power the screen and make a connection with the Raspberry Pi through a DSI ribbon cable.\n\nThe main reason this screen will connect via DSI ribbon cable is to keep the Raspberry Pi’s HDMI port free. Doing so gives users the option to connect the device to a secondary screen if needed. It is important to note that early adopters of this touchscreen will have to get their hands dirty and perform some minor assembly to get everything up and running.\n\nNote from the Author: The touchscreen will be compatible with Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, Model B+ and Model A+. The first generation of Raspberry Pi’s will not be supported [for now], as the screen requires the latest version of the Raspbian OS to operate.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on attaching a touchscreen to your Bitcoin Node running on the Raspberry Pi 2?

Computer king IBM sure thinks so. In what is a clear instigation that the corporate world is now embracing the technology behind bitcoin, IBM has confirmed that it is further experimenting with the blockchain to focus and improve its systems, particularly the future Internet of Things.\n\nArvind Krishna, the senior vice president and director of IBM research, recently posted some personal (and positive) thoughts towards the blockchain in a blog post, saying:\n\n“It’s a completely novel architecture for business – a foundation for building a new generation of transactional applications that establish trust and transparency while streamlining business processes… It has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of getting things done.”\n\nKrishna further explained to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Blockchain, as a technology, is extremely interesting and intriguing.

Sadly, the way financial services assess risk is one such example. Too much reliance is placed on neat quantitative solutions even though they are flawed. Investment is both an art and a science and risk should be calculated through qualitative and quantitative methods. Our one-dimensional approach to risk could well sow the seeds of the next crisis. Market risk is commonly evaluated through models like the simple Capital Asset Pricing Model or complex derivatives of the Black Scholes option pricing model. They have their uses. Fund managers discussing levels of risk with clients or looking to launch funds need concrete measures on which to base conversations. But these uses are pretty limited. A problem is the use of short-term volatility as a proxy for risk. This measures the day-to-day movement of asset prices and is easy to quantify. But it does not accurately reflect permanent loss of capital — the investors’ risk of losing their money forever. It also neglects other risks such as credit, liquidity and bankruptcy, which are not readily measurable. During the financial crisis, institutions such as Lehman Brothers collapsed because the models they used miscalculated some risks and ignored others, which were hard to quantify. Models are only as good as their inputs. Technology companies use the phrase ‘garbage in, garbage out’ to describe the data you will get out of a program if what you put in is suspect. The concept is not sufficiently well-understood in finance. For instance, past performance data are often at the heart of models, despite numerous flaws. Potential investors are told ‘past performance is no guarantee of future performance’ — it really is not. Think of the Chinese equity owners, who saw their capital more than double in value over the course of this year, only to plunge 30 per cent in less than a week. Financial markets are more complex than probability alone implies; uncertainty also needs to be considered Even without these failures, models should not be the sole instrument used to calculate risk. Economist John Maynard Keynes explained that there are two components to risk: probability and uncertainty. Probability explains risk in closed situations, with a finite number of outcomes and limited repercussions, such as tossing a coin. It is also the output from risk models. But financial markets are more complex than probability alone implies; uncertainty also needs to be considered. The probability of Greece exiting the Eurozone, for instance, could be roughly estimated by looking at markets and bookies’ odds. But the many uncertainties surrounding a Grexit cannot be estimated by even the most sophisticated risk models. A qualitative approach to analysing risk allows consideration of these uncertainties. Statistically insignificant events with the potential to cause massive disruption are given appropriate attention. Flaws in data and risks that cannot readily be quantified may cause models to produce ‘garbage’, but in a holistic approach these flaws will not prove so fatal. Qualitative data may not produce concrete statistics, but they do allow us to look past the fallibility of models. The sophisticated models used by credit rating agencies judged many complicated asset-backed securities as relatively benign before the financial crisis. The models were wrong. Maybe if the credit rating agencies had taken a wider look at these products (or just asked themselves if they understood them) they might have come to very different conclusions. Models based on flawed data, which do not consider uncertainty are clearly insufficient. A more holistic approach is needed. Unfortunately such a view is not shared by many risk analysts. Their only philosophy is the leap of faith that is required to account for the assumptions inherent in models. Anne Richards is the chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management', 'Uber is one of the most valuable startup in the world, and part of that success can be attributed to an aggressive strategy to acquire and retain talented people. Their most notable, and recent, tactic has been poaching Google’s top experts in mapping and geospatial solutions. Moves like this provide Uber with a significant competitive advantage in a crowded marketplace. Talented executives and engineers flocking to Uber believe the company has “world-changing” ambitions with a corporate culture that values team as much as the bottom line.\n\nThe opportunity to thrive, professionally, is grounded in the understanding that Uber is committed to their most valuable asset—people, even though it has received plenty of criticisms for the way it treats drivers by not offering them health insurance and other worker benefits. Investment in human capital is a functional practice that new startups often overlook. Critics will argue that initiatives focused on leadership and professional development are mere fluff and do not work. However, new research proves that it is one of the most important factors in building a world-class workforce that remains committed, engaged, and performing at the highest levels.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, startups spend months raising money to build a business. But, with Uber as a prime example, building a successful business is about more than raising money. After initial fundraising rounds, investor expectations are high and startups hit a very a delicate point in a company’s lifecycle – where talent means everything and investing in talent is critical for success.\n\nIn the current market context, there are four distinct areas of focus that start-ups must embrace to build an early competitive edge:\n\nUnderstand the dynamics of the talent war: In the past, employees valued opportunity, compensation, and security. Today, millennials occupy a larger percentage of the work force and are overwhelmingly attracted to companies that are perceived as strongly invested in their personal overall growth and career development. They want to know that there will be the opportunity to develop a strong set of competencies and transferrable skills that can not only be useful now, but later on as well, as their careers develop. Further, preparing workers for new roles as the company expands is also necessary — internal mobility is a better alternative than losing key talent.\n\nCreate a culture with a passion for learning: Culture can be a barrier to integrating professional development into a company strategy, but it can also be the source of competitive advantage. A culture of excellence leverages continuous learning to create an environment where preparation, adaptability, and ongoing support to do a job are ever present. This is where out-of-the-box contributions emerge. Instead of just getting work done, the culture transforms a company into a place where employees feel motivated and empowered to develop new ideas, concepts, and recommendations that are actively advancing individual and collective innovation well beyond what’s normally expected. This allows companies to better monitor and evaluate employee progress and provides an opportunity for employees to be constantly aware of their performance while identifying areas where support exists to help master new skills.\n\nEnhance effective management: Managers who operate in an environment that integrates learning develop a potent ability to influence, communicate and drive performance for subordinates and peers. In the past, startups or smaller managers could survive by responding reactively to market conditions. But reactive options fail to take advantage of professional development opportunities and forego the competitive advantage. When senior leaders use continuous learning to develop short-mid- and long-term growth strategies, the result is an aggressive and highly competitive operating model. With a clear strategy and plan for correlating talent development and efficient execution, communication with key stakeholders, like investors, are more productive.\n\nRelentlessly promote the brand: Top talent who appreciate a continuous learning environment are more likely to be motivated to remain consistently engaged and can be groomed to become some of your best assets. These are your brand ambassadors, promoting the value of the company to new employees and even potential investors. They embody the brand, enhance the reputation across the industry, and are a direct reflection of the best the brand can offer.\n\nTalent today is the newest form of currency for start-ups. Competitors can poach top talent over the weekend – effectively collapsing your edge in the market. While startups have a number of balls in the air at any one time, one of the most important is to recognize top talent as their most critical asset and deliberately and proactively develop strategies to protect it. It’s the strongest path to success.\n\nJason Wingard is a professor at Columbia University. He is also author of Learning to Succeed: Rethinking Corporate Education in a World of Unrelenting Change.', 'De acuerdo con lo informado por el diario El Mundo, el lanzamiento de esta criptomoneda solo será posible gracias a la aprobación del Banco Central del país, ya que en Rusia esta es la única entidad que tiene derecho a emitir monedas. A pesar de sus dudas y temores acerca del uso de las criptomonedas para actividades ilegales, el gobierno de Rusia ha decidido apoyar esta iniciativa precisamente para evitar este mal uso.', 'What is the usual response if a company releases results that fall below expectations? It is usually a significant drop in share price. This is because of the phenomenon that is called behavioural finance. Investopedia defines behavioural finance as:\n\n“a relatively new field that seeks to combine behavioural and cognitive psychological theory with conventional economics and finance to provide explanations for why people make irrational financial decisions.”\n\nThere are many variations of behavioural finance, with the particular instance I discussed above attributing predominantly to herding and/or overreaction.\n\nOverreaction is fairly self-explanatory and draws on the theory of investors overreacting after a negative announcement. I believe that investors who fall under this category are responsible for the next one, herding. Herding, or herd behaviour, describes the tendency for investors to feel pressurised and thus copy large groups of other investors. The investors who have overreacted often form these large groups, hence why I’m holding them accountable.\n\nIt is this that is partly responsible for stock market bubbles forming, which has occurred many times throughout history. The most famous of these is of course the dotcom bubble, however, economic bubbles have been an issue for centuries, such as the time when, amazingly, the price of a single tulip bulb was selling for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman back in the 17th century. Value investors will try and estimate a company’s intrinsic value via various analyses and valuation models, particularly multi-period models such as discounted cash flow, and if their valuation is above the current share price they will buy. Value investors also tend to focus on stable, long-term investments as well.\n\nNow, take the concept of a value investor purchasing shares in a company after performing all relevant analyses and valuations and in turn believes the company is undervalued. If the quarterly results aren’t as good as was predicted, this will likely see a significant drop in the share price due to reasons discussed above. Rather than this particular investor panicking, what they should actually do is see it as a profit-making opportunity. This is because the same company they believed is undervalued prior to the quarterly announcement is now selling for an even cheaper amount. Providing they are confident with their valuation and believe the company should be selling for a higher amount, it should highlight the time to purchase even more of the shares, as they’re confident it will rise in the long-term. This is something that Christopher H. Browne discusses in detail in his book, The Little Book of Valuation, and in particular within Chapter 1, ‘Buy Stocks like Steaks…On Sale’.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the sudden and significant price drops/rises occurring as a result of overreaction are often not permanent, with the mispricing eroding over time to reach back to its equilibrium.\n\nEmpirical Evidence\n\nAs an extreme case of being able to make a profit in these circumstances one could look back at the share price of Rightmove, the online real estate portal, which bottomed out at a price of 160p in January 2009 as a result of the financial crisis. If, as a result of you believing it was grossly undervalued and that Rightmove will hang on throughout the crisis and flourish thereafter you bought more shares at this low of 160p, you would have made a capital gain of over 2300%. This assumption of the company hanging on through the crisis was arguably rational due to its dominance in its industry where it held 80% of the market share.\n\nObserving a more common scenario, we can look at the FTSE 100 company, Imperial Tobacco. On the 19th August 2015 they released an Interim Management Statement for their 3rd quarter, which showed they were on track for their full year results. Nevertheless, the news was strangely greeted with a surprising initial drop of 4.62% in share price. Along with a further 5.09% drop as a result of a notification of transactions of Directors and PDMRs, the share price has not only risen back to what it was on August 19th, it has risen a further 3.5%.', 'The UK payment processing firm rejected bid interest from suitors including French rival Ingenico in favour of a listing next month which should catapult it straight into the FTSE 100.\n\nIts private equity owners Bain Capital and Advent International, which bought it from Royal Bank of Scotland five years ago in a deal worth about £2billion, are looking to raise £890million from selling at least 25 per cent of the company to reduce debt and grow the business.\n\nSenior management including chief executive Philip Jansen, are in line for a paper fortune, while Worldpay’s 4,500 global workforce will receive between £1,000 and £6,000 each.\n\nWorldpay has grown rapidly since RBS was forced to offload it following the bank’s £45.5billion bailout.\n\nMore than £300million has been spent on a string of acquisitions and joint ventures and a further £400million invested in technology.\n\nCity grandee Sir Mike Rake, chairman of BT and former CBI president, recently took over as chairman.', 'The European Union has been into much pressure after the continuous surge of migrants from the Middle East and Africa that arrive in thousands at the coasts of Italy and Greece, in order to continue their journey to the central and northern Europe. The conflicts that are raising in Syria and in Afghanistan have forced many people to migrate, having as their final destination mainly Germany.\n\nThe number of migrants in the first 6 months of 2015 has been higher than the number for the whole 2014. More specifically, during January – August of 2015 more than 350,000 people were seen in EU’s borders, whereas in 2014 the number was 280,000. Greece has received by far the highest number of migrants, coming mainly via Turkey. Italy follows as the runner-up, receiving migrants mainly from North Africa. However, the trip to Italy has been the most dangerous thus far and many people have lost their lives in the Mediterranean, desperately trying to reach the Italian coasts.\n\nSyrians have been the largest migrant group thus far. The civil war has destroyed a big part of the country and many people have been forced to abandon their their homes and to seek asylum in Europe. Afghans and Eritreans are the second largest migrant group, who have left their countries mainly because of the poverty and the abuse of human rights.\n\nAs it is shown from the diagram above Germany is the main destination for migrants and has received most of the asylum applications. It is estimated that this year more than 800,000 refugees are expected to arrive in Europe, raising questions over the ability of EU members to host them. According to the UN more than 3,000 people are expected to cross Macedonia every day in the following months. Many of them cross into Serbia and Hungary in order to reach central Europe. Due to the high influx of migrants the Hungarian authorities decided to build a razor- wire fence, in order to keep migrants out. Apart from that the central Budapest station where many migrants were gathered in order to travel to Germany and Austria, closed by the order of the local authorities in 1st September and provoked reactions over the actions of Hungary over the migration crisis.\n\nMany countries are struggling with the high influx of migrants and have asked for help from other EU members over the acceptance of the increased number of asylum seekers. Hungary, Greece and Italy have been the migrant hotspots, overwhelmed by a high number of migrants that hope to settle in Europe. Many reception centers in countries like Greece are overcrowded and are unable to handle the increased number of asylum claims. Germany suspended the Dublin rule which states that every EU country has the responsibility to examine every asylum seeker’s claim once an immigrant has reached their borders, and accepts only a certain number of asylum applications from Syrian refugees.\n\n“It is Europe today that represents a place of hope and a haven of stability in the eyes of men and women in the Middle East and Africa”\n\nJean-Claude Juncker\n\nAre EU countries doing their fair share?\n\nThe EU’s asylum policy for many years has been inadequate and not harmonized, because most of the member states have their own policy which in some cases does not comply with the EU one. The economic climate in Europe is gloomy, unemployment is rising in some of the EU countries and the member states are divided on how to share the migrant burden. In addition to that the Dublin regulation, under which every EU country must proceed a migrant’s asylum claim once he enters that country first, was not designed for such a massive migrant crisis and there is a need for adjustments to be made.\n\nAgreeing on asylum rules is another key for encountering the increasing migrant influx. If the member states agree on common rules, this could mean that countries would share any data on migrants and it would be easier to track them with the use of fingerprints or IDs. The dysfunction of the Dublin Regulation is a major disadvantage in the effort to process any asylum claims and according to the European Agenda of Migration, in 2014 all the 72% of applications for asylum were handled by just five EU states, raising concerns over integrity of EU in such a crisis.\n\n“We Europeans should know and never forget why giving refuge and complying with fundamental rights is so important”\n\nJean Claude Juncker\n\nThe migration crisis has divided the EU member states over the course of action that they need to take. The difficult part for the political leaders, as in the Eurozone crisis, would be to implement effective policies in order to keep a steady pace of the events. The EU states must agree to a common ground, in order to share the burden of asylum claims fairly. This can be mainly achieved by accepting a mandatory quota system, where countries would equally share the number of fleeing refugees. This is quite difficult to be implemented as countries like the UK opted out of the quota and are willing to take only 20,000 Syrian refugees. This crisis requires the co-operation of the EU countries and strong leadership from the EU leaders in order to be set in control.', 'You’ve probably heard of a man named Michael Jordan and a company called Nike before. What perhaps you might not have known is the dominance that the Brand has in the market place.\n\n$11,267\n\n$15,000\n\n$5,000\n\nThese three figures are resale prices for three different Jordan branded shoes, the Air Jordan 11 (blackout), UNDFTD X Air Jordan 4 and the Air Jordan 10 and 12 OVO editions. In all three cases these were limited editions or one off shoe releases. However for the product to re-sell for so many times more than it’s retail price, gives us the first indication of the power of the Jordan brand.\n\nIn 1984, Jordan signed his deal with Nike, although Adidas offered $500,000, double Nike’s offer. Nike included something no one had ever done: a percentage of the revenues in the deal. Nike also had an out clause, if Air Jordan’s didn’t earn Nike $3 million in the first 3 years. Jordan signed with Nike and in 1985 the shoe made $130 million in revenue. The rest is history.\n\nRising prices\n\nWhen Air Jordan debuted in 1985 they cost $65. An astronomical price for sports shoes then, an equivalent of about $136 today. However, in 2002 the XVIIs became the first sports shoes to retail for $200 and new Jordan’s sell for higher today. It’s this continued rise in retail pricing, that is perhaps most shocking of all. Eric Myers, director at engineering firm INTEGRIS Group said\n\n“Rising sneaker prices can be attributed to a variety of factors: rising costs of labour in China, increased costs for raw material, inflation, and general price increases, yet it appears that the price increases have significantly outpaced these factors over the past decade.”\n\nSteve Bence a 38-year Nike veteran and director broke down the general industry cost of a $100 pair of shoes. It’s worth noting that the Jordan Brand has shoe releases that regularly eclipse this $100 mark, yet would pay a similar price for production.\n\nNot the cleanest image\n\nIn order to keep costs low Nike has gone to incredible lengths, pushing labour and human rights barriers. Despite labour costs only accounting for about 4% of the total cost of production for Nike it has fought rising wages. With 171,000 Nike-affiliated workers, Indonesia is the third-largest producer of goods for the company, according to The Independent. However according to the Guardian a Nike shoe factory in Serang, Indonesia, failed to pay its workers for 600,000 hours of overtime work over two years.\n\nAn Educating for Justice report claims, a shoe factory in Sukabumi, Indonesia, which produces Nike products, allegedly hired high-ranking Indonesian military officers to force workers to agree to work for less than the country’s minimum wage. Six Nike-contractor factories in Indonesia applied for an exemption from the minimum wage law, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports; they needed consent from some workers in order to be eligible. If the factories get the exemption, they will be able to pay their workers $3.70 per day instead of $4 per day.\n\nThe result is a big profit margin\n\nClearly profit margins that these branded trainers/sneakers (not just the Jordan brand) have are very wide. As a notorious reseller Corgishoe, with several thousands social media followers, explained, “For example, a shoe that should sell for $100 is now bumped up to $125”. A large amount would be sold at the sore price upon the shoe’s release and the remainder can be sold at a discount of 25 per cent, which happens to be around the $100 manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP), based on the production costs.\n\n“Even at a 40-50 per cent discount on the $125 MSRP the brands are still turning a great profit…. It’s genius. Pull the wool over the consumer’s eyes, and always remember: Capitalism has no moral compass. I absolutely applaud the brands for maximizing their profit margin.”\n\nPower of branding\n\nThe truth is Jordans can keep margins so wide because of it’s branding power. Jordan’s are luxury goods, but one that isn’t exclusive to the wealthiest. The name Jordan it self is worth millions of dollars. At a civil trial focused on the market value of Michael Jordan’s identity, Jordan was awarded $8.9 million from Safeway for using his name in an advert without his permission. In 15 years, having earned the largest single season salary NBA history, Michael Jordan took in $94 million in cumulative playing salary, whilst hitting game winner after game winner. Yet in 2014 alone over the age of 50, Jordan made more than $100 million in sponsorships.\n\nJordan U.S. shoe sales rose 17% to $2.6 billion in 2014, according to data compiled by SportScanInfo. Jordan has eight times the sales of the signature shoes, which is current NBA star, LeBron James. Jordan apparel and the international business have revenues over an additional $1 billion. The Jordan Brand commanded 58% market share of the $4.2 billion U.S. basketball shoe market last year, up from 54% in 2013. The Nike share jumps to 95.5% if you include Nike Basketball. The competition: Adidas (2.6% share), Under (1%) and Reebok (0.8%).\n\nThe Air Jordan XI “Legend Blue” sold out on Nike’s website in three hours. At an average price of $180, according to SportScanInfo, Nike sold more than $80 million of the “Legend Blue” within its first week around $35 million within its first day. One style. In one week. The competition: Adidas, Under Armour, Reebok and every other non-Nike/Jordan brand sold a cumulative total of $190 million for all its styles over the entire 52 weeks of 2014. Like he did on the court, Jordan has dominated all competitors that have stood in his way.\n\nJordan himself rates higher than any athlete in consumer perception, according to market research firm Repucom. He ranks 12th globally. The only other athlete in the top 20 was David Beckham. Jordan’s 98% awareness level in the U.S. is on par with President Barack Obama in the States.\n\nThe followership\n\nThe following for Jordan’s have reached a cult like status. They’re a must have and a symbol of status within the younger generation, collectors own pairs that have never been removed from their box. Rapper Macklemore’s song “wing$” perfectly captures the attitudes within the culture when it comes to the effect the brand has had. Beyond sports within the hip hop culture, whether it’s Multi millionaire rapper Drake, who is “still at it scrubbing J’s (jordan’s) with a tooth brush”. Or it’s Nelly who “rocks a different year of J’s every day, a different style, different colour are a must” the Jordan Brand is engrained in the culture. Nike even had to change its Jordan release dates to Saturdays so as to stop children skipping school to go buy the shoes. One thing is certain the Jordan brand is as successful and example of brand power you’re likely to come across, with significant financial benefits Nike.\n\nWith a growing share of a market it already dominates and the continued financial success of Nike, the partnership between Nike and Jordan will likely continue to produce billions in revenue for the company and hundreds of millions for the man. Although with demand remaining as high as it’s ever been don’t look for the prices to come down. If you want to be like Mike, you have to pay the price.']"
09/20/2015,"['It was the little currency that could, and now it really can. Despite being an effectively made up currency that was once used almost exclusively on the Web, the bitcoin is inching ever closer to legitimacy. Late last week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) took the virtual currency further into official recognition than ever before, defining bitcoin and other digital currencies as commodities. “While there is a lot of excitement surrounding bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets,” said CFTC director of enforcement Aitan Goelman. So even though the ruling came about as a slap on the wrist for the currency, it actually may be a good thing for bitcoin users.\n\nIn a press release, the CFTC explained it had “issued an Order filing and simultaneously settling charges … Coinflip and its chief executive officer Francisco Riordan for conducting activity related to commodity options transactions without complying with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations.” The landmark decision, the Commission said, marks “the first time that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities.”\n\nSince the controversial debut of the bitcoin, whose rather sullied past includes its usage in black markets and online drug trades, the CFTC has weighed the pros and cons of exercising jurisdiction over such cryptocurrency. Simultaneously, businesses and markets have debated whether or not bitcoins should be viewed as commodities, but with this latest CFTC ruling, it seems that both of these questions have been answered. With the increased regulations that seem to inevitably stem from the decision, the agency may be able to exercise considerably more control over how, when, and where bitcoins can be used.\n\nSo welcome to the big leagues, bitcoin.

Bitcoin has gained wide spread acceptance in the past few years. The technology powering bitcoin, better known as Blockchain technology has gained a lot of attention in the recent days due to its potential uses. Blockchain is a secure, transparent ledger that records all transactions occurring over the Bitcoin Network. Developers and researchers have found various other applications of Blockchain. Apart from being used as a ledger for cryptocurrencies, it can also be adopted to record and manage other forms of data as well.\n\nThe use of Blockchain in creating various applications that does not necessarily deal with the financial aspect of bitcoin has got its own name now. It is called Bitcoin 2.0 and there are various startups and individuals who have already created and launched such applications for use in diverse range of fields. Some of the notable applications are in banking, finance, intellectual property, medical records management, scientific research and more. Blockchain technology holds a lot of potential in scientific research. It can used for laboratory data management, powering scientific computing, managing patents and other IP related to research, publishing research journals and more.\n\nThere are a handful of such Blockchain based applications for use in scientific research and related applications.

If that is what Bitcoin users want, then they should keep the limit, and perhaps even decrease it. But if Bitcoin users want to be a payment system, then up it must go,” said Buterin.\n\nAnother important factor to consider according to Buterin, is the technological capability of the blockchain and the size of the blocks that can be supported. For example, increasing the blocksize to 8 mb could make the bitcoin blockchain eight times more vulnerable than it was before. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, BTCChina’s Mikael Wang explained that they will not be supporting bitcoin core developer Gavin Andresen’s proposal to increase the bitcoin blocksize to 8mb for the same reason. “What the Bitcoin community needs now is stability and growth, and we will not do anything to jeopardize this further,” said Wang.\n\nInstead of the BIPs proposed by the bitcoin core developers, Buterin suggested another method:\n\n“If you divorce the decision from its current political context and ask me “what is the optimal block size for a payments blockchain”, then I would say exactly what I’ve done for ethereum: target a limit equal to 1.5x the exponential moving average of the current block size (with perhaps 0.1% replacement per block.”\n\nTo present and review actual proposals for scaling Bitcoin, bitcoin startups, mining firms and core developers are set to participate in Bitcoin Scalability Workshops in Montreal Canada on September 12 -13.', 'Upon the interests of those that have awaited for the highly anticipated bitcoin debit cards of Xapo, the multi-million dollar startup has finally begun shipping its cards internationally.\n\nHowever, in correlation to its launch, Xapo has announced that the cards cannot be shipped to the United States, and cannot be used by its residents.\n\n“Unfortunately, Xapo cannot issue nor ship the Xapo Debit Card to users who reside in the following countries: United States Minor Outlying Islands Uzbekistan Vanuatu Venezuela Vietnam Virgin Islands, U.s.

No entanto, aos poucos, a moeda virtual vai perdendo a má fama e, mais estável, sendo utilizada não apenas para compras virtuais, mas também em lojas e hotéis. Confira um glossário preparado pela Snapcard com os termos mais usados no sistema e entenda melhor como o bitcoin funciona.\n\n\n\n1) Satoshi Nakamoto\n\n\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto é o nome do criador do bitcoin. Até aí tudo bem, um japonês com um QI acima da média. Mas, não. A verdade é que ninguém nunca viu Satoshi. Não se sabe nem ao menos se esse é o nome verdadeiro, um apelido ou se ele é realmente do Japão. O criador nunca veio a público se manifestar, deu entrevistas ou participou de programas de TV.\n\n\n\nBitcoins (Foto: Divulgação/FISL)\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Satoshi\n\n\n\nÉ a menor parte de um bitcoin. Um bitcoin é composto de cem milhões de satoshis.\n\n\n\n3) Bitcoin\n\n\n\nBitcoin é uma moeda virtual desenvolvida sob código aberto onde não está submetida a nenhum governo ou instituição financeira. Seu símbolo é o ? ou BTC. Todas as transações são armazenadas em um banco de dados disponível online.\n\n\n\n4) Blockchain\n\n\n\nBlockchain é o nome do banco de dados onde ficam armazenadas as transações. Funciona como uma espécie de contabilidade pública onde todo mundo consegue acessar o que está acontecendo. Com isso, o sistema mantém a transparência e evita fraudes, já que cada transação entre os usuários ficam gravadas e disponíveis.\n\n\n\n5) Mineração\n\n\n\nHá basicamente duas formas de se conseguir bitcoins: comprando com dinheiro real ou através da mineração. Como o nome sugere, a mineração funciona como um garimpo virtual. Apenas 50 blocos são lançados por vez e fragmentados pela rede. Encontrar esses fragmentos é muito difícil, exige um computador potente e paciência.\n\n\n\n6) Pool\n\n\n\nGrupo que se junta para minerar bitcoins. Um usuário sozinho pode demorar anos para achar um fragmento de bitcoin. Com a pool, é possível reduzir considerevalmente o tempo até dar resultado, já que mais computadores estarão trabalhando em conjunto.\n\n\n\nComo investir em bitcoins? Descubra no Fórum do Techtudo.\n\n\n\n7) Carteira de bitcoin\n\n\n\nSão empresas que organizam a compra e venda dos bitcoins, como se fosse uma casa de câmbio e um pouco parecido com os bancos. Com elas, além de poder comprar um bitcoin com dinheiro real e também é possível guardar a moeda. Elas também são responsáveis por fazer a intermediação entre as estabelecimentos que quiserem aceitar bitcoins como forma de pagamento. A taxa de administração chega a até 0,5%.\n\n\n\n8) Segurança\n\n\n\nPara manter as transações seguras, as empresas que funcionam como carteira de bitcoins utilizam uma senha única para cada usuário. Além disso as informações são criptografadas.\n\n\n\n9) Taxa de Hash\n\n\n\nÉ a quantidade de cálculos que a rede bitcoin está trabalhando. Quando a taxa de hash chega 10 Th/s, significa que ela pode processar 10 trilhões de cálculos por segundo.\n\n', 'Ralph Atkins in Zürich and Dan Dombey in London SEPTEMBER 21, 2015 4 Zurich Insurance has abandoned plans to buy the UK’s RSA group, saying it wanted to focus instead on rectifying a series of hits to its general insurance business. The Swiss insurer last month proposed a £5.6bn offer for the more than 300-year old RSA. But on Monday Zurich Insurance unexpectedly announced it was dropping the bid and issued a warning about losses from Chinese and US non-life businesses. Its decision, which took by surprise people close to RSA, triggered a sharp sell-off in the UK insurer’s shares. RSA shares fell 22 per cent in early trade to 399p while Zurich’s shares were 2.3 per cent lower at SFr256. Zurich Insurance revealed that Kristof Terryn, who takes over as head of its general insurance operations next month, would launch a review of the business after it incurred losses expected to reach about $275m on a series of explosions in August at a container storage station in the Port of Tianjin, China. In addition, Zurich Insurance warned that a review of its reserve positions relating mainly to US auto insurance policies would have a negative impact of $300m on the third-quarter results. “We feel obliged to solve issues in our own portfolio before we make an M&A transaction,” Martin Senn, Zurich Insurance’s chief executive told the Financial Times. Mr Terryn’s predecessor was Mike Kerner, an American executive who this month said he would step down to spend more time with his family, who had remained in the US. Overall, Zurich Insurance expected its general insurance business to report an operating loss of about $200m for the third quarter. “In the light of the deterioration in the general insurance performance, we have terminated the discussions about a possible offer for RSA,” said Zurich Insurance. Insurance deals are starting to make less sense Deals are looking either expensive or strategically unsound Read more The Swiss insurer’s explanations were “partially plausible”, said Stefan Schürmann, an analyst at Vontobel in Zürich. “But clearly Zurich was aware of a cautious view by the market about the deal”. A possible capital increase to fund the deal would also have become more expensive in recent weeks, he added. Zurich Insurance said results of its “due diligence” investigation into RSA had been in line with its expectations. “We had not found anything that would have prevented us from proceeding with the transaction,” the company said. But it wanted to focus management on taking action to prevent a repeat of the problems exposed in its general insurance operations. Some Zurich Insurance shareholders had questioned the price it had appeared willing to pay for RSA, which was pitched at a premium of about a quarter over RSA’s pre-bid market value. The Swiss group’s decision to drop its bid for RSA — led for the past 18 months by Stephen Hester, the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief — throws the future of the UK insurer into uncertainty. Mr Hester has made progress in his push to help RSA recover from a string of profit warnings. But the insurer still faces pressure from weak investment income and intense competition. Last year the activist Cevian Capital became RSA’s largest shareholder. RSA noted that Zurich had confirmed to it that “due diligence findings were in line with their expectations and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they had not found anything that would have prevented them from proceeding with the transaction on the terms announced”. RSA stressed that Zurich’s interest had been unsolicited and added that in the meantime it had announced the sale of its Latin America business, the principal outstanding piece of its strategic refocus programme. Zurich Insurance said it “remains committed” to achieving its financial targets for the 2014 to 2016 period, including a business operating profit after tax return on equity of between 12 and 14 per cent.

Marc Sapatin, Nguyen Lam, and Kyran Evans may have to face off against AT&T in court for allegedly installing malware on AT&T computer systems to unlock hundreds of thousands of AT&T-supported mobile phones.\n\nAlso read: NYDFS Going Soft? Symphony Allowed to Launch Despite Encryption Methods\n\nAT&T filed its complaint last week in at US District Court in Seattle, Washington. The mobile phone company has very strict unlocking policies, which it defends by claiming that its locked phones allows it to make devices cheaper for consumers and ensure revenue through long term contracts.\n\nTherefore, when AT&T found out that its employees played a part in an illegal unlocking scheme, it wanted to act fast. The mobile carrier claims that a company called Swift Unlocks worked with Sapatin, Lam, and Evans to install the malware programs in AT&T’s computer systems in order to unlock the phones. This scheme allegedly took place while the three AT&T employees worked at a Washington call center in 2013. After discovering the operation, AT&T fired Lam, while Sapatin and Evans resigned. The carrier believes that Swift Unlocks paid “at least” $20,000 USD to Evans, and “at least” $10,500 USD to Sapatin. AT&T has not accused Lam of receiving any payments from Swift Unlocks.\n\nIn addition to Sapatin, Lam and Evans, AT&T said that there were 50 “John Doe Defendants” with unknown names that developed the software used to gain access to the company’s computer systems.\n\nAT&T now seeks damages and injunctive relief from the defendants in this case. The mobile carrier also emphasized that the unlocking scheme did not compromise any customer information nor exert any negative effects on its customers.\n\nThis drama raises the question: why do we need mobile carriers at all? It would of course be much cheaper and efficient to buy phones directly from the manufacturers and connect directly to some non-proprietary cellular and data network. Unfortunately, though, things are not that simple. The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and only a select few firms are big enough to play by the regulators’ rules.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that decentralization and P2P technology can’t improve this ever-important sector of the economy. With the advent of technologies like meshnets and TOR-like networks, it is not too much of a stretch to envision a future where consumers do purchase phones straight from manufacturers rather than carriers. These phones would have have decentralized communications software pre-installed, or would connect to a node-based network styled after the Bitcoin network.\n\nCould decentralization improve the telecommunications industry?

09/21/2015,"['Bitcoin Ponzi scheme perpetrator Trendon Shavers has plead guilty to securities fraud, a decision that reverses plea of not guilty submitted in March.\n\nShavers faced up to 20 years in prison for defrauding investors out of an estimated $4.5m while operating Bitcoin Savings & Trust (BS&T). The investment scheme, which promised investors 7% returns on bitcoin market arbitrage activity in 2011 and 2012, became the object of a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry in July 2013.\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg, Shavers will now serve anywhere from 33 months to 41 months in prison as a result of the plea deal, and pay a $5m fine.\n\n“I know what I did was wrong and am very sorry,” Shavers said in a court hearing, according to the news source.\n\nShavers was ultimately found to be engaging in a Ponzi scheme whereby money from new investors was used to issue ""interest payments"" to new investors. Further, he exchanged bitcoin into US dollars to pay personal expenses, investigators found.\n\nAs a result of an initial inquiry, Shavers was forced to pay $40m in penalties for violating anti-fraud and securities laws in September of 2014. He was subsequently arrested again on criminal charges in November of that year.\n\nA 9th September filing in the case previously revealed that US Attorney Preet Bharara had postponed a pre-trial conference on the basis the parties were working toward an agreement.\n\nShavers is scheduled to be sentenced on 3rd February, 2016.\n\nFor more information, a full copy of the plea agreement can be found below.\n\nShavers Plea Agreement\n\nJustice image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He advises companies about bitcoin-related regulatory law and represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings. Here, he discusses a recent ruling by the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which saw it label bitcoin as a commodity.\n\nLast Thursday the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) settled charges against a small and now-defunct operation in San Francisco called Coinflip, which marketed bitcoin derivatives. In the process, the CFTC asserted for the first time that bitcoin is a “commodity”.\n\nWhat does that determination mean for the bitcoin ecosystem and what does this new kind of enforcement action portend for the future?\n\nFirst, before getting to the nitty-gritty, recall that in the crazy mixed-up world of overlapping American regulation, this determination means almost nothing for how other regulators treat bitcoin. The BitLicense, for example, will soldier on unaffected, as will other state regulators and FinCEN.\n\nThe formal classification probably does put to final rest the idea that ordinary bitcoins are securities, as Prof. Shadab told to CoinDesk last week, but the SEC has been acting that way for a long time.\n\nWhat the classification tells us about the CFTC\n\nAs an initial matter, it comes as no surprise that the CFTC is calling bitcoin a commodity. The CFTC had signaled its views on the subject nearly a year ago, and I wrote about its potential implications around the same time. Companies like TerraExchange have been working with the CFTC under the same presumption for even longer.\n\nTerraExchange and others have taken to heart the most obvious upshot of the CFTC’s classification, which is that, to legally run a market for bitcoin derivatives for US users, a company must first jump through a bunch of hoops with the CFTC. (For financial newbies, a financial derivative is essentially a contract to buy, sell, or pay, contingent upon the price of a something else.) Coinflip didn’t do this and the result was this recent enforcement action.\n\nMore broadly, the classification also now means it is more likely the CFTC could, under its market manipulation authority, police fraudulent activities on exchanges where bitcoins – and not just bitcoin derivatives – are traded.\n\nHowever, the CFTC has suggested it is not particularly interested in going down that path, and in fact there may be some limits on its ability to do so without a specific connection to commodities derivatives markets.\n\nThis leaves the primary impact of the enforcement action itself to be felt by companies like Coinflip, which offer bitcoin derivatives to users in the US.\n\nBefore getting to that, though, keep in mind the importance of bitcoin derivatives themselves.\n\nThe importance of bitcoin derivatives\n\nBitcoin derivatives provide the primary vehicle by which a holder can stabilize the fiat value of their bitcoins even when markets remain turbulent – if you’re not familiar with the concept, check out how you do this using a “costless collar”.\n\nThat’s a big deal when many complain bitcoin is not a dependable store of value. Using derivatives to stabilize value is awkward on a one-off basis, but commercialized and regularized through smart contracts, it gives holders the experience of owning bitcoins with a stable price, even when the market price for bitcoins continues to fluctuate.\n\n“The CFTC’s action is exactly the sum of its parts. Bitcoin is now officially a commodity.”\n\nAs for legal implications, the most pertinent message from the enforcement action itself is the CFTC’s signal that it will expend resources to shut down unregistered platforms, including very small ones.\n\nThe CFTC didn’t make any money on this settlement, as Coinflip didn’t have to pay a fine, and likely could not have afforded to pay a big one anyway. Likewise, Coinflip’s platform, Derivabit, apparently never had more than 400 users, which, even in the world of bitcoin, is still very small.\n\nIt is worth pointing out, as I’ve mentioned before, that non-US based companies who sell derivatives to US persons are subject to this same enforcement risk – though whether the CFTC will go so far as to conduct extraterritorial enforcement actions in this area is not obvious.\n\nLikewise, violation of any CFTC rule is, somewhat amazingly, punishable with jail time.\n\nHere, Coinflip cooperated with the CFTC, and the fact that they didn’t even pay a fine likely reflects this. (Recall, though, that while cooperation with an investigation is sometimes a good strategy, willy-nilly and lawyer-less discussion with government investigators almost never is.)\n\nStill, this enforcement action suggests that, without something more flagrant, criminal punishment for these types of offenses is not especially likely.\n\nIn the end, the takeaway is that the CFTC’s action is exactly the sum of its parts. Bitcoin is now officially a commodity.\n\nEven small unregistered sellers of bitcoin derivatives are wise to make plans to deal with potential enforcement actions.\n\nWashington DC image via Shutterstock\n\nThis is not legal advice, and is not intended to establish an attorney-client relationship.

Banks have sent letters to founders of Australian bitcoin exchanges, including Bit Trade and Buyabitcoin, informing them their accounts will be closed, without further explanation. It is understood at least 17 Australian bitcoin companies have received similar letters, with 13 already having their accounts closed. The letters, seen by The Australian Financial Review, were from Westpac Banking Corporation and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, but Ron Tucker, chairman of industry body The Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association, said all large Australian banks were shutting the door on bitcoin companies.\n\nRon Tucker, middle, with fellow executives of Bit Trade, which has had its account closed by Westpac. Lisa Maree Williams\n\nMr Tucker, who is also the founder of bitcoin exchange Bit Trade, said banks were refusing to explain why accounts were being closed, or discuss what could be done to address the problem.\n\n""Our members have been unable to obtain any formal clarification on the reasons for closure, except for references to policy or risk. Just what policies or risks these are have not been specified,"" he said. ""The industry is more than happy to talk to the banks about their concerns. However, neither the association nor its members have been given the opportunity."" A threat to industry The wave of closures threatens the viability of the wave of new financial services businesses springing up to disrupt the existing sector. In August a Senate committee found that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were becoming part of the mainstream, and that they should be recognised as a regular currency for Goods and Services Tax purposes.\n\nSenator Sam Dastyari says he is concerned there is an allegation that Australian banks are deliberately choking small businesses. Daniel Munoz\n\n""It is widely recognised that the banking sector could stand to be disrupted, as indicated in comments from Westpac\'s CEO two weeks ago. Companies in this industry are in the business of offering and developing cost-effective financial services for consumers and businesses,"" Mr Tucker said. ""However, should bitcoin companies be shut out of the Australian marketplace because of de-banking actions, this question will forever remain a hypothetical."" Last week it emerged that CBA was working with some of the world\'s biggest banks to turn the technology behind digital currencies into a safe way to transfer money around the world and potentially replace the cumbersome international money transfer system. Labor Senator Sam Dastyari, who chaired the Senate Economics References Committee into digital currency, said he was concerned by the banks\' actions and there appeared to be no clear justification for suddenly closing accounts.\n\nTony Pearson, acting chief executive of the Australian Bankers\' Association, says banks are obliged to close accounts if they can\'t see a full payments trail under AML/CTF laws.\n\n""I am concerned that there is an allegation that Australian banks are deliberately choking small businesses, while setting themselves up to offer the same services,"" Senator Dastyari said. ""We don\'t have a four-pillars policy to allow banks to guillotine emerging industries they are competing with … These small local digital currency companies are essentially competing to provide trading platforms, and develop emerging technologies."" A CBA spokesman said the bank was unable to comment on individual customers\' circumstances, but that it served each customer consistently on a case-by-case basis. Money laundering concerns\n\nWestpac also refused to discuss individual cases but alluded to the fact that compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws was an issue, rather than potential competition with bitcoin players. ""The current bitcoin operating model requires very tough compliance and assurance requirements to ensure we meet the high standards required under anti-money laundering regulations,"" a bank spokeswoman said. ""We continue to monitor developments in bitcoin, including their regulation."" Acting chief executive of the Australian Bankers\' Association Tony Pearson said banks were obliged to close accounts if they couldn\'t see a full payments trail under AML/CTF laws. He said the lack of transparency and regulatory oversight raised a number of risks for users and also posed risks for the payments system. ""Given the risks, there is a need for a clear and settled legal and regulatory framework for digital currencies,"" Mr Pearson said.', 'Will Bitcoin go away?\n\nThat’s the question that digital currency experts debated Monday at a conference in San Francisco hosted by tech news site TechCrunch. The digital currency, which first began to gain attention in 2009, has been called both a fad and the next big thing to happen to money and finance.\n\n“I think it could,” Nathaniel Popper, a New York Times reporter and author of the recently published Bitcoin book, Digital Gold, said about Bitcoin’s potential demise.\n\nWences Casares, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin wallet and vault service Xapo, agreed, adding: “I can imagine a couple of ways in which Bitcoin might fail.”\n\nBut Bobby Lee, co-founder and CEO of China-based Bitcoin exchange BTCC, talked up Bitcoin as being nearly immortal. He pointed to only one scenario under which it could die.\n\n“If any of you think the Internet might go away, then Bitcoin might go away,” he said, emphasizing the digital currency’s independence from centralized powers. Of course, as the owner of an exchange for the currency, Lee has a huge stake in Bitcoin’s longevity.\n\nAnd in some ways, Lee is right. Bitcoin is a database processing technology that only needs computers to run its software and to communicate with each other to keep it alive. As long as there are Internet connections and a desire to use Bitcoin, it will be around.\n\nAnd yet, for Popper, the real question is a bit different, and one the Bitcoin industry has been grappling with for some time.\n\n“To me this debate that we’re having right here is the debate of whether Bitcoin matters or whether the technology that Bitcoin introduced is going to matter,” Popper said.\n\nHere, Popper is referring to the block chain, the shared ledger of transactions all computers use to mark Bitcoin transactions they make. Several companies, and now even major banks, are looking at ways to harness the block chain outside of Bitcoin. Many are looking at how it can help with escrow by, for example, holding and disbursing funds only when certain conditions are fulfilled. Many in the finance sector have been weary of Bitcoin’s price volatility, but see the block chain as a promising technology.\n\nBut this brought out the final question of the day, about whether the block chain, not Bitcoin, will have the biggest impact on financial services. Unconvinced, Casares was quick to point out that shared databases—what he says the block chain really is—have long existed. Yet Popper argued that block chain is still the first shared database that is truly open and free for anybody to join, unlike shared systems that organizations have used in the past. Moreover, as a ledger of all transactions, it holds participants accountable because it publicly tracks all users’ activities.\n\nSubscribe to Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin’s fate, watch this Fortune video:', 'Bitcoin is now officially a commodity according to U.S. regulators, Bloomberg Business reports .

So when they find a small one-man startup they can’t resist giving themselves work to do – so they go in and whack it, especially in California.”\n\nHeard added that he is not terribly surprised and not terribly worried.\n\n“I think the CFTC has a very weak case here and it’s a very creative reinterpretation of what the word commodity means,” he said. “The ruling will be challenged, and judges will apply common sense and decide it to be a currency.”\n\nSome commentators said that compliance with the Commodity Exchange Act and applicable CFTC regulations would be too costly for many Bitcoin startups, with the predictable result that many innovative U.S. companies will be forced to move offshore.\n\nOthers, in agreement with Hearn, noted that the CFTC claim is inconsistent with related decisions by regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries.\n\nJournalist David Seaman summarized the situation in a tweet : “To commodities regulators, Bitcoin is a commodity. To bank regulators, it’s a bank. To stock regulators, it’s a stock. Everyone wants ‘in.’”', 'The US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) has published a patent filed by US financial services giant Bank of America that seeks to protect a system for wire transfers using cryptocurrency technology.\n\nThe patent, filed on 17th March, 2014, and published 17th September, seeks to protect a system by which electronic funds could be sent between customer accounts using the underlying blockchain of a given cryptocurrency as the rails for payment.\n\nThe system described, for example, would enable customer funds to be converted at a cryptocurrency exchange and then sent to a second cryptocurrency exchange to be converted into a foreign currency before the value is moved to a recipient.\n\nSpeaking to the goal of the invention described, authors Thomas Edward Durbin and James Gregory Ronca write:\n\n""Enterprises handle a large number of foreign wire transfer requests on a daily basis. As technology advances, foreign transactions have become more common. For some customers, it may be desirable to conduct a foreign wire transfer in less time than what current foreign wire transfer systems allow.""\n\nDurbin and Ronca suggest that such a system would be designed to ""bypass"" traditional wire transfer services, ""reducing dependency on third-party networks"" and ""increasing the reliability of fund transfers"".\n\n""Initiating fund transfers using cryptocurrency allows for the technical effect of conducting a foreign fund transfer in less time than a foreign fund transfer currently, as it avoids delays that may be caused by relying on third-party systems and services,"" the filing continues.\n\nFurther, it suggests that fund transfers using cryptocurrency would reduce the need to transfer customer information to a ""third-party system"", thereby ""increasing control and security of customer data"" during such transactions.\n\nWhile the filing uses the term ""cryptocurrency"" generally throughout, it does name bitcoin, litecoin, Ripple and dogecoin as specific examples.\n\nRepresentatives from Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAssessing need\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of the filing is the way in which it envisions the method by which cryptocurrency would be selected as the preferred option for transmitting funds.\n\nFor example, Bank of America states that its transaction module may choose from a number of available cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges based on factors such as price and market volatility.\n\n""For example, transaction module 136 may choose a particular cryptocurrency exchange because the cryptocurrency is priced favorably (eg, cheap if purchasing, expensive if selling) or because the cryptocurrency exchange has a relationship with the enterprise,"" the filing reads.\n\nOKCoin, Bitstamp, BTCC (formerly BTC China), Cryptsy, CoinMarket and Justcoin (since purchased by ANX) are named as examples of cryptocurrency exchanges that could be used.\n\nThe filing goes on to state that the module would seek to initiate the buying and selling of cryptocurrency near simultaneously in an effort to facilitate a cost-effective transfer.\n\nA separate module would then initiate the transfer of funds, handling the security aspects of the transaction.\n\nFor more information, read the full filing here.\n\nImage credit: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Anyone with a computer and Internet connection can plug into the network and participate. That is where its most promising potential lies.\n\nAs the Internet was allowed to flourish by limiting government’s hand on the underlying protocol and its development, so too should Bitcoin.\n\nFor years, Bitcoin sat at the fringes of the technology landscape as developers and users worked to improve its functionality and further its reach. Bitcoin start-ups and the larger digital currency ecosystem have gone mainstream, receiving major venture capital investments from the New York Stock Exchange, Andreessen Horowitz, Goldman Sachs and others. Nasdaq is experimenting with trading assets on the blockchain, and Citibank is reportedly developing its own in-house digital currency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Coinbase was specifically chosen by the exchange because of its commitments to transparency, security and regulatory compliance in the Bitcoin market.\n\nBut like other areas, we have to strike the right balance between helpful rules that protect and sustain progress and those that will stifle innovation and economic growth. Indeed, platforms like Coinbase are already carrying out robust protections required by third parties like the N.Y.S.E., illustrating their commitment to consumer protection and security.\n\nCalls to impose burdensome regulations on Bitcoin wallet platforms in an effort to stamp out illicit uses would do almost nothing to solve the root problem. The only real result of such regulation would be to make it more difficult for the Bitcoin wallets to serve all of the legal participants who simply wish to take advantage of the technology’s ability to facilitate frictionless transactions between parties.\n\nSuch an outcome would be tragic, especially given that the industry is poised for explosive growth. With a few million regular users, and a vast amount of untapped potential, Bitcoin is well positioned to lead a cultural shift that results in more globalized markets and new business models.\n\nIt is essential that policy makers give careful consideration to a balanced approach when determining the most effective regulatory solutions for the platform. For example, government regulators should continue to focus on the connections between physical and digital currency and shun any attempts to force modification or regulation of the underlying protocol itself.\n\nMeaningful, light-touch rules that create necessary safeguards for users are a welcome addition to the evolving Bitcoin ecosystem, but we must not inadvertently stifle the growth and innovation of the service we seek to regulate. When it comes to Bitcoin, we simply can’t afford it."", 'Visa, Capital One, JP Morgan.\n\nWhile it may be expected that the world\'s leading financial firms would be interested in bitcoin and blockchain tech given its association with currency, the technology\'s range of potential use cases is attracting perhaps more surprising names.\n\nFor example, Verizon Ventures, the venture capital arm of US telecommunications giant Verizon, recently invested in Filament, a Nevada-based startup seeking to use the bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum to enable Internet of Things (IoT) devices to both be tracked, and to transact, on a public ledger system.\n\nThe investment was Verizon Ventures\' first in the industry, but according to director Ed Ruth, it\'s unlikely it will be the last. Ruth believes blockchain tech has the ability to solve problems facing technology applications in the IoT and beyond.\n\nIn an interview, Ruth indicated Verizon Ventures had been studying bitcoin for a year without much interest, but it was the larger implications of the blockchain, the digital currency\'s distributed ledger, that changed his mind about the available opportunities.\n\nRuth told CoinDesk:\n\n""As we started looking at the protocol, it became apparent that blockchain had a bigger potential than the specific bitcoin or cryptocurrency use case. We started to see some convergence around Internet of Things, and we started to seek out companies leveraging the technology.""\n\nWhile he suggested the use of cryptographic tokens as digital currency might find a fit in the third world, Ruth suggested the firm doesn\'t believe this use case is as compelling in developed markets like the US.\n\nStill, Ruth cautioned that his firm doesn\'t have an operating thesis on the technology, calling it a ""living and breathing"" project, adding that Verizon is paying attention to all aspects of the developing technology.\n\n""I think the market is incredibly nascent,"" he continued, ""but we\'re interested and paying attention and we\'re learning through companies we\'re investing in.""\n\nOne of the largest cell phone carriers in the US, Verizon generated $87.6bn in wireless revenues in 2014, and boasts 6.6 million Internet subscribers.\n\nAll in on IoT\n\nRuth explained that, while Verizon Ventures is interested in blockchain tech, it\'s still a very general interest. As such, it was Filament\'s use of the technology for IoT, he said, that made the startup a compelling investment.\n\n""We think of IoT as an extended new vertical for network infrastructure. We know it\'s going to be the backbone for a lot of the data that needs to transact in the cloud for smart cities, fleet management, and so on and so forth,"" he explained.\n\nFilament, he recently wrote, stood out for the way it combined IoT technology with its use of end-to-end encryption and ability to ""securely collect and consolidate data"" with its devices. The startup is set to release two devices in Q4 of this year, both of which advertise an ability to securely communicate, execute smart contracts and send microtransactions.\n\nRuth said IoT has become a bigger point of emphasis for Verizon as it has recently sought to expand beyond telecommunications. For example, he noted Verizon\'s recent acquisition of AOL saw it entering the media business.\n\n""We\'ve been traditionally a telco company and about a year and a half two years ago, we transitioned into a technology company,"" he continued. ""I think IoT is a means by which we can transform ourselves.""\n\nCautious approach\n\nDespite a heavy focus on IoT, Ruth said he does believe blockchain tech will impact other verticals, though he\'s not sure exactly which will be affected.\n\nFor example, he suggested there may be use cases for digital currency in financial services and shared databases in regards to roaming agreements, where Verizon will extend voice and data services to customers by way of a local telecom partner.\n\nWhile Orange Telecom has honed in on the former use case for extending financial services, Ruth said the model doesn\'t quite make sense for Verizon yet given its US focus.\n\n""For emerging markets, it\'s a bigger value than in stable markets with stable currencies,"" Ruth continued. ""Our initial thinking was that it didn\'t solve a large enough problem domestically.""\n\nGoing forward, Ruth predicts bitcoin and blockchain tech will continue to garner attention from major brands, given the support and capital leading VC firms such as Andreessen Horowitz have already extended.\n\nStill, he said incumbent companies are likely to be cautious as they explore the tech, concluding:\n\n""I think a lot of companies have been looking at bitcoin and blockchain for at least as long as we have. But, when you\'re a big company and you\'re publicly traded, it takes you a little bit longer to make those choices.""\n\nVerizon image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In reality, majority mining power is what drives adoption of new versions of the Bitcoin software, taking the approval mechanism out of the hands of Bitcoin users and putting into the hands of the mining pools.\n\nThis Bitcoin development consensus mechanism provides lose oversight over the developers, but ultimately they have final control over what features they choose to add to the protocol.\n\n“If you go back in history, it was really simple. It was whatever Satoshi decided at the beginning. That’s really where we started. We had one source code. We had one [pseudonymous] person who made all the decisions about what should Bitcoin be, how should it evolve, and what should it do,” says Bitcoin Chief Scientist, Gavin Andresen.\n\n“As soon as Satoshi stepped back and threw the project onto my shoulders, one of the first things I did was try to decentralize that. So, if I get hit by a bus, it would be clear that the project would go on. That’s why, at this point, there are five people who have commit access to the GitHub Bitcoin source tree. And there’s kind of this consensus process for what changes are made to the code — and even what consensus-level, low-level changes to the Bitcoin rules should happen,” Andresen continued.\n\nWith other types of open source software, such as Linux, if users disagree with the path the developers take, they can take the code and fork it, adding whatever features they desire into their version. Then users can choose which version of the software they would rather run. This forking mechanism is possible with Bitcoin as well, but since it is a financial network worth Billions, forking is a much riskier endeavor than with other open source projects.\n\nForking the network can result in financial loss for those sending/receiving transactions when it occurs, as well as splitting the network into two weaker competing networks that may be more susceptible to attack. A two network situation would most likely not last long, as one network should take over the other relatively quickly, but it is a less than ideal situation. Put simply, if a Bitcoin fork can be avoided, then it should be.\n\nIf you go back in history, it was really simple. It was whatever Satoshi decided at the beginning. That’s really where we started. We had one source code. We had one [pseudonymous] person who made all the decisions about what should Bitcoin be, how should it evolve, and what should it do. — Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin Chief Scientist\n\nCurrently, the Bitcoin community is at a crossroads, many users wish to raise the capacity of the network, while the main developers want to keep it at it’s current capacity of 1MB every 10 minutes until they can all agree on a solution. As a result of perceived developer inaction, two main developers have chosen to create a fork of the Bitcoin software that implements an increase against the wishes of the majority of developers.\n\nUsers now have the choice of running Bitcoin Core or the new forked version, Bitcoin XT. Bitcoin XT is designed to require a threshold of users before it’s forking capacity increase is implemented. If 75% of miners choose to run XT, then 2 weeks later the capacity increases will begin, resulting at that point in an incompatibility with Bitcoin Core.\n\n“I think a lot of the strife and conflict comes with — we’re starting to grow beyond even that to there are a lot more stakeholders, there are a lot more people involved, there are a lot more projects,” Andresen says. “How do we evolve from — it used to just be Satoshi making decisions to it was this small group making decisions to suddenly there’s a much larger set of people who are interested in decisions and how they’re made.”\n\nAll the developers agree that the strategy of forking the main software is less than ideal, but where they disagree is that both sets of developers feel that they are acting in the best interests of Bitcoin users. As a result, the solution to this disagreement lies in the same principles that govern corporations, a vote by stakeholders weighted by their respective stakes.\n\nHow do we evolve from — it used to just be Satoshi making decisions; to it was this small group making decisions; to suddenly there’s a much larger set of people who are interested in decisions and how they’re made. — Gavin Andresen - Bitcoin Chief Scientist\n\nCryptoVoter is an open-source block chain voting client that enables Bitcoin users to place votes transparently based on how much bitcoin they own. CryptoVoter requires no changes to the existing Bitcoin codebase and can be implemented immediately.\n\nVoting requires no trusted third parties and is completely decentralized, allowing anybody to audit the voting results using a block chain explorer. Vote results are non-binding so devs still have the ultimate say, but now everyone would objectively know coinholder sentiment. Furthermore, throughout the entire process a user’s bitcoin remains fully under their own control, with their private keys never leaving their local computer.\n\nCryptoVoter enables Bitcoin users to vote on any topic based on the amount of bitcoin they own. Specifically, the software will enable bitcoin owners to express their opinion on what course of action the developers should take regarding the current block size debate.\n\nThis is comparable to shareholder voting in public companies, where shareholder votes are based on the number of shares owned by a particular individual. If the concept works for thousands of corporations worldwide then it should work for Bitcoin’s governance.\n\n“The current Bitcoin and cryptocoin governance model emphasizes developer and mining pool consensus, while leaving Bitcoin holders out with no real say,” says Jim Joseph, chief executive of Blockchain Innovation Labs. “We developed CryptoVoter to change that by giving bitcoin holders a public voice in the development debates and provide the mandate developers need to implement controversial changes. By shifting the concentration of power away from developers and mining pools, CryptoVoter hopes to empower Bitcoin holders and strengthen the blockchain along the way.”\n\nCryptoVoter’s voting client and code launched on September 14th and will go through approximately a one month test period holding development votes on a smaller cryptocurrency’s block chain before hosting the first Bitcoin block size-related vote on October 23.\n\nThe company hopes that by releasing the voting client as open-source the community will join in testing and evaluating the voting client before the first Bitcoin vote is conducted to address any issues that may have slipped past them during alpha-testing.\n\nCryptoVoter will enable truly decentralized Bitcoin governance that will allow the network to grow over time and integrate new features. Bitcoin strives to be a global independent currency and store of value, for it to succeed it will need a decentralized governance system where all stakeholders have a voice.\n\nFeatured Image: Russell Werges']"
09/22/2015,"['As an early adopter of the internet (I got AOL in 1993), I have watched with fascination as Bitcoin has become more and more popular: with the media, with users, and especially with investors. I have my doubts about the future of Bitcoin, but the technology is unquestionably one of the most interesting social experiments in human history.\n\nFor those that don\'t know, Bitcoin is something called a ""cryptocurrency"", a form of digital, decentralized money. It is often associated with illegal activity but there are a growing number of organizations and professionals who are beginning to investigate its potential.\n\nPublicly-traded Overstock.com, the New York Stock Exchange, Expedia, and dozens of other Fortune 500 companies have publicly expressed interest in Bitcoin, and a reported $900 million has been invested into Bitcoin-related startups this year.\n\nThis rapid growth has been met with serious resistance from select governments around the world. While countries like the United Kingdom have passed favorable legislation, the United States has treated it with much more hostility.\n\nNew York, the financial capitol of the U.S., recently passed a law that specifically targets Bitcoin companies called the Bitlicense. Almost immediately, twelve of the top companies in the industry shut down services to New York residents.\n\nThen, last week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) made the public determination that Bitcoin would be classified as a commodity, which caused an uproar across the community.\n\nBitcoin forums have been bombarded with heated conversation about this development and major Bitcoin companies have begun to release official statements. A Bitcoin company that specializes in edge security, San Diego-based Airbitz, drafted a letter that was sent to every Senator, Congressman, and Governor in the United States warning of the dangers of over-regulating Bitcoin.\n\nThe letter which they announced on their Facebook page draws a comparison between today\'s Bitcoin regulations and the Red Flag Acts that were passed in the 1800s that many believe damagingly over-regulated the British auto industry and permanently set it behind the rest of the world.\n\nThis letter raises the increasingly relevant question: what will happen to the United States if they continue to over-regulate innovative technologies?\n\nTechnologies like drones and Bitcoin are facing continued regulatory scrutiny and many entrepreneurs are packing up and taking their businesses elsewhere. Do you think the U.S. is over-regulating emerging technologies?', 'A 33-year-old Texan man pleaded guilty to running a Ponzi scheme involving bitcoins, making it the first ever U.S. criminal fraud case related to the cryptocurrency.\n\nTexas native Trendon Shavers has admitted to operating a Ponzi scheme running $4.5 million worth of bitcoins, Reuters reports.\n\nShavers aka “pirateat40” while online, was arrested in November, a couple of months after being ordered to pay $40.7 million in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit related to the Ponzi case.\n\nThe case is a milestone, with prosecutors noting that it is the first U.S. criminal securities fraud case related to Bitcoin.\n\n“I know what I did was wrong, and I’m very sorry,” – Shavers said while being prosecuted in court.\n\nIn a plea deal, Shavers agreed not to appeal against any sentence at or below 41 months in prison.\n\nThe Quick Con\n\nShavers started his company, Bitcoin Savings & Trust in 2011 and used it to offer promises of high rewards to investors over the Internet by collecting bitcoins.\n\nThe con? A return of one percent interest, every three days. In other words, a staggering seven percent per week.\n\nMost of the bitcoins collected duly went back to paying initial and older investors, making it the classic Ponzi scheme.\n\nNot one for subtlety, Shavers used the remaining bitcoins after the payout to splurge on a used BMW M5 sedan, a $1000 Las Vegas steakhouse dinner and plenty of outings to Las Vegas spas and casinos. At the very height of his scheme, prosecutors said Shavers controlled nearly 7 percent of the bitcoins in public circulation and had misappropriated about 146,000 bitcoins in total. The Ponzi scheme is confirmed to have caused 48 investors to incur losses.\n\nShavers accumulated over 750,000 bitcoins, worth over $4.5 million in comparing the average price of bitcoin between September 2011 to September 2012.\n\nA prosecutor in the case, Michael Ferrara, revealed that Shavers had also invested some of the amassed bitcoins with the now-obsolete Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox. Most of the bitcoins, however, went straight back into the pool of returns to pay back and appease early investors.\n\nIn other words, he had the telltale signs of a Ponzi scheme, confirmed Ferrara.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Pixabay.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin traders accuse Australia\'s biggest banks of declaring war on cryptocurrencies\n\nUpdated\n\nDozens of Australian Bitcoin traders have accused the country\'s biggest banks of refusing to do business with them in an effort to shutdown the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ and the National Australia Bank are among the financial institutions that have been named and shamed by Bitcoin traders, who have spoken of their experiences for the first time.\n\nMichaela Juric, 22, has been trading the virtual currency Bitcoin for two and a half years.\n\nRecently her business bitcoin-babe.com has come under threat because the country\'s biggest banks refused to do business with her.\n\n""I\'ve been blacklisted from Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Westpac, St George, Bank of Melbourne, Bank SA, Bank of Queensland, Rams and BT Superfund.\n\n""I can\'t open or hold any accounts with those institutions because I deal with Bitcoin,"" she said.\n\nMs Juric believes banks see Bitcoin as a threat, and she claims to know at least 50 other traders in Australia who have been through the same thing.\n\nThe banking institutions frankly see a lot of this as a threat.

Some analysts, Lee said, even believe the currency may bottom out at zero — a figure he doubts, yet doesn’t rule out either.\n\nMaking matters worse is another troubling notion about what might happen if Bitcoin’s slump continues. In his remarks, Casares said there is a very real scenario where Silicon Valley’s tech companies stop providing services for Bitcoin in favor of more lucrative business models. Bitcoin needs infrastructure to work, and this infrastructure means apps, financial platforms and support from traditional banking institutions.\n\n“I would say that I’m the most biased Bitcoin person I can imagine, the most pro-Bitcoin person I can imagine,” Casares said. “And even then, I always tell people that they shouldn’t own an amount of Bitcoin they can’t afford to lose because I think there is a non-trivial chance that that amount goes to zero.”\n\nLee said the tragedy in Bitcoin’s possible demise would be the missed opportunity to benefit from an independent monetary system that relies on an unbiased code base, as opposed to typical currencies that rely on government management and consumer perceptions.\n\nDespite this, the three unanimously endorse the idea that blockchain, the coding framework behind Bitcoin, would likely never go away. As a transactional database synced among all of its users, blockchain could be repurposed for other uses like personal identification or varieties of digital record keeping. And the state of Vermont has asked a coalition of stakeholders to consider whether the technology could help manage state records. Similarly, Popper suggested that blockchain could be a foundation for iteration. Bitcoin, the three agreed, could be the predecessor of a more successful currency, rebranded and ubiquitously accepted by major financial institutions.\n\nWhatever the case, Lee said he and other advocates of the service believe the system has fundamentally changed the concept of monetization. Lee likened its transparency and innovation to the beginning of the World Wide Web.\n\n“It will matter for sure!” Lee said. “Bitcoin is not going to go away in the same way the Internet is not going to go away.”\n\n\n\nThis story was originally published by Government Technology."", 'Bitcoin services firm Coinbase has filed nine patent applications with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n\nThe USPTO – the agency responsible for issuing patents to investors and businesses as well as registering product and intellectual property trademarks – received the submissions on 17th March this year.\n\nAccording to the filings, published this month, Coinbase submitted patent applications for various products including a hot bitcoin wallet, an instant exchange (which the company launched in June), a bitcoin exchange, a bitcoin tipping button alongside two off- and on-blockchain transaction systems.\n\nAlthough published by the USPTO, Coinbase\'s applications are still pending approval, a process which Eitan Jankelewitz, a solicitor at London-based law firm Sheridans, said can take years.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The process seeks to establish that the invention is patentable (some things, such as abstract ideas, aren\'t patentable). Then the \'novelty\' of the invention is considered – if the invention was known/or available to the public, it won\'t be patentable.

South African bitcoin exchange BitX , which also operates in Nigeria, recently partnered with mobile payment and smartcard company Zazoo to enable bitcoin use via the virtual prepaid MasterCard app, VCpay.\n\n""Bitcoins are becoming increasingly popular in Nigeria,"" said Victor Munis, a partner at international law and arbitration firm TRPLAW, via email. ""A good number of Nigerians are using bitcoins for their day-to-day transactions. Private companies sell bitcoins to interested persons. Retailers are beginning to accept bitcoins as payment for goods and services.""\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria, meanwhile, has indicated its intention to regulate bitcoin use in the country. The deputy governor of CBN’s Financial System Stability unit, Joseph Nnanna, told a recent financial community conference that regulating virtual currencies will protect customers and investors, maintain the stability of the financial system and deter the potential use of bitcoin for money laundering and terrorist financing. The cloak of anonymity that bitcoin payments offer has made it useful to transact illegal business. For example, the Silk Road underground online marketplace took payment in bitcoins.\n\nMunis agreed that regulating bitcoin transactions is necessary.\n\n""Setting up the appropriate regulatory framework will not only regulate its use but also give legitimacy to bitcoin transactions in Nigeria,"" Munis said, ""The intention of the CBN to do so is a welcome development.""\n\nThough a growing number of Nigerians use bitcoins regularly to acquire items online, many are afraid to use it because of its instability.\n\n""Volatility does not inspire most of them to put their hard-earned money"" into bitcoins,\n\nsaid Tim Akinbo, CEO of Nigeria-based TimbaObjects, which develops mobile and Web apps. Those who do use bitcoins tend to do so for quick transactions, to minimize risk from rapid fluctuations in the value of the virtual currency.\n\nThe situation is however not unique to Nigeria, according to TRPLAW\'s Munis. ""Another country which has a notable use of bitcoins is South Africa,"" Munis said. ""There are a number of bitcoin exchanges there. However, the South African Reserve Bank as well as its financial institutions are reluctant to accept bitcoin use. The situation may change in the future due to increasing use.""\n\nAnother Bitcoin Africa Conference is scheduled for next March, following its inaugural edition in South Africa. The country also has a dedicated academy, the Bitcoin Academy, that offers courses on bitcoin basics as well as blockchain-based application development. The blockchain is a public database of transactions that can be modified by users.\n\nRegulation will ""protect the consumer and weed out all the bad players"" and ""give businesses (and investors) a lot more clarity and confidence in what can be done in the space, which in turn will attract more capital and innovation to the sector,"" said the head of business development and growth at South Africa’s BitX, Werner van Rooyen, in email. Meanwhile, ""all serious bitcoin companies (at least those who want to be around for more than the next few years) self-regulate by mirroring the KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) set in place for other financial institutions,"" he said.\n\nVan Rooyan noted that BitX has already started to build a compliance framework, working closely with governments, regulators and financial institutions, focusing on adopting financial community best practices.\n\n""We encourage a pragmatic approach that aims to balance the innovative potential of the technology whilst mitigating the key risks,"" van Rooyan said. ""This allows businesses and startups the opportunity to grow, learn and explore the new terrain without overly burdensome regulation.""\n\nAs an example of a practical approach, van Rooyan noted that some financial sector regulators adopt a ""sandbox"" approach, allowing regulation to kick in only once a certain size threshold -- such as number of users, or transaction volumes -- is met. He also suggested that the New York BitLicense Regulatory Framework and the now-dormant California Bitcoin Regulation Bill be studied for guidance. The California bill has been shelved, at least temporarily, but New York on Tuesday issued its first BitLicense.\n\nWith Unicef now accepting virtual currencies as donations and Barclays becoming the first U.K. bank to help charities accept bitcoin payments, there is an increasing need to regulate virtual currencies in parts of Africa where these and other multinational organizations have strong networks.\n\nBanks across the world have been exploring bitcoin, trying to determine the potential uses for the digital currency and its underlying blockchain technology. The move by Barclays, with operations in 14 countries across Africa, could bring bitcoin into the mainstream as the bank stated that it has the ""potential to change financial services.""\n\nIn addition, a Commonwealth of Nations working group made up of Australia, Barbados, Kenya, Nigeria, Singapore and Tonga agreed after meeting International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials in London last month that virtual currencies could benefit member states and drive development. While recognizing that virtual currencies pose some risks, the group urged Commonweath members to ""consider the applicability of their existing legal frameworks to virtual currencies and where appropriate they should consider adapting them or enacting new legislation to regulate virtual currencies.""\n\nWith 18 African members, The Commonwealth Secretariat will create a digital repository of best practices and model regulations as part of an effort to assist members in developing policy.', 'The story of Bitcoin is a cloudy but mostly American fairy tale about a global currency that doesn’t even really exist to many since it lives only on one’s computer. While no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, it is believed that Satoshi primarily spoke and worked on Bitcoin in English, resided on the West coast, and refined his protocol with the late Hal Finney over six years ago.\n\nYet just 2 years ago, China began to get a taste of the wonders of Bitcoin, and it blew the roof off of the small, but growing market, driving prices to over US$1,100 within a season.\n\nChina’s love-hate relationship\n\nAmericans had never had that level of fervor for Bitcoin as a new currency/investment because Americans have been so privileged as to have the global reserve currency as their national currency. Bitcoin is just a cute speculative investment for Americans. A digital toy to play with, something to day trade with friends.\n\nFor anyone outside of the U.S., it can represent much, much more. The average Chinese investor quickly saw a decentralized currency not manipulated by the People`s Bank of China as a wonderful thing and acted on it. The average American should be just as intrigued by an innovative, sound money-based currency that appreciates over time, but being spoiled has its demerits, too.\n\nAfter a torrid second half of 2013, the Chinese government got wind of the financial shift in the markets and countered by making bitcoin persona non grata when it came to banking and regulatory authority. Banks could not hold bitcoin or open any business or personal accounts related to the currency. Bitcoin rallies and conferences were censored by the totalitarian state to keep a lid on Bitcoin\'s publicity and level of interest nationwide.\n\nCoupled with the Mt. Gox collapse, this started a financial market crash that only now bitcoin is starting to recover from. Even as the United States of America slowly turns into The Police States of America, China is way ahead of The West when it comes to restricting freedoms of its people.\n\nYet, in 2014, the state took a step back. According to highly successful Chinese miners covered by Vice’s Motherboard, who control a large chunk of the global Bitcoin mining market, state restrictions on Bitcoin either eased or were navigated around. The state no longer saw Bitcoin as a decentralized threat upon the national currency, the Yuan, but just an online commodity to be traded. Throughout 2014 until the current day, China has increased and maintained a massive market share in Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to reports from Western financial powerhouse Goldman Sachs, around 80% of all Bitcoin was traded in Chinese Yuan at the end of 2014. China has maintained more than 50% of the global Bitcoin market ever since Q4 of 2013 when Bitcoin prices exploded almost overnight.\n\nWith this chart, you can see that Bitcoin was almost exclusively a US Dollar investment from the beginning, but the US Dollar has faded fast since China got on board with the digital currency concept.\n\nIs this level of Chinese mining and Yuan exchange currency dominance a good thing for Bitcoin?\n\nYou can look at it from two different perspectives. Having one billion people potentially investing in Bitcoin could accelerate its global adoption, influencing the rest of the world to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Or not so good, since China is a well-established and highly restrictive totalitarian regime that makes the growing ""Police State"" in the U.S. look like a Cub Scout meeting.\n\nYou can see a potential downside since if the People’s Bank of China, which is directly run and managed by the Chinese government, has dropped the hammer on Bitcoin investors and owners before, they can do it again.\n\nAmerica’s ‘laissez-faire’\n\nAt least in the U.S., the government has carried a ""laissez-faire"" approach to Bitcoin due to corporate business interest and a need for tax revenue. American greed and fascism have gone a long way in protecting Bitcoin in the West. Also, American legislation has defended Bitcoin well. The Citizens United Case has made the legal precedent of money as a form of speech and information, which has huge ramifications for Bitcoin.\n\nIf the U.S. Government wants to ban Bitcoin, they risk creating a solid legal precedent that Bitcoin is money and is a legal form of information and speech in accordance with Constitutional law and current legal constructs. That road is a very dangerous one to travel and well-funded Bitcoin venture capitalists could win this battle, something that the Americans powers that be are aware of.\n\nPlus, bitcoin is used in religious tithings as donations and there are many American laws protecting the freedom of religion. Furthermore, politicians also have little incentive to attack it, as they can now legally get donations in bitcoin via a judgment by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). So why close a potential long-term stream of income? Politicians always love getting bought off so bitcoin is here to stay as far as America is concerned, while Bitcoin’s free market capitalism isn’t going anywhere soon.\n\nDifferent use-cases\n\nBanks around the world are now building their own blockchains and western venture capitalists are investing heavily in “the future of money.” Slowly and quietly, Bitcoin is not only changing how the world does business, but also how China does mining. The Bitcoin currency investment and mining have to come from somewhere, and that place is currently China.\n\nThe West sees the business potential, but the Chinese see the currency’s potential. ZeroHedge has gone over how Bitcoin is a great way to maneuver around Chinese state capital controls, allowing well-heeled Chinese to invest in valuable foreign markets like American real estate.\n\nAs states look for more and more control over the failing global financial markets, Bitcoin offers too many answers to these problems for the consumer. As long as people want to be free to invest worldwide and don’t want to be controlled by pick-a-government-regime, Bitcoin will be a viable path to economic freedom.\n\nRight now, the Chinese see Bitcoin’s decentralized value much more clearly, and it is the Western markets looking to catch up in the race to the world’s much more advanced economic future.', 'A major European banking trade group has called for governments and businesses to develop regulatory solutions for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe European Banking Federation (EBF), a group representing thousands of the continent\'s largest banking groups, recently released its vision for a digital revamp of the banking system. Included in its proposals are several recommendations to policymakers regarding bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nThe group points to the blockchain as an innovation that ""provides a number of interesting opportunities both for financial institutions individually and for the collective ecosystem"".\n\nThe EBF proposal states that bitcoin should be regulated through the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework and the application of existing anti-money laundering statutes to digital currency transactions. It also recommended further research into the technology so ongoing evaluations of rule-making can be made.\n\nDespite calling for digital currency transactions to be regulated to the same degree as traditional currency transactions, the EBF\'s manifesto noted that ""maintaining innovation should remain however a prerequisite for the development of crypto-technologies"".\n\nThe document also points to some of the potential pay-offs of the technology\'s wider adoption, stating:\n\n“Using such technology offers clear opportunities to reduce costs of moving and handling money, to secure consumer spending and to introduce greater liquidity to the market. It also improves offers of products and services and increases banks\' velocity in all their activities.”\n\nYet the group appears to dismiss the prospects of bitcoin\'s use case as a currency, calling its future ""unclear"".\n\n""\'Bitcoin\' cryptocurrency represents probably one of the most well-known examples of crypto-technology,"" the report states. ""However, its future as a currency is unclear, given that it was built as an experiment.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He was cuffed and charged in July after running the scam in 2011 and 2012. As part of the deal, he has agreed not to appeal any sentence at or below 41 months in prison.\n\n""Trendon Shavers has admitted that his high-yield Bitcoin investment program yielded high returns for himself rather than his investors,"" said US Attorney Preet Bharara.\n\n""Instead of reaping gains, his investors were largely swindled out of their money in a cyber-age Ponzi scheme. Shavers now awaits sentencing for his crime.""\n\nShavers set up BTCST just as interest in the e-currency was starting to kick off. He promised investors that he\'d discovered arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin markets, and offered returns of up to one per cent a day (annualized interest rate of 3,641 per cent a year, according to the Feds) in exchange for their cash, saying he would personally cover any losses incurred.\n\nHe converted his investors\' money into BTC, and at one point held seven per cent of the Bitcoin market, but proved unsuccessful at trading them for a profit. Instead, he used money from new investors to pay off old ones, and siphoned off $165,000 for himself.\n\nAccording to UT financial watchdog the SEC, Shavers held Bitcoins worth $4.5m at the time – if he still had them now they would be worth about $60m. We\'re told 48 of the 100 investors contacted by the SEC lost some or all of their original stake.\n\nAfter being arrested, Shavers attempted to beat the rap by claiming Bitcoin wasn\'t real money, and thus he couldn\'t be charged with securities fraud. A judge disagreed, and he has now copped a plea deal.\n\nWhile this arrangement means he\'s unlikely to get a full 20-year sentence, Shavers has other problems. A separate civil court case in Texas that he lost fined him $150,000, along with $40 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, for the scheme. ®']"
09/23/2015,"['Not bad.\n\nEven better.\n\nBecause, it’s back in the news.\n\nIt’s kind of a back-to-the-basics argument, which might make it a little tiring, but that’s news for you. The question is — what is a bitcoin, after all?\n\nApparently, it may not even be a currency, crypto or otherwise.\n\nYes, you’re very well-informed. But turns out, the answer is no.\n\nIn the US, where the bulk of bitcoin action was taking place, three separate definitions seem to be emerging. There is its history as a currency, or as a system of money. American income tax authorities think it should be treated as property — something that is owned. And recently, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the US has decided to treat the bitcoin as a commodity — like crude oil or gold — because there are derivative products, like futures and options, based on the bitcoin.\n\nThe commission is the local commodity regulator in the US, which oversees the futures and options market. So when F&Os based on the bitcoin popped up, it probably felt it had to act. The commission said it would act against agencies which provide bitcoin derivatives without getting registered with the commission first. That’s the kind view.\n\nThat there isn’t much financial innovation happening in the US; so every regulator wants to bring the bitcoin into its jurisdiction.\n\nA bitcoin derivatives market called Derivabit operated by a bitcoin exchange called Coinflip. The ironic part is that when the commission did get in touch with Derivabit, the exchange was already defunct.\n\nExactly because bitcoin prices are speculative. For those who hold large quantities of bitcoins, buying regulated derivatives brings a certain amount of stability to the value of their bitcoin holding.\n\nThat doesn’t seem to be the case generally. In India, for instance, it is regulated by the RBI and the SEBI. So some people believe the FTC’s move may be challenged in court, where it would be overturned and bitcoins might return to being just a currency.\n\nActually, the bitcoin world is going through something of an internal upheaval. To put it simply, high-profile developers in the bitcoin world have decided to split it into two — the new Bitcoin XT and the old Bitcoin Core. The bitcoin world is calling it The Fork.\n\nEssentially, the two bitcoin versions have popped up because developers couldn’t agree on how to scale up the size and load capacity of the existing one. If they don’t upgrade it, however, the currency’s transaction processing ability slows down, making it unattractive to users. But let’s leave that for another day.\n\nA weekly column that helps you ask the right questions\n\n(This article was published on September 23, 2015)', 'Izabella Kaminska SEPTEMBER 23, 2015 0 After months of hype, the 21 Bitcoin Computer from 21 Inc was finally unveiled this week. Built atop the Raspberry Pi platform originally aimed at promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools, the computer allows you to mine bitcoins in the background while doing regular computing stuff. Mining is the energy-intensive process by which new bitcoins are added into circulation by number-crunching computers. The irony is, the sum of bitcoins you can earn from this sideline is so small it is unlikely to cover the $399.99 cost of the device, let alone make anyone a profit. Those who buy it will be paying for the right to waste electricity servicing the bitcoin network in return for a bitcoin shaving. 21 Inc says the machine, which will be shipped from November, also “allows anyone to sell anything over the internet for bitcoin just by plugging a device into the wall and typing a few commands”. The Amazon listing for the product carries endorsements from former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and others, implying the device could be as revolutionary as the web. According to Vitalik Buterin from rival project Ethereum, however, a quick analysis of the numbers shows that at best purchasers will be able to make $0.105 per day or $38.30 per year in bitcoin from the device. But of course the computer is not supposed to be just a bitcoin miner, instead it is what the industry likes to call a devkit, which suggests it is really a means towards an endlessly stimulative app economy. Indeed, 21 Inc expects its micro-transaction-accepting developer army might even disrupt the advertising-based business models of Google, Facebook and Twitter.

You have up to $750 billion worth of their deposits being guaranteed – all of this provided by the Australian people as an implicit subsidy, that implicit subsidy doesn’t exist so that they can behave in a way that stifles and stops growing industries in this country.”\n\nThe ACCC’s investigation comes shortly after several bitcoin traders in Australia said they have been systematically discriminated against by some of Australia’s largest banks, including the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ and the National Australia Bank.\n\nMichaela Juric, a bitcoin trader also known as the “Bitcoin Babe,” told the ABC:\n\n“I’ve been blacklisted from Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Westpac, St George, Bank of Melbourne, Bank SA, Bank of Queensland, Rams and BT Superfund. I can’t open or hold any accounts with those institutions because I deal with bitcoin.”\n\nAnother bitcoin trader, Daniel Wilczynski, said he is now out of business as both his personal and business accounts had been closed. He said:\n\n“Everything was going well, but my first bank closure was by NAB and then I had ANZ close, and then Westpac and then about two months ago the Commonwealth Bank closed my bank accounts.”\n\nAccording to the Australian Financial Review, at least 17 Australian bitcoin companies, including Bit Trade and Buyabitcoin, have received letters from major banks such as Westpac and Commonwealth Bank, informing them their accounts will be closed without further explanation.\n\nRon Tucker, chairman of The Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association, said that banks refused to explain why these accounts were being closed or even discuss what could be done to resolve the issue.', 'While it’s getting easier to spend Bitcoin on the Web for physical and digital goods and services, keeping your cryptocurrency safe still remains a challenge — you either have to entrust your private key to an online wallet or store it on an offline computer in your home or office.\n\nKeepKey hopes to change that with its $239 hardware vault.

Since then, the always-outspoken advocate for the technology has been silent on new developments in the industry.\n\nHowever, in the ongoing AMA, hosted by Bitcoin.com, Shrem opened up about a range of topics including the ongoing debate over bitcoin\'s block size, adjusting to prison life and why he believes the transparent nature of the bitcoin blockchain will lead to more repressive government regulation.\n\nShrem spoke at length about why he believes government will eventually lead to the creation of three classes of bitcoin: white bitcoins, those that meet regulatory requirements; gray bitcoins, those that have not been identified by the government; and black bitcoins that are blocked by the bitcoin mining network.\n\nShrem wrote:\n\n""If the government is able to discover that you possess black bitcoins or process blacklisted transactions, you could even be seen as a someone committing a crime. Eventually Bitcoin will become a fast payment system without counterparty risk but with full government control.

A pioneer in multi-sig and P2SH Bitcoin wallet technology, BitGo’s popular wallet and API products have not experienced a single breach, with $0 stolen since the company’s launch in 2013. BitGo also disclosed that its various consumer, enterprise and API wallet products now control a majority of market share for all P2SH wallet addresses.\n\n“BitGo was the first to pioneer the secure, multi-signature wallet platform for bitcoin,” said BitGo CEO and co-founder Mike Belshe. “Security is never a finished feature, so we're continually raising the bar. As we reach this billion dollar milestone, we're happy know so many customers are seeing the value of our solution.”\n\nWallets secured using multi-sig Pay to Script Hash technology, known as P2SH, are rapidly gaining traction and predicted to soon become the most widely used method of securing and storing Bitcoin. P2SH share of overall Bitcoin wallets grew more than 84% over the past three months, with particular success among commercial and high volume traders. With many highly publicized thefts and breaches in Bitcoin’s recent past, P2SH has proven to be the most secure method for storing bitcoins and the user experience, once deemed too cumbersome, is now simple and accessible.\n\n“For the sake of accuracy, our metrics do not count change address outputs. As an example if a user sends someone $3 from a wallet with $10 in it, we only count the $3 transaction and not the transfer of $7 back into the wallet.” said Regina Scolaro, Director of Marketing for BitGo. “We have chosen to use this methodology because we believe that in order to get a true sense of activity within the Bitcoin space; this should be the standard measurement.”\n\nBitGo is focused on creating the most secure bitcoin wallet in the world and raising standards for security within the Bitcoin space. As P2SH addresses continue to gain traction, all indications are that users are prioritizing security and will continue opting for solutions that offer multi-sig solutions.

These changes include debit card support, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured USD wallet and transfer support, higher customer limits, and application re-branding.\n\nUnlike the instant credit card deposits currently offered by Circle, instant debit card deposits are now without fees. Regarding other deposit methods, the blog post notes, “You can also still link your bank account, which is free of charge, but it may take a few days for your bank to complete a transfer.“\n\nUS customers can now hold FDIC insured US dollars in their account with Bitcoin transfer and service interoperability. If a customer holding dollars receives a Bitcoin transfer, it may be automatically converted to dollars upon receipt. Sarah Mitchell of Circle recently told the Associated Press the addition of euro and pound sterling support is currently planned.\n\nUsers unhappy with Circle’s deposit, transfer, and withdraw limits, will be happy to learn the limits have been increased. The default limit is US$300 per week. With security verification, users may upgrade their weekly limit to US$3000.\n\nCircle’s mobile and web applications have been re-branded to “Circle Pay” in an update which makes account creation faster. The blog post explains, “Now when you send a friend money, that friend will have a simpler time signing up with Circle to receive it.”\n\nCircle has become the first company to receive a controversial BitLicense as part of compliance with New York’s money transmitter regulations. In August of 2014, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire spoke out against BitLicense, even threatening to block New York residents.\n\nWith Circle’s new-found BitLicense compliance, they are holding true to their goal of helping people worldwide. Circle’s co-founders explain, “We want to help people everywhere around the globe, and that includes New Yorkers.”', 'Singapore based Search Engine startup SearchTrade recently raised over 200 BTC in a rapid 7-day presale of their keywords.

09/24/2015,"['WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A New Jersey-based bitcoin swap trading platform was sanctioned by U.S. derivatives regulators on Thursday after it allegedly facilitated illegal wash trades and then misled U.S. regulators both through press releases and at a government-sponsored public meeting.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission said TerraExchange LLC pre-arranged the sale of a swap that derived its value from bitcoins for trading last October, in an effort to test its systems.\n\nThere were only two buyers authorized to trade it, and they each bought the swap for the same size and amount, effectively offsetting each other in what is known as an illegal “wash trade.”\n\nLater, however, the trading platform attended a CFTC advisory committee meeting where it announced the trade was evidence of actual market interest, without disclosing the trade was pre-arranged.', 'In the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto launched a digital currency called Bitcoin that he or she claimed could remove the need to rely on central or commercial banks. Six years later, financial institutions such as JP Morgan and Citigroup are taking on Nakamoto’s ideas – but ditching the parts of Bitcoin’s design intended to reduce their influence.\n\nInstead, banks such as Barclays and Credit Suisse are backing efforts to draw on Nakamoto’s open-source code to build systems that will help financial giants do business as usual more efficiently. The general plan is to build software that apes the way Bitcoin records and verifies transactions in a digital ledger known as the blockchain, but to do it without the digital currency itself, or the way its blockchain is secured and operated by a network of computers owned by various companies and strangers around the world running “mining” software (see “What Bitcoin Is and Why It Matters”).\n\nOne such project became public last week, when New York City startup R3 announced that it was partnering with nine banks including Goldman Sachs, UBS, and JP Morgan to develop blockchain software that could ease the transfer of financial assets between institutions. If an asset’s ownership is recorded by cryptographic software in a blockchain recognized by multiple banks, it can be transferred between them more rapidly than today, says Richard Gendal Brown, R3’s head of technology.\n\nIn theory, a system like that could be built on top of Bitcoin. But some of its features are not a good fit for the financial industry, such as how its blockchain is public, says Brown. “Customers tend not to want their private financial transactions visible to everybody,” he says. Instead, banks could get together to operate a semi-private blockchain, powered by servers distributed between them, and accessible only to trusted institutions, says Brown.\n\nA report from Spanish bank Santander this summer estimated that “distributed ledgers” could save banks as much as $20 billion annually in infrastructure costs by 2022. Such ledgers are hoped to be cheaper to operate than existing, often outdated, solutions to connecting financial institutions, and they could also prevent assets from being locked up for hours or days as deals complete.\n\nChain, a San Francisco startup that this month received $30 million in funding from investors including Nasdaq, Visa, and Citigroup, is on the way to implementing that kind of design. A handful of customers are already seeking partners to share blockchains for specific types of assets, for example to record transactions in shares of private companies (see “Why Nasdaq is Betting on Bitcoin’s Blockchain”). Adam Ludwin, a Chain cofounder and the company’s CEO, expects the first such blockchain to go live next year and predicts that his technology will ultimately help consumers move money or other “assets” such as loyalty points more easily, as well as benefiting banks.\n\nChain was founded in early 2014 to provide software for the nascent Bitcoin industry. But the company decided to switch to developing private blockchain technology after meeting with executives from Wall Street companies who made it clear that Bitcoin was not suited to large-scale financial services, says Ludwin.\n\nFor one, Bitcoin was designed to primarily support transactions in Bitcoin over the Internet, but Ludwin found that financial companies didn’t care much for the currency. They were interested in better ways to move their existing assets around. Another problem was the volume and speed of transactions. Bitcoin’s design currently supports only roughly seven transactions per second. On average, it takes a new transaction 10 minutes to be added to the blockchain. And the total value of all Bitcoins today, underpinned by its blockchain, is $3.4 billion, a small figure to large banks.\n\nPrivate or semi-private blockchains can be designed to specifically support whatever asset needs moving around, whether it’s stocks, bonds, or airline miles, says Ludwin. He claims they can also offer better security.\n\nThe network of computers running Bitcoin-mining software protects the blockchain against fraud, and is one of Nakamoto’s most innovative ideas. But anyone can join that pool of miners, and an organization with enough computing power could overpower the other miners and tamper with Bitcoin’s blockchain (see “Academics Spy Weaknesses in Bitcoin’s Foundations”). “Pushing U.S. stocks or other assets into the Bitcoin blockchain and hoping that, say, China doesn’t attack it felt like a stretch,” says Ludwin.\n\nAn older startup, Ripple, has attracted several small banks from the U.S. and elsewhere, and cross-border payments company Earthport to its own private, Bitcoin-inspired system (see “Making Money”). IBM, which has a sizeable business providing backend systems to banks and major corporations, is also exploring how blockchains could help the financial sector and other industries.\n\nMoves from Wall Street giants to take selective inspiration from Bitcoin comes at a time that Bitcoin’s own community faces a major crossroads. Despite wide recognition that Bitcoin’s design needs to be modified or extended to support more transactions, there is vitriolic argument about exactly how (see “The Looming Problem That Could Kill Bitcoin”). There is no accepted governance or process for how to make such decisions about Bitcoin (see “Leaderless Bitcoin Struggles to Make Its Most Crucial Decision”).\n\nSome people think Bitcoin will overcome that challenge and ultimately sideline the idea of private, Bitcoin-free blockchains. They offer a safe way for existing banks to dip a toe into Bitcoin-style technology today, but won’t ultimately go anywhere, says Barry Silbert, CEO and founder of Digital Currency Group, which has invested in more than 50 Bitcoin and digital-currency-related companies. He previously founded Second Market, which facilitates trades in private company stock, among other assets.\n\n“We’re likely going to see years of exploration and talking and some preliminary products with companies like Chain, but it’ll be a very narrow use case,” says Silbert. He predicts that in coming years Bitcoin will rise to become a recognized store of value of something like gold, and that innovation in its design and services built on top will see the original, public blockchain become an underpinning for financial services of all kinds. “Eventually Wall Street will come to appreciate that the Bitcoin blockchain is the most secure and most flexible and can solve a lot of the issues that they have,” he says.\n\nLudwin also thinks Bitcoin will survive, but he says it will only represent a fraction of the value of less-radically open blockchains. Nakamoto’s invention will persist as a kind of backstop that offers a way for people unable to use or trust more conventional financial systems to move money around, he says. “The encroachment of other asset classes is actually bad for that; we need Bitcoin to thrive at that level,” he says. “The long-term vision is where we have many blockchains that are interoperable, as opposed to a single chain where everything is wedged in.”', 'UPDATE (25th September 14:5o BST): This article has been updated with comment from BitPay CEO Stephen Pair.\n\n\n\nBitPay has reduced the size of its staff in an effort to ""reduce costs"" and ""better align with the pace of growth"" in the industry, according to an email sent by CEO Stephen Pair to the firm\'s employees earlier today.\n\nThe confirmation of staff reductions at the troubled bitcoin payments processor follows speculation, rumors and a report by bitcoin news source Qntra that BitPay employees were seen leaving its Atlanta office following layoffs.\n\nPair\'s email, entitled ""Important Company Announcement"" and sent to the entire company, suggests the move may have been taken with little prior notice to employees, as he indicated his belief the day would be ""emotional"" for those involved.

Perhaps most notable among the poll\'s findings is that those surveyed believe the ""tipping point"" for government use of the blockchain will occur by 2023.\n\nFor purposes of the survey, blockchain technology was broadly defined as ""an emerging technology [that] replaces the need for third-party institutions to provide trust for financial, contract and voting activities"".\n\nIn turn, the survey suggested bitcoin and the blockchain would reach a ""tipping point"", or a point at which it becomes broadly adopted, by 2027. Respondents were given a range of potential responses to survey questions, which included the ability to respond with answers such as ""it has already happened"", it will happen in ""20+ years"" or it will ""never"" happen.\n\nOf the respondents, 73.1% reported by that taxes would first be collected using a blockchain by 2025, while 57.9% affirmed they believe 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) would be stored on a blockchain by this time. By comparison, 91.2% of survey-takers indicated 10% of people would wear clothes connected to the Internet by that year.\n\nThe WEF also indicated that, should blockchain technology become mainstream, it would be likely that the traditional role of government and institutions would need to be reimagined, writing:\n\n""Economic and monetary management will be overhauled by new systems anchored in digital currencies and the blockchain, making traditional pricing mechanisms and exchange rate systems less relevant.""\n\nFounded in 1971, the WEF is a 600-person independent international organization dedicated to improving the world through collaborations between the public and private sector.

""On the one hand, it is unregulated and not overseen by any central bank, meaning less control over monetary policy. On the other hand, it creates the ability for new taxing mechanisms to be built into the blockchain itself (eg a small transaction tax).""\n\nThe report suggested there were potential drawbacks to blockchain-based government systems, including an undermining of central bank and monetary policy, corruption, real-time taxation and changes to the role of government.\n\nOf note is that government experiments with blockchain technology are already underway, with the Isle of Man\'s Department of Economic Development announcing plans for a trial in May.\n\nFor more insights, read the full ""Deep Shift: Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact"" report.\n\nImage credit: Gil C / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This year, three of the 15 finalists come from the Bitcoin and blockchain sector: Everledger , Safello and Vaultoro .\n\nThe purpose of the competition is to discover and support up-and-coming innovators in financial technology who are poised to “disrupt [the banking] industry in e-commerce, security, mobile payments, data and others.”\n\nThe two winners are selected from each of three territories: Europe, Latin America and the United States and the rest of the world. Those six companies not only take home $30,000 each, but also benefit from extensive mentoring and networking support from BBVA in the form of a two-week intensive course.\n\nThis year, Everledger was named one of the two European winners.\n\nBased in the U.K., Everledger is a permanent ledger for diamond certification and related transaction history. Using blockchain technology, it acts as a fraud-detection system, overlaying big data from closed sources such as insurers and law enforcement.\n\n“BBVA Open Talent provides an inflection point in the growth curve of Everledger and validates our role in the financial services ecosystem,” Everledger’s CEO Leanne Kemp told Bitcoin Magazine .\n\n“Everledger is a business that will make a difference: At our very core we focus on the ongoing presence of blood diamonds, combatting fraud, theft and counterfeit luxury goods — a problem for consumers, law enforcement and insurers that tops £50 billion a year,” she said. “Blockchain provides a distributed global solution to a fragmented, scattered and complex global problem. With the support from the Barclays Accelerator, and now as a finalist in the BBVA Open Talent Competition, we are having conversations to create new financial and insurance products for diamonds.”\n\nJoshua Scigala, co-founder of Vaultoro, was enthusiastic about the BBVA’s inclusion of his U.K.-based bitcoin and gold exchange.\n\n“We are really proud to be a finalist in the BBVA awards,” Scigala told Bitcoin Magazine . “The developing world skipped the landline and went direct to mobile phones. They are now doing the same with traditional branch banking because it’s just too uneconomical to set up. Vaultoro enables anyone to easily enter the global economy securely by utilizing the native Internet currency, bitcoin, and removing the extreme volatility by combining the security of assigned gold bullion. This will go very far towards ending poverty by including a potential 5 billion people who have no real access to banking.”\n\nVaultoro is a real-time Bitcoin gold exchange that allows its users to convert their bitcoin instantly to gold and back, alleviating volatility risk for bitcoin users. Its “bank-independent trading” allows users to trade gold in amounts as small as 0.001 gram.\n\nThe third bitcoin finalist, Safello, is a Swedish-based exchange that works with a wide network of European banks providing direct payment options, allowing customers to buy and sell bitcoin instantly, thereby avoiding exposure to market volatility.\n\n“What’s most noticeable about this Open Challenge is the sheer amount Bitcoin selected,” Frank Schuil, CEO of Safello, told Bitcoin Magazine . “It shows the dedication from BBVA to embrace blockchain technology. With regards to our selection, of course our recent announcement with Barclays is sparking interest from other financial institutions. The fact that we are essentially building a new type of bank on top of blockchain technology is sparking interest.”\n\nEverledger joins BitNexo , winner of the Latin American regional competition, as the second Bitcoin-based company to take home a BBVA award this year.\n\n“In BitNexo’s mission to bring simplicity, speed and savings to cross border payments for SMBs through the use of blockchain technology, we had the honor of sharing the stage with 13 other amazing FinTech Startups from all around Latin America,” said Darren Camas, CEO and co-founder of BitNexo in a blog post . “To say I was impressed with the level of competition is an understatement.”\n\nInformation about all 15 finalists can be found on the BBVA Open Talent competition website .', ""If cyber-security is an arms race, the good guys are losing, believes Mariano Belinky of Santander Bank; as quickly as cyber-security companies come up with a new defense, hackers seem to have figured out how to beat it.\n\n“It’s a money pit,” Belinky, managing partner at Santander InnoVentures, Santander Group’s VC fund, told The Times of Israel on his recent visit to Tel Aviv, where he attended a financial technology event.\n\nGet The Start-Up Israel's Daily Start-Up by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\n“Unfortunately you have no choice but to spend the money, because your system is only as strong as its weakest link. The best defense is to pile on technologies in the hope that you will discourage hackers from attacking you and instead incentivize them to attack someone else, because their defenses are easier to get through than yours.”\n\nBut long-term, that’s not a solution – neither for his bank nor for the financial industry itself. Israel, however, has the technology that could supply a sustainable solution – though not necessarily by means of the top cyber-security technology that the country has become known for.\n\n“I see blockchain technology as a good candidate for future secure financial transaction technology,” said Belinky. “Israel is already a strong player in this area, and definitely has the talent to develop blockchain-based apps for banking.”\n\nAs head of start-up investments for Santander, Belinky would be more than happy to invest in promising blockchain technology firms. A bit late in discovering Israel, Santander, which is the biggest bank in Europe and South America, is now actively seeking investments in Israeli financial tech firms, as banks and financial firms like Citi, Visa, Mastercard, Barclays, and others are already doing.\n\n“We’ve already invested in one company, called MyCheck, and we expect to do at least one or two investments a year,” said Belinky.\n\nMyCheck, founded in Israel in 2011, is an app that allows users to pay bills at restaurants, bars, hotels, and other places of entertainment using their smartphones – a long-sought after financial technology goal, turning the smartphone into a kind of credit card. “There is a strong pool of talent in Israel, and the start-ups here know how to develop technology for foreign markets, so it makes a lot of sense for us to be here,” Belinky said.\n\nThe decentralized blockchain technology – the same tech that powers Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies – could revolutionize banking in many ways, including making home banking safer and more secure. “We have 100 million clients, most of them private individuals and small businesses, although about 10% of our clients are enterprise,” said Belinky.\n\nThose consumer-oriented clients like the idea of a bricks-and-mortar branch they can visit, and a banker they can speak to in person.\n\n“Of course running a branch is a lot more expensive that having the client download an app and do their banking that way, but you can’t just foist those changes on clients. You have to think about their needs, how you acquire them and how they grow with the bank.”\n\nWhile older customers who are not quite at home in the digital age still prefer the old-fashioned ways of doing things, younger customers are looking for a digital experience – an app that will be easy to use, and will not put their money at risk.\n\nThat’s where blockchain technology comes in. Although Bitcoin has proven to be less secure than many believed, the failure of top Bitcoin players like Mt. Gox and others was mostly due to human-perpetrated fraud, not the failure of the blockchain. The blockchain system allows many different computers to enter transactions on an account and to verify them independently – in a manner that makes it very difficult for anyone to commit fraud, since all transaction records (deposits, withdrawals, credits, etc.) are dependent on confirmation from numerous sources.\n\nThe key to blockchain tech is cryptography, which secures the entry made onto an account from the different computers, said Belinky – and cryptography is an Israeli specialty. “With its talent pool, Israel can become the reference market for blockchain apps. No other place has the tech and people for this kind of work – you just don’t find this level of talent in Silicon Valley and other tech centers,” said Belinky.\n\nOne of those Israeli blockchain tech firms – GetGems – won the award for Most Visionary Social Media Solution at Citi’s Global Financial Technology Challenge, which took place in Jerusalem, London, Nairobi and Warsaw last May. GetGems, which bills itself as “the first messaging app that pays you,” allows users to send payments using crypto-currencies (including Bitcoin) via text messages, combining payments, social networking, and blockchain technology. According to the company, Citi is exploring a “commercial relationship” with GetGems, which “reaches beyond those currently banked to those without a bank account or debit card.”\n\nGetGems is just one example of a growing blockchain business in Israel, but start-ups could be doing so much more, said Belinky.“All the talented cryptographers are going into cyber-security. The Israeli cyber-security industry is also very innovative, but it’s still an industry that at its essence is always going to be behind the eight ball – trying to stay one step ahead of hackers, who are going to catch up eventually. Blockchain apps could be a new paradigm, for banking and for Israeli financial technology. If 20 graduates of top IDF units like 8200 would work in blockchain instead of cyber, it would be of great benefit to everyone.”"", ""According to the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO), Coinbase, a San Francisco online exchange and platform for bitcoin services, applied for nine patents in March this year. The patents include ‘Hot Wallet for Holding Bitcoin’, ‘Bitcoin Exchange’, ‘User Private Key Control’, and ‘Tip Button’.\n\nThe bitcoin community on social media platform Reddit are in an uproar, expressing that these are not Coinbase inventions and should not be patented. Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, responded to the community by referring to an article by programmer Paul Graham called “Are Software Patents Evil,” in which the author describes business as a “a kind of ritualized warfare.”\n\n- Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO\n\n“A closer comparison might be someone seeing a hockey game for the first time, realizing with shock that the players were deliberately bumping into one another, and deciding that one would on no account be so rude when playing hockey oneself,” said Graham. “Hockey allows checking. It's part of the game. If your team refuses to do it, you simply lose. So it is in business. Under the present rules, patents are part of the game.”\n\n- Paul Graham, Y Combinator\n\nSome in the community were curious regarding Armstrong’s intentions, and inquired as to whether Coinbase would consider going down the same route as Tesla, who had similar quandaries regarding the patenting system.\n\nWhen Elon Musk, CEO and Founder at Tesla started out with his first company Zip2, he believed that patents were positive and he worked diligently to obtain them. “And maybe they were good long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors.”\n\n- Elon Musk\n\nHowever, Musk also obtained patents for Tesla Motors, concerned that large car companies would copy the technology and use their manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm the electric car company. In 2014 he turned the archaic patent on its head by announcing, “Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.”\n\nArmstrong’s response regarding Musk’s approach was that, “Tesla was awarded well over 200 patents before Elon musk blogged about open sourcing its IP (and they were a many billion dollar company at that time). Clearly their strategy was not to forego patent filing entirely, even if they ultimately intended to make a public commitment to open sourcing the IP. Coinbase is very open to making similar commitments in the future and we're considering options,” he wrote.\n\n- Armstrong\n\nMusk's ethos is rare in any market, and other companies who have chosen to entertain “a kind of ritualized warfare” over patents, bear the possibility of suffering significant losses. As an example, the saga between Apple and Samsung has been ongoing since litigation proceedings began in 2011.\n\nWhen Apple released the first i-Phone in 2007, investors coined the term “you bet your company on it,” due to the billions of dollars invested into the product. In order to protect their investment Apple acquired five key patents, one of which is for the touchscreen “slide to unlock” feature, which was heavily marketed in their first ad campaign.\n\nThe i-Phone’s release was a raging success. “iPhone is a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We are all born with the ultimate pointing device—our fingers—and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse.”\n\nOther companies followed in the company's footsteps, releasing similar products. According to the USPTO, internal documents from Samsung showed that the competitor “paid close attention to, and tried to incorporate” some of Apple’s patented technology, which was “indicative of copying by Samsung.”\n\nThe most recent ruling, from the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, stated that Apple should have received an injunction which would bar Samsung from selling any devices which infringed upon its patents. This means that Samsung will be unable to sell products in the US with features protected by Apple’s trademarks, including autocorrect, lock screens and data detection applications.\n\n- Circuit Judge Moore\n\nIn the bitcoin industry, Coinbase is not the only company to file for patents. The USPTO recently published that the Bank of America filed for a patent in March last year, seeking to protect a system which could enable the conversion of a customers digital currency funds into a foreign currency. Mastercard, IBM and Amazon have also made applications for bitcoin related projects."", ""After four months of suspense, the company with far more funding than any other company in the Bitcoin space, 21 Inc., released its very first product for pre-order on Monday, the 21st day of the month. The company has raised more than US$121m from venture capitalists.\n\nNamed simply “The 21 Bitcoin Computer,” the $400 desktop device is available on Amazon, and will be shipped on November 16, 2015.\n\nThe device is composed of a custom mining chip, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, a heat sink, and customized software centered around creating applications for the Internet of Things, using Bitcoin.\n\n- 21 Inc.\n\nIn May, we covered 21 Inc.'s stated plans for their product line, which did not mention anything similar to this device. The original product description was for a USB hub with a bitcoin mining chip in it. Monday's announcement came as a surprise to many, causing most to fixate on the specifications of the mining chip.\n\nMany voices online seemed to forget that the stated purpose of this machine has nothing to do with mining. By Monday night, a peek at any bitcoiner forum or online hangout was nearly uniformly raging with posts made by people who were unhappy with this product. Many could not seem to see past the device being a mining computer, since after all, it has a new ASIC mining chip within it, and says in their product listing that you can “Buy digital goods with the constant stream of bitcoin mined by a 21 Bitcoin Chip.”\n\nSome mean-spirited jabs even got tweeted from just outside the bitcoin community, like this one from Bitcoin bear Tim Swanson, who is now the Director of Market Research at R3 CEV: “I have a killer idea: give me $400 & your electricity and one day I will give you $50 back in a currency no one uses”\n\nEven those that did appreciate the concept behind the computer were posting that the price is too high, and the functionality is already achievable with available parts. Coder Scott Robinson, wrote that he was disappointed in both the marketing approach and the price, which is nearly twice what he feels it is worth as a development computer. Another programmer, Sam Patterson of OB1, estimated the price of purchasing the hardware at US$247.44, although he admits that “this ignores the value of the OS, which comes with tools that are supposed to make using Bitcoin easier.”\n\nAnd then on Tuesday, amidst all of this negativity, an interesting thing happened; The Amazon product listing, despite being a pre-sale, was doing so well that their product made the #1 bestseller spot in Amazon's Server category. At the time of writing, it has achieved the #31 spot in all computers and accessories on Amazon, which is likely impressing computer manufacturers worldwide, given Amazon's importance on the global market.\n\nIt has yet to be seen why people are buying all of these machines, perhaps they are doing so for the sake of developing on them, or perhaps they are buying them because the product could potentially become a hot collector's item, forever known as “The First Bitcoin Computer,” as 21 says in their Amazon listing.\n\nBy Wednesday, many developers had started speaking up on social media in defence of the computer. Coders, including at least one on the Bitcoin core development team, are perhaps the most likely group to appreciate the devices potential, and have a different take on this product.\n\n- Jeff Garzik, Core Bitcoin developer\n\n- Demian Brener, Streamium\n\n- Chris Ellis, ProTip\n\n- Bill Barhydt, ABRA CEO\n\nWhat do these code slingers see in the $400 chunk of hardware that most people don't?\n\nProgrammers typically work with a Software Development Kit (SDK) whenever they come across new technology or programming environments. SDKs, or devkits, are typically a set of software development tools that allow the creation of applications for a certain software package, software framework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating system, or similar development platform.\n\nSDKs allow programmers to dive into a new environment and use its full functionality without taking the time to learn the whole programming language of that environment from scratch. This is exactly the purpose that this tiny bitcoin server was built for; A way for coders to start building applications and new uses for devices in the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nSimply put, this computer gives them access to a more bitcoin-friendly toolset, which they can build a highly-connected world with. That may be a struggle for the rest of us to imagine yet. There is nothing else like it, and there may never be again if 21's chipsets become common in everyday computers and smartphones.\n\n21 Inc.'s CEO, Balaji Srinivasan, has laid out his vision for the upcoming IoT on many occasions. His optimistic speeches often set pulses racing, and tempt investors to start writing checks. According to Srinivasan, the end goal is far beyond enabling every electronic device we own to both talk and trade with each other, enabling them to automatically share resources and trade in a truly open market using bitcoin. First, he stresses, each of these devices will need to produce their own bitcoins, so that they have the resources to trade with each other.\n\n- Srinivasan\n\nThe first examples of specific use-cases for the 21 Bitcoin Computer are starting to be explored, and they are mostly projects that involve your computer charging micropayments for computing tasks.\n\nOne clear example is for webmasters who need social media likes, comments, upvotes, or any other type of marketing micro-task to help the ranking of their website. By paying tiny fractions of a bitcoin for a single link, upvote, or like, a webmaster could spread out his or her marketing around the world, looking like a very natural, diverse set of profiles and IP addresses. Such a program on the 21 Bitcoin Computer should be pretty easy to make, and leave running on the device itself. People using the device can build a passive, hands-free stream of income, just for leaving a tiny server running.\n\nNo matter what happens to this project in the future, Srinivasan made it clear during his investors presentation back in May that his plans are to put related devices in many different types of consumer products. If that is indeed still the plan, then it makes perfect sense that selling this developer's kit as the first product would be ideal, if not even necessary.""]"
09/25/2015,"['Much has changed at Circle Internet Financial in the past week. The company was granted the first BitLicense from the state of New York, and since made some changes to the service:\n\nToday we took another step toward realizing that goal. Now in the United States, you can send, receive, and hold US dollars in addition to using bitcoin for payments within the Circle app.\n\nYou can enjoy the benefits of Bitcoin without ever holding or buying bitcoin yourself, and without being exposed to bitcoin price volatility. Even if you prefer to hold US dollars in your Circle account, you gain security, speed, and open interoperability with bitcoin wallets and services around the globe. You can hold US dollars but still send someone bitcoin, and likewise someone can send you bitcoin and Circle can instantly turn it into US dollars in your account.\n\nAnd if you still prefer to hold bitcoin instead of dollars? That’s perfectly fine; you can switch back and forth between currencies at any time with zero fees. As we add further currencies, you can expect the same.\n\nYet, since the announcement, many customers have expressed concern over how the service has operated.\n\nAccording to some, Circle won’t let them transfer bitcoins out of the service for four weeks. Others have reported Circle has paused deposits and withdrawals. Circle representatives told CCN some changes have been made, but not nearly as all-encompassing as some Redditors make it seem.\n\n“On Tuesday, we updated our send and receive limits, with most customers receiving a limits increase,” Circle VP of Marketing, Josh Hawkins, told me.\n\nFor a small number of customers, the limit may have come down or remained the same. These customers can contact Circle support and they will raise the limits, allow customer to move the funds out, and then the limits will be returned to the normal level.\n\nThe service interruptions, moreover, were not Circle’s fault.\n\n“Regarding the intermittent service interruptions some of our customers experienced yesterday, those were indeed related to the Amazon Web Services issues, which many on the Reddit thread you shared suggested,” Hawkins said. “These issues affected numerous Internet companies and services, including Amazon itself. These issues appear to have been resolved and we are fully operational.” Circle has also rolled out a marketing campaign seemingly distancing itself from Bitcoin . As the firm makes clear, it does not consider itself a Bitcoin company.\n\n“We think of ourselves as a consumer finance company. We see bitcoin as an enabling technology,” President and co-founder Sean Neville told Reuters. This position has surprised some Bitcoiners, who were under the impression the company was a Bitcoin company. Not so, and the company makes this clear, even seemingly pushing individuals towards USD accounts.\n\nIn a recent advertisement for the company, there is no mention of Bitcoin.\n\nThe company, whose backers include Goldman Sachs, was the first to receive a New York BitLicense earlier this week. The company views Bitcoin not as its main product, but, rather, as an enabler to change how people transact.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'By Michael McDonald\n\nThe commodities markets are some of the oldest trading markets in the world. The basic idea of trading wholesale goods between parties is as old as commerce itself. Recently though, the commodities markets did something very unusual – they added a new commodity; Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is an electronic pseudo-currency that is independent of any state or country. The currency is created by computers solving complex math problems with currency released slowly over time. The basic idea behind Bitcoin is that the currency is free from the interference of any government or central bank. Because the amount of the currency in circulation cannot be controlled by central banks, its value is independent of inflation. One might suppose that would make Bitcoin more stable as a form of money. In fact the opposite is true.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is not really used in any meaningful way for commerce, but instead exists mainly as a speculation instrument, its price has been extremely volatile. In the last year, a single Bitcoin has been worth anywhere from less than $200 per coin to more than $400 per coin. If U.S. dollars fluctuated in relative value in that way, no one could use the currency for trade. Fortunately, Bitcoin does not have that issue, and trading volumes have largely held steady in the currency despite its volatility over the last year.\n\nBitcoin’s appeal for many early adopters was based on the lack of regulation around the currency. That is now changing as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) moves to regulate the currency as a commodity. This move should change both the commodities markets and the Bitcoin markets. Evidence of the latter has already started as the CFTC moves to clamp down on unregulated trading of the currency. Bitcoin will never again be the freewheeling libertarian ideal that it once was. Instead, it is moving to a different phase of its lifecycle – as a monetary hedge against inflation.\n\nAs the CFTC continues to crack down on the unregistered trading in the Bitcoin markets, the investor base of the asset should start to change. Institutional investors who need to follow laws and regulations consistent with fiduciary duties could never have invested in Bitcoin before. Now that the CFTC is regulating the currency, it is much more defensible as an investment. Over time that will lead to a change in the investor base holding Bitcoin and likely a change in the character and volatility of the market for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin as a currency will likely also change the commodities markets too. Commodities trading has traditionally been a market of hedgers and speculators dealing in very traditional products from lumber to cattle. Bitcoin is the opposite. Where oil drilling and cattle production involve the use of real assets and traditional production processes, Bitcoin is the epitome of a 21st century product.\n\nNow of course, most commodities contracts are never completed and instead are simply traded between speculators, but even so, Bitcoin trading represents a new era of purely electronic commerce. Trading in the commodity itself will require new teams of traders and supporting personnel who understand the currency and can make an intelligent forecast about supply and demand going forward. Banks and trading firms will also need to find potential end users who are interested in hedging some sort of risk using Bitcoin. Without such hedgers, speculation in the commodity is moot since there is no ultimate demand for the product.\n\nAll of these changes will take time to implement and Bitcoin for now will continue to be outside the mainstream of investment assets. But over time, Bitcoin could become an alternative investment choice for those who want to store value in an asset that is independent of the value of the U.S. dollar. That could include many foreign nationals who do not understand the U.S. economy, yet do not trust the currency of their own government. That level of global acceptance could take decades to build, but for the first time, with the implicit backing of the CFTC, Bitcoin may actually have a viable future as a true investment product.\n\nThis article was originally published on Oilprice.com.', 'Mike Tyson says he is grateful to be part of the ""bitcoin revolution"", though he admits he\'s ""no guru"" just yet.\n\nThe ex-heavyweight champion of the world spoke with CoinDesk prior to the launch of his first branded bitcoin ATM in Las Vegas yesterday morning.\n\nPositioned inside the Off The Strip restaurant, the Lamassu machine has been billed as Tyson\'s ""George Foreman grill"" – and bitcoin\'s bridge into popular culture.\n\nMany have accused the digital currency of having a branding problem, with Silk Road and Mt Gox still raw, but Tyson disagrees.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The World Economic Forum’s recent report that the Bitcoin block chain would be worth 10% of the world’s GDP by 2027 did not give solid figures, for starters. But as noted in the report, and elsewhere, the WEF is referring to the overall value stored on the block chain – not to bitcoins themselves, necessarily. The report specifically says, on page 24:\n\nSmartcontracts.com provides programmable contracts that do payouts between two parties once certain criteria have been met, without involving a middleman. These contracts are secured in the blockchain as “self-executing contractual states”, which eliminate the risk of relying on others to follow through on their commitments.\n\nThe estimated $20 billion value of the block chain is also not referring solely to the worth of bitcoins, but rather to all value currently secured by it via things like smart contracts, Factom, and so forth. It is quite feasible that far more than 10% of the world’s GDP could be on “block chain technology,” which doesn’t even necessarily have to refer to the Bitcoin block chain.\n\nAs the report says, “disintermediation of financial institutions, as new services and value exchanges are created directly on the blockchain.” This means that people will around the globe will most likely be using services like M-pesa and others which more aptly cater to their needs than can traditional financial institutions, banks included. By such a metric, 10% of the global GDP could even be a low figure.\n\nNevertheless, a Reddit user did what Reddit does best and attempted to stir up some hyperbole, using primitive mathematics to estimate that by 2027 bitcoins would be worth “$300,000 or more.” How’d he reach this conclusion? Like so:\n\nThey predict that roughly 10% of the world’s GDP will reside on the bitcoin blockchain by 2027. 10% of today’s gdp is 7.5 trillion. So if you divide 7.5 trillion by 21 million, that would make each bitcoin worth over $300,000 per bitcoin by 2027.\n\nNumerous other Redditors pointed out the obvious folly here, with one being less crude than standard Reddit faire:\n\nI don’t think it’s that 10% of the world’s GDP will be invested in bitcoin. I think it’s that assets will be on the blockchain — smart contracts, cryptobonds and the like. Notice that the article says the blockchain is currently worth $20bn. That’s quite a bit more than the market cap of bitcoin.\n\nCertainly any investor in Bitcoin would love to believe that it will one day hit $300,000, but there are several factors which make this unlikely. A notable thing left out of the estimation, for instance, is that Bitcoin mining will actually still be in progress in twelve years hence. That is to say, there won’t be 21 million coins yet, although mining will be yielding far less inflation than it does today. Secondly, there are a lot of competing efforts in the cryptocurrency industry, some of which have long since solved certain “fundamental problems” with Bitcoin.\n\nA more realistic vision of the future might involve a variety of “viable” cryptocurrencies, all serving various specific purposes and interchangeable with each other. But predicting the future is the domain of prediction markets or mystics, not the World Economic Forum or Internet forums.\n\nThe Government and the Block Chain\n\nThe potential value of “blockchain technology” was not all that was covered in the WEF’s report, however. The WEF expects that by 2023, a government somewhere in the world will collect taxes via block chain technology. The report notes that governments have struggled to understand or reconcile cryptocurrencies, but that they could in the end be beneficial.\n\nOn the one hand, it is unregulated and not overseen by any central bank, meaning less control over monetary policy. On the other hand, it creates the ability for new taxing mechanisms to be built into the blockchain itself (e.g. a small transaction tax).\n\nThe report cites a 2016 London mayoral candidate’s suggestion that block chain technology be used to augment existing record-keeping in the city’s government. It neglects to note an ongoing campaign by Bitcoiners in New Hampshire to get the state to accept bitcoins in lieu of fees and taxes.\n\nIt seems that, according to the World Economic Forum and almost any financial expert you speak to these days, Bitcoin and its various cousins have a very bright future. Whether the actual value of a single bitcoin ever rises to its height of $1200 again remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: in six years Bitcoin and block chain technology have gone from a discussion on an out-of-the-way cryptography mailing list to something eagerly acknowledged by the highest priests of finance.\n\nImage from Gil C / Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Only a week after ruling that bitcoin and other digital currencies are commodities, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced on Thursday that they have settled charges filed against TeraExchange LLC (Tera) for arranging a “non-deliverable forward contract” last October.\n\nNeither of the parties entering the trade were looking to profit off of future bitcoin price changes, but rather to test Tera’s network. However, Tera subsequently released a press release that indicated the pre-arranged swap was a real trade, which would violate both the Swap Execution Facility (SEF) Core Principles found in the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.\n\nThis was the first charge filed by the CFTC against a bitcoin exchange following last week’s announcement , which gave the CFTC jurisdiction over online bitcoin exchange and derivative markets.\n\nOther digital currency platforms that offer similar services have prepared for this moment. LedgerX applied for both an SEF and Derivatives Clearing Organization license last year but has received only a temporary SEF registration at this point.\n\nIn a statement released September 10th, CEO Paul Chao said, “[LedgerX does] not intend to launch with only [an] SEF license… Only with both SEF and DCO licenses from the CFTC can we clear and physically deliver the underlying commodity, offer an order-book trading venue, and attract institutional traders.”\n\nLedgerX has even contracted Ancoa , a surveillance technology provider in order to identify “manipulative behaviors and suspicious trading practices” on the LedgerX platform, according to a statement released earlier this year.\n\nWhile this type of regulation might seem counterintuitive, as it forces exchanges to push back release dates, industry players welcome the oversight. In a private interview, Alt-Options co-founder Marco Cuesta conveyed that “[the CFTC’s] regulation does positively impact the bitcoin derivative market, since its purpose is to protect clients and their assets. As regulation for the Bitcoin derivative market becomes more aligned with that of traditional financial markets, there should be wider adoption, which is good for the industry.”\n\nImage via CFTC', 'D.A. Wallach, the recording artist and songwriter who Kanye West and Pharrell Williams discovered while he was an undergraduate at Harvard College, wrote the article, Bitcoin for Rockstars: How Cryptocurrency Can Revolutionize The Music Industry, in December of 2014.\n\nMr. Wallach’s piece – eloquent, insightful, and provocative – served as the first meaningful opinion from the artist community regarding the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nA lot has been written since then. I personally have explored this topic with artists like Zoe Keating, Imogen Heap, Ryan Leslie; and with Venture Capitalists and entrepreneurs, such as, Andy Weissman from Union Square Ventures, Bill Tai, Jesse Von Doom from CASH Music, and the founders of Colu.\n\nRoughly a year from the publication of Mr. Wallach’s seminal piece on this topic, I strongly believe that blockchain technology (or some alternative distributed ledger) is the very best path forward in order to develop a music industry that enables those who create music to control their works and be compensated for their usage, and for those who desire to consume/utilize/build businesses around music to do so in a transparent and efficient manner, without self-interested intermediaries distorting and leveraging the process.\n\nPie in the sky? Perhaps, but progress is being made, and certainly no better “solutions” are presenting themselves.\n\nI recently had the opportunity to check in with Mr. Wallach about this topic, and, over the course of a lengthy conversation, we discussed not only his views on the progress made with respect to blockchain technology and musicians, but also his work with Spotify, and his strong conviction that there is a more moral way to approach the music industry than that which currently exists.\n\nOur conversation was direct, and at times heated, but it is abundantly clear to me that the music industry is incredibly fortunate to have someone like Mr. Wallach to help define its future.\n\nIn this first part of our conversation, presented below lightly edited for grammar and clarity, we discuss:\n\nHow the problems of today’s music industry has less to do with nefarious executives, and more to do with “poorly architected systems.” The need for a distributed registry. The unlikelihood of some sort of consortium or governmental agency coming together to create a registry. How institutions, such as ASCAP, BMI, will be reluctant to embrace these technologies, because doing so would threaten their very existence. (This is a point I made in an early article on Blockchain, entitled, “Bitcoin Can\'t Save The Music Industry Because The Music Industry Will Resist Transparency.”) How consent decrees and other forms of collective bargaining are hindering artist’s ability to determine the usages of their works. Mr. Wallach’s “thought experiment” on what might happen if an artist became popular – via social media, etc. - and the artist’s works were played on the radio without the artist affiliating with a PRO.\n\nThe entire interview can be heard here.\n\nI will be posting part two of our conversation, in which – among other topics – we get very specific about Mr. Wallace’s work with Spotify, and his thoughts on their approach to artists.\n\nGeorge Howard: So, I have the pleasure today to talk to D.A. Wallach. D.A., thanks for joining me. How are you doing?\n\nD.A. Wallach: I am doing great. Thank you.\n\nGH: Good. So, before we dive in on the topic at hand, I want to give a little bit of an overview. You wrote an article called: “Bitcoin For Rock Stars: How Cryptocurrency Can Revolutionize the Music Industry,” back in December of 2014. And, that article to me was really the first one that raised a lot of awareness, in the artistic community, about the blockchain, generally.\n\nThrough my own work in that area, it is an article that keeps getting referenced, which is a testament, not only to how great the article is, and how well written it is, but, also to you generally, and everything that you have done in the industry. So, I was wondering, before we jump in, if you could set the stage about your career and what led you to this point.\n\nDW: Yeah. For sure. So, as my life stands today, I sort of split my time 50/50 between continuing to make music and putting out albums as a solo artist. And, with the rest of my time, I invest in early stage technology businesses. And, going back even further, prior to Spotify, I was spending pretty much all of my time just being a career artist. So, touring and making records.\n\nAnd, that started pretty much from the day I graduated college, which was in 2007, that I had started as an undergraduate when my band got a record deal.\n\nAnd so, I’ve gone through a number of different worlds that all sort of overlap and brought me to the interests that I developed in both cryptocurrency and also in fixing some of the core infrastructure in the music business. And, I had started thinking about some of these issues ten years ago, when I was literally busking on the street in Boston.\n\nGH: Yeah. I probably saw you.\n\nDW: You may have, unfortunately. But, particularly with my experience through Spotify, and from being on the other side of the table, a little bit, I gained an even more acute awareness of really how significant some of the problems were in the way that the industry functions that aren’t necessarily attributable to evil minded executives or anything nefarious; it is really just that this industry and lots of other media industries are built upon really poorly architected infrastructure. In fact, no one architected it; it just sort of evolved over the past hundred years. But, it is not up to the task of today.\n\nGH: Yeah. It’s sort of an architecture of accretion.\n\nThank you for that introduction and context. And, it does sort of uniquely qualify you, as say you\'ve been on both sides of the table; being an artist who has had the trajectory of busking all the way up to putting records out and playing in front of a lot of people, and selling a lot of records – this all gives you context. And, then investing, and working with Spotify.\n\nAnd, frankly I wish there were more like you. I think that one of the main reasons the record industry sort of devolved was that there was a separation between the people who were making the music and the people who were marketing the music. And, never the twain shall meet. So, we are lucky in the artist community to have somebody like you out there. So, thank you for what you are doing.\n\nDW: That’s nice. Thanks.\n\nGH: To your point about the lack of architecture; unquestionably, the music industry did evolve through accretion. We still talk in terms that are anachronistic, in the sense that they were invented back when the music industry was invented. I mean “mechanical royalties” was a term used when they had to come up with some way to describe taking music and mechanically reproducing it on a piano or a music box, and yet it is still a key component.\n\nWhat intrigues me about the blockchain or a decentralized registry, generally, is that maybe now we can move to one place that has a more accurate registry as well as one that is less easily corrupted by people for their own desires or for economic imperatives or what have you. Is that a fair statement?\n\nWas that sort of your initial gesture on this or was it not?\n\nDW: No. I don’t think it was. You know, I would sort of distinguish between two separate problems that my article is attempting to address and that, to me, is clearly more two separate problems the longer I think about this. The first one is that we really need this thing. And, by “this thing,” I mean that we need a central registry where we easily keep track of who creates our art and who gets paid when that art gets used.\n\nGH: Can I interrupt you? The idea that we need a central registry.... I would say that we need a distributed registry. Right? I think it might be helpful for people to understand the distinction.\n\nDW: Yeah. Absolutely. I think that is the second problem.\n\nGW: Okay. I don’t mean to change your flow. I just think there is a key distinction, because there are tons of registries out there. ASCAP has a registry, Harry Fox has a registry, Sound Exchange has a registry. What I am arguing for, and I think you are too, is a registry that is decentralized. In essence, it is distributed.\n\nDW: Sure. What I would say is that when I first started thinking about this - before I started thinking about decentralization - I was thinking about the music industry becoming global and that is sort of a universal trend. We have one world, one culture. It doesn’t make sense really to release records in different territories on different days, and things like this because the internet has brought everyone so much closer together.\n\nAnd, if you can imagine a world in which the United Nations created this database and it was a free public asset and everyone used it. That would be great. And I sort of wouldn’t mind a single party controlling it, as long as they were trustworthy, and were sort of easy to work with, and did a basically good job on the technology side.\n\nBut, the world in which we actually seem to live in, is one in which basically no one in the media industries basically trust each other.\n\nGH: Right.\n\nDW: So, I actually view the need for decentralization here, or the opportunity for decentralization as sort of a slightly sad testament to how corrupted the media businesses are.\n\nI mean I sort of wish that everyone could work together and form a consortium globally that did this. But, that hasn’t happened. It doesn’t seem like it’s going to happen. It is hard to imagine what would actually make it happen.\n\nAnd, that led me to the possibility that maybe the only way to do this is to actually produce a solution that will enable everyone to work together. And, that’s what decentralized stuff is good at.\n\nGH: Yeah. I’m there. So, decentralization sort of addresses both of those things. One, it obviates the bug in the ointment of if people have control they are going to utilize that control to their own ends. And, that’s life.\n\nIt also allows for it to be global, as you say, and finally allows for us to be able to distribute it across anyone who wants to use it. So, it’s not just in the hands of a few people.\n\nDW: I agree. I think that you are absolutely right that people are keeping... you know, ASCAP maintains their own database; Harry Fox maintains their own database. All of thee people are keeping their sort of proprietary dataset around.\n\nGH: I am sorry to interrupt you, but, that’s where their value comes from, right? That’s part of the inherent problem of saying, “Hey, ASCAP open up your database.” Well, if they do that they are giving away their secret sauce. They are giving away their value.\n\nDW: You know, I think that’s their perception, and, you know, they may be partly right. But my view of it - and I am not like extremist ""information should be free"" type of person - it’s just that in this case, I don’t see anyone deriving much value from having this stuff be proprietary. Sure. It is part of ASCAP’s value. Yes. They have a pretty comprehensive database of their songwriters and the stuff those songwriters created. But, I really don’t think that’s where their value comes from in the world.\n\nI think the reason songwriters affiliate with them is to go and effectively collective bargain on their behalf with broadcasters and other people who use music. By the way, I think that is always going to be a potentially valuable service that they can provide in the world.\n\nGH: So, let me stop you again. I do disagree here. And, that’s okay. I think that ASCAP and BMI and any of the PROs are the most likely low-hanging-fruit to be disrupted by the blockchain.\n\nLet me just throw a straw man out at you and you can tell me where I am wrong. And, I am probably going to work this into an article. So, I am testing it out on you today.\n\nSo, if you decide that this music thing is for the birds, and, you don’t want to do it anymore; you are going to open up a restaurant instead, right? You want to play music in your restaurant. And, you are not you; you are someone that doesn’t know the ins and outs of the music business. And, you get a letter or a knock on the door from ASCAP or BMI saying, “Hey, you want music in your restaurant? Great. You need to pay us a blanket license fee and then you can play anything that’s in our catalog because we’ve negotiated” — as you said re collective bargaining — “we negotiated for our writers. And you say, “Alright. I understand. Great!”\n\nAnd the PROs say, “By the way, if you don’t purchase this blanket license, we are going to sue you.”\n\nSo, what if we were in a — and I am sort of jumping ahead a little bit — but, what if you and I got together and said, We are going to find two to three hundred artists out there who have the rights to their compositions, and we are going to put it up on the blockchain. We are going to stipulate that this music can be used by restaurants and then we are going to find three hundred of our friends that have restaurants, and say, “Hey, you want music in your restaurant? You can use this music according to the database that we used the blockchain tocreate.”\n\nAnd the people supplying the music will set whatever reasonable price, and the people that want to use the music willdecide: “yeah I am either going to pay or I am not going to pay that.”\n\nWhat do we need ASCAP or BMI for? Scale?\n\nDW: Sure. The system you are proposing I find really appealing, right. And, I think at a certain level, artists shouldn’t need to affiliate with one of these PRO’s in order to have their music usable in the world.\n\nGH: And, you think you have to? You can tell I have a bias against this. So, you can shoot me down at any point. But, you are right. They shouldn’t. Then, there is a burden on the services — that artists have to align themselves with — to report accurately and effectively, and we both know now that none of the PROs come anywhere near that.\n\nDW: Sure. Look, I would distinguish between two functions that the PROs provide. One, is that they keep track of who owns this stuff, and then they move them all around, right? They go and get a check from Clear Channel. They figure out how to go and split it up. You can debate whether or not they can do a fair or a good job of that, but let’s assume that they do an OK job of it. So, that’s one of their functions. And, the other function is this sort of collective bargaining thing.\n\nGH: OK.\n\nDW: And, the collective bargaining thing, in general is good for artists who don’t have a lot of power. And, it’s potentially worse for artists that do have a lot of power. So, this sort of alternative PRO that you are describing is actually sort of being done right now with a lot of powerful artists in the form of this GMR; Global Music Rights.\n\nGH: Right.\n\nDW: Which isn’t bound by the consent decrees of U.S. Congress, and so can’t demand higher rates on behalf of its songwriters who are the sort of folks who you can’t live without if you have a radio station.\n\nGH: If you are the Eagles, you can say, “We are going to pull our music from ASCAP, BMI or whoever and limit our usage."" And the Eagles will not let, for instance, tv shows broadcast their music without a direct license. But, all that does, and tell me if I am wrong, but doing this without the blockchain or some other decentralized registry, is just building a new system that is essentially the same as the other one, but perhaps more elitist.\n\nAnd, what I am looking for is one that allows for some sort of smart contracts to exist. Where I open a restaurant, but, I can just say, “OK, I like salsa music. I want that in my restaurant, and I am willing to pay $100.00 a month.” And, I plug that in and my machine goes out and looks for artists that do that type of work and are willing to allow their music to be used and the machine sort of match each other up. Is that too pie in the sky?\n\nDW: I don’t think it’s pie in the sky. It should work, you know, if an alien came down and created this from scratch. So, in general, I favor that approach. I think. My wish though is that artists could do whatever they want. If they want the sort of collective bargaining power of ASCAP and they want to go in with a bunch of other artists and have someone negotiate a rate for all of them that might be better than what they could negotiate on their own — more power to them. If someone doesn’t want to affiliate and wants to use a sort of system that you are describing at their own rates, then they should be able to do that too. And, I think the problem right now is that artists can’t do that.\n\nGW: Right. That is the point.\n\nDW: I have had sort of a “thought experiment"" for a while that I think would be a fun stunt. Which is: imagine that you had an artist that was really hot on the internet and you had a big bidding war over them and they signed a record deal with whomever, and they didn’t affiliate with a PRO. And then as soon as they get played on the radio, all over the place, they sued every station for each play.\n\nGH: They weren’t affiliated with a PRO. For the people who don’t understand: If you write a song only you have the write to publicly perform it, which means, have your song broadcast on radio, etc. And, if you have a hit, however that might happen - via social media or whatever - and radio stations just start playing it, and you haven’t affiliated with ASCAP or BMI, those radio stations are infringing upon the songwriter’s right to publicly perform the song and the songwriter can sue them for infringement.\n\nDW: Exactly. And, I don’t know if this has ever happened. I don’t think it has happened with a notable artist. It’s an interesting way to sort of put pressure on this system. You could imagine major artists un-affiliating from ASCAP or BMI and just reclaiming their own rights.\n\nGH: You can imagine that. But, the problem with that is, if you are Paul McCartney, and you are making lord only knows what Paul McCartney is making from public performance royalties because “Yesterday” is being played a billion times a day, he is lacking the necessary incentive to say, “I’m going to stop doing that,” and pull that song from his PRO, and, then negotiate directly with every radio station and therefore make more money, because it is more of a pain in the ass to do the administrative side of it.\n\nDW: Yep. Yep.\n\nGH: And, that’s why I go back to blockchain. With blockchain it can be done through smart contracts and machines. Radio stations could say, “OK I’ve got to only play songs that the writer has checked off the box that says, ‘I’m willing for my music to be played and I am willing to be paid this amount.’” And, it could be played with bitcoin or whatever currency. It could be in micropayments and you wouldn’t have the transaction costs.\n\nI want to direct this back to blockchain, though I love your thought experiment.\n\nIt’s been almost a year since you posted your article. What has changed in your thinking or thoughts? It most be somewhat gratifying at least to be sort of the “genesis block” almost of this discussion. Are you more or less optimistic about blockchain now than you were when you wrote this? And, what have you learned?\n\nDW: Well, I think both. What I have seen in media related to the blockchain, and in other verticals, notably financial services, is just an incredible flurry of creativity and energy. And entrepreneurial enthusiasm for decentralization and blockchain and similar technology. And so I think this is a technology, generally speaking, that has more of a sort of moral component in people’s minds.\n\nSo, it’s not only an interesting technical solution to a pretty complex problem, but it’s also brain candy, because when people learn about it and go a little deeper, they feel really smart, and it sort of tickles your brain because it’s hard to understand. Once you figure out the puzzle. Then, you want to explain it to people, and do something cool with it, and it’s gratifying in that way.\n\nBut it also is sort of accompanied by this moral weight, and this notion that this is a fundamentally different way to organize society or to use computation and to get people to do things together. And, I think it is a genuinely sort of novel idea in human history.\n\nSo, I think right now we are trying to figure what to do with it. You’ve got a lot of people building things that are stupid, and you have people building things that are smart. And, you have people building things that are too smart and ten years away, and don’t have the sort of enabling technologies in place to make them thrive.\n\nBut, my hope is that we will start seeing some usable stuff coming out of this. But, you have to zoom out and look at technology from a ten-year or twenty-year time scale. And, we are just at the very beginning of this, hopefully.\n\nGH: Yeah. I agree. My friend, Andy Weissman, who is a venture capitalist, I interviewed him on this topic, and he said, “Look, my job really is to envision a world that I want to live in that is three to five years away from now.” So, I am with you. I am encouraged by certain people, and as I have said, I have talked a lot with Imogen Heap and others.\n\nI am starting to see little tiny flickers of going from sort of pie in the sky things to: “You know, I think we might actually make something of that.""\n\nIn part two of our conversation, we get specific about Mr. Wallach’s work with Spotify, and how blockchain technology could play a role in its growth.', ""Bitcoin’s leading global merchant processor, BitPay, has reportedly begun massive layoffs to cut costs at their Atlanta headquarters. This, in conjunction with this week’s change in “Free Plan” pricing terms point to a situation of financial peril for one of Bitcoin’s most stalwart corporations.\n\nTimes are tough at BitPay\n\nYou could trace issues all the way back to the BitPay-funded college football “Bitcoin Bowl” last December. The financial outlay was considerable and the return on investment negligible. Boosting the mainstream image of Bitcoin was noble, but it was a three-year annual commitment signed through December of 2016. In the aftermath of the first year of spending on this venture, nine employees were laid off weeks later.\n\nEarlier this week, reports of a change in the “Free Plan” surfaced, which severely cut service from the original terms. Originally, the starter plan for merchants was an unlimited amount of transactions.\n\n“Today BitPay is proud to announce a new free plan which offers basic payment processing free-of-charge, forever,” BitPay Co-Founder and Executive Chairman Tony Gallippi said at the time on the corporate blog in July 2014.\n\nIt seems that forever only lasts about fourteen months, current customers notwithstanding, as the terms for merchants has just been changed on Wednesday to a capped limit for no-cost Bitcoin transactions of US$1,000 monthly, then 1% charges on transactions, thereafter. Obviously, this was done to increase company revenue, but most merchants aren’t doing that many bitcoin transactions monthly at the present time, so the effects are not widespread.\n\nToday, reports of the current string of layoffs are hitting the Atlanta main office hard, with sources claiming as many as twenty have been let go. Reddit user whatthefuuuuuu, who claims to work within BitPay, has been passing along information on the situation over the past 24 hours. The marketing and newly-implemented “CoPay” departments seem to have been the hardest hit.\n\nThe post reads:\n\n“I'm not going to take pictures of coworkers leaving with boxes in their arms in tears. Call the office and ask Sara the receptionist. You could also just come by the office if you are in Atlanta. Look at how few members are on our GitHub page now compared to yesterday. Look at some LinkedIn pages. Some are already updated. Email them using their first name @bitpay.com and watch it bounce back.”\n\nAnother post late last night reads:\n\n“There is not a reason to say it's not safe right now. We did keep some developers to ensure payment processing continues to function. Just don't expect much in the way of support since almost all support staff were let go.”\n\n$1.8 million gone\n\nThis news coincides with the story we reported on last week of BitPay being scammed out of US$1.8 million in Bitcoin by a slick computer hacker. The thief managed to get CEO Stephen Pair to send thousands of bitcoin to him directly by commandeering an email account of another BitPay executive. The layoffs may be a simple matter of cause and effect, similar to the period after the Bitcoin Bowl in January.\n\nBitPay has been one of the, if not the most successful Bitcoin companies at attracting mainstream merchants to the payment platform. Major acquisitions include PayPal, Microsoft, Dell Computers, and United Way. Their goal as of last fall was to gain over one million merchants by the end of 2016."", 'Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded to the backlash against his company when it was revealed that it filed nine Bitcoin patent applications with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n\nBacklash\n\nThe USPTO was said to have received the submissions on March 17 of this year. Immediately after this news went public it created quite the stir in the community mostly upset with the Coinbase decision. Many took to social media to voice their opinion including Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik who said:\n\n""Contrast: 1. Coinbase Patents 9 Bitcoin Products 2. Tesla: All Our Patent Are Belong To You, Publicly calling on bitcoin companies to follow the Linux route and defensively pool patents for collective good.""\n\nCoinbase responds\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded by telling him that they needed to research how they felt about patents. He also explained that the intent of the patents were not to drive smaller companies out of business, but to protect themselves from services “engaging in patent warfare.” Still many in the community were not pleased by this response calling Coinbase “evil” and asking how they can patent ideas they did not invent.\n\nArmstrong, seemingly concerned with the public backlash, penned an article on Medium entitled: “How We Think About Patents at Coinbase”. The CEO states that he would “personally prefer to see a world where software patents don\'t exist.” Though he doesn\'t see this as a real possibility and thus, Coinbase has filed for these patents because they are a form of “warfare.” This is because the company is afraid of patent trolls, which Armstrong mentions this throughout the article, while emphasizing that Coinbase only “might” get the patents.\n\nArmstrong describes the patent operations in the tech field with great detail and says his company didn\'t invent the copyright system but notes that if you\'re running a tech service and don\'t apply for patents then ""you are doing it wrong,"" while adding:\n\n“It is an unfortunate game we all must play, but we didn’t invent the rules. (If you’ll forgive the colloquialism, don’t hate the player, hate the game.)”\n\nPatent now, open source later?\n\nHowever, Armstrong mentions a few ideas that giant tech firms have used in the past to help open source patents. He says they are looking into all the options such as the way Linux opens sources its content or how Elon Musk patented over 200 copyrights and open sourced all of them afterwards. Armstrong says he has great respect for the open code community, particularly Tesla\'s initiative and says Coinbase is “much earlier in the process, but generally following a similar strategy.”\n\nWhen asked whether the company was “evil” and “trying to destroy bitcoin” the Coinbase CEO reassured that “history will show that we’ll do the right thing with them.” He also noted that “if we didn’t apply for them, somebody else would have,” and believes that it is much better if a Bitcoin company holds the rights to these ideas instead of a company with no ties to the digital currency at all.\n\nArmstrong concluded:\n\n""Let us see if we can find the right structure to get these patents (if we are awarded them) into the right place to ensure the future success of bitcoin. I’ll update this post once we have researched some options and made a decision how to move forward.""\n\nDo you agree with Coinbase? Should such ideas be patented? Share below.', 'When you begin to delve into the question of what money really is, you must be prepared for some metaphysics. Money, currencies and other such media of exchange differ markedly in their backgrounds and means of operation, and have changed quite recently into forms that are barely understandable.\n\nFor centuries, minted coins not only represented the value and trust of banks, their depositors and eventually nation-states, but also were deemed valuable because they were made from precious metals like gold and silver. These metals are difficult to move around in large quantities, and so banknotes were invented as early as the seventh century in China and brought to Europe in the 13th century. Unlike coins, banknotes were not treated as valuable in themselves since they were simply printed on otherwise worthless paper. Rather, they served as a form of promissory note or IOU that could be presented to the banks that issued them in exchange for their face value in precious metal, coins or bullion.\n\nIn the 20th century, most central banks and governments stopped backing up their currencies with precious metals, and yet banknotes maintain fluctuating values, with some in high demand as media for exchange both domestically and internationally. Dollars and euros are highly regarded and preferred currencies for international commerce, as well as for stocking private bank accounts.\n\nNow we have bitcoins and other digital currencies that exist entirely in blocks of zeros and ones and are even “mined” by machines running algorithms. And earlier this month, bitcoins and their ilk were officially deemed commodities by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which will now regulate them.\n\nSo as the greenbacks and quarters in our pockets slowly disappear, replaced by strings of digits stored on our smartphones, and money takes another step away from being tied to anything of value, a philosophical question comes to mind: does money still exist? And if so, what gives it its value?\n\nThe Guardian explains bitcoin.\n\nWhat’s value without value?\n\nMoney is a “fungible” item, which means that exchange of any one portion for a portion of equal value is not a “taking” of property. That is, you don’t own a particular US$100 bill. You own the value it represents.\n\nThis is how banks have long worked, since when you deposit your money, you are not entitled to receive the same coins or bills back as you deposited. This is also how “fractional reserve” banking began (in which banks do not keep all the curency on deposit “within” the bank, just some fraction of it) and was not regarded somehow as theft. People took their money to a bank, they were given a note of deposit, which entitled them to withdraw the same amount plus some interest, but they were not entitled to the same coins or bills that they deposited.\n\nThe money on deposit in a bank is not all physically in the bank (excepting that which is in safety deposit boxes) and has not been really since banking was invented. When you deposit a sum, you no longer own the paper or other medium of exchange used for the deposit, legally. What you own is a debt and obligation by the bank to return the equivalent amount of money with interest.\n\nJohn Searle has described things like money as “some special sort” of social objects. That is, X (coins, bills, strings of digits) work as Y (money) in context C (an economy, coffee shop, bank, etc). In the case of money, anything can conceivably take on the Y role even without an X (think a barter economy). Where metals, then bills and now bits in computer memory take the role of X, money might well be a “free-standing” Y, meaning it could exist without anything to represent it except the web of intentional states (the debts and obligations) that make more familiar forms of money function. It’s only physical manifestation might be a note in a ledger.\n\nWithout precious metal standards backing national currencies, and in the age of digital transactions, money is decreasingly tied to banknotes, just as its ties to metals have faded. Digital ledgers track exchanges and accounts, with digital strings in computer memories representing the trust and value we once attached to more solid things like coins, bills and notes, in more ephemeral digitally encoded, instantly accessible forms attached to cellphones, computers and chip cards.\n\nA brave new world\n\nNew types of cryptocurrencies (where cryptography protects its integrity) like bitcoin and others take the concept one step further, distributing the banking to all its users, tying the transactions and ledgers to no particular party but to all users at once. This is similar to mirrored bank servers, but bitcoin is mirrored among all bitcoin owners.\n\nA bitcoin is as ownable as dollars are when they are deposited in a bank. Skipping the stage of physical, fungible currencies, bitcoins exist by virtue of their representations in a ledger in cyberspace. The information encoded in a massively distributed and constantly updated blockchain is incapable of the exclusivity required for owning objects in the traditional sense. But the same is true of the information that tracks most of the money in the world. Money in nearly every denomination exists and flows in a similar state, represented by digital bits.\n\nBitcoins nonetheless lack some of the institutional guarantees that other types of money has due to nations and their laws.\n\nTrading on trust\n\nDepositors to banks are protected in their debts by states, generally, and through contracts with their banks. State insurance and the contractual guarantee that a bank will pay back what has been put into them mean that there is some force behind our trust in the continued existence of a person’s wealth while digitally stored in a bank’s servers. The blockchain exists on many servers at once, spread across the universe of bitcoin owners.\n\nWithout government insurance or contractual guarantees, only mutual trust maintains the value and integrity of the system. What bitcoin owners own is the debt, just as those who own money in banks own debts that are recorded in bits. They do not own the bits that comprise the information representing that debt, nor the information itself, they own the social object – the money – that those bits represent.\n\nBank ledgers exist. They are tangible, even though digital, and they record the debts owed among parties. While cyberspace is ephemeral, it is still real and physically based. Digital bank ledgers now track money without the necessity for physical transfers of currencies.\n\nBitcoins too exist as digital records of obligations, physically encoded on servers of those who hold them, propagated and distributed for transparency and security, encrypted for privacy. Bitcoins are as real as money in banks. What’s most fascinating about these new digital cryptocurrencies is how much they reveal about the surreal nature of currencies and wealth in our digitized economy.\n\nIf bitcoins are as real as any other money, how real can money be?\n\nDavid Koepsell, Adjunct Associate Professor, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.', 'When you think about it, Bitcoin transactions should be simple: I send money from one Bitcoin address to another. All I need to know is the origin, destination and amount, right? It turns out that Bitcoin transactions are much more complicated than this. We’re going to learn how to read a Bitcoin transaction simply, as well as understand all that gibberish that generally follows.\n\n[tweet_box design=”box_02?]Bitcoin addresses don’t actually exist like you may think they do.[/tweet_box]\n\nThe blockchain is not a ledger of all the accounts that exist and their respective balances, but rather a comprehensive history of all Bitcoin transactions. In fact, the entire blockchain is full of transactions and not much else (and a bit of data that connect the blocks).\n\nBitcoin is a system designed to avoid having to trust account balances (maintained by third parties), and in fact allows everyone to verify and track every single fraction of a coin that ever existed to make sure no one is gaming the system. This can be done by making all transactions public and verifiable.\n\nSee, Bitcoins don’t actually move between addresses, they actually exist in virtual vaults with special cryptographic locks. Instead of sending them, you just change the locks. If Alice “owns Bitcoins”, she actually just has a cryptographic key to a vault that has BTC inside. And when Alice wants to send those Bitcoins to Bob, she just unlocks her lock and puts the Bitcoins in a vault with Bob’s lock on it. Now Bob “owns” them.\n\nVaults and locks are free and easy to make, so if Alice only wants to send some of the coins (and keep the rest), she can create a new vault with her lock and put the change in it. Every time someone opens a lock, the whole network needs to be able to verify it (otherwise they will consider it cheating), so a cryptographic signature is used to prove you have the key to that lock.\n\nSince this is all done digitally, a Bitcoin transaction is simply a record of:\n\nInput(s) : signature proving you can actually open a locked vault.\n\n: signature proving you can actually open a locked vault. Output(s): how many Bitcoins are placed in each new vault and with what lock.\n\nPro tip:\n\nThe sum of your outputs cannot be higher than the sum of your inputs (otherwise you’re making Bitcoins out of thin air), but it can be lower. The difference in the sum of inputs and outputs equals to the miner fee. This means that you will never see any reference to miner’s fees in a transaction, rather you simply infer it: one BTC inputs – 0.9 BTC outputs = 0.1 BTC miner fee. Bitcoin wallets manage this automatically for you.\n\nSo what does a Bitcoin transaction actually look like?\n\n“Raw” Bitcoin transactions are actually very difficult to read, which is why there is a plethora of “block explorers”, which are websites or other software used to “translate” and more easily read what’s going on in the blockchain. For this example, we will look at Blocktrail, but you can really use any of many (and trust me, there are many).\n\nBlocktrail, like many block explorers, will show more information about the transaction than the transaction itself: things like when it was first seen, how long it took to confirm; other explorers will tell you how much money was “sent” and how much was “change”, etc. Most of this extra information is useful, but it is also mostly guessing. Only the transaction itself in the blockchain can be verified cryptographically.\n\nThe following transaction (following the convention of being named after the “hash” of the transaction itself: 61a1..0b0c) is a pretty simple and common transaction: it collects BTC from two different inputs (previous transactions) for a total of 159 bits and then sends them to two different outputs for a total of 59 bits. Note that there are 100 bits leftover, which were never used in the transaction outputs: they were leftover for miner fees.\n\nThe basics: inputs, outputs and values\n\nThese are the most important parts of the transaction page, they tell us where the money is coming from and where it’s going. Let’s say we want to confirm receiving a Bitcoin payment (let’s say 50 bits to the address 1AFc…7VeQ), so we’ll look for our address in the list of outputs, and confirm that the correct amount of coins were sent there. In this case, we see that the transaction indeed includes our payment.\n\nThe other output (which sends nine bits to 3GmY…6J4S) is probably their change address, but that’s extrapolation, and honestly not much of our business. We can follow each address by clicking on it, or follow each input/output by clicking the arrow next to it. The ‘P2SH’ label means that the address (the lock on the vault) is a script hash, which means that the address allows for the recipient to use more complex signatures (such as multisig).\n\nMore information\n\nThe information above the inputs and outputs could be of use, such as when Blocktrail first saw the transaction (“Relay time”), as well as how long it took until it was confirmed in a block (“Time until confirmed”). Of course, it will show us in which block it was confirmed (“Block”), as well as how many confirmations it has (“Confirmations”). The “Priority” is Blocktrail’s way of calculating how good the fees are on this transaction (based on coin age and transaction size in bytes).\n\nRaw information\n\nThe real, hard information about the transaction is actually listed in the scripts on the bottom: that’s the “raw” information about each of the inputs and outputs. The output script includes the cryptographic lock and vault that you’re sending the Bitcoins to. The input script includes the signature proving that the owner of the vault can open the lock determined by the previous output (from the previous transaction).\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more in depth about Bitcoin transactions, I highly recommend browsing through the Transactions chapter in Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos.']"

The Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM turns your cash into bitcoin in under 20 seconds.” Now it redirects to MikeTysonLive.com which scantily mentions Tyson’s Bitcoin involvement.\n\nComing soon… http://t.co/Blf592VtUW… Changing the way we get change. — Mike Tyson (@MikeTyson) July 25, 2015\n\nAt the time of the announcement, CryptoCoinsNews questioned the legitimacy of a such Bitcoin ATM.\n\nFeatured image from Denis Makarenko / Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'What, exactly, would happen if everyone just dropped the money they were using (USD, the euro, the yen, etc.) and resorted to dealing in bitcoin from here on out?\n\nAlso read: “Blockchain Technology” is Bringing Bitcoin to the Mainstream\n\nThis is a question that we’ve likely entertained on an individual or otherwise small scale at some point or another. As a civilization, however, it’s not likely we’ve actually sat down and thought through the full results we’d likely face if Bitcoin were accepted on a global scale, and all other forms of finance became obsolete.\n\nFor one thing, banks as we know it would be things of the past. We’d say goodbye forever, most likely, the current working methods of entities such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase Bank and all the other financial powerhouses we still put so much trust and faith in. Furthermore, those secretly advocating for bitcoin and related currencies and using it within a specific realm of privacy would likely feel free to introduce themselves to the world. After all, they wouldn’t necessarily be doing anything wrong, and they wouldn’t be engaged in anything that their friends and neighbors hadn’t heard of, so obviously this creates a whole new side to the table.\n\nIn basic terms, one of the great results would be that we would likely receive a little more financial freedom with global bitcoin acceptance and legalization. Finances would likely be stronger, as one bitcoin, despite several drops is still worth over $200 in USD alone. We would also likely witness more ease in the way we use money and how we work in finance in general. With the entire world using the same kind of currency, international business overseas would probably become much simpler than it is right now.\n\nBut would there be a downside as well? This is certainly a possibility. It can’t all be lush, green meadows and honey-flavored lollipops. There is a dark side and a light side to every equation. One of the big problems is that bitcoin, despite the security presented through the blockchain, is still susceptible to hacks and vulnerabilities that have been exposed rather heavily in the past through the collapse of Mt. Gox, the attack on Bitstamp early this year, and other similar occasions. Naturally, security and digital strength would likely improve over time and thereby put a damper on events of a criminal nature, but it’s hard to say exactly when and how this would occur.\n\nFurthermore, as digital currencies have become more popular, we have witnessed the rise of things such as the BitLicense and several forms of copycat regulation throughout the United States and other areas. As more limitations are put in place, several businesses are packing up and calling it quits in areas such as New York, the home of Benjamin Lawsky’s dreaded document. Worldwide legalization and acceptance of Bitcoin would label it as a global currency, not simply a national currency, and we would more than likely witness the growth of worldwide regulation in an attempt to keep every country working in the same manner to prevent problems. There would be further limitations put on how we currently handle bitcoin, and businesses would be forced to suck it up and play by the rules. After all, bitcoin would no longer be “new” or “different” or “lonely.” It would classify as “regular” currency. Such action might even lead people to become nostalgic for the money they once used, whether it’s the euro or the yen or anything else, and many might find themselves attempting to use traditional currency in the same way they’re using Bitcoin now.\n\nWhat do you guys think? What do you foresee as the possible results of worldwide bitcoin acceptance? Post your comments below!\n\nFeatured image courtesy of coincommerce.co.\n\nOriginally posted on: What Would Happen if Bitcoin Was Accepted Globally?', ""Aiga Gosh is researcher in international law at the China University of Political Science & Law. In this article, she briefly examines China's economic history, its currency controls and the rise of bitcoin in the country.\n\nChina's monetary policy and currency has largely been in mess for a long time. Only in 1994 did China manage to set a unified, official exchange rate abandoning a dual system, with both a fixed and a market rate existing side-by-side.\n\nIt has tightly controlled the flow of capital across its border, which has enabled Chinese authorities to steer the economy and control business.\n\nAs The Economist stated back in 2010, China's approach towards monetary policy has been incremental. In 2009, China put forward reforms allowing those exporting to China to price their goods in yuan, instead of dollars, and deposit the proceeds in offshore corporate accounts, although with low interest rates and mostly in Hong Kong.\n\nSince then, both deposits and the number of firms seeking to tap them, have increased, while offshore and onshore markets remain separated by tight control: companies cannot borrow yuan from the mainland, they must earn it through trade.\n\nCrudely put, yuan flows out of China only if goods or services flow the other way. Offshore yuan does not easily travel back into China either. The currency represents a claim on a country's underlying assets.\n\nChina has also signed currency-swap deals with Argentina, Belarus, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea. Further more, it began allowing certain countries to use the yuan to pay for Chinese imports, and it now lets enterprises based in Shanghai and in four cities in the southern province of Guangdong use it to pay for imports into China.\n\nHave those steps made capital accounts freely convertible? While authorities have been weighing the pros and cons of to what extent to open up capital flows, bitcoin has done it seemingly overnight.\n\nWhy has bitcoin had success in China?\n\nOne of the reasons bitcoin has been relatively successful in China is that the Chinese already have experience of using virtual currency, such as Q coins, which were introduced in 2002.\n\nQ coins are issued by Tencent QQ – an instant messaging software service company with more than 800 million active users that offers a variety of services, such as online social games, music, shopping and microblogging.\n\nFrom my experience, when asking Chinese people for their email address, around four out of 10 have an address on the QQ server.\n\nQ coins can be purchased via a bank, telephone or Q card at an official price of 1 yuan per coin, and can be used for purchasing Tencent services, such as electronic greeting cards and online games.\n\nOn top of this existing exposure to virtual currency is the fact that bitcoin gives an opportunity for people to move money out of China and transact with international merchants/customers. This is important as there is currently a 350,000 yuan (around $50,000) limit on overseas investment.\n\nChinese exchange platforms, such as OKCoin, BTCC and Huobi, allow trading without charging a fee, thus, using bitcoin is faster and cheaper compared to traditional money transfer methods, such as Western Union.\n\nThis is important for the millions of Chinese who study and work abroad.\n\nZennon Kapron, financial technology expert and owner of the Shanghai-based consultancy Kapronasia, told CoinDesk that China's main experimentation in the bitcoin space is in trading and the manufacture and operation of mining equipment. He argues that, with this being the focus, bitcoin is unlikely to cause a financial revolution in China.\n\nAccording to Kapron, to work in China, bitcoin has to become accessible and useful for the masses in daily transactions. This might be challenging. Merchant fees in China are lower than in the West and platforms such as Alipay and WeChat/Tenpay dominate the mobile and non-bank payment market.\n\nWhile this might be true for the mainland, in greater China, and Taiwan, in particular, bitcoin seems to have a really kicked off.\n\nBitcoin purchasing has been launched at thousands of Taiwan's stores, including FamilyMart, OK mart, Hi-Life stores and the largest chain 7-11, since the beginning of 2015.\n\nCustomers have to create an order for bitcoins using an app or web-based wallet from Maicoin or BitoEX (the main competitors in Taiwanese bitcoin services), and then hand cash to the shopkeeper to complete the transaction, or use the regular bank ATMs. To shop, customers need to display a barcode on their phone or tablet for the convenience store cashier to scan.\n\nThis presents a good opportunity for those on the mainland to observe whether bitcoin will increase its user base and daily usage.\n\nRegulation\n\nIn China, as in Taiwan, one of the biggest hurdles is that of regulatory approval. People's Bank of China issued a statement relating to bitcoin on 5th of December, 2013. It prohibited financial institutions and third party payment processors from dealing with bitcoin directly. Bitcoin remained legal for private individuals to own and trade and exchange platforms were allowed to continue business.\n\nAfter the statement, the price of bitcoin worldwide dropped from its record high of over $1,100 by more than 20%. The statement had a dramatic effect on the market share of large bitcoin exchanges in the country.\n\nSuch a cautious decision by Chinese authorities was to be expected, namely to remove the direct risk to the financial system which might undermine China's economic growth.\n\nJust like the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone, established in September 2013, to test a number of reforms regarding foreign investment, arbitration and legal services, and e-commerce before their nationwide implementation, bitcoin has been moved aside to be watched from afar.\n\nIn my opinion, Chinese authorities will, first, closely monitor developments of bitcoin around the world, then adopt the best practices regarding regulating bitcoin (the UK and United States might be examples to look upon) tailoring them to suit Chinese characteristics.\n\nAs for now, it is clear that 'bitcoin fever' is not over and it is interesting to see how it develops in China. The main questions now are: Will bitcoin affect the current financial system and the use of money in China? If so, what political implications might this have?\n\nThis article is an edited extract from Aiga Gosh's paper titled 'Bitcoin Rush: the Past, the Present and the Future'.\n\nTaiwan and Chinese flag images via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The company behind it, 21 Inc., has raised $120 million from prominent investors like PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and the well-known firm of Andreessen Horowitz. According to this list of Bitcoin investments, that makes it the most lavishly funded Bitcoin startup ever.\n\nSo this week\'s announcement left a lot of people confused. For $399, you can get a tiny computer with a customized chip that allows you to generate bitcoins. An incredibly small quantity of bitcoins, in fact — according to one back-of-the-envelope calculation, it will generate around 10 cents\' worth of bitcoin per day if run constantly. And depending on where you live, the electricity required to power the device could cost more than the value of the bitcoins generated.\n\nThe backers of 21 believe that the ability to generate small quantities of bitcoins is going to become a standard component in digital devices — just as a wifi chip is today. They envision a future where digital currency serves as a lubricant for a wide variety of electronic transactions that aren\'t possible with today\'s computers. If 21\'s technology works, it could deliver something technologists have dreamed about for decades: a practical system for paying for content and online services with tiny payments. For example, 21\'s technology could be used to power a jukebox that plays ad-free music, or a camera that automatically rents its own online storage.\n\nAnd 21 has built some impressive technology to help realize this vision. But the vision itself seems to have some gaping holes in it — holes so big that I\'m skeptical 21\'s technology will take off.\n\n21 is selling a chip to turn electricity into money\n\nYou\'ve probably heard advertisements telling you to text to a certain number in order to make a $10 contribution to a particular charity. In this transaction, the phone company acts as the middleman, putting the $10 charge on your next monthly phone bill. That makes things more convenient for customers, who don\'t have to pull out a credit card at the time of donation — or worry that the credit card might get misused.\n\nThe technical details of how the 21 Bitcoin Computer works is complicated, but at a basic level, you can think of it as a clever hack for putting charges onto your electricity bill. Inside the 21 Bitcoin Computer is a chip that can efficiently engage in ""mining"": performing difficult mathematical operations that can generate new bitcoins. These bitcoins have real financial value, but the process isn\'t free — the chip consumes a lot of power.\n\nThe 21 Bitcoin Computer isn\'t designed for people who want to become professional Bitcoin miners — there are more sophisticated products for that already. Rather, 21 believes that the ability to generate a few pennies\' worth of bitcoins per day will open up totally new types of markets that don\'t exist right now.\n\nImagine a jukebox that pays for its own songs\n\nThe device 21 is selling right now isn\'t the version of its technology that will eventually be offered to the general public. Instead, it\'s a proof of concept aimed at developers who — 21 hopes — will begin creating applications that use the 21 chip\'s capabilities. Over the next few years, they expect the chip will get smaller and dramatically cheaper, to the point where it can be built into a wide variety of third-party devices, much as chips from Intel are today.\n\nYou can think of the 21 computer as a clever hack for putting charges onto your electricity bill\n\nImagine, for example, buying a small speaker that acts as an ad-free jukebox system. You plug it in, name any song, and the device starts playing it. And you never have to pull out a credit card. Instead, the jukebox is generating a fraction of a penny for each song it plays and sending it to the relevant copyright owner. Average consumers never have to think about it — or even understand how it works.\n\nOther 21-enabled products could work in a similar way. There could be a camera that automatically purchases enough online storage for the pictures and videos you take. There might be a tablet that automatically detects wifi networks that are willing to rent out anonymous access for a few pennies\' worth of bitcoins. And maybe entrepreneurs can think of other clever ways to use small amounts of digital cash to make our lives more convenient.\n\nAs the number of connected devices in our homes and offices grows, 21\'s technology could help avoid an orphan device problem. That\'s a situation where companies stop supporting these connected devices, leaving them in a broken or — even worse — insecure state. If each device is able to generate a small Bitcoin maintenance fee each month, it could provide manufacturers the funds they need to continue supporting devices long after they were created.\n\n21 hopes to enable practical micropayments\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering why anyone would want to buy a weird money-printing chip instead of making payments through the regular financial system. There are two basic reasons.\n\nOne is that for many applications it will be a hassle to input credit card information into a special-purpose device. The Bitcoin jukebox I mentioned in the previous section might not have a keyboard or screen, for example, and it would be convenient if you could just plug it in and have it start playing music.\n\nThe more fundamental issue, though, is that the transaction fees of traditional financial networks make very small financial transactions impractical. The overhead of credit card networks means that the smaller transactions get, the larger the fraction that gets eaten up by fees. This is why you rarely see online goods that are cheaper than the 99-cent songs in the iTunes store. Below a dollar, the economics of credit card payments don\'t work very well.\n\nThis is the real magic of 21\'s platform: The standard Bitcoin network isn\'t a great platform for micro payments either, but it\'s an open software platform. And 21 has apparently developed technology to use the Bitcoin network to make very small payments more efficiently than is possible with other payment technologies.\n\nWhy users probably won\'t like Bitcoin micropayments\n\nTechnologists have been dreaming of building practical micropayments for a very long time. There have been a number of attempts to build micropayment systems, and so far, none of these systems have really taken off. The investors behind 21 are making a big bet that Bitcoin is the technology that will finally make the concept work.\n\nPeople have been trying to make micropayments work for so long that the internet theorist Clay Shirky wrote an article way back in 2000 explaining why the micropayment experiments of the dot-com boom hadn\'t taken off. More recently, as others have tackled the concept, he\'s written multiple follow-up articles on the topic since then.\n\nIn a nutshell, Shirky\'s argument is that micropayment systems fail because users find them annoying. ""There is a certain amount of anxiety involved in any decision to buy, no matter how small, and it derives not from the interface used or the time required, but from the very act of deciding,"" he wrote. ""Micropayments, like all payments, require a comparison: \'Is this much of X worth that much of Y?\' There is a minimum mental transaction cost created by this fact that cannot be optimized away.""\n\nOn the surface, it might seem like 21\'s micropayment technology actually could optimize away these transaction costs. After all, when consumers buy new household appliances, they don\'t spend much time worrying about how much power they\'ll consume. Why should customers worry about a new generation of devices that take a bit of extra power and convert it into money?\n\nBut if you think about how this would work in practice, it becomes clear that there would be some serious difficulties. Imagine a future where you have a dozen devices in your house with 21\'s bitcoin mining chip in them. One month, your electricity bill is suddenly $20 higher than you expected.\n\nMaybe it was just a hot month and your air conditioning was running on overtime. Maybe some of your 21-based devices got hacked, and bad guys are stealing your electricity to generate bitcoins for themselves. Maybe your teenage son recently bought a new off-brand device that generates a lot more bitcoins (and wastes a lot more power) than it promised on the box — and sends the extra cash back to its sketchy manufacturer.\n\nDevices with built-in bitcoin mining chips would have to be replaced every couple of years\n\nThe problem is that you wouldn\'t know, and there would be no easy way to find out. It\'s not like your power bill will have an itemized list showing how much electricity each device is consuming. You\'d be forced to start measuring the power consumption of the devices around your house — exactly the kind of accounting hassle 21\'s technology was supposed to eliminate.\n\nIn practice, few people are going to want to worry about this kind of issue. It\'s only going to take a few stories of devices being hacked — or unscrupulous manufacturers overcharging customers — for customers to decide they want to steer clear of devices with built-in bitcoin mining chips.\n\n21 chips will get less and less efficient\n\nThe 21 approach has another big problem, too: Bitcoin mining hardware tends to become obsolete quickly. All of the Bitcoin mining chips in the world compete to win a fixed pool of bitcoins. As new, more efficient chips come on the market, the number of bitcoins won by older, slower chips will go down over time.\n\nWhen you buy a shiny new 21-powered device, it might only cost 70 cents\' worth of power to generate $1 worth of bitcoins. After a year, it might take $1.20 worth of power to generate $1 worth of bit coins. A year after that it might cost $2 to generate the same $1.\n\nSo devices with built-in bitcoin mining chips would have to be replaced every couple of years to avoid having them waste more and more electricity.\n\nOf course, a device that only works for a couple of years could still be useful. But in that case, it might be more efficient to just load it with pre-generated bitcoins — or even better, just have the manufacturer provide the necessary services for free and charge an extra $10 or $20 for the device. Customers like clear and transparent pricing; effectively billing costs to your electricity bill is just the opposite.', 'Credit cards are one of the most common payment methods around the world, yet they are also one of the least secure forms of payment. There is no other payment method in history suffering from such a high rate of fraud and chargebacks, as these cards were never intended to be used for online payments. Several banks have issued a new version of their credit cards, which should make them more secure.\n\nAlso read: 20 GBP Note Goes Polymer, Competitors Embrace Blockchain Technology\n\nThe EMV Microchip In Your Credit Card\n\nWhenever someone holds up a credit card, there will be a plastic-looking chip on the left side of the card. This chip is designed to be read by credit card processing terminals all over the world, to make the payment system more convenient and streamlined. Many people believe this chip holds all of the card owner’s sensitive information, but that is not the case.\n\nTo be more precise, that wasn’t the case, until now. Various banks around the world have started shipping out a new version of credit cards, packed with an EMV microchip. Rather than storing all of the cardholder’s information on the magnetic stripe on the back of the card – which is easy to copy and steal -, these EMV chips will contain all of the sensitive data.\n\nSwiping a card at any location will no longer be such a high-level security threat to card holders, as the sensitive information can not be read through card skimming anymore. Making a duplicate of the valuable credit card information itself becomes much harder, as fraudsters would need tools to replicate an exact copy of the EMV chip. Up until this point, no such breach has been reported.\n\nBut there new types of credit cards will also bring some minor changes for both consumers and merchants. When paying at a location with an EMV-enabled card, the checkout process will take a few extra seconds to complete. Merchants, on the other hand, will need to install new payment terminals if they want to be compatible with EMV-enabled card payments. Failure to do so could result in credit card fraud charges being footed by the retailer.\n\nGrasping At Straws To Keep Bitcoin At Bay\n\nWhile the efforts to make credit card payment should be applauded, these new chips are one of the top financial innovations the sector has seen in the past 50 years. Financial institutions are grasping at straws to keep consumers away from other viable alternatives, such as Bitcoin, which are not in control of the banks or governments.\n\nMerchants will have to upgrade their infrastructure at an additional cost to accommodate for these EMV-enabled payments. If they decide to accept Bitcoin as a payment method, however, there is no additional infrastructure to set up. Plus, they will be charged lower payment processing fees, and are protected from Bitcoin price volatility.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these new EMV chips to make credit cards more secure?

When it reappeared as a payment option this week, users were stumped as to why.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Andreas Hronopoulos revealed bitcoin\'s reappearance was a result of Naughty America\'s \'virtual porn\' launch, which triggered a wave of online support for the currency.\n\nHe added:\n\n""We found VR is geared towards a Millenial audience, they seem to have an interest in bitcoin – it aligns more with how they think, how they spend their money.""\n\nHronopoulos said his team had overlooked the demographics of its \'2D\' users – the majority of which are \'Generation X\' – during Naughty America\'s initial integration with bitcoin payment processor BitPay.\n\nIn hindsight it\'s not surprising that these users ""didn\'t connect"" with the currency as some still make payments by check, he added.\n\nBitcoin surcharge\n\nWhile the announcement was received on Reddit with the usual fanfare, users flagged the fact that bitcoin subscriptions carried a surcharge.\n\nA check of the site yesterday showed one month ($29.95) was priced 20% higher than Naughty America\'s credit card option, while annual subscriptions would cost over $48 extra.\n\nHronopoulos dismissed this price discrepancy as ""probably just coincidental"" and likely related to A/B testing on the site. ""Do not put any stock into that,"" he said.\n\nHowever, emails from Naughty America\'s customer support appear to contradict this, indicating bitcoin customers are charged more to cover ""processing costs"".\n\nBitcoin\'s Millenials\n\nIt\'s now common wisdom that bitcoin\'s core user base is predominately male, young and tech-savvy, and so far the figures back that up.\n\nIn June, a CoinDesk survey of nearly 4,000 bitcoin users found that over 90% identified as male. The majority (55%) were aged between 19 and 34 (Millenials), while only 33% of respondents were aged between 35 and 54 (Gen X).\n\n""Every generation finds an interest in a currency they like and they stick with,"" Hronopoulos said. While the currency might never reach Generation X, it might not need to: Millenials are the biggest generation out there – with spending power estimated to reach $2.45 trillion in 2015.\n\nThis year, North Americans in this group are expected to spend more than $62bn on media content alone.\n\nBut does bitcoin stand a chance outside its inner circle? Hronopoulos says yes: ""I think the whole world is pretty optimistic, I think you\'re seeing that now in the press."" For him, the fate of VR and bitcoin are tied:\n\n""We are one of three in the adult industry that is actively producing or creating pre-recorded VR. I think that you will see bitcoin introduced on a much larger scale as VR continues to grow.""\n\nVR headset image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Many are also wondering if it truly has a place in contemporary society. Will bitcoin be a long-lasting trend, or will it die out? Can it survive the ups-and-downs, or will its popularity fade away?\n\nThere is evidence circulating to suggest that the coin may be at risk of ceasing to exist, but that the technology behind it may become as revolutionary as the Internet itself. Through a recent survey, the World Economic Forum has labeled the blockchain as one of the largest and most influential trends currently shaping our digital world. Banks and businesses also continue to experiment with blockchain technology on a regular basis. “Permissioned blockchains” have been introduced to banks in Japan. The general consensus behind them is that they will increase security while reducing costs and normalizing infrastructure. Furthermore, a number of high-profile companies such as computer giant IBM claim that the blockchain is the undeniable doorway into the future.\n\nBut what can we say about the coin itself? Well, we know that the price, while presently stable, can change at any minute (and it usually does). This has often led to feelings of distrust and worry amongst users and the general public. Furthermore, companies like BitPay are believed to be cutting their staff in order to save on costs and keep up with bitcoin’s current pace.

Rattner, in an opinion piece in the New York Times on Saturday, called Fiorina’s time as the CEO of HP “short and disastrous.” Rattner said HP’s acquisition of Compaq, pushed through by Fiorina, caused an amount of divisiveness at the company that Rattner says he never saw in his 33-year career on Wall Street. He said that while Fiorina did serve during a tough period for tech stocks, HP’s shares did worse than rivals. And Rattner said Fiorina has correctly been named to a number of lists of worst executives of all time.\n\nRattner says it is perhaps unfair to criticize Fiorina for the 30,000 layoffs that happened at HP under her watch.

But Rattner says voters should note that during the time of the layoffs, again a difficult time for tech and HP, Fiorina took home $100 million in compensation, and she pushed for HP to acquire five private jets.\n\nRattner says less attention has been paid to Fiorina’s time at Lucent, the job she had before going to HP. Fiorina was never the boss at Lucent, but Rattner says she oversaw the use of a number of aggressive sales tactics to boost revenue. Rattner says shortly after Fiorina left Lucent, the company “veered off a cliff.”\n\nRattner said strikingly few former colleagues have come to Fiorina’s success. And he says her own defense of comparing herself to other business leaders who were fired, like Steve Jobs and Oprah Winfrey, is silly. They rebounded to remarkable business success. Fiorina never did.\n\nRattner, to be sure, has had his own business troubles. In 2010, the former investment banker and private equity executive agreed to pay $6.2 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle charges that his firm used a consultant who essentially paid kickbacks to win business from a New York State pension fund. A number of other private equity firms were investigated as well, and Rattner did not admit or deny the allegations. What’s more, Rattner is not without his bias. He is a long-time democratic donor, and was recruited by the Obama administration to help it with GM and the other car companies in the wake of the bailouts.\n\nFortune has done it’s own analysis of Fiorina’s time as HP’s CEO.']"
09/27/2015,"['No one can argue that bitcoin has become a phenomenon that can’t ever be overlooked; the number of mainstream businesses adopting it, as a payment method, is increasing steadily and more and more venture capitalists are chipping in into various bitcoin startups. However, as the world’s first cryptocurrency is becoming more and more popular, this comes with a serious premonitory, especially that the anonymity offered by the blockchain technology is so tempting to hackers and fraudsters.\n\nWhenever you become a victim of identity theft leading to loss of funds off your credit card or bank account, your losses would be covered by your bank or insurance company, but what if your bitcoins were stolen? Who would cover for your losses then? Accordingly, securing your PC and bitcoin wallets is crucial to turn down most hackers who might try to steal your coins.\n\nHow Hackers Can Target Your Bitcoin Wallets and Trading Accounts:\n\nTo maximize the security of your bitcoin wallets, you first need to understand how hackers can target your PC, mobile or server to steal your coins. Here are the most common types of attacks, hackers can use to exploit the vulnerabilities on your OS and steal your bitcoins:\n\n1- Phishing:\n\nPhishing IP addresses has always been one of the most commonly used types of hack attacks. Occasionally, the “IP phishing” is just the first step in more complicated types of attacks. In my opinion, nowadays if the IP of the “target” is recorded, 50% of the hacking process is already completed.\n\nIn most instances, a hacker creates a malicious link and sends it to the target machine, and once the user clicks on it, the IP address of his/her machine is recorded.\n\nIf you are using an online BTC wallet, you might receive a “fake” email that includes a link that directs you to a “fake” page of your online wallet login page and when you enter your login details, they are directly sent to the hacker who would definitely use them to drain all the BTC in your wallet; however, as all top online wallet providers have SSL protection, if you are attentive enough, you can bust such “fake” login pages easily.\n\n2- Keyloggers:\n\nIn my opinion, keylogging is the easiest way to capture a password. A keylogger can be so deceiving that even a tech-savvy victim can fall for it. Simply speaking, a keylogger is a script code, which once installed on the OS of a target machine, records all the strokes on the keyboard and sends them back to the hacker, mostly via FTP.\n\nThe success of the process of injecting a keylogger is dependent on numerous factors including OS, the keylogger’s lifespan, the level of footprint infection on the target machine. Keyloggers are usually injected using a web browser exploit. Security vulnerabilities of the target machine vary according to the type of browser being used; whether or not the copy of the OS installed on the target machine is genuine or not; whether or not the OS is up-to-date regarding security vulnerabilities and bug fixes (2).\n\n3- Stealers:\n\nStealers are pieces of software that retrieve the passwords and login credentials stored on your browser. Once FUD, some Stealers can be very powerful. In most instances, a stealer is a .bat file that can be injected into the target machine online or via a USB drive through “social engineering” (1).\n\n4- Cookie Hijacking:\n\nCookie hijacking, or session hijacking, is the process of exploiting a valid computer session maliciously to gain unauthorized access to information or service on the target machine.\n\nAs http communication utilizes many TCP connections, a web server has to have a method to identify every user’s connections. Session tokens and cookies are the most commonly used client authentication methods nowadays. Cookie hijacking has many forms including session sniffing, cross-site script attack, side-jacking, man-in-the -middle attack and man-in-the-browser attack (3).\n\nHow Can You Secure Your Bitcoin Wallets and Trading Accounts?\n\n\n\n1- Operating Systems and Bug Fixes:\n\nUsing a genuine OS that is regularly updated for security vulnerabilities and bug fixes is the first step in securing your bitcoin wallets. I would never recommend using android devices to access your bitcoin wallets, because, in my opinion, the android OS is full of security vulnerabilities that would act like a magnet attracting hackers.\n\n2- Desktop Bitcoin-qt wallets Vs Online Wallets:\n\nThe security of most online bitcoin wallets is questionable. A large number of online wallet providers and bitcoin exchanges have suffered from a wide variety of security breaches and to our present day, such services still don’t offer adequate insurance and security to its users. If you have to use an online bitcoin wallet service, use “two factor authentication” to boost your security.\n\nBitcoin-qt wallets are the best option to maximize your security which will render you the only one having the private keys of your bitcoins. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket i.e. keep small amounts of money on your computer, server or smartphone for everyday expenses and use “cold storage” to store the majority of your coins. You should use strong passwords for both types of wallets. Multi-signatures is also another feature that can maximize your security.\n\n3- Using Proxies and VPNs:\n\nProxy servers and VPNs can increase the security of your bitcoin wallets. Although most people wrongly think that a VPN grants them anonymity online, the truth is it doesn’t, yet it boosts privacy. Think of VPN as “window curtains’; the curtains promote privacy of the activities taking place inside your house, yet the address of your house can still be identified.\n\nVPN minimizes hackers’ access to the open ports on your router so reduces the possibility of successful hack attacks (4).\n\n4- Anti-Phishing Browsing Behavior:\n\nAlways, be cautious before clicking on any link. As mentioned earlier, your IP addressea would be recorded the second you click on a malicious link. Whenever you are suspicious about a link, use a “Website Phishing Check” service before clicking it.\n\n5- Encrypt and Backup Your Wallet(s):\n\nA wallet backup is indispensable to protect against PC failures and human errors. An encrypted wallet backup can help you retrieve your coins after your computer or mobile phone is stolen. You should always encrypt your online backups; even a PC connected to the internet is rather vulnerable to malicious attacks. Accordingly, any backup that can be accessed via the internet should be encrypted (5).\n\n6- Cold Storage:\n\nAn offline wallet is also sometimes referred to as “cold storage” of bitcoin. Cold storage is the best way to store bitcoin in a secure place that has no network access. Cold storage should be used to store bitcoin savings.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAlthough bitcoin represents the mostly targeted digital currency by hackers today, following strict security measures can turn down most attacks. Dealing with bitcoin should be approached on a secure machine while also adopting secure web browsing behavior.\n\nReferences:\n\n1- Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing Guide 1st Edition\n\nby Rafay Baloch. http://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Hacking-Penetration-Testing-Guide/dp/1482231611\n\n2- Keyloggers ETHICAL HACKING EEL-4789 http://web.eng.fiu.edu/~aperezpo/DHS/Std_Research/Keylogging%20final%20edited%202.0%20.pdf\n\n3- OWASP.

Securing Your Wallet. https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet', 'Bitcoin has been around for about seven years and it has achieved great heights in such a short span. While bitcoin is already being adopted by a considerable number of people across the world, the technology that powers bitcoin transactions has become a bigger hit. Blockchain technology is behind all bitcoin transactions. Blockchain is a secure and transparent ledger that records each and every transaction that happens over the bitcoin network. All transactions needs to be confirmed on blockchain and the entry recorded to ensure there is no double spending on fraudulent transactions. Apart from bitcoin transactional data, blockchain can also record non-transactional data.\n\nBanks and Blockchains\n\nBlockchain technology has found its way into various applications other than bitcoin transactions. The use of blockchain technology varies from simple laboratory data management applications to secure proprietary financial transaction tools dealing with banking and securities. Recently we have seen banks experimenting with blockchain technology to evaluate its use in their day to day operations. Few banks are already using Ripple network on an experimental basis while a group of international banks work on creating a proprietary blockchain, better known as federated blockchain. The federated blockchain is being created with plans to link all these banks to a network, similar to that of bitcoin network and use the network to transfer funds from one bank/branch to another instantly while bypassing the conventional routes.\n\nEven though the research is currently still in the initial stages, its implementation will not take much time. However, wide spread adoption is another question. Banks and corporations are giants, taking a long time before they could achieve widespread implementation. But once implemented, it may spell doom to bitcoin as we know it today. It is highly unlikely for banks and financial institutions to adopt bitcoin or any other open source technology on an as-is basis. So, the probability of banks adopting their own cryptocurrency or a token is very high.\n\nOnce blockchain technology is implemented in banks across the world, the turnaround time for fund transfers will fall rapidly. Banks will be able to process transactions at the same rate as bitcoin transactions. The transaction fees associated with fund transfers will also fall drastically as banks will be able to successfully circumvent SWIFT network and central banks. These benefits will be passed on to customers. In short, banking customers will be able to enjoy almost all the benefits bitcoin currently offers through the banking system. Once banks start processing transactions over blockchain, these crypto tokens used by banks will be readily convertible to local fiat currency without the need of any third party exchanges.\n\nDecentralized no more\n\nBitcoin is popular mainly because it offers fast, easy and an economical way to transfer funds. If mainstream banking sector begins to offer all these benefits, then people will start opting for conventional banks over bitcoin. In addition to it, few mining pools are growing bigger each day. The top three bitcoin mining pools put together control over 50 percent of the bitcoin hashrate and F2pool alone has a share of close to 25 percent of total available bitcoin hashrate. If the trend continues, bitcoin may not stay decentralized for a long time. Once people realize that the decentralized nature of bitcoin network is about to be compromised, they might start looking for other options. Bitcoin network’s trouble reaching a consensus, if continued will compound the problem and may lead to an early downfall of our much beloved cryptocurrency.', 'Share on twitter\n\nShare on Google Plus Patrick Durkin by While stockbrokers, investment bankers and traders were enjoying a well-earned break for the Queen\'s birthday on June 8 this year, a group of bitcoin cyber criminals known as ""DD4BC"" were busily plotting to launch cyber attacks against some of our biggest financial institutions, including Westpac and Macquarie Bank. The government\'s newly formed Australian Cyber Security Centre said it was aware of ""extortion campaigns occurring May through July"" by the notorious cyber criminals who have ramped up their attacks over the past few months and turned their attention to the financial sector – banks, brokers and clearing houses in Australia. ACSC co-ordinator Clive Lines warned that financial markets were vulnerable. ""Australia is experiencing increasingly sophisticated attacks on networks and systems in the public and private sectors, including the finance sector,"" Mr Lines said. ""If you are connected to the internet, you are vulnerable – financial markets and stock exchanges are not immune from this threat.""\n\nThen Prime Minister Tony Abbott opened the Australian Cyber Security Centre last November. Andrew Meares\n\nManaging director of online stockbroker OpenMarkets, Rick Klink, who has agreed to speak out about DD4BC\'s extortion attempt, was relaxing at home on June 8 when he checked his phone for work emails and discovered the threat.\n\n\ufeffBlinking in the MD\'s inbox was a intimidating email warning of a ""DDOS Attack!"", unless the broker paid up $US5750 in bitcoins within the next 24 hours with the ransom price increasing to $US11,500 in bitcoins and increasing ""for every hour of attack"". DD4BC demands ""All your servers are going under DDoS attack unless you pay 25 Bitcoin,"" the first demand, sent at 9.10am on Monday, read. ""Please note that it will not be easy to mitigate our attack because our current UDP flood power is 400-500 Gbps ... It is just to prove that we are serious.\n\nAustralia\'s biggest banks have withdrawn their support for bitcoins in the wake of extortion threats by DD4BC. Tomohiro Ohsumi\n\n""If you ignore us and don\'t pay within 24 hours, long term attack will start, price to stop will go to 50BTC and will keep increasing for every hour of attack. If you are thinking of reporting this to authorities, feel free to try. But it won\'t help. We are not amateurs. We do bad things but we keep our word,"" the cyber criminals signed off. The next demand from DD4BC – which stands for ""DDoS for bitcoin"" (distributed denial of service for bitcoin) and is a commonly executed cyber attack used to bring down websites and debilitate web servers – landed about midday the next day. ""You are ignoring us,"" they wrote. ""You probably believe that after some time, we will give up. But we never give up. You don\'t pay, your services go offline for a long time. Until you pay more.This is your last chance."" Mr Klink, a former IBM executive, refused to pay but called in cloud provider Amazon, the Australian Federal Police and the government\'s ACSC, which knew to take the sophisticated cyber criminals seriously.\n\nThe first cyber ransom note from DD4BC.\n\n""We could see they were trying to bring down the website with a UDP flood attack. Amazon brought in their security team and we avoided any downtime for our site,"" Mr Klink told The Australian Financial Review. DDoS attacks on the rise To date, DD4BC have launched about 150 attacks across Europe, the United States, New Zealand and Australia – with 58 per cent directed at financial services companies, according to research by cloud provider Akamai, released this month. As part of the attacks, the group seeks an initial payment of 25 bitcoins – with bitcoins currently valued at about $US230 each – in exchange for relinquishing a flood of inbound data issues, which render a target\'s website inaccessible. The group deliberately demand payment in bitcoins to take advantage of the virtual currency\'s anonymity and ""transaction malleability"", a glitch that makes it possible to fake transactions and create phantom transaction records.\n\nThe second cyber ransom note from DD4BC.\n\nLuckily, the cluster of denial of service attacks occurred predominantly on a non-trading day, although Mr Klink added that its trading systems were not connected to its website and were never under threat. The Financial Review understands that Westpac and Macquarie Bank were among other major financial institutions targeted. Neither organisation confirmed an attack although Macquarie said it would work with the Australian Federal Police on any investigation. ""Denial of service incidents are a known feature of operating in a digital economy,"" Macquarie spokeswoman Navleen Prasad said. ""Macquarie has appropriate systems and processes in place, including working with law enforcement and other financial institutions where appropriate, to ensure confidential data remains protected."" The revelations come as Australia\'s biggest banks have moved to withdraw their support for bitcoins, after letters were sent from Westpac and Commonwealth Bank of Australia to at least 17 Australian bitcoin companies and bitcoin exchanges including Bit Trade and Buyabitcoin informing them their accounts would be closed.', ""Leading Danish bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange CCEDK has introduced the world’s first decentralized multi-lingual fintech exchange OpenLedger, allowing users to convert bitcoin to fiat-pegged SmartCoins, which are directly convertible to cash via PayPal, Ripple gateway, CCEDK’s NanoCard or money transfer in.\n\n“We have combined the strengths of digital currencies pioneered by Bitcoin with the universal acceptance of major credit cards,” announced CEO Ronny Boesing in a statement. “In the process we have eliminated most of the biggest drawbacks of the two systems.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“It’s like having your savings, checking, and trading accounts in the palm of your hand, accessible from anywhere in the world – at the speed of light – with dramatically lower fees than banks and exchanges have ever been able to offer.”\n\nThe OpenLedger platform will grant direct access to the industrial-grade financial smart contract platform BitShares, providing users a complete decentralized financial platform.\n\n“Using the BitShares platform also gives CCEDK the ability to share its order books and services with future partner exchanges and digital asset providers to achieve deeper markets, tighter price spreads, and a growing suite of innovative products and services,” explained Boesing.\n\nThe OpenLedger team has also secured other blockchain partners including diversified cryptocurrency group Banx Capital, data center backed Bunkershares, the Beyond Bitcoin Show, music platform Peertracks, identity-focused cryptocurrency Identabit, voting platform Follow My Vote, and others to diversify its services and products as a fintech exchange and platform.\n\nDecentralized Crypto Platform\n\nThe OpenLedger platform is a product of CCEDK and Cryptonomex, an independent blockchain development company founded by the core developers of the BitShares blockchain. The partnership between OpenLedger and Cryptonomex provides the platform’s users with a direct access to the bitShares 2.0 network.\n\n“This relationship provides us with deeply integrated access to the BitShares 2.0 network allowing industrial grade digital currency transactions several thousand times faster than Bitcoin,” said Boesing. “Using the BitShares platform also gives CCEDK the ability to share its order books and services with future partner exchanges and digital asset providers to achieve deeper markets, tighter price spreads, and a growing suite of innovative products and services.”\n\nThe integration of BitShares 2.0 network onto the OpenLedger platform should further improve the monetization and connections of financial products and platforms, which may potentially allow the OpenLedger platform to break the final barriers to mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOpenLedger partner Stan Larimer told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Bitcoin aligned the incentives for consensus of a ledger, but BitShares aligns all incentives necessary to spread a new type of sound money into the existing economy. Markets are profitable because of the networks of people within them. Anyone with influence in a network of people can now monetize their connections in a way that improves the efficiency of already desirable and valued services within that economy.”\n\nUnder one roof\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, OpenLedger CEO Ronny Boesing stated that the following features of OpenLedger’s web wallet offers a series of features that aren’t offered together by other wallets currently on the market. These include:\n\nIntegrated block explorer;\n\nMulti signature accounts;\n\nAccess to bitAssets like bitUSD;\n\nAccess BitShares network directly;\n\nNo middle man controlling access;\n\nRecurring and scheduled payments;\n\nUser issued assets (similar to colored coins);\n\nGlobally registered identity (blockchain account name);\n\nAll markets are integrated.\n\nThe OpenLedger Web Wallet provides users with an integrated block explorer, allowing users to search bitcoin addresses, blocks and transaction IDs directly from the platform. The wallet also incorporates Multi-Signature implementations, for secure corporate transactions and settlements.\n\nHowever, the OpenLedger depends heavily on the BitShares 2.0 platform and the Graphene toolkit developed by Cryptonomex. Therefore, the performance of the OpenLedger platform is dependent on the performance of the grapheme tool kit and the BitShares 2.0 platform.\n\n“It all confirms that all parts need to work to make wonders but then again isn't that what innovation is all about - fitting all those small pieces into one great puzzle,” concluded Boesing."", '', 'Blockchain technology has been described as email for money, but it has the potential to be so much more.\n\nAccording to Blythe Masters, the blockchain represents a watershed moment in technological history. “You should be taking this technology as seriously as you should have been taking the development of the Internet in the early 1990s,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nBlockchain technology is a hyper-secure record of digital events that is distributed among many different computers. The blockchain can only be updated by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system, and once information has been entered, it can never be erased. Blockchain technology is best known for its connection to the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. It’s what enables transactions to happen without middlemen or a central body, while protecting against duplication and fraud.\n\nTo date, the focus has been on blockchain applications for the financial world. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are several other industries that are already putting blockchain technology to good use. In this article we will look at the ways that startups are using the blockchain to reduce crime and counterfeiting, and potentially save lives.\n\nArt Authentication\n\nA Swiss art-research lab recently caused a stir by claiming that more than 70 percent of the works it checks out are fakes, forgeries or misattributions. While exact figures are unknown for the amount made in forged art each year, high-profile cases over the last decade have revealed that forgers can make millions. Some forgeries are so convincing that they were displayed in the most prestigious art galleries in the world.\n\nThe emergence of new online art sales platforms, such as Artspace, Paddle8 and Amazon Art, are making it increasingly difficult to keep track of authentic art pieces. This facilitates the spread of counterfeit art. Buying online is especially popular with the younger generation, with almost 25 percent of 20–30 year olds surveyed saying they first bought art online without seeing the physical piece. The Hiscox Online Art Trade Report 2014 estimated the value of the online art market will rise to $3.76 billion by 2018.\n\nThe only true way to prove a piece is the real deal used to be through a certificate of authenticity — which also could be forged.\n\nWhen purchased online, art does not follow usual channels, and tends to pass over the middlemen, such as auction houses or galleries, who play a part in ensuring authenticity and recording the ownership and location of rare art. In the past, authenticating a work of art involved a number of important stages, from defining the origins of the piece, working out whether it has been exhibited in the past and previously valued and, finally, having the piece professionally authenticated by an expert. Because of the level of skill of professional forgers, the only true way to prove a piece is the real deal used to be through a certificate of authenticity — which also could be forged.\n\nL.A.-based startup Verisart believes it has come up with the answer, by using the blockchain to “foolproof” the system. Using blockchain technology, it has created a non-centralized database of art that verifies each work by assigning it unique authenticity codes. Owners and buyers alike could then use these individual blockchain codes to validate the authenticity of the pieces, and monitor their movement worldwide.\n\n“The art world is not broken. It just relies too much on middlemen to ensure trust and liquidity…As more art sales move online, there will be increasing demand for certificates of authenticity as well as the need to perform real-time verification of provenance,” said Verisart Founder Robert Norton in an interview with TechCrunch. “The blockchain allows potential buyers to verify the chain of title in a work without relying on any single node of verification.”\n\nThe startup has added Bitcoin hero Peter Todd as a board advisor, and hopes to offer a secure safety net for artists, dealers and collectors alike with a digitalized system that could verify pieces in real time. The new system would not only ensure authenticity, but also provide a level of anonymity for the buyer and seller, which is an important factor in the art world, where anonymous buyers are not uncommon.\n\nHigh-Value Goods\n\nAccording to the U.S. Custom and Border Protection, millions of shipments of counterfeit high-value goods, such as electronic items and fake designer clothes and accessories, enter the country each year. More than $1.2 billion worth of goods are seized annually, but the authorities acknowledge that this is a fraction of the total goods entering the country. The counterfeit market has been named the “crime of the century.” In 2015, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) expects the value of counterfeit goods to exceed U.S.$1.7 trillion globally, accounting for more than 2 percent of the world’s total current economic output.\n\nIn response, London-based startup Blockverify aims to use the blockchain to authenticate a wide range of high-value goods (ranging from mobile phones to diamonds) to simplify sales tracking and product verification.\n\nUsing blockchain technology, Blockverify’s system is able to authenticate counterfeit products that are already in a company’s possession, track goods to see if they have been diverted from their original destination, trace and locate stolen goods and track fraudulent transactions. Each product is labeled with a tag, so when consumers purchase a product, they are able to verify that the product is genuine and activate it. Companies are able to create a register of their own products, then monitor the supply chains with ease via the Blockverify platform. Products can even be verified using mobile devices, making it viable to verify products on a large-scale and at the point of delivery.\n\nCounterfeit Drugs\n\nBlockverify also uses its system to combat the international trade of counterfeit drugs. According to HavocScape, drugs are the most commonly counterfeited products, and account for more than $200 billion in losses each year.\n\nInterpol estimates that more than 1 million people are killed each year by counterfeit drugs, stating that the manufacture and sale of counterfeit drugs is becoming one the most lucrative businesses for organized crime gangs around the world. The most common counterfeit drugs are antibiotics, HIV/AIDS and cancer medication, anti-depressants, erectile dysfunction pills, weight-loss supplements and anti-malaria medication, according to Caracol. Interpol reported that more than 200,000 people die worldwide annually from counterfeit anti-allergy drugs alone.\n\nMore than 200,000 people die worldwide annually from counterfeit anti-allergy drugs alone. — Interpol\n\nAs also seen in the world of art, the growth of online pharmaceutical sales is making it harder for officials to keep track of the flow of real and counterfeit products. A number of leading sites such as Snapdeal Medidart, Buydrug and Meramedicare have installed safety features, requiring users to upload prescriptions for prescribed drugs while placing orders, and extra checks on vendors. However, the World Health Organization estimates that more than 50 percent of medications purchased from online vendors in which the doctor’s name is concealed are counterfeit.\n\nBlockverify claims that it has the technology to put an end to this flow of deadly counterfeit products by using the blockchain to track pharmaceuticals throughout the supply chain, and to ensure consumers receive authentic products.\n\nBig Changes Ahead In Many Industries\n\nOliver Bussmann, Chief Information Officer at UBS, said recently, “I know of more than 100 firms that are trying to make the blockchain more scalable, more secure, to make the one that everybody will use. There’s a race on out there.”\n\nWhile the technology is still in its early stages, and will take years to be assimilated universally, the opportunities for offering fast and secure transactions, verifying goods and tracking products throughout a supply chain could potentially save trillions of dollars, and hopefully reduce the flow of dangerous counterfeit products worldwide.', 'Image: Shutterstock\n\nThe man believed to be forgotten Silk Road architect Variety Jones has published a series of accusations against someone he suspects is a corrupt Federal Bureau of Investigation employee, guilty of crimes including leaking sensitive information to criminals, extorting the owners of dark web marketplaces for bitcoins, and even conspiracy to kidnap.\n\n""The story of $75,000,000 of pirates treasure in bitcoins,"" Variety Jones wrote in a post on a cannabis enthusiast forum Sunday under one of his pseudonyms, ""Plural of Mongoose.""\n\n""The story of a rogue, highly placed member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who has been making better than an average of a $1,000,000 a month, committing felonies with wild abandon, just because he can.""\n\n""The story of a bent Federale who has leaked me secret grand jury information in an effort to keep me *out* of the hands of his colleagues.""\n\nVariety Jones claims that an anonymous source contacted him months after the Silk Road was shut down offering inside information. The anonymous source, who later called himself ""Diamond,"" claimed to be an FBI agent and said he could provide tips about investigations into dark web marketplaces. He claimed to have provided such information to Atlantis, a dark web drug site that would eventually shut down in 2013, according to Variety Jones.\n\nDiamond made good on his promise of information, Variety Jones said, by tipping him ahead of time about the investigations into Carl Mark Force IV and Shaun Bridges, two law enforcement officials who stole funds from the Silk Road. This and other inside information convinced Variety Jones that Diamond was in fact an FBI agent.\n\nDiamond also claimed to be doing a robust business in reaping bitcoins by trading in information and blackmailing dark web marketplace owners. Diamond informed Variety Jones about the imminent closure of the Evolution marketplace in mid-March, allegedly because of an extortion campaign Diamond carried out against them.\n\n""Considering the money involved, I would be in fear for my life.""\n\n\n\nDiamond also claimed to be in possession of a Bitcoin wallet containing over 300,000 BTC, or $70 million at today\'s exchange rates, that previously belonged to Ross Ulbricht, the convicted creator of the Silk Road.\n\nThis wallet was protected by a password, and Diamond believed that Variety Jones, with his previous work on the Silk Road, could access, or help access, the funds in this wallet, and asked for his help.\n\n""He wants me to move to Singapore, where he can set up a safe house and know that I\'m clear of the clutches of the DOJ,"" Variety Jones claims. He also says that Diamond warned of an Interpol Red Notice against him, and that immigration police were hunting him in Thailand, where he has been living.\n\nEarlier this month, Motherboard published an extensive investigation into the identity of Variety Jones, based on the previous work of independent researcher ""La Moustache."" Variety Jones made financial and security decisions around the Silk Road, and was referred to by Ross Ulbricht as a ""mentor.""\n\nMotherboard named Variety Jones as Roger or Thomas Clark, a Canadian man in his fifties, and tracked him down to the Thai island of Koh Chang.\n\nAccording to his blog post, Variety Jones, a.k.a. Thomas Clark, told Diamond he wanted nothing to do with breaking into the Bitcoin wallet. That\'s when Diamond (allegedly) started making threats.\n\n""If I ever fucked up and fell into the hands of the Feds, he had the reach and knew the people, and most importantly had the funds, to have me killed,"" Variety Jones wrote.\n\nAfter this, Diamond supposedly made an extraordinary claim: ""He would kidnap Ross Ulbrichts sister, or mother, or ideally both. Get a video capable phone in front of Ross Ulbricht, and he\'d give up that fucking pass phrase, and Diamond would have them tortured until he did,"" according to Variety Jones.\n\nVariety Jones provided a TorChat ID for Diamond in his forum post. Although the ID is active, whoever is behind it did not immediately respond to messages.\n\nVariety Jones claims he contacted Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Serrin Turner, who prosecuted Ross Ulbricht, to warn him of the actions of Diamond.\n\n""Under the circumstances, I\'m very concerned about falling into the clutches of Diamond, or subjecting myself to custody of the U.S. justice system, where considering the money involved, I would be in fear for my life,"" Variety Jones wrote in an email, supposedly dated May 2015 and included in his forum post on Sunday.\n\nAn excerpt from an email sent to Assistant US Attorney Serrin Turner about Diamond, according to Variety Jones.\n\nAt this point, there is no way to independently verify Clark\'s claims, but Motherboard has independently confirmed the identity of the individual behind the account.\n\nTurner did not immediately respond to Motherboard\'s request for comment, and neither did the FBI.', 'Uber is one of the most innovative companies as far as the concept of a sharing economy is concerned.

While only available to a select for regular users, as well as Uber for Business members, the plan is to roll out UberEVENTS to everyone in New York state over the next few months.\n\nWhat makes this new feature so interesting is how event organizers can schedule these rides well in advance, and even customize dates, times and promotion codes. Purchasing a ride with UberEVENTS can be done in the form of guest passes, which will then be delivered via email.\n\nOnce a guest has received their UberEVENTS guest pass electronically, it will include a code that needs to be entered in the Uber mobile application. Doing so will allow the user to request a ride to the event’s location, and get the party started as soon as they arrive. Everything is taken care of behind the scenes, with no hassle for the user.\n\nUber’s Kimiko Ninomiya stated the following:\n\n“When planning a company happy hour, client appreciation dinner, or even upcoming nuptials, there is a lot that goes into ensuring that your event goes off without a hitch—including how your guests can safely get to and from without any fuss. We want to make the experience of planning transportation logistics as seamless as ordering a ride at the touch of button.”\n\nA Perfect Opportunity To Experiment With Bitcoin?\n\nIn recent months, there have been various media reports concerning Uber integrating Bitcoin. While the company keeps denying these reports, alternative services enabling Bitcoin payments for Uber rides have been surfacing online. UberEVENTS provides another excellent opportunity for the company to start using Bitcoin, or even blockchain technology.\n\nThe United States is home to many Bitcoin conferences, and guests have to get to these venues in time. If UberEVENTS wants to cater to this crowd as well, Bitcoin integration is a must. Plus, Uber has the option to use blockchain technology for this service as well, to keep track of drivers and guests, as well as issuing and storing guest passes.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on UberEVENTS?

And, to be sure, it has worked, helping uncover wrongdoing and leading to more than $74 billion in fines.\n\nBut Justice has come under fire — from Congress and others — for not nailing enough individuals responsible for the crimes. That led to last week’s memo from Sally Q. Yates, an assistant attorney general in Washington, DC.\n\n“Companies cannot pick and choose which facts to disclose,” Yates wrote — adding that if companies don’t hand over their employees, including senior executives, the DOJ will throw the book at them.\n\nSo banks, looking to get the upper hand over unscrupulous employees, are turning to firms like Paxata and Red Owl Analytics and Palantir — as well as a slew of investigators and law firms who license their proprietary software.\n\nUsing these programs, banks are able to scrape together and easily monitor in real time their employees’ social media, how often they send emails on personal accounts, withdraw money from ATMs, when they enter and leave the building, when they plan private conversations, and what they do on the shadowy “deep web,” where Internet activity isn’t logged like it is on Google.\n\n“[Banks] are held to a higher standard about how to police their own people,” Brian White, COO at Red Owl, told The Post.\n\nIn adopting these programs, the banks are starting to mimic their overseers, since the Securities and Exchange Commission struck a deal with Palantir last year to sift through huge amounts of data to find unseemly activity.\n\nPalantir, which was founded by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, didn’t return a request for comment.\n\n“With the ability to monitor employee behavior in real time for anomalies that might indicate risk due to misconduct, companies can be proactive in their fraud investigations and hopefully prevent illegal activity from occurring, or at least prevent its spread,” Julian Moore, a senior managing partner at K2 Intelligence who had led the prosecution of Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff at the DOJ, told The Post.', 'Par Brice Rothschild\n\nDans un précédent article, j’avais évoqué la difficulté pour la communauté Bitcoin de conserver le consensus qui fait sa raison d’être. Ce problème peut être généralisé : peut-on constituer une vaste communauté guidée par des règles communes sans pour autant que cela tourne à l’abus de pouvoir ?\n\nDu problème de la dimension des organisations\n\nPour y voir clair, simplifions les choses en imaginant Robinson sur son île déserte. À ce stade, il n’a de conflit avec personne. Alors que Pierre arrive sur l’île, se pose la question de la répartition des richesses que chacun produit. S’ils sont raisonnables, ils vont trouver que se voler l’un l’autre ne profite à personne : mieux vaut que chacun se spécialise dans ce qu’il fait de mieux et l’échange entre nos deux îliens fera le reste. Bref, alors que l’agression détruit des richesses, la coexistence pacifique en produit.\n\nNos sociétés modernes comptent des millions d’individus. À cette échelle, l’instrument de libre coopération le plus efficace est le marché qui n’est que l’agrégat des échanges entre individus. Ce marché n’est pas une réponse définitive. Il est parfois plus efficace de constituer des organisations auxquelles adhèrent des individus. On appelle cela des entreprises, des associations, des copropriétés ou tout autre lien contractuel.\n\nÀ une certaine échelle, ces organisations tendent malheureusement à se corrompre dans le sens où l’agression reprend le dessus sur la libre coopération : les liens contractuels sont fragilisés. Cela peut s’expliquer par le fait qu’une taille importante engendre un pouvoir suffisamment fort pour empêcher la concurrence d’autres organisations plus respectueuses de ses membres. C’est le cas des États. Dans le cadre de notre société de coopération, cette organisation est supposée rendre justice à ceux qui sont victimes d’agressions. Or l’État est trop souvent détourné de sa vocation pour devenir l’instrument d’agressions commanditées. Les États dits démocratiques ne font pas exception. Là, les élus y forment trop souvent le noyau d’une sorte de nomenklatura. Plusieurs facteurs en sont responsables : clientélisme, problème principal-agent, corruption, connivence. La force publique est mise au service des groupes d’intérêts les plus influents au lieu d’être au service de la justice.\n\nLa réponse à ce problème d’échelle des organisations est d’avoir des organisations limitées en taille, tout simplement. C’est sans doute ce qui explique la relative prospérité des États faiblement peuplés où les institutions judiciaires restent le plus dans leur rôle de condamnation des agressions et de faire exécuter les contrats. Mais avec une taille limitée, comment les organisations de libre coopération peuvent-elles faire face à celles qui sont oppressives et bien plus puissantes ? C’est le pot de terre contre le pot de fer.\n\nDe la montée en puissance des réseaux de type Bitcoin\n\nAlors que l’or est une réalité monétaire par sa nature, Bitcoin est d’abord le fruit d’une organisation humaine. En effet, ce sont bien des machines qui maintiennent et sécurisent le réseau, mais ces machines sont commandées par des humains qui ont des intérêts. De plus, Bitcoin est indépendant des lois existantes dans le sens où la loi est le code exécuté par ses membres. On peut donc tout à fait comparer la manière de gérer le réseau Bitcoin et la manière de gérer les États. Si le réseau Bitcoin doit atteindre une taille très importante (avec des millions d’utilisateurs réguliers), alors par économies d’échelle, une certaine centralisation aura lieu et on retombera alors sur un potentiel abus de pouvoir.\n\nPour résoudre ce problème de centralisation, des solutions sont en développement. De leur côté, les créateurs de BitShares ont lancé un projet plus ou moins concurrent de Bitcoin en adoptant une autre approche. Au lieu de rémunérer ceux qui mettent à disposition de la puissance de calcul pour valider les transactions, le système donne ce pouvoir aux élus de tous ceux qui possèdent des unités de BitShares. Ces élus sont révocables quasiment à tout moment. Cette corde de rappel détenue par ceux qui ont le plus d’intérêt dans le système doit permettre une centralisation contrôlée des ressources utilisées par le réseau. On se retrouve avec un système comparable au fonctionnement des organisations (entreprises, associations ou États) auxquelles nous sommes habitués.\n\nIl ne s’agit pas ici de savoir quelle crypto-monnaie est plus à même de faire face à ce problème d’échelle, mais de remarquer que ce type de technologie donne naissance à une sorte de laboratoire d’institutions (et donc de lois) en libre concurrence. Il faut comprendre que derrière ces projets se cachent des enjeux considérables. On parle de décentraliser non seulement la banque, mais aussi le notariat, l’assurance, la bourse, l’arbitrage. Des activités qui de nos jours sont parmi les plus réglementées par les États. Une fois décentralisées, elles constitueront leur propre système légal, car indépendantes des systèmes légaux existants. On peut imaginer une panarchie mondiale où des citoyens de « nations numériques » différentes coexisteraient (cf. BitNation). Leurs membres seraient en mesure de se faire respecter parce qu’ils pourraient se coaliser pour se défendre en rémunérant une police et une armée destinées à faire respecter les contrats établis au sein de leur « nation ». Autrefois, les États pouvaient casser les liens de communication entre individus. Aujourd’hui, ce n’est presque plus le cas grâce à Internet. Demain, ce sont les liens contractuels qui gagneront en robustesse.\n\nLes États tels que nous les connaissons pourront-ils un jour être balayés par des organisations disruptives non moins puissantes mais fondées sur la coexistence pacifique et non le rapport de forces ? Les « crypto-monnaies » sont-elles la clé providentielle ouvrant la voie « vers une société sans État » (David Friedman) ? En somme, pourra-t-on bientôt conjuguer pouvoir et bonne gouvernance ? L’actuel foisonnement de réalisations et de recherches en la matière nous en donne en tout cas l’espoir.\n\n—\n\nSur le web']"
09/28/2015,"['On October 9, 2014, the world was told that the first bitcoin derivatives transaction had taken place on a regulated exchange. The groundbreaking event for the bitcoin community was widely publicized as the next step in bitcoin\'s revolution. The transaction in question occurred on New Jersey-based TeraExchange, the first federally regulated platform for bitcoin derivatives, trading USD/Bitcoin swaps.\n\nTo the bitcoin community, it was an important milestone, since derivative trading is a great way to hedge bitcoin holdings and reduces investment risks. Hopes were high that the trade marked the beginning of a liquid bitcoin derivatives market, and therefore large banks and corporations would all pour capital into bitcoin.\n\nHowever, almost a year later the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) revealed that the transaction was a wash trade, and prearranged. The story, as promoted by TeraExchange was at best a poor decision, and sanctions quickly followed.\n\nTeraExchange, a multi-asset class platform for trading an array of financial instruments offers bitcoin forwards and swaps. Its provisionally registered as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF), as of Sept 19, 2013, but its application for permanent registration is still pending.\n\nWhile still on a temporary registration, which is the first step in the process of gaining full compliance, the exchange launched it’s SEF and began offering bitcoin swaps on September 12, 2014. As a provisionally registered SEF, the exchange is required under the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations to enact and enforce rules prohibiting certain types of trade practices, including wash trading and prearranged trading.\n\nAs part of the compliance process, TeraExchange established a rulebook including warnings for all participants.\n\n- TeraExchange rulebook\n\nHowever, a year after their launch the exchange broke its own rules, as well as the CFTCs. The transactions involved the only two firms who were authorized to trade on its SEF. According to TeraExchange the two firms did not know each other, one was digitalBTC, who acts as a liquidity provider for bitcoin swaps on the exchange, and the other was “a hedging counterparty.”\n\nThe transactions commenced when an employee of TeraExchange sent an email to one of the two firms, stating that they had ""a counterparty who would like to do a trade,” and that ""we would like to test the pipes by doing a round-trip trade with the same price in, same price out, (i.e. no [profit and loss] consequences) no custodian required.""\n\n- CFTC\n\nWhile on Skype calls with the exchange\'s employees, the two trading parties obliged, and one entered a bitcoin swap buy order with a notional amount of US$500,000, which was accepted by the second party. Then, just minutes later, an equivalent sell order was executed and accepted, completely offsetting the first transaction.\n\n- CFTC\n\nThe two trades canceled each other out entirely, as intended. There was no gain or loss, and TeraExchange did not even charge a transaction fee or commission to either party, as they would with a real trade.\n\nSince there were only two market participants authorized to trade on TeraExchange’s SEF, and only one pair of trades executed, this pre-arranged trading did not go unnoticed.\n\nSoon after the trades, the National Futures Association and the CFTC\'s Division of Market Oversight separately contacted TeraExchange regarding the two suspicious offsetting transactions. However, both agencies were told by the exchange that the purpose of the transactions was only to ""test the pipes.”\n\nThe CFTC would have been satisfied with that answer, since it is acceptable for exchanges to test their systems. Unfortunately for TeraExchange, the CFTC saw the press release that TeraExchange issued the very next day, misleadingly claiming the first bitcoin derivative transaction to be executed on a regulated exchange.\n\nOn the same day, the exchanges\' then-president appeared at a meeting of the Commission\'s Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC), and confirmed that trades had occurred in the Bitcoin swap the previous day.\n\nAs part of the CFTC\'s regulations, it is very important that no pre-operational test trades are publicized as real trades, as it could confuse the public and make the market appear more liquid than it is. While the CFTC has no problem with TeraExchange testing their systems, to ensure they are transaction-ready, the company is obliged to make “it clear to the public that the trades do not represent actual liquidity in the subject market.”\n\nNeither the press release nor the company\'s statement by its then-president even hinted that the transactions were prearranged wash sales executed solely for the purpose of testing. The Commission then considered both announcements were made “to create the impression of actual trading interest in the Bitcoin swap,” which is a violation of the Commission\'s regulations.\n\n- CFTC\n\nIn staging the wash trades and announcing them as real trades, TeraExchange did not just accidentally make the mistake of not enforcing the rules, but instead the exchange spearheaded the violations from the start.\n\n- CFTC\n\nAt the time of the CFTC\'s recent order, the wash trades were the only transactions executed on the TeraExchange SEF. This shows an extreme lack of liquidity on the exchange, as well as opening up the spot for the first bitcoin swap transaction.\n\n- CFTC\n\nTeraExchange, without admitting or denying any liability, settled with the CFTC. The Order requires Tera to cease and desist from future violations relating to its obligations to enforce rules on trade practices. There was no financial penalty.\n\nThis is the second case of the CFTC coming down on a bitcoin derivatives platform. Just a week prior the Commission officially classifying bitcoin as a commodity for the first time, while simultaneously ordering bitcoin options trading platform Coinflip, operating under the name Derivabit, to cease operations.\n\nIn such a short amount of time, two bitcoin derivatives trading platforms were sanctioned, attesting the fact that not only do bitcoin derivatives trading platforms need to register, but all trades on them must comply with CFTC regulations.\n\nThankfully, not all bitcoin derivatives platforms are this careless. LedgerX seems to be taking multiple steps above and beyond those required to ensure compliance. In addition to registering its SEF, they have also applied for registration as a derivatives clearing organization.\n\nThe Commission has recently approved the LedgerX temporary SEF registration, but the company has said that they do not intend to launch with only the SEF license at this time. If both registrations are approved, LedgerX would be the first U.S. regulated derivatives exchange and clearing house for institutions to trade physically-settled options on bitcoin.\n\nLedgerX also recently appointed Mark Wetjen to the Board of Directors at Ledger Holdings Inc., the parent company of LedgerX LLC. Wetjen coincidentally organized and chaired the CFTC\'s Global Markets Advisory Committee meeting, at which TeraExchange announced its first bitcoin derivative trade.\n\n- Paul L. Chou, LedgerX CEO\n\nNominated by President Barack Obama in March 2011, and later unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate, the Honorable Mark Wetjen served as commissioner on the CFTC from October 2011 to August 2015. He also served as the CFTC’s acting chairman for five months and helped craft over ninety CFTC actions.\n\n- Mark Wetjen, ex-Commissioner of the CFTC\n\nWith LedgerX taking their current, careful path, the future of bitcoin derivatives still looks bright, despite the actions of a couple of overanxious start-ups.', ""Diamond, which is believed to be an online alias of an unknown corrupt FBI agent, has been threatening to kill Silk Road Architect Variety Jones and torture Ross Ulbricht’s mother and sister to obtain the password to an encrypted bitcoin wallet containing over 300,000 BTC or US$70 million which previously belonged to Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road.\n\nDiamond believed that Variety Jones, with his involvement in creating the Silk Road could help him gain access to the funds. “He wants me to move to Singapore, where he can set up a safe house and know that I'm clear of the clutches of the DOJ,” claimed Jones on the MyPlantGanja forum.\n\nFurthermore, Jones claims that Diamond provided classified information about the Silk Road investigation ahead of time, specifically about former special agents Carl Mark Force IV and Shaun Bridges, to U.S. law enforcement officials charged for moving the seized funds during the Silk Road investigation to their private bitcoin and bank accounts. Since only high ranking members of the FBI have the power and authority over this type of information, the information on the two agents convinced Jones to believe that Diamond is an FBI official.\n\nHe continued:\n\n“I wasn't taking him serious in the beginning, and even once I realized he was who he said, and he was amassing millions of dollars in ill gotten gains, it wasn't until he started obsessing on the kidnappings, that I realized I had a lunatic on my hands. A lunatic highly placed in the FBI, with a massive off the books private budget, who thought that kidnapping and torture were the solution to his problems, and he starting to get a few other screws loose, as well. I do know how to pick my enemies.”\n\nSince Jones was not interested in cooperating with Diamond in obtaining the keys for the encrypted wallet, Diamond’s threats aggravated each day.\n\n“He also started to get nastier and nastier, because I refused to cooperate in his planning to obtain the keys to the encrypted wallet,” he said. “I became inured to his regular threats, but I know he was serious. Basically, if I didn't do exactly what he wanted, or ended up in custody of any authority, he'd have me killed.”\n\nAccording to Jones, Diamond revealed his “back up plan” to have Ulbrict on a video call, and torture his mother and sister until he would release the passphrase (private key) to the wallet holding US$70 million. Diamond persistently continued to threaten Jones and have him killed with his power and resources at the FBI.\n\nAfter Jones realized that Diamond is an official FBI officer with a lot of power and authority at his hands, Jones started to search for ways to catch Diamond and reveal his true identity.\n\nJones began to look for opportunities to get a hold of Diamond on Agora, when he discovered a tiny piece of evidence to trail his identity. However, Agora shut down on August 26, taking the last opportunity to catch Diamond, the corrupt FBI official with it.\n\nWith the last chance to capture Diamond gone, Jones decided to turn himself to the FBI, in return for the protection. Jones cautioned the family members of Ulbricht and law enforcements to make sure that Ulbricht’s sister or mother do not end up being kidnapped by Diamond.\n\n“Someone has to make sure he doesn't succeed in kidnapping Ross's sister and/or mother, and it would be kind of swell of them to make sure Ross doesn't come to any harm at the hands of one of Diamond's agents as well. Diamond, you're not getting the US$75,000,000,” said Jones.\n\n[Editor's Note: The real identity of 'Diamond' and the information contained in the above article have not been confirmed.]"", 'When I first started writing about Bitcoin over 3 years ago the currency was trading for around USD$6 each. It fluctuated between $3 and $8 for some time and then after Silk Road (the TOR site that offered contraband for Bitcoins) was reported about in the news, the stock shot up to over $20. It wasn\'t long after that it settled back to below $10 but in late 2013 the currency really shot up eventually rising to over $1,100. It\'s uncertain what caused the huge spike in value but most people point to a few reasons. First, Chinese residents decided to start investing heavily in the product. Uncomfortable with their own stock markets and with some concern about the volatility of the yuan, millions of Chinese residents invested in Bitcoins. There was also hope that Chinese businesses and banks would accept the currency as a form of legal tender. Second, was the pending U.S. debt crisis. Just as people turn to gold and silver when times are bad a lot of speculators were worried that a default by the U.S. government would lead to a huge decline in the value of the dollar and many speculators thus deemed that Bitcoins were a safe option. Third, was the eventual shut down of Silk Road. While the site created excitement among some that were holding Bitcoins there was concern that Silk Road was drawing negative attention to Bitcoins and most holding Bitcoins knew that as long as contraband was being traded undetectable, the currency would be under a lot of scrutiny from world governments. The closure after the arrest of its founder brought hope that the U.S. government and particularly the DoJ and Treasury would back off. And the last major reason given was just the amount of venture capitalists around the world who were pouring money into Bitcoins, since they believed it was undervalued.\n\nBut as quickly as the price rose it fell and by the end of 2014 the price was almost a quarter of what it was the year prior. There are several reasons for this but the main reason was government interference. The Chinese government told banks not to accept Bitcoins, causing thousands of Chinese investors to drop them, the Russian government said it was going to block Bitcoin websites, causing Russians who were using Bitcoins as a way to avoid the unstable fiat currency to sell them and of course in the U.S. the Treasury said that it was preparing to identify Bitcoins as a taxable product.\n\nAs well, Warren Buffet, who was always seen as a prudent and well respected investor effectively called Bitcoins a sham:\n\n""Stay away. Bitcoin is a mirage. It\'s a method of transmitting money. It\'s a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? You can transmit money by money orders. People do it. I hope Bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it, but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.""\n\nBuffet\'s words proved to be somewhat prophetic as several thefts of Bitcoins took place as well. The famous theft of thousands of Bitcoins at MtGox, the biggest Bitcoin trading site caused the markets to flinch and then when hackers raided Bitstamp out of $5 million worth of coins it became clear that the product, which is still just a series of encrypted numbers, are not as safe as one thought they were. The price of Bitcoins plummeted to the point where one of the largest mining sites said that mining Bitcoins had become unprofitable. It bottomed out at about $250 and has stayed within $100 of that price for over a year now.\n\nBut while the fluctuations in the price and the clear ease of hacking into Bitcoins were a concern to many companies considering accepting Bitcoins as a form of payment, more concerning to gambling operators was the fact that American authorities have been able to identify Bitcoin gambling operators and intimidate them into closing down. Several Bitcoin only gambling sites have closed in the last few years after they were told by the DoJ to cease and desist and in February of this year Bryan Micon, one of the owners of the extremely popular Bitcoin only poker site Seals with Clubs, was arrested at his Las Vegas home. According to Micron the police broke down his door and arrested him at gunpoint with his wife and toddler present after the Nevada Gaming Commission enforced a warrant against him. The authorities took computers which contained important files and Bitcoins and led him to the police station in his underwear. Although no charges were laid at the time it was clear the Gaming Commission planned to charge him with operating an illegal gambling website. Micon moved his family and himself to Antigua after the arrest and closed down the Seals with Clubs site. Later in the year Micon returned to Nevada and pleaded guilty to running an illegal gambling site in return for having the charge reduced to a misdemeanor and paying a $25,000 fine. Once the ordeal was over Micon left the U.S. and set up a new site SWCPoker.eu keeping most of his former clients, but without the other owners who decided not to go ahead with the venture for fear of U.S. reprisal.\n\nSo with all this occurring it would just be logical that most websites would run away from Bitcoins but that hasn\'t happened. In fact in the area of gambling many mainstream online sportsbooks have come on board in the last year and those that do offer Bitcoins as a form of payment indicated that they love the product.\n\nSome of the sites that currently offer Bitcoins include Heritage Sports, 5Dimes, Diamond Sports, Bovada, BetOnline, BetAnySports and Switch Poker, the first site to honor Bitcoins, continues to do so. And Bitcoin only gambling sites like Betcoin, Nitrogen Sports and Bitstarz continue to attract bettors. There are likely many other gambling sites that offer the currency as well, but keep it quiet. I asked several online gambling websites a few questions relating to their choice to offer Bitcoin and received a couple of interesting responses.\n\nThe first question I posed was why they started offering Bitcoin:\n\nManagement at BetAnySports provided some insight. ""Bitcoin started trading early 2010. Since then we have kept a close eye on the crypto currency to determine its stability and overall performance for peer to peer transactions. Last year we began testing Bitcoin for our Poker Games (many poker players requested BTC), and just recently we added Bitcoin to our Sportsbook. Transfers are initiated by contacting our customer service department.""\n\nHeritage Sports management provided a similar response. ""We started offering Bitcoin as a deposit and payout solution about a year and half ago on a limited basis and made it a permanent payment offering for a full year now.""\n\nThe second question I posed was why they like it as a payment option:\n\n""It\'s an excellent payment option. As a peer to peer currency Bitcoin fits in perfectly for anyone looking play at an Online Sportsbook, Casino, or Poker Room. There are no fees associated with Bitcoin transactions, there are no charge backs, and you can make as many transfers as you like throughout the day,"" BetAnySports answered.\n\nHeritage added, ""For US customers, it\'s very similar to the days of Neteller, when a customer could request a payout and have the money delivered to their wallet and under their own control within a short period of time (minutes or hours, always same day with us). It\'s become a fast and easy payment method for both incoming and outgoing.""\n\nThe third question I posed is what benefits they perceive Bitcoin offers to the players:\n\n""Bitcoin benefits players two ways: First Bitcoin is quick and easy to use. To deposit with Bitcoin the player only needs to contact our customer support team and they will provide a BTC wallet address. The player can transfer from $50 in value up to $10,000. The transaction can take anywhere from 5 up to 30 minutes to process. Secondly the player is able to keep his transactions completely private and manage his Bitcoin currency without any 3rd party banking institution keeping a detailed log throughout the year,"" BetAnySports informed me.\n\n""The players ultimately control the funds they keep in their wallet. That kind of flexibility is something I think U.S. customers miss from the days of Neteller and Moneybookers,"" cited Heritage.\n\nThe final question I asked is how they deal with the wild fluctuations in the price of Bitcoins and how they can keep the books balanced:\n\n""We use www.Bitstamp.net to determine the current market value of BTC, or as you say ""keep the books"" up to date. When you\'re ready to deposit or withdraw with us, you should reference Bitstamp to determine the current market value of Bitcoin,"" mentioned BetAnySports.\n\nHeritage on the other hand indicated that they aren\'t all that concerned about the fluctuations: ""We feel a lot of the early volatility is mostly out of the market with some ""real world"" uses of Bitcoins. It\'s becoming more mainstream and with that, we think that the fluctuations are more palatable for us. And the ease of the transactions along with the low cost makes it worth it to us. We do monitor the price and keep Bitcoin reserves to manage payout requests along with having an exchange account for buy/sell purposes.""\n\nAs for players I spoke to a friend in Arizona who told me that Bitcoin has helped him out immensely. ""I almost gave up on betting offshore. Just a couple of years ago getting money to any book became a nightmare and the only payout options was by check. And it was obvious my bank was getting suspicious of me as a result of large check deposits from banks in countries I couldn\'t pronounce let alone find on a map. But with Bitcoin I control everything. It\'s all anonymous and neither the government nor bank are involved at all. It\'s fabulous and I don\'t care about the price of Bitcoins because I\'m not going to sell them and I can still use them to buy most products I want, as the market for them has really opened up.""\n\nOne thing that is obvious from all the online gambling websites offering Bitcoin, is that they still cater to the U.S. market. Sites that no longer cater to U.S. customers have avoided the currency to date, likely because players in other countries have a ton of payment options including credit cards, Moneybookers. PayPal, Playsafecard, Instadebit (Canada) among others so they don\'t need Bitcoin presently for their players. But talking to gambling companies in the UK and the Caribbean that don\'t currently allow betting from the U.S. they indicated that they too are keeping a close eye on Bitcoins as a potential payment option simply because a lot of customers are demanding it.\n\nSince Bitcoin is still in its infancy it\'s hard to tell what the future of the virtual currency will be, but it seems clear that for U.S- facing gambling sites the future is now and they deem the future to be bright. And as gambling operators indicate the success they are having with them, it is only logical that others will come onboard. In fact one site that closed operations to U.S. citizens indicated that they may reopen to American customers but will only allow payments for those customers in Bitcoins. Without question that has to be music to the ears of many American bettors.\n\nFind the top websites for gambling online using bitcoin here.\n\nRead insights from Hartley Henderson every week here at OSGA and check out Hartley\'s RUMOR MILL!', 'Baja California has become known for certain things in recent years and decades. For one, deportees. Including veterans of the United States army who were deported from the United States. Another thing Baja is known for is craft beer, with numerous beer fests taking place all over the state. I wrote another piece recently about how US-based Uber drivers wanted nothing to do with traveling to Mexico, underscoring how many people in the US feel about Mexico. One thing Baja has not exactly been known for is its tech.\n\nBaja California is the northernmost and westernmost of the 31 states in Mexico. The country became a state in 1953 and borders today the Pacific Ocean, Sonora, California, and Arizona.

The ones that have heard something about Bitcoin have heard negative things in the press.” International and Mexican press has tainted the view some have of the new technology.\n\n“The feedback I get from some businessmen here is very negative, because of the news,” Muñoz told me. “People don’t trust this new technology, for here in Baja California there is a history of scams of all types – on the internet, social media and by telemarketers. Therefore, it’s very difficult for them to trust Bitcoin or try to understand it.” According to Muñoz, time might be of the essence.\n\n“It might take a couple of years before more people get involved with Bitcoin, that’s why I’m trying to educate everyone I know,” he said. He thinks adoptions might accelerate if Mexico sees a major economic crisis. In recent weeks, the strengthening US dollar has caused peso declines.\n\n“All the people that I know that used Bitcoin are very happy with the technological advantages that Bitcoin has in daily life,” Muñoz added. In the border city of Tijuana, there is Bitcoin infrastructure.\n\nOur faithful #bitcoin mascot on duty in #tijuana A photo posted by Genesis Coin Inc.

When I spoke with him about operating a Bitcoin ATM in Tijuana, he lamented the slow adoption in the region.\n\nTechnology projects perhaps struggle in Baja. The Silicon Border project, which garnered a lot of press a few years ago, has lay dormant for quite some time now. To be sure, the border politics of Baja and California could play a role in Bitcoin’s adoption over the coming years.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A team of creative technologists based in Denmark have launched a Kickstarter campaign for a digital piggy bank and app that enable children to save in bitcoin.\n\nThe Ernit app is connected to an interactive physical piggy bank that uses light to show children how close they are to reaching their saving goals.\n\nAccording to Thomas Bjerring, founder and partner at Ernit, the idea first emerged approximately three years ago, when members of the team – most of whom are parents – began to discuss the idea of giving their children digital pocket money.\n\nBitcoin, Bjerring said, seemed like an obvious option, adding:\n\n""We believe bitcoin and the concept of decentralised currencies is an important part of the future, when it comes to money and means of exchange. Bitcoin was an obvious choice when we decided what should be available for our users.""\n\nFunding and monetisation\n\nThe team – which says it received a $15,000 grant from a Danish innovation fund and has attracted approximately $75,000 from investors to date – is currently running a Kickstarter campaign to raise an additional $80,000.\n\nBjerring told CoinDesk that, if obtained, the funds would be used for ongoing development; including the addition of new features, further beta testing and producing Ernit units in additional colours.\n\nWith regards to monetisation, Bjerring said the app and the service will be free for consumers. The piggy bank, however, will be sold for a fee.\n\nHow it works\n\n“Contributions from parents are done through the app, where each family member is connected to the kid that saves money. Ways of transferring from patrons outside the family account depends on the account setup,” explained Bjerring.\n\nTo start using the system, the adult is first required to set up an Ernit app account. Users are then able to link up an Ernit wallet, a bitcoin wallet or a bank account.\n\nThe parent is then able to add their children – and any other family members willing to contribute funds – to the family’s account.\n\nOnce funds are sent to the child’s Ernit account, he or she will receive an alert on the piggy bank, which will prompt the child to claim the funds by pressing its snout.\n\nNow in possession of the funds, the child is able to distribute and track the money according to their individual saving goals.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, he expressed optimism that as the Ethereum Foundation reduced its paid staff, developers and other employees would be hired by projects building on top of the platform.\n\n""Note that a substantial number of Ethereum foundation subsidiary staff is going to be moving over to the rapidly growing for-profit Ethereum ecosystem over the next half year in order to bring more funds, interest and development effort into Ethereum-land.""\n\nOverall, Buterin sought to suggest this was a natural transition for the project, one that would find it emerging from the incubation period supported by the initial funding, to a more open-source and varied funding model more comparable to the bitcoin network.\n\nButerin stressed that the major news from the day\'s announcement was the financial support of Chinese multinational automotive giant Wanxiang, which is in the process of launching a non-profit called Blockchain Labs.\n\nWanxiang representatives confirmed Blockchain Labs recently purchased $500,000 worth of ETH as part of its wider effort to support the technology.\n\nLimited initial funding\n\nThe post notably listed figures representative of what Buterin claimed were the project\'s holdings, equalling $2.52m held in 200,000 CHF, 1,800 BTC and 2.7 ETH. At press time, 1 ETH was trading at $0.70 on bitcoin exchange Kraken.\n\nThese figures do not include a 490,000 CHF ($502,976) legal defense fund Ethereum said it is keeping on hold for possible legal defense.\n\nButerin went on to suggest that the Ethereum Foundation and its subsidiaries ""do not have the manpower"" to complete the current vision of the project, but cautioned that he does not believe that this puts the open-source project in jeopardy.\n\nMonthly expenditures from the Foundation, Buterin said, are now due to fall from 410,000 CHF ($420,858) per month to 340,000 CHF ($349,201) on 1st October. The ultimate goal will be to reduce the Foundation\'s burn rate to between 200,000 CHF ($205,370) and 250,000 CHF ($256,818) per month.\n\n""Assuming that we get there in three months and that ether and bitcoin prices stay the same, we have enough to last until roughly June 2016 at the 340,000 [CHF] rate, and perhaps up to Sep-Dec 2016 given planned transitions,"" the post continued. ""By that point, the intent is for the foundation to secure alternative revenue sources.""\n\nAccording to Buterin, contributors to the Ethereum project are able to receive funds in ETH, BTC or CHF, though he was less clear about how such payments interacted with cryptocurrency markets, stating that ETH payments had not yet ""touched primary ether markets"".\n\nButerin indicated that the Ethereum Foundation no longer had the funds to meet its hiring schedule in relation to project demands.\n\n""A hiring schedule that was meant to last over three years ended up lasting a little under two (although bolstered by a \'second wind\' from our ETH holdings),"" he wrote.\n\nPossible revenue streams\n\nThe post speculates on potential ways for the Ethereum Foundation to continue to take in funding from the community, with possible revenue streams including developer workshops and conferences, efforts Buterin suggested were already underway.\n\nThe project also committed to becoming more transparent about its finances as it seeks to work past short-term budgeting issues, suggesting it is working with Ethereum-based accounting software provider Consensys to record all its expenses in the blockchain.\n\nConfusion about the handling of project funds can be seen in interest group forums, where speculation has persisted that Ethereum\'s sale of bitcoin was having an affect on the bitcoin price as far back as last August. Further, details regarding how bitcoins raised as part of the effort would be used were scarce in its initial crowdsale communications.\n\nOf note regarding the project\'s future is that the price of ETH has declined in September, from 0.0059 BTC on 1st September to 0.0026 BTC at current market prices.\n\nImage via Ethereum\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

With the attraction of a temperate climate and low cost power, Georgia is a good site for the high-energy consumption Bitcoin mining facility, the third to have a design target of 100 MW.\n\nRead this A tour of Iceland's data centers Data centers provide the backbone for many tech services we take for granted, but what goes on behind those doors -- and why might firms including Apple and Google be interested in moving over? Read More\n\nThough the data center has the same energy target as its previous Georgian build, the newest facility should be significantly more efficient, for a number of reasons. The first is the latest generation of custom ASICs for Bitcoin mining released by BitFur. The new 16 nm ASICs are rated at four times the processing power of the previous generation's 28 nm process chips. The second is the result of BitFury's acquisition of liquid cooling technology company Allied Control. Allied's technology is a passive, two-phase immersion cooling process that is claims results in a cooling efficiency increase of as much as 4000 percent.\n\nBitFury has been very energy-aware in the placement of its existing data centers, making use of a colocation provider in Iceland and building its own data center in the city of Gori, Georgia, the latter being built with the Georgian Co-investment Fund. The nature of Bitcoin mining is one where OPEX directly impacts profitability in a very obvious manner, as the cost of power to run the Bitcoin mining operation is immediately factored into the profit on Bitcoins being generated."", 'Financial disruption from the inside\n\nRegulation makes it impossible today for most institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin. However, there are many new players trying to circumvent regulatory boundaries, or innovate from inside, instead of trying to change the regulations altogether. Innovation, instead of regulatory change, is a faster, cheaper and easier approach to change in many innovators\' and entrepreneurs\' eyes.\n\nOne of those companies is XBT Provider. In May, it launched the world’s first Bitcoin-based asset “Bitcoin Tracker One” and just recently announced its second product, a Euro-denominated Bitcoin-based security, Bitcoin Tracker EUR, available through Nasdaq Nordic on October 5.\n\n""We are proud to offer a Euro-denominated instrument to meet demand from investors worldwide,” said Alexander Marsh, CEO of XBT Provider.\n\nThe demand for Bitcoin has seen very high growth since its inception in 2009 but this demand has been accessible only for private individuals or investors who have had the flexibility to invest outside of regulated exchanges. Looking at the demand from institutional investors, this might rapidly be changing and, according to Marsh, “Bitcoin Tracker One has during periods been among the top three most-traded ETNs on Nasdaq Nordic since launch.”\n\nAttractive investment to diversify portfolio\n\nThrough the opening of Bitcoin-based assets accessible on the regular stock exchange, XBT Provider is looking to get institutional investors to understand the benefit of having Bitcoin in their portfolios, but more education is needed. “One of the advantages of diversifying your portfolio with bitcoin is that it’s still uncorrelated with other assets.” Johan Wattenström, Partner at XBT Provider explains. “Additionally, a critical number of triggers and catalysts in the Bitcoin ecosystem are now in place for a further take-off in the price.”\n\nThe volatility that has followed Bitcoin has been seen as both a blessing and a curse. For the regular investor, volatility in an asset is often seen as something negative that has to be avoided to have a stable portfolio. However, volatility for the institutional investors, and crafty traders, is instead seen as something very positive since they can capture the upward price movements and make a profit from them.\n\nBitcoin no longer an untouchable asset\n\nThere are a few benefits for investors to invest in ETNs instead of directly in the underlying asset or in an ETF. First, ETNs can track one unique asset without needing to diversify its holdings such as an ETF often must. Additionally, it can increase liquidity in otherwise highly illiquid assets. Lastly, it can give investors access to assets that are otherwise too hard to manage or require too much prior knowledge to maintain properly.\n\nThis makes ETNs a very common choice for investors who would like to invest in niche assets without needing to spend time and resources learning and understanding the underlying asset\'s technical aspects.\n\nFrom Sweden to the world\n\nBitcoin Tracker One is denominated in Swedish krona, which, being a minor currency in the global financial markets, has led to some still being hesitant to invest. Bitcoin Tracker EUR aims at changing this by making the steps for investing in bitcoin as few as possible. Being denominated in euros, it can lower fees and make bitcoin much more accessible to the global investor.\n\nCompared to bitcoin, Bitcoin Tracker One has seen incredible growth since its launch a few months ago and is currently holding more than 15,000 bitcoin. This opens up the question whether the next step to Bitcoin’s growth will come from the institutional side and not from the private investor. Additionally, it has followed the price of bitcoin on a 1:1 ratio consistently, which shows that, if managed properly, bitcoin can be considered as any other financial asset that institutional investors could consider investing in.', 'Bank of America (BoA) has filed a patent application titled “System and Method for Wire Transfers Using Cryptocurrency .” The application was filed in March and published on September 17 by the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office.\n\nThe BoA filing describes an alternative to traditional wire transfers. The funds are first transferred to a cryptocurrency exchange, then converted to a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, then sent to another exchange, and finally converted into another currency for the recipient. In other words, BoA wants to patent the concept of using a cryptocurrency as a transparent intermediate step for fiat currency transfers.\n\n“A system includes a memory and a processor,” reads the abstract of the filing. “The processor is coupled to the memory and causes the system to receive an electronic request for a fund transfer and initiate a debit of a first amount of a first currency from a customer account. In response to determining using cryptocurrency is optimal, the processor can transfer the first amount of the first currency into an account associated with a first cryptocurrency exchange and initiate the purchase of a first quantity of a cryptocurrency from the first cryptocurrency exchange. The processor can transfer the first quantity of the cryptocurrency to a second cryptocurrency exchange and initiate the sale of the first quantity of the cryptocurrency at the second cryptocurrency exchange. The processor is further able to initiate the transfer of at least a portion of the resulting currency to a recipient.”\n\nThe system includes means to determine which transfer method – including cryptocurrency – is optimal in a given case. The decision strategy is based on time factors, price factors, exchange rates, fees charged by third parties, volatility and other relevant information. If using cryptocurrency is found to be optimal, the system includes means to determine which cryptocurrency or exchange should be used. For example, the system “may choose a particular cryptocurrency exchange because the cryptocurrency is priced favorably (e.g., cheap if purchasing, expensive if selling) or because the cryptocurrency exchange has a relationship with the enterprise.”\n\nBoA claims that the system described in the patent application can reduce or eliminate disadvantages and problems associated with traditional wire transfers. The application notes that enterprises handle a large number of foreign wire transfer requests on a daily basis, and foreign transactions are becoming more common. The BoA filing is focused on making cross-border transactions faster: “It may be desirable to conduct a foreign wire transfer in less time than what current foreign wire transfer systems allow.”\n\nThe proposed BoA system can bypass traditional wire services, reduce the dependency on third party networks, and increase the reliability of fund transfers. Cryptocurrency-mediated transfers permit completing a foreign fund transfer in less time than traditional wire transfers, avoiding delays that may be caused by third party systems and services. Furthermore, transferring funds using a cryptocurrency reduces the need to transfer customer data to third-party systems, thus increasing control and security of customer data.\n\nAs usual with patents, the application tries to cover all possible technical implementations and use cases, and defines cryptocurrencies in a generic way. “A cryptocurrency is typically a peer-to-peer, decentralized, digital currency whose implementation relies on the principles of cryptography to validate transactions and generate the currency itself,” reads the filing. “Some examples of cryptocurrencies are: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Peercoin, and Dogecoin. In some instances, a cryptocurrency, such as MintChip, may be backed by a government (e.g., Canada).”\n\nToday, many banks and financial operators are warming up to the potential of digital currencies to reduce the time and cost of fund transfers, especially cross-border transfers. The BoA patent application tries to cover both existing and future cryptocurrencies, and all systems that use a cryptocurrency as a transparent intermediate step for fund transfers in fiat currencies. It seems likely that BoA is trying to claim ownership of cryptocurrency-mediated fund transfers, which might become commonplace soon. Of course, the move has been criticized by Bitcoin users, for example in this Bitcointalk discussion thread .', 'UPDATE (28th September 22:25 BST): This piece has been updated with comment from Imperial College Professor William Knottenbelt.\n\nImperial College London has established a research center dedicated to blockchain initiatives.\n\nAnnounced in the university\'s summer newsletter, the Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering grew out of previous Imperial College efforts aimed at exploring bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nThe university, founded in 1907, is considered one of the world\'s top technical institutes.\n\nThe notice explained:\n\n""With an overwhelming response from staff and students, the Centre will now coordinate research grants directed at designing and engineering improvements to the protocols that underpin blockchain technology.

09/29/2015,"['In 2014, a Bitcoin startup called BitPay raised $30 million from investors and was dubbed the “PayPal of Bitcoin” for helping companies such as Microsoft accept payments in the digital currency. But 2015 has been less kind. Last week BitPay made significant layoffs, and earlier in the month it admitted to having $1.8 million in Bitcoins stolen.\n\nThe company’s travails neatly demonstrate two problems with Bitcoin as a currency and payment mechanism.\n\nFirst, no one much wants to pay with Bitcoin and there’s not currently good reason to think that will change. BitPay’s business model was to help merchants take Bitcoin payments—often converting them directly into dollars—and take a cut of transactions. The company has enabled Microsoft, retailer Newegg, and many other companies accept Bitcoin payments.\n\nUnfortunately for BitPay, just about no one gets paid in bitcoins, and for most people there are not clear reasons to bother with the trouble of buying bitcoins just to spend them again. The people with the best incentive to buy stuff with the currency are those who bought it several years ago and are now cashing out their gains after Bitcoin’s rise in value.\n\nBitPay’s CEO Stephen Pair admitted as much in June, when he told BusinessInsider that the company was trying to find another business model. “We keep adding merchants—we’re up to over 60,000 now—but they’re selling to the same pool of Bitcoin early adopters.”\n\nGavin Andresen, who in 2010 was picked by Bitcoin’s mysterious inventor to lead work on its code, recently told me that he didn’t see that changing soon (see “The Looming Problem That Could Kill Bitcoin”). “Until part of your paycheck is regularly paid in Bitcoin, I’m not sure how it would really go mainstream,” he said.\n\nBitPay’s embarrassing loss of 5,000 Bitcoins worth $1.8 million, revealed in court documents this month, highlights another challenge facing both the company and the idea of Bitcoin as a currency. The thief was able to trick BitPay’s CEO into transferring the funds just by sending e-mails from the account of his CFO.\n\nThat reflects badly on BitPay’s compliance mechanisms. It also adds to the short but very rich history of spectacular Bitcoin thefts (see “Bitcoin’s Rise Constrained by Heists and Lost Fortunes”). They suggest that the currency’s design is not well suited to being used like conventional digital payment and money tools. Although digital, bitcoins are like cash in that transactions cannot be reversed if something goes wrong. Researcher Nicholas Weaver at the International Computer Science Institute has called that Bitcoin’s “fatal flaw.” Conventional electronic transactions such as credit card charges and bank transfers can all be undone if fraud is detected.\n\nAll this presents a big headache for BitPay—and for many other people and companies betting on the idea that Bitcoin would become a widely used payment mechanism. In addition, the Bitcoin community is currently faced with tough decisions about adjusting the cryptocurrency’s design (see “Leaderless Bitcoin Struggles to Make Its Most Crucial Decision”).\n\nThe e-mail BitPay’s CEO sent to his staff announcing layoffs last week said that the company needed to “reduce costs” so as to “better align with the pace of growth” in the Bitcoin industry. BitPay may have stumbled for reasons specific to the company. Or we might see other companies start to show the strain as hopes that Bitcoin would quickly gain traction as a currency and payment mechanism prove to be false.', 'Distributed ledger startup R3CEV has added 13 new banking partners, bringing the total number of banks involved in its activities to 22.\n\nIn a release, R3 revealed Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Citi, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Morgan Stanley, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, SEB, Societe Generale and Toronto-Dominion Bank had signed on to the project.\n\nR3 CEO David Rutter suggested in statements that the startups approach to collaborating with the market to lower the cost of delivering new blockchain initiatives was a factor in the deal.\n\nRutter said:\n\n""The addition of this new group of banks demonstrates widespread support for innovative distributed ledger solutions across the global financial services community, and we’re delighted to have them on board.""\n\nAs previously noted, R3 will lead collaborations between its members on design, engineering, experimentation and research projects related to blockchain and distributed ledger technology.\n\nWith the news, the 13 banks join nine previously announced partners including Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street and UBS, which announced support in September.\n\nGlobal Fabric for Finance\n\nIn a separate blog post, R3 director for market research Tim Swanson expanded on the vision for the startup and what it seeks to achieve with its new partners.\n\nCautioning that he did not speak for the firm, Swanson distanced R3 from bitcoin and cryptocurrency, suggesting that the startup is not working with banks to develop a digital currency and that it is not working with the bitcoin network.\n\n""Bitcoin solves a set of problems for a niche group of individuals operating under certain security assumptions (eg, cypherpunks not wanting to interface with banks or governments). Regulated financial institutions do not operate under those assumptions, thus axiomatically bitcoin in its current form is highly unlikely to be a solution to their problems at this time,"" he wrote.\n\nRather, Swanson suggested that R3 was attempting to work with its bank partners to design a new blockchain ledger system tailored for the needs of the banking community and crafted with its input.\n\nHe went on to suggest such a network may not need a mining or distributed transaction processing community, but that any efforts would likely seek to be open sourced to the community.\n\n""After all, a foundation layer this critical would benefit from the collective eyeballs of the entire programming community,"" he wrote.\n\nThe post concluded by noting that R3 is currently seeking to hire developers for its initiatives.\n\nImage via R3\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

According to a recent post by online blogger Victor Hernández’s, the article released was incorrect. Although changes have been made in the treatment of bitcoin, it is in no way banned.\n\nBitcoin is now to be regulated under Federal Law on the Prevention and Identification of Operations with Illicit Resources, an anti-money laundering law which was established in 2013.\n\nAccording to Mónica Ramírez Chimal, founder and partner of Mexico City based consulting firm, ASSERTO RSC, the regulation will affect fifteen activities that are vulnerable to money laundering. “The regulation of these activities[...] is consistent with international standards such as the Financial Action Task Force and the European Union Directives.”\n\nEx-President of Mexico, Felipe Calderon, signed the regulation into law in an effort to combat transnational crime. “The prevention of money laundering and combating financial terrorism is a fundamental part of the state\'s comprehensive strategy against organized crime,"" he stated at the time.\n\nMexico is no stranger to money laundering. Mexican drug cartels are responsible for vast amounts of money moving in and out of the country. Award winning Zeta magazine recently reported on the indictment of two men, Ayon Diaz and Contreras Arriaga who have been accused of using multiple “casas de cambio,” currency exchange houses, in Tijuana. Over $45m was laundered between Mexico and United States banks over a two year period, and was tied to the Sinaloa Cartel’s drug trafficking.\n\n- US National Money Laundering Risk Assesment\n\nThe regulation was put in place to tackle these money laundering issues, by placing restrictions on certain transactions using pesos, foreign currency, precious metals and now bitcoin. No on in Mexico can purchase real estate property with a value greater than $500,200 Pesos, US$29,239, with cash or precious metals. The purchase of goods, such as boats, cars, jewelry, art, gambling tickets or the transfer of shares or equity quotas with a value over $200,000 Pesos, US$11,691, is also banned.\n\n- Martindale Overview of Mexico’s Anti-Money Laundering Law\n\nBitcoin related companies are now expected to submit reports on vulnerable activities to the Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, The Ministry of Finance in Mexico. Under this law, there are obligations to identify clients and users, to retain and safeguard documentation, and to file relevant notices to the Ministry of Finance and to appoint an individual to be in charge of compliance.\n\nThe introduction of the this law saw some industries lose income. As reported by the Washington Post, The Morton auction house experienced a 25 to 30 percent drop in sales. According to the auction house director, Luis C. Lopez Morton, customers were afraid to make cash purchases, “They feel uncomfortable. They feel that the government is watching them.”\n\nWhether the application of this regulation will extend to bitcoin companies is yet to be seen. However, there are companies which are moving full steam ahead with incorporating digital currencies into their existing infrastructures.\n\nMost recently MercadoLibre Mexico announced its payment platform MercadoPago has integrated Bitcoin payments. MercadoLibre was founded by Marcos Galperín, employs over 3,000 people, and operates in 12 countries throughout Central and South America.\n\nShould the MercadoLibre experiment with bitcoin be successful, the platform could streamline adoption throughout South America.

We are a technology service provider for banks and we don\'t handle any money – that\'s up to our bank partners, licensed money businesses and licensed exchanges.""\n\nCollateralised tokens\n\nThe digital tokens, Kitze said, are 100% collateralised. ""This means each token that represents $1.00 has exactly $1.00 stored in a bank.""\n\nHe continued:\n\n""For digital currencies that have fiat interchange, they [the digital tokens] have to be created and operated by a bank for legal reasons. It\'s also possible to create tokens for loyalty or private currencies, and we have been testing this with a company based in Iceland for the past six months.""\n\nWhen asked about how the transactions would be processed at the point of sale, Kitze said that just like bitcoin, each party would have a secure wallet and the transaction would be recorded on the blockchain.\n\nThe recipient, he added, would receive a confirmation in his or her wallet in less than 10 seconds and would then be able to re-send these tokens.\n\nReducing friction\n\nKitze believes there is demand for such an offering as there is currently too much friction in small transactions, noting the US banking system\'s inefficiencies.\n\nThere is currently no simple and fast way, Kitze claimed, to send small amounts of cash electronically across borders and between different systems with final settlement in less than 10 seconds.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""That\'s really what we are targeting – removing the pain and friction from these kind of transactions for consumers and merchants. We think this will open a lot of things that are not possible today.""\n\nAlthough Kitze declined to reveal the platform\'s banking partners, adding that these would be disclosed later this year, he claims the platform\'s focus on the mainstream banking world is what makes it unique.\n\nRipple and Hyperledger – the latter was acquired by Blythe Masters\' firm earlier this summer – he added, could be seen as Safe Cash\'s main competitors, but Safe Cash, he said, attempts to take things further.\n\n""While these companies have done a good job to get the technology to where it is today and create awareness, things are about to move from the pioneer to the settler phase,"" he concluded.\n\nDollar image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

09/30/2015,"['Why are so many financial institutions investing in block chain innovation labs? Will the block chain, with its promise of rapid, secure and inexpensive transactions, really make many existing financial institutions obsolete as some have claimed? Thomas F. Dapp and Alexander Karollus examined the block chain’s impact on traditional financial institutions in a “talking point” article for Deutsche Bank Research, which provides macroeconomic analysis for Deutsche Bank Group. The article is titled, “Blockchain – attack is probably the best form of defence.”\n\nThe authors noted that the block chain, because it constitutes a decentralized ledger system which can manage transactions in a secure manner, has ignited a vigorous discussion in both online and offline media.\n\nBitcoin is the best-known example of a P2P technology application, the authors noted. However, the P2P network can also process fully automated and/or programmable agreements known as “smart contracts,” which bypass intermediaries, national borders and regulators. This capability was the idea proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious programmer who initiated the first bitcoin transaction in the P2P network in 2009. The log of the string of transaction chains continues to verify bitcoin transactions.\n\nA Paradigm Shift For Banks?\n\nBlock chain theory holds that individual business divisions of banks and other players will become redundant. There could also be a paradigm shift in the financial system since the P2P network could also replace many intermediary services.\n\nThese features explain the growing interest of traditional banks and other financial sector players in the new technology. Several institutions have established innovation labs devoted exclusively to the block chain. Stock exchanges, credit card firms, clearing houses and insurers are also exploring the technology for their own uses.\n\n“This may be because established intermediaries want to get an idea of whether the blockchain is actually a threat to their existence or may ultimately even offer numerous opportunities – now in the digital age – to implement new proprietary technologies which will raise the digital profile of traditional transaction banking, boosting its efficiency and, above all, execution times,” the article noted.\n\nWill The Block Chain Actually Strengthen Banks?\n\nThe ability to offer financial products and services in real time globally at reduced costs could actually catapult traditional banks back to top spot in the race to devise financial innovations, the authors noted.\n\nTraditional banks must now focus on a timely analysis of the new technological challenges and on developing strategies to claim a more active role in the innovation race. Financial institutions could defend their business models by implementing certain parts of block chain technology for their own purposes and in their own IT environment without the P2P aspect.\n\n“Thus, it is entirely conceivable that banks could, for instance, set up a new digital booking and clearing system amongst themselves enabling them to offer client transactions featuring the benefits of the blockchain, such as speed, efficiency, internationality and cost savings.” A modern clearing system among banks would likely be even less expensive and more efficient than the block chain since there would be no need for the energy-consuming “proof of work” (“mining” in bitcoin).\n\nBanks could configure their systems in a user-friendly manner for customers and provide them more personalized services which the block chain currently cannot do.\n\nWith a new proprietary digital IT infrastructure banks could thus quite conceivably be able to position themselves relatively well in relation to the blockchain technology.\n\nBanks could also assume new tasks, such as acting as custodians for cryptographic keys. Such services could ensure that customers remain on the bank’s financial platform in order to use other monetization options.\n\n“To this end, traditional banks would have to play their wild card of trust – which they (still) hold – in a much better way than has been the case so far.”\n\nAlso read: Global Financial Research Institute Seeks Grant Proposals On Block Chain Capabilities\n\nChallenges Remain For Banks\n\nBecause the technology is still in its infancy, banks and other players have time to analyze the challenges, the authors noted.\n\nThe political sector plays a key role as well. An open P2P financial system will confront regulators and law enforcement with new challenges.\n\nTo date, there has not been any regulatory restriction of P2P mechanisms in the financial system.\n\nTraditional banks should not rely on the regulator now, though, but instead actively experiment with the new technologies in their labs and collaborate without prejudice in order to create their own digital ecosystem in the medium run.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Deutsche Bank.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Chris Ryan/Nature\n\nWhen the digital currency Bitcoin came to life in January 2009, it was noticed by almost no one apart from the handful of programmers who followed cryptography discussion groups. Its origins were shadowy: it had been conceived the previous year by a still-mysterious person or group known only by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto1. And its purpose seemed quixotic: Bitcoin was to be a 'cryptocurrency', in which strong encryption algorithms were exploited in a new way to secure transactions. Users' identities would be shielded by pseudonyms. Records would be completely decentralized. And no one would be in charge — not governments, not banks, not even Nakamoto.\n\nYet the idea caught on. Today, there are some 14.6 million Bitcoin units in circulation. Called bitcoins with a lowercase 'b', they have a collective market value of around US$3.4 billion. Some of this growth is attributable to criminals taking advantage of the anonymity for drug trafficking and worse. But the system is also drawing interest from financial institutions such as JP Morgan Chase, which think it could streamline their internal payment processing and cut international transaction costs. It has inspired the creation of some 700 other cryptocurrencies. And on 15 September, Bitcoin officially came of age in academia with the launch of Ledger, the first journal dedicated to cryptocurrency research.\n\nLISTEN Noah Baker investigates what the future may hold for digital currencies You may need a more recent browser or to install the latest version of the Adobe Flash Plugin.\n\nWhat fascinates academics and entrepreneurs alike is the innovation at Bitcoin's core. Known as the block chain, it serves as the official online ledger of every Bitcoin transaction, dating back to the beginning. It is also the data structure that allows those records to be updated with minimal risk of hacking or tampering — even though the block chain is copied across the entire network of computers running Bitcoin software, and the owners of those computers do not necessarily know or trust one another.\n\nMany people see this block-chain architecture as the template for a host of other applications, including self-enforcing contracts and secure systems for online voting and crowdfunding. This is the goal of Ethereum, a block-chain-based system launched in July by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, based in Baar, Switzerland. And it is the research agenda of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3), an academic consortium also launched in July, and led by Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.\n\nNicolas Courtois, a cryptographer at University College London, says that the Bitcoin block chain could be “the most important invention of the twenty-first century” — if only Bitcoin were not constantly shooting itself in the foot.\n\nSeveral shortcomings have become apparent in Bitcoin's implementation of the block-chain idea. Security, for example, is far from perfect: there have been more than 40 known thefts and seizures of bitcoins, several incurring losses of more than $1 million apiece.\n\nCryptocurrency firms and researchers are attacking the problem with tools such as game theory and advanced cryptographic methods. “Cryptocurrencies are unlike many other systems, in that extremely subtle mathematical bugs can have catastrophic consequences,” says Ari Juels, co-director of IC3. “And I think when weaknesses surface there will be a need to appeal to the academic community where the relevant expertise resides.”\n\nAcademic interest in cryptocurrencies and their predecessors goes back at least two decades, with much of the early work spearheaded by cryptographer David Chaum. While working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Chaum wanted to give buyers privacy and safety. So in 1990 he founded one of the earliest digital currencies, DigiCash, which offered users anonymity through cryptographic protocols of his own devising.\n\nDigiCash went bankrupt in 1998 — partly because it had a centralized organization akin to a traditional bank, yet never managed to fit in with the financial industry and its regulations. But aspects of its philosophy re-emerged ten years later in Nakamoto's design for Bitcoin. That design also incorporated crowdsourcing and peer-to-peer networking — both of which help to avoid centralized control. Anyone is welcome to participate: it is just a matter of going online and running the open-source Bitcoin software. Users' computers form a network in which each machine is home to one constantly updated copy of the block chain.\n\nNakamoto's central challenge with this wide-open system was the need to make sure that no one could find a way to rewrite the ledger and spend the same bitcoins twice — in effect, stealing bitcoins. His solution was to turn the addition of new transactions to the ledger into a competition: an activity that has come to be known as mining (see 'The Bitcoin game').\n\nSource: Bitcoin.org\n\nMining starts with incoming Bitcoin transactions, which are continuously broadcast to every computer on the network. These are collected by 'miners' — the groups or individuals who choose to participate — who start competing for the right to bundle transactions into a new block. The winner is the first to broadcast a 'proof of work' — a solution showing that he or she has solved an otherwise meaningless mathematical puzzle that involves encrypted data from the previous block, and lots of computerized trial and error. The winning block is broadcast through the Bitcoin network and added to the block chain, with the proof of work providing an all but unbreakable link. The block chain is currently almost 400,000 blocks long.\n\nIn principle, this competition keeps the block chain secure because the puzzle is too hard for any one miner to solve every time. This means that no one will ever gain access to the encrypted links in the block chain and the ability to rewrite the ledger.\n\nMining is also a way to steadily increase the bitcoin supply: the miner who wins each block gets a reward, currently 25 new bitcoins. That is worth almost $6,000 at today's prices. Nakamoto's design controls the supply increase by automatically adjusting the difficulty of the puzzle so that a new block is added roughly every ten minutes. In addition, the reward for creating a block decreases by half roughly every four years. The goal is to limit the supply to a maximum of 21 million bitcoins.\n\nThe network cannot determine the value of bitcoins relative to standard currencies, or real-world goods and services. That has been left to market forces, with people trading bitcoins on online exchanges. One result is that the market price has gyrated spectacularly — especially in 2013, when the asking price soared from $13 per bitcoin in January to around $1,200 in December. That would have made the first real-world products ever paid for with the cryptocurrency — a pair of Papa John's pizzas, purchased for 10,000 bitcoins on 22 May 2010 — worth almost $12 million.\n\nPuzzle solutions\n\nIt did not take long for the problems with Bitcoin to become apparent. For example, because users are allowed to mask their identity with pseudonyms, the currency is perfect for screening criminal activity. That was behind the success of the online black market Silk Road, which the FBI shut down in 2013; its founder was sentenced to life in prison in May this year. But Bitcoin also had a key role in funding the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks — an outcome that some would call beneficial. It is difficult for society to work out a legal framework to differentiate between good and bad uses of this technology, says Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey. “How do you regulate around Bitcoin without banning the technology itself?” he asks.\n\nOther issues surfaced with Bitcoin's mining procedure. As the currency has gained value, for example, mining competition has become fiercer, with increasingly specialized computers solving the puzzles ever faster. Courtois, who has found ways to streamline the puzzle-solving process2, says that at one point he was successfully earning $200 a day through mining. The rivalry has driven the establishment of large Bitcoin-mining centres in Iceland, where cooling for the computers is cheap. According to one estimate from 2014, Bitcoin miners collectively consumed as much power as the whole of Ireland3.\n\nWorking together\n\nIntensified Bitcoin mining has also led individual miners to pool their computational resources. Last year, the largest mining pool, GHash.IO, briefly exceeded 50% of total Bitcoin mining power — which is problematic because anyone who controls more than half of the mining power could start beating everyone else in the race to add blocks. This would effectively give them control of the transaction ledger and allow them to spend the same bitcoins over and over again. This is not just a theoretical possibility. Successful '51% attacks' — efforts to dominate mining power — have already been mounted against smaller cryptocurrencies such as Terracoin and Coiledcoin; the latter was so badly damaged that it ceased operation.\n\nTo reduce the threat from mining pools, some existing cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, use puzzles that call more on computer memory than on processing power — a shift that tends to make it more costly to build the kind of specialized computers that the pools favour. Another approach, developed by IC3 co-director Elaine Shi and her collaborators4, enlists a helpful kind of theft. “We are cryptographically ensuring that pool members can always steal the reward for themselves without being detected,” explains Shi. Their supposition is that miners would not trust each other enough to form into pools if their fellow pool members could easily waltz off with the rewards without sharing. They have built a prototype of the algorithm, and are hoping to see it tested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnother problem is the profligate amount of electricity used in Bitcoin mining. To reduce wastage, researchers including Shi and Juels have proposed a currency called Permacoin5. Its proof of work would require miners to create a distributed archive for valuable data such as medical records, or the output of a gene-sequencing centre. This would not save energy, but would at least put it to better use.\n\nThe security of cryptocurrencies is another huge concern. The many thefts of bitcoins do not result from the block-chain structure, says Narayanan, but from Bitcoin's use of standard digital-signature technology. In digital signatures, he explains, people have two numeric keys: a public one that they give to others as an address to send money to, and a private one that they use to approve transactions. But the security of that private key is only as good as the security of the machine that stores it, he says. “If somebody hacks your computer, for example, and steals your private keys, then essentially all of your bitcoins are lost.”\n\nSecurity is such a concern for consumers that Narayanan thinks Bitcoin is unlikely to find widespread use. So his team is working on a better security scheme that splits private keys across several different devices, such as an individual's desktop computer and smartphone, and requires a certain proportion of the fragments to approve a payment6. “Neither reveals their share of the key to each other,” says Narayanan. “If one machine gets hacked, you're still OK because the hacker would need to hack the others to steal your private key. You'll hopefully notice the hack happened before they have the chance.”\n\nOther thefts have occurred because the private key needs to be combined with a random number to create a transaction signature. Some software — such as Bitcoin apps developed for Android smartphones — has generated random numbers improperly, making them easier to guess. This has allowed hackers to steal somewhere between several thousand and several million dollars' worth of bitcoins, says Courtois, who has been investigating such vulnerabilities7. “It's embarrassing,” admits David Schwartz, chief cryptographer at cryptocurrency developer Ripple Labs in San Francisco, California. “We as an industry just seem to keep screwing up.”\n\nInto the ether\n\nThe block chain is a remarkably powerful idea that could be applied to much more than just transaction records, says Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and chief technology officer of its foundation. One use might be to develop computerized, self-enforcing contracts that make a payment automatically when a task is complete. Others might include voting systems, crowdfunding platforms, and even other cryptocurrencies. Wood says that Ethereum is best used in situations for which central control is a weakness — for example, when users do not necessarily trust one another. In 2014, to make it easier to develop such applications, Wood and fellow programmer Vitalik Buterin devised a way to combine the block chain with a programming language. Ethereum raised 30,000 bitcoins through crowdfunding to commercialize this system.\n\nTo prevent the basic cryptography-related mistakes that have plagued Bitcoin, Ethereum has recruited academic experts to audit its protocol. Shi and Juels are looking for ways that Ethereum could be abused by criminals8. “The technology itself is morally neutral, but we should figure out how to shape it so that it can support policies designed to limit the amount of harm it can do,” says Juels.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not under anyone's direct control, so it operates outside national laws, says Wood. However, he adds that technologies such as music taping and the Internet were also considered extralegal at first, and seemed threatening to the status quo. How Bitcoin, Ethereum and their successors sit legally is therefore “something that, as a culture and society, we're going to have to come together to deal with”, he says.\n\nJuels suspects that Bitcoin, at least, will not last as an independent, decentralized entity. He points out how music streaming has moved from the decentralized model of peer-to-peer file-sharing service Napster to commercial operations such as Spotify and Apple Music. “One could imagine a similar trajectory for cryptocurrencies: when banks see they're successful, they'll want to create their own,” he says.\n\nCourtois disagrees. He calls Bitcoin “the Microsoft of cryptocurrency”, and maintains that its size and dominance mean that it is here to stay. As soon as any new innovations come along, he suggests, Bitcoin can adopt them and retain its leading position.\n\nWhatever the future holds for Bitcoin, Narayanan emphasizes that the community of developers and academics behind it is unique. “It's a remarkable body of knowledge, and we're going to be teaching this in computer science classes in 20 years, I'm certain of that.”"", ""Over the past year, bitcoin startups in the Philippines and Australia have begun to target day-to-day expenses and remittances; markets that are in desperate need of instantaneous, secure and cost-effective payment systems.\n\nStartups including Australia-based Living Room of Satoshi and Manila-based Rebit.ph, also known as the parent company of Bills Ninja, have been trying to educate the global population to use bitcoin in day-to-day expenses, such as paying utility bills and settling bank payments.\n\nPaying Bills with Ease\n\nEarlier this year, Rebit.ph acquired bitcoin bills payment platform Bills Ninja, to allow its users to settle rental, tuition, and electricity and credit card bills abroad. The service has been used by Filipino expats working in countries including Canada, UAE, Singapore, Hong Kong, Austrailia and Canada.\n\n“Using Bitcoin, we've made it easier for Rebit users to send targeted remittances. A good number of remittances coming from overseas Filipino workers are intended for bills payments anyway. By enabling our users with this service, we've made it more convenient by eliminating that second step for them,” Rebit.ph CEO John Bailon told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nAn official with Satoshi Citadel, the parent company and investor of Rebit.ph told Bitcoin Magazine that the Philippines-to-Canada, -Hong Kong and -Singapore remittance markets are huge, and that there are hundreds of thousands of Filipino employees working in these countries to support their families in their homeland.\n\nQuite often, these expat workers pay utility bills such as water and electricity and credit card bills directly from these countries, using the Rebit.ph platform or the Coins.ph platform, which is currently ranked among the top 300 most popular websites in the Philippines.\n\nCoins.ph, a competitor of Rebit.ph has seen a huge success through its partnerships with local banks, remittance outlets and financial institutions. The platform enables users to pay utility bills and cash out bitcoin at any of its supported outlets, including thousands of ATMs from the nationwide Security Bank and remittance outlets from Lhuiller and Palawan Pawn Shop.\n\nHowever, Bailon told Bitcoin Magazine that its platform is different from services such as Coins.ph, because of its over-the-counter transactions for remittances and bills payments.\n\n“Coins.ph allows people to load funds into and draw from their mobile money wallet, while Rebit is closer to the current user experience of an electronic over-the-counter transactions for remittances and bills payments,” Bailon explained.\n\nCurrently, many local residents and employees prefer to pay bills at local establishments and institutions. However, the Rebit.ph team says that the local residents are starting to recognize the advantages of bitcoin and bitcoin bills payment systems.\n\n“There needs to be a paradigm shift in consumer behavior when it comes to electronic bills payments. Most Filipinos still pay their bills in-person at establishments even though they actually have access to more convenient methods. We're getting there, and when more and more people start to realize the convenience of electronic bills payments, Rebit is here to allow them to do it over the blockchain,” said Bailon.\n\nLiving Room of Satoshi\n\nLiving Room of Satoshi, Australia-based bills payment platform allows anyone to pay any Australian bill using bitcoin. The platform has been providing bitcoin bills payment service in all sectors, including shopping, entertainment, banking, Internet, electricity/gas, rent, tax, insurance and water.\n\nThe platform has been welcomed and used by Australian residents across the country. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Australian farm Buda Foods founder and CEO Mark Burgunder said:\n\n“We currently have a great service available here called Living Room of Satoshi that allows us to make bill payments and electronic transfers to almost any bank account in Australia using bitcoins. We've been using this service on a number of occasions already with the largest purchases so far having been for chicken feed and for mobile electric fencing.”\n\nMany bitcoin enthusiasts and startups in the Philippines and Australia believe that the key to mainstream success for bitcoin is to educate the general population about its advantages, and encourage people to use bitcoin for day-to-day expenses.\n\nPhoto www.tOrange.us"", ""Vietnam’s first official bitcoin broker, Bitcoin Vietnam, recently announced the relaunch of VBTC, Vietnam’s first bitcoin exchange platform.

Among the country's richest 60 percent, only 39 percent reported having an account at a financial institution.\n\nAccording to the World Bank statistics, Vietnam receives the 11th highest amount of remittances of any country, with India and China scoring the top two positions.\n\nVietnam's remittance inflows have been increasing steadily over the years, with the 2014 remittance inflow of approximately US$12 billion.\n\nThe Vietnamese receive most of their remittances from family in the US, followed by Australia and Canada. Remittance from the US is estimated at US$6.8 billion, whereas Australia only sends US$1 billion to the country.\n\nMore than just a remittance solution, however, with this relaunch BlinkTrade hopes to provide the unbanked population with access to modern banking alternatives, all 70 percent of them.\n\nNearly everything about the VBTC service has been replaced, but perhaps the most impressive upgrade is the new ability deposit and withdrawal cash from more than 9,200 banking locations in the country. Without the need for a bank account.\n\n“These locations are all of the commercial bank branches in Vietnam. We are making use of a system, which when translated to English, means something like ‘Cash-to-ID’.” Dominik Weil, Bitcoin Vietnam Co-founder, told Brave New Coin. “All we need is the ID data of the customer to send the money to the chosen bank branch, and the client can withdraw the money in cash. (With no need for a bank account.)”\n\nThis unprecedented level of access to remittances is available now, and allows for anyone in the country to pick up remittance payments at their nearest bank, in ??ng, the local currency.\n\n- Dominik Weil, Bitcoin Vietnam Co-founder\n\nAll with competitive fees, as well. “The transaction cost for cash withdrawals are even cheaper than the normal bank wire fees to the client's account,” Weil added.\n\nOn top of remittance solutions, using banking locations allows for instant bitcoin deposits into the VBTC exchange, allowing verified users to quickly fund trades on the exchange, and make trades without leaving funds on the exchange for prolonged periods of time.\n\nHowever, there is now a lot less risk if users leave funds with them as security was another major upgrade. By integrating with industry-leading multisig wallet technology provider BitGo, VBTC provides secured account trading with multi-signature cold wallets, which require co signing by two of the three parties involved; BlinkTrade, Bitcoin Vietnam, and BitGo, in order to move customer funds.\n\nNot only do two out of three security systems need to be breached in any possible theft of bitcoin at the exchange, but BitGo also provides insurance of up to US$250,000 in case of operational security failures.\n\nContrary to previous rumors, bitcoin use has never been prohibited in Vietnam, even after the State Bank publicly declared that bitcoin has no legal tender status, in Feb 2014, and that funds or payments in Bitcoin are not protected by the law.\n\n- Nguyen Tran Bao Phuong, CEO of Bitcoin Vietnam\n\nWhile bitcoin is nowhere near being widely used and adopted in the country yet, the small bitcoin community and general interest are both rapidly growing. Bitcoin Vietnam are in talks with the country's State Bank, and a department of public security, to define applicable regulations for Bitcoin usage in the country."", 'Staying in tune with the latest technological innovation sweeping the world off its feet, Fordham University’s Rose Hill campus is hosting roundtable discussions on cryptocurrency. The Cryptocurrency Club at Fordham University (CCFU) will explore potential uses of cryptocurrencies across various fields including finance, accounting, economics, philosophy, and computer science.\n\nCCFU’s President and Co-founder Ryan Chand said, “The block chain is essentially a permanent ledger where computers verify transactions multiple times to prove they’re real. It removes the sense of an authoritative agency, which is very disruptive.”\n\nAccording to the official announcement, members will be provided with a Bitcoin starter pack that will help in an easier understanding of the relatively new technology. The starter pack will include a list of prominent firms that deal with Bitcoin and a copy of the original white paper in which the creator Satoshi Nakamoto outlined the formula for Bitcoin.\n\nThe roundtable discussions will help students understand the potential impact of Bitcoin as a disruptive technology in various fields, most importantly finance, as well as educate them on how to operate a Bitcoin wallet and get a job in the emerging industry. The cryptocurrency group will also support job placements for the candidates by bringing in notable speakers in the field for networking opportunities.\n\nThe New York-based non-profit research university is aiming to host a conference of the College Cryptocurrency Network (CCN), an international student-run organization that began as a coalition of Bitcoin clubs at Stanford University, MIT and University of Michigan in 2014. CCFU’s Kevin Leffew believes that a CCN conference could help establish Fordham as a leading University for studying cryptocurrency and the blockchain – the technology underpinning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nDr. Christine Janssen, CCFU’s advising professor and the Director of GSB’s Entrepreneurship Program said, “I commend students who are willing to break out of the usual mold – including clubs – to create something new that is relevant to both the students and to the changing face of business.”', 'Europol has said in a new report that it believes bitcoin could become the go-to currency for digital criminals in the region.\n\nThe European Union\'s top law enforcement agency released its Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment for 2015 on 30th September, outlining its view of the top cybercrime threats facing the European Union.\n\nThe report focuses on the topic of bitcoin and digital currencies in a number of contexts, including the state of criminal financing and specific elements of illicit activity involving the technology.\n\nEuropol said that, according to its data, bitcoin accounts for as much as 40% of criminal-to-criminal payments online, with PayPal accounting for 25% of those reported. The figures build on previous statements from the agency regarding cryptocurrencies as a key factor in the development of the so-called ""crime-as-a-service"" ecosystem.\n\nThe agency noted in its new report:\n\n""Although there is no single common currency used by cybercriminals across the EU, it is apparent that bitcoin may gradually be taking on that role. Bitcoin features as a common payment mechanism across almost all payment scenarios, a trend which can only be expected to increase.""\n\nOpenBazaar seen as threat\n\nThe report includes a section on the progression of law enforcement activities surrounding dark marketplaces, noting developments in the ecosystem since Operation Onymous, a November 2014 operation that resulted in the shuttering of Silk Road 2.0 and a number of other illicit sites.\n\nEuropol, pointing to that effort as ""a message"" to cybercriminals, acknowledged in the report that ""hidden services continue to grow, multiply and evolve"" despite the crackdowns.\n\nAs part of a look at future threats regarding dark markets, Europol identified OpenBazaar as an area of concern for law enforcement officials due to its peer-to-peer nature.\n\n""As the \'market\' is peer-to-peer, there would be no website or server to be targeted by investigating law enforcement and intervention is a considerable challenge, mirroring the issues law enforcement currently has with investigations involving bitcoin,"" the report noted, adding:\n\n""Payments on the OpenBazaar use a multi-signature approach involving a third-party ‘notary’ to control the release of funds. This means that there is no possibility of performing an exit scam with customers’ and vendors’ funds.""\n\nThe report recommended that law enforcement officials work “to pursue investigative and research opportunities related to emerging technologies such as decentralised marketplaces like OpenBazaar” in conjunction with the private sector and applicable academic sources.\n\nRegulatory effectiveness questioned\n\nThe report\'s authors cast doubt on the effectiveness of regulation being developed by both EU-level bodies as well as countries within the region.\n\nThe Europol report stated:\n\n""Any regulation of cryptocurrencies would likely only be applicable and enforceable when applied to identifiable users such as those providing exchange services. The inability to attribute transactions to end users makes it difficult to imagine how any regulation could be enforced for everyday users.""\n\nIt further added that ""it is clear that cybercriminals will continue to use whichever payment mechanism is convenient, familiar or perceived to be safe, including those that are already regulated and maintain anti-money laundering controls"".\n\nEuropol went on to encourage broader cooperation between law enforcement agencies on digital currencies, and further suggested that agencies ""monitor the alternate payment community"" for further intelligence into payment mechanisms.\n\nThe full 2015 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment can be found below:\n\n2015 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

From a functional standpoint, the cryptocurrency has challenged the most fundamental principles of the world’s financial systems by providing a decentralized, secured and trusted model to process financial transactions. To enable its magic, Bitcoin relies on an architecture powered by a groundbreaking technology known as the blockchain.\n\nWhile bitcoin has clearly become the most important implementation, it is just one of many practical applications that can be powered by the blockchain. From the conceptual standpoint, the blockchain provides a series of capabilities that can change some of the well-established architectures in the enterprise digital world.\n\nHow can the blockchain redefine enterprise?\n\nThe decentralized, autonomous, trusted and secured capabilities of the blockchain can redefine the foundational patterns of enterprise applications. While the principles of the blockchain are well-understood patterns in enterprise solutions, until now we have lacked practical implementations that validate its functionality at an enterprise scale. The blockchain opens a new set of opportunities to enterprise scenarios that weren’t possible before. However, in order for blockchain solutions to be embraced in enterprise, they will have to develop a series of key capabilities to get past traditional IT compliance and regulatory practices.\n\nWhat’s needed to adopt the blockchain in enterprise?\n\nDespite its unique value, the process of adopting blockchain solutions in enterprise is far from trivial. Like many other technology trends, blockchain solutions will have to develop a series of enterprise-ready capabilities to be adopted in mainstream business scenarios. Those enterprise-ready capabilities are called to address many requirements in areas such as management, operational readiness, or compliance, which are essential to adopt solutions on different industries. The following list includes some of the key capabilities required to adopt the blockchain in mainstream enterprise scenarios.\n\nDevelopment Platform: The blockchain is a very complex architecture modeled in terms of transactional exchanges. To mitigate that complexity, we need programming frameworks and languages that allow average developers to build general-purpose applications against the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain is a very complex architecture modeled in terms of transactional exchanges. To mitigate that complexity, we need programming frameworks and languages that allow average developers to build general-purpose applications against the blockchain. Monitoring Tools: To be adopted in enterprise settings, the blockchain community should produce solutions that can actively monitor the health of a blockchain network and recover from unexpected failures. These capabilities will allow organizations to monitor the runtime behavior of blockchain solutions.\n\nTo be adopted in enterprise settings, the blockchain community should produce solutions that can actively monitor the health of a blockchain network and recover from unexpected failures.

Standards will facilitate the interoperability between different blockchain platforms while also enabling important security and compliance requirements of enterprise solutions. Interoperability with Well-Established Enterprise Platforms: Like any other enterprise software trend, blockchain solutions will be required to integrate with established enterprise platforms like databases, line of business systems, etc. Enabling that interoperability will be essential to power the adoption of blockchain solutions in the enterprise.\n\n10 Enterprise Scenarios that can be Redefined by the Blockchain\n\nDecentralized IoT\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming one of the most important trends in modern enterprise software. While many IoT platforms are based on a centralized model in which a broker or hub control the interaction between devices, this model has proved to be impractical for many scenarios in which devices need to exchange data between themselves autonomously. That specific requirement has been the fundamental principle behind decentralized IoT platforms. Those decentralized models are fundamentally powered by a trusted ledger of exchanges between smart devices fundamental to power real-world IoT solutions.\n\nThe blockchain provides foundational capabilities of decentralized IoT platforms such as secured and trusted data exchange as well as record-keeping. In this type of IoT architecture, the blockchain will serve as the general ledger, keeping a trusted record of all the messages exchanged between smart devices in an IoT topology.\n\nKeyless Signature\n\nPublic Key Infrastructure (PKI) has been one of the fundamental technologies powering data signatures. PKI models rely on a central authority to stamp and validate signatures on a data payload. While PKI models have been incredibly successful, the dependency on a central authority presents serious limitations for large-scale scenarios and is also vulnerable to attacks involving quantum computation.\n\nThe characteristics of the blockchain can help to overcome some of the limitations of PKI models with a keyless security infrastructure (KSI). A KSI model uses only hash-function cryptography, allowing verification to rely only on the security of hash functions and the availability of a public ledger commonly referred to as a blockchain.\n\nData Archiving\n\nArchiving historical data in a secure and trusted manner has been a permanent challenge of enterprise IT. Companies like EMC have become one of the most iconic enterprise software companies in history by providing robust storage and archiving solutions. More recently, cloud platform vendors such as Amazon have provided alternative data archiving solutions. However, in both cases, data archiving solutions rely on a centralized storage model, which has well-known limitations in enterprise scenarios in areas such as security and privacy.\n\nDecentralized and autonomous data archives models, such as the ones provided by the blockchain, can be an interesting alternative to centralized data storage solutions. This model will eliminate the dependency on a centralized authority and will allow distributed and trusted storage across nodes in a blockchain network. More importantly, using the blockchain as a data archive will allow any nodes to validate the authenticity of the archived data without relying on central hub.\n\nDecentralized B2B Auditing\n\nBusiness-to-business (B2B) exchange models are one of the foundations of modern commerce. In those scenarios, transaction tracking, auditing and reconciliation processes are essential capabilities of B2B processes. Traditional B2B platforms enable these capabilities by providing centralized transaction tracking models that will be used by the different B2B endpoints to log relevant events of a specific transaction. These centralized tracking models have proved to be impractical to address many of the typical challenges of B2B transaction tracking processes in areas such as auditing and reconciliation.\n\nLeveraging the blockchain as a decentralized, secured and trusted transaction ledger could be a more effective model to address the challenges of B2B transaction tracking solutions. Using the blockchain, each party in a B2B process could autonomously track the events related to a B2B transaction without the need to rely on a centralized authority. Additionally, the security capabilities of the blockchain will facilitate the implementation of more sophisticated reconciliation and auditing processes.\n\nLegal Proof of Existence or Proof of Possession\n\nValidating the existence or the possession of signed documents is an incredibly relevant element of legal solutions. The challenge of traditional document validation models is that they relied on central authorities for storing and validating the documents, which presents some obvious security challenges, but also becomes more difficult as the documents become older.\n\nThe blockchain provides an alternative model to proof-of-existence and possession of legal documents. By leveraging the blockchain, a user can simply store the signature and timestamp associated with a document in the blockchain and validate it at any point using the native blockchain mechanisms.\n\nDistributed File Storage\n\nCloud file storage solutions such as Box, Dropbox or One Drive are becoming regular citizens of modern enterprise environments. Despite its popularity, cloud file storage solutions typically face challenges in areas such as security, compliance and privacy in order to be adopted in enterprise environments. Those concerns are all rooted behind the fact that enterprises need to trust a third-party cloud system with their confidential documents.\n\nSecurity Trade Settlement\n\nCentral Security Depositaries (CSDs) have been an essential element of modern equity and bond trading. In the U.S. equity market, following frequent bottlenecks during the late 1960s in the settlement of securities trades, CSDs smoothed the post-trade process for transferring share ownership by eliminating the exchange of paper certificates and recording transactions in central, computerized book-entry systems. The international CSDs Euroclear and Cedel (now Clearstream) played a similar role in the Eurobond market from the 1970s onward.\n\nThe centralized nature of CSDs is essential to successful bond and equity trades. However, the settlement process via CSDs is incredibly expensive and slow, averaging two or three days per trade settlement.\n\nThe blockchain offers an interesting alternative to traditional CSDs as a decentralized ledger that can keep records of transactions without relying on a central authority. The query capabilities of the blockchain will allow the settlement of trades in minutes or even seconds and at a fraction of the cost of the current CSD solutions.\n\nAnti-Counterfeiting\n\nCounterfeiting remains as one of the biggest challenges in modern commerce. Segments like luxury goods, pharmaceutical or electronics are constantly affected by counterfeiting. As a result, the demand for anti-counterfeiting remains one of the hottest topics in the digital commerce world. Unfortunately, most solutions in the market require a trust in the third-party authority, which introduces a logical friction between merchants and consumers.\n\nThe decentralized and security capabilities of the blockchain can enable an interesting alternative to traditional anti-counterfeiting platforms. In that sense, we can envision a model in which brands, merchants and marketplaces are part of a blockchain network with nodes storing information to validate the authenticity of specific products. In this model, brands don’t have to trust a central authority with their product authenticity information and can rely on the security and decentralized trust models of the blockchain.\n\neGoverment\n\nGovernments all over the world are investing deep resources to digitize many of their existing processes. Many of these processes deal with sensitive information that require sophisticated levels of traceability, privacy and security. Inevitably, the digital collaboration process relies on trust on centralized authorities.\n\nThe blockchain capabilities provide a robust option to enable the digital collaboration between government agencies and citizens. In this model, different government agencies can store records in blockchain nodes so that it can be accessed and verified by other government parties and citizens in a secure and trusted way.\n\nP2P Commerce\n\nTraditional ecommerce business models are based on the presence of a centralized entity that control activities such as order processing, inventory management, catalog access, etc. In order to buy and sell goods, ecommerce marketplaces need access to sensitive user information such as credit card information, user profile data etc. This information often becomes the target of cybersecurity attacks and many other security and regulatory challenges.\n\nThe architecture of the blockchain can enable the first effective peer-to-peer (P2P) ecommerce network in which buyers and sellers can interact directly without the need of a central authority. The absence of a central marketplace eliminates many of the restrictions of ecommerce models such as fees, regulated transactions, etc.\n\nSummary\n\nThe blockchain represents one of the most important advancements in computer science of the last few years. The ability to enable decentralized, secure, trusted and highly scalable architectures opens the door to a new group of enterprise software solutions on a large number of industries. Blockchain-powered solutions have the opportunity to challenge some of the fundamental architecture principles of enterprise solutions in areas such as security, data storage, trust, etc. Similar to Bitcoin, we should expect to see spectacular platforms in the enterprise software space powered by the blockchain.', ', September 30, 2015 at 16:00 UTC\n\nBitcoin lending platform Bitbond today announced the launch of its new global affiliate program.

Investing and borrowing through Bitbond is accessible to everybody who has an internet connection. Therefore the platform and its users are independent from the traditional banking system.\n\nPrevious to starting Bitbond, founder and CEO Radoslav Albrecht worked at Deutsche Bank London and consulting firm Roland Berger.\n\nThe publication of a press release on this page should not be viewed as an endorsement by CoinDesk. Customers should do their own research before investing funds in any company.', 'In Part One of my interview with the musician, investor, and entrepreneur, D.A. Wallach, we discussed the “poorly architected systems” of the music industry, and how blockchain technology could potentially resolve some of these issues via its decentralized nature and smart contracts.\n\nIn addition to the above list of accomplishments, Mr. Wallach has had a long relationship with Spotify, and was for a time their artist in residence.\n\nAs anyone who has had the mis/good fortune of spending any time with me, or hearing me speak at conferences, knows, I have a troubled-at-best relationship with Spotify.\n\nThat said, I do feel strongly that the vast majority of people who work not just at Spotify, but in the music industry, generally are doing so because they value art, and genuinely do not want to intentionally harm artistic creators.\n\nIn short, I believe they mirror the sentiment that I came up with and try to repeat as often and loudly as I can: More Art Equals Less War.\n\nGiven this, and – importantly – given the fact that Mr. Wallach is an artist, I was eager to get his perspective on both Spotify, specifically, and the music business, generally.\n\nWhile Mr. Wallach and I don’t necessarily see eye to eye on Spotify, one thing we resoundingly agree on is, as Mr. Wallach says: “If we want to fix the music industry, we have to get more money flowing into it.”\n\nOur conversation below has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity, but otherwise is transcribed verbatim. If you prefer, you can listen to the entirety of our conversation here.\n\nGeorge Howard: What is your role at Spotify? What type of work are you doing there?\n\nD.A. Wallach: My role at Spotify is really limited now. I have put in three and a half years of really intense work there, and, my responsibility as “artist in residence” was really to do two things: One, to help educate the creative community about Spotify’s business model, and to sort of allay peoples’ terror that this was going to destroy everything, which I’ve never believed it would.\n\nAnd, on the other hand, I have a more exciting important role I played: To be a vehicle for artists and the creative community into Spotify.\n\nAnd, things that we have built at Spotify, that were sort of catalyzed by my efforts, were to sell merchandise to the fans of the product, with the ability to sell concert tickets, and increasingly the ability to derive analytics from the behavior of people who were listening to your music.\n\nSo, I was meant to be a sort of voice of artists within the company, and obviously this has been a really fraught topic, and I’ve spoken over the past few years literally to thousands of musicians and managers and, you know, my view remains that this is going to be a really, really fantastic development for artists and for the music industry and that’s what got me involved in the first place.\n\nGH: They are lucky to have had you. I contend that they need a lot more people like you working there. But, certainly having you is awesome.\n\nI am very candid about my frustrations, and also with the potential possibilities of Spotify. And, I have been really transparent about it. I do think that - if it is sort of viewed as a discovery tool, and with some of the things that you have done, whether it’s with merchandise or tickets – it potentially can provide value to artists. And that’s a sort of nice throughline that provides some value.\n\nOtherwise, it is fairly easy to see as Spotify using the artist to get subscribers without compensating the artist fairly.\n\nSo, I am interested to hear how you see blockchain related to this, or not. But, how do you see Spotify grow and evolve into a place where it becomes a good business, both for them and for artists?\n\nDW: Right. I think this relates to — in some way to what you were envisioning for the future of PROs — a sort of decentralized automated infrastructure. [NOTE: In Part One of our conversation, I lay out my theory for how blockchain technology could obviate the role of PROs by providing direct relationships between those who desire to use music (restaurants, radio stations, etc.) and music creators.]\n\nGH: Yes.\n\nDW: So, what Spotify is trying to create for consumers is a way of listening to music and paying for it, that [consumers] basically don’t have to think about it.\n\nGH: Got it.\n\nDW: Just automate everything about the consumer experience. So, the idea is that right now consumers for the most part get - the vast majority of people - listen to a lot of music, but they don’t pay anything for it.\n\nI look at this really, really simply and my starting point is that if we want to fix the music industry, we have to get more money flowing into it.\n\nSo, a lot of the conversation about Spotify and live streaming and everything is about how money is shared within the industry, but the problem that I have always focused on is how do we get more money into the industry?\n\nGH: Love it.\n\nDW: So, for me almost axiomatically, the only way you can do that is to convince people who aren’t paying a lot for music to spend more on music than they are spending right now.\n\nGH: Which is nothing.\n\nDW: Which is nothing.\n\nGH: If you are starting from a baseline of zero, as you say, getting more people to pay for music is axiomatically a good thing if the distribution of those funds in a sort of reasonable way, that both allows for artists, and the companies that are trying to build businesses around them, to survive.\n\nDW: Absolutely. And look, there are going to be competing models for how to best accomplish this. All that we can say right now is that, after four years, nobody in the world has done a better job than Spotify of getting people to pay for subscriptions to music.\n\nAnd, the marketplace is getting more competitive.\n\nApple is dealing with a different model without a free tier. Other people will come along and have different models, and, as an artist, I want a lot of competition, right?\n\nGH: Yeah.\n\nDW: And so to your point, what I want to see is a world in which entrepreneurs are really excited to build competitive businesses in and around music.\n\nAnd, when I look at Spotify and Google and Apple getting into this; what I see is that, holy cow thank God: if you are an artist you’ve now got the biggest technology companies in the world fighting with each other to build the most exciting music products.\n\nGH: Boy, I love that! I love your spirit. The cynical view… and it’s not my view. I want to be clear; I am much more in line with you.\n\nDW: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nGH: But, the cynical view would be:\n\nBut, that’s only because people like music, and if these companies can use music as a loss-leader to compel people to buy other products — and for Apple that’s iPhones, for Spotify, that’s maybe a video product down the road, or what have you — then, the music is just simply a loss-leader for that. The artists - they are a dime a dozen. They self replicate.\n\nDW: The artist, the industry at large, and record labels can take a cynical view if they want. That’s alright. We create the music. We own it. If you sell it to a record label, they own it. This is everyone’s right. If we take a cynical attitude, what that will mean is that people don’t want to come and start businesses around music.\n\nWe as an industry either have to be welcoming or we have to be really formidable.\n\nGH: But, wait. Who is the industry that has to be welcoming or formidable?\n\nDW: I think it’s artists. I think it’s record labels. I think it’s publishers. I think it’s performing rights organizations.\n\nSo, when you look at the nineties, basically if you wanted to be general about the industry, the attitude was: pirating was bad. Consumers who are pirating are breaking the law. They are stealing our [the labels’] shit, which is basically true. Anyone who is building a company which helps them do that [e.g. Napster] is breaking the law, and we [labels] are going to sue them into oblivion, and we are going to make them disappear. Because ultimately, we [labels] create the music. We have the power. We can tell the consumer how they are going to listen to our stuff and how they are going to pay us and it’s on our terms.\n\nAnd, it didn’t work.\n\nGH: It didn’t work.\n\nDW: It was a disaster, and as a result of that, all the consumers stopped paying.\n\nAnd, so we ended up with an industry that was horribly mismanaged. Where none of the consumers paid any money for music, and as a result all the money disappeared and artists don’t have money. And, that’s a really bad problem to have as a media business.\n\nAnd so, when I got involved in Spotify, I looked at Daniel Ek and the folks who started the company and I said, “Jesus, here are some really competent, smart, enthusiastic, determined people who want to try and fix this.”\n\nAnd, of course, their motivation is not only fixing it as a moral solution for artists, it is because we actually can get people to pay for music again. And, if we can do that, we are going to make a ton of money too.\n\nGH: Yeah. Which I am fine with, by the way.\n\nAt the very beginning of our conversation, we were talking about blockchain tech, and one of the motivations there is: there is an economic incentive to be a miner and do all those other things.\n\nI think we are really in harmony here. So, I hope I am not coming across as disagreeing with you. You have an inside advantage that I just don’t have. All I can look at is the actions. But, I have no problem — in fact, I think it’s imperative — that these companies have a financial incentive.\n\nI think the worst thing that we could do is to say that there is some sort of noblesse oblige; we should just do music for the public good or something like that. Then, we end up with museums and things. There has got to be an economic imperative. And that is why I go back to blockchain.\n\nDW: Well, let me use this as a pivot into talking about why I think streaming actually sets the stage for a sort of decentralized infrastructure. And that’s what we are talking about. And, the reason for that is that - there are two:\n\nThe first is that companies like Spotify — and this is something that I have seen from the inside — they have to manage how complex the industry is and how fragmented the information is. It costs them a ton of money and takes up a lot of time. And, when we talk about an industry that welcomes entrepreneurships and innovations, I think that means we have to lower the barriers to entry, right? And, one of those barriers right now is that if you want to start up by a competitor and you are George in Boston….\n\nGH: You have to negotiate with all the master rights holders.\n\nDW: Oh my God! You have to deal with all this complex stuff. And then you have to find some computer genius…\n\nGH: And deal with 7Digital or some of these master holders that are . . .well . . . I am not going to say what I really think, but that are challenging at best to deal with. But, go ahead.\n\nDW: And, you have to build this insanely complicated database to deal with rights ownership and payment specs. Who do you hire to do that? These are all problems that should be non-problems. That’s one.\n\nGH: I love this. So, let’s be clear — and this is what I do in my consulting business — if somebody comes in and says, “I want to start a music streaming service,” unfortunately, I have to tell them the Byzantine pathway to doing that which are mired in all the transaction costs and uncertainty, and uncertainty is the worst thing for investment.\n\nDW: Right. But, let’s talk about what a solution could look like. Now, the other aspect of streaming music, in particular, is that — this is hotly contested but, for better or worse — the business model requires you to pay out a fraction of a cent every time people play something.\n\nSo, we are moving from an industry where a consumer buying a song for a dollar can play it forever. We say, “Look, every time you listen to something, you pay a very tiny amount and we are going to pay that out to the artist and let him keep a fraction of it.”\n\nWhat this means practically, is that the music industry as a whole, is moving towards a micropayments based economy. Right now we don’t have the infrastructure to support that.\n\nSo, the way a company like Spotify approaches this, is you basically look every week, or every month, or every quarter, at how much stuff got played. And you say, each time it got played that was a half of a penny multiplied by the number of plays. That’s the check that we are going to write every month.\n\nAnd, what would be much better is if companies like Spotify — every time someone listened to a song — could instantaneously issue a micropayment. They literally can’t do that today, because: how do you do it? You can’t send a friend half a cent.\n\nGH: Exactly.\n\nDW: So you need a financial infrastructure that allows for the flow of fractional payments in real time. And that would be a great service to artists. It would be a great service to services like Spotify and Google and Apple.\n\nGH: I want to talk at this point about morality. To really know where you are going with that; how blockchain has a moral component to it? Because typically when you talk about financial tech, I think people are very skeptical about the immoral things you could do with it.\n\nBut, what you have suggested is completely in line with what I have proposed too: using a cryptocurrency to do the micropayments and obviate those transaction costs. Do them in real time. And, here’s what important: Do it transparently.\n\nWhen you have a company like Kobalt that can enter a very convoluted and crowded space and gain market share just by saying, “Hey, yeah. We are not going to lie to you,” it shows you the type of demand for moral or at least transparent procedure.\n\nThe transparency obviates so much of these unethical foundations in the music businesses.\n\nDW: Totally. And, one thing that I have taken away from my experience with Spotify, and dealing with the record labels is that look, the music industry has a terrible history of screwing artists and being full of evil atrocious con artists, right? But, my experience — at the highest levels of Universal Music Group, with Warner Bros., or any of these places — is that most of the people are really nice people.\n\nGH: I totally agree.\n\nDW: And, most of them are…it’s like if you are in the United States Congress today, it’s not your fault that you have to spend half of your time raising money.\n\nGH: The system sucks. Right.\n\nDW: The system sucks, and everybody who is involved with this, is basically complicit in this thing because nobody has stepped up and created a solution.\n\nGH: There’s the moral problem and that’s because they’re afraid. They are afraid at the higher levels that if they step to the higher level of innovation, that you and I are talking about, they are going to get fired. And, so they don’t.\n\nDW: Yeah. Hell yeah. And, also there is a more charitable view, which is that it’s really hard.\n\nGH: Of course it’s hard. But that’s their job!\n\nDW: There is a reason I wrote Bitcoin For Rock Stars, and didn’t start this company. I think this is a ten-year project. You need people who are really, really capable and maniacally obsessed with this problem.\n\nThe state of the art now as I look at it is poised to produce the sort of solution that you and I are talking about and grasping for, in general.\n\nWhat I have yet to see necessarily, is the right entrepreneur, approaching it in exactly the right way, and there are a bunch of folks working on parts of the problem, who are talented and really, really interesting. But, what I want to see is folks coming together, and working exhaustively to make this happen.\n\nGH: That’s what it is going to take. But, D.A., you’ve got the ball rolling. I can’t thank you enough for not only writing the article, but for the work that you have done on behalf of artists.\n\nI know now having talked to you exactly where it stems from. So, we are all grateful to you for what you have done. I am grateful to you for taking the time—it was more time than you allocated. So, I appreciate it. But this has been wonderful to talk to you. So, thank you very much.\n\nDW: Absolutely. It has been pleasure, George. Thanks.', 'Three upstate New York politicians say they’re proud to be associated with Bitcoin as Bethlehem Town Clerk candidate Melanie Dumers (R, C – Bethlehem) and Stillwater Town Council candidate Patrick Nelson (D, T – Stillwater) join Troy, NY mayoral candidate Jim Gordon (R, C, I, RE, G – Troy) in accepting Bitcoin campaign donations.\n\nAll three candidates are critical of the controversial New York State BitLicense. Two are new, but enthusiastic, Bitcoin supporters and all are ready to integrate Bitcoin acceptance or block chain technology into their local governments.\n\n“I’ve been following Bitcoin for years,” Nelson said in an exclusive CCN interview, “and it really wasn’t a second thought that when I decided to run that we would accept bitcoin donations.”\n\nBitLicense “Anti-Small-Business,” says Dumers\n\nDumers, a BitPay customer who is against the BitLicense, said in an exclusive CCN interview that she wants “to be on top of the most innovative technology” and appreciates the security and low fees offered by Bitcoin, relative to PayPal.\n\nGordon concurs with Dumers’s position on the BitLicense and laments New York state’s loss of small companies due to the early regulatory framework. Nelson takes a more moderate position in favor of regulation but is, likewise, critical of the BitLicense, telling CCN that “it fails greatly to strike the proper balance and instead raises the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs.”\n\n[Bitcoin] is well in line with the principles of federalism and checks and balances that underlie the American system of government,” said Nelson, a Coinbase customer. “The blockchain and bitcoin are poised to do for the transfer of value, what the internet did for the transfer of information.\n\nBlockchain Tech for Local Governments\n\nDumers would like to see the Town Clerk’s office use blockchain technology to help keep residents’ personal information secure from cyber attacks.\n\nBitcoin and the blockchain could go as far as keeping encrypted records of birth certificates and other confidential paperwork on a decentralized network,” said Dumers. “This could change the way recordkeeping is done at a local, state, and federal level.\n\nGordon takes a more conservative tack on securing residents’ personal information with the blockchain but wants to accept bitcoin for payment of taxes and municipal fees. Nelson is also open to this idea for his town of Stillwater.\n\nStill in the Early Stages\n\nNone of the candidates expect campaign finance reporting complications despite the fact that the state Board of Elections has yet to take a position on the use of Bitcoin in politics.\n\nDumers is gearing up to make her first bitcoin purchase, Gordon says he made a donation with bitcoin and Nelson regularly spends his coins at local cafes and theaters.\n\nWe are still in the very early stages of adoption for digital currencies and the blockchain. It’s very promising to see our younger politicians already embracing the technology and rewarding themselves early on with the benefits of a decentralized payment network – stated Paul Paterakis, a member of the NY Bitcoin Group, who is representing the candidates in the Bitcoin space.\n\nPhotos courtesy Melanie Dumers for Bethlehem Town Clerk and Patrick Nelson.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
