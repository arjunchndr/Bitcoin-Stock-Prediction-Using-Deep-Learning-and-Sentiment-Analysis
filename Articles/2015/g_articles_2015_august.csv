Thursday was the day that the Ethereum Project finally launched, after much sound and fury, including raising ~US$10 million (in Bitcoin.) It’s a fascinating, wildly ambitious project, and it is vaporware no more.\n\nTo explain Ethereum, let’s first go back to Bitcoin. By now it’s widely understood that Bitcoin is a virtual currency secured by cryptography and the computing power of its decentralized mining network. It’s less well understood that Bitcoin is more than just bitcoins; every Bitcoin transaction is actually a program written in a custom scripting language. That language is not Turing-complete, though, meaning, basically, it’s not a full-fledged programming language.\n\n(Turing-complete is not a particularly high bar. PostScript is Turing-complete. TrueType fonts come with a Turing-complete scripting language. Bitcoin’s scripting language isn’t because that was a deliberate security/performance decision by Satoshi Nakamoto.)\n\nEthereum, like Bitcoin, is built on a blockchain, and has a decentralized mining network. Its coins are called “Ethers”; it raised its millions in seed money by pre-mining and selling a large quantity of ethers to believers/investors. But its scripting language is Turing-complete and full-featured, which vastly expands the kinds of smart contracts that it supports. Indeed, Ethereum is intended not as a new cryptocurrency, but as a massive virtual machine running atop a decentralized blockchain.\n\nTo me, the two most interesting things about Bitcoin are that it is fully decentralized, and it is programmable money. Ethereum is both of those things on steroids. It is explicitly designed to “decentralize the web,” i.e. provide services and content that are maintained by its entire network, without having to rely on, or trust, any particular company or server cluster. (The pedant in me wants to argue that “decentralize the Internet” is both more accurate and more meaningful, but never mind.)\n\nThe potential applications are extraordinarily wide-ranging. Decentralized web sites. Decentralized messaging. An interesting forecasting / early-warning-system prediction market named Augur has already alpha launched atop Ethereum. I expect, eventually, whole categories of smart-contract applications that don’t yet exist at all — such as decentralized autonomous systems — because blockchain-based virtual machines are whole new kind of platform.\n\n…OK, let’s cease the starry-eyed handwaving and return to earth for a bit. These are very early days; this is only the first preliminary phase of a multi-stage launch. (One which will theoretically end with an eyebrow-raising transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, for you hardcore cryptocurrency nerds out there.) Even then, performance will be terrible; it will be a decentralized virtual machine, but a painfully slow and weak one compared to the computer on your desk, or even the one in your pocket.\n\nMy suspicion is that Ethereum is an important step forward, a significant milestone, but by no means the end of the road. My guess is that it will eventually, or even soon, be supplanted by some other sidechain that builds on its concepts. (Not a new notion; Counterparty, for instance, has already implemented Ethereum’s smart contracts.)\n\nBut maybe I’m wrong; maybe Ethereum is the new DOS, not the new CP/M. Either way, congratulations are in order to its founder (and Thiel Fellow) Vitalik Buterin, and the rest of its team. They have built and shipped something genuinely new, extraordinarily ambitious, and intellectually fascinating. That’s much more than most startups can say.', 'A TRADER in the digital currency bitcoin has told how he had thousands of pounds of cash seized under legislation usually used to target drug dealers.\n\nMax Flores, 27, was told by his bank that his account had been frozen while they investigated an issue. He was subsequently told his account was being closed and asked to come and collect his money at a specific time and date.\n\nBut when Flores left the bank in May this year, he was stopped by police and told his cash was being seized under proceeds of crime legislation.\n\nA court then granted permission for prosecutors to hold the money for three months to allow investigations, with allegations of behaviour that pointed to money laundering.\n\nHis money was handed back at the beginning of July after his solicitor appealed the decision, pointing out Flores traded in bitcoins. However he has lost around £1,200 out of his original £5,500 in legal fees trying to get the money back.\n\nIt is believed to be the first case of its kind in Scotland involving bitcoin. The digital currency was launched in 2009 and can be bought using traditional money from a bitcoin exchanger.\n\nFlores, from Glasgow, said he first became interested in bitcoin in 2011 and decided to trade occasionally to help people get access to the digital currency.\n\nHe believes problems arose when his bank filed a “suspicious activity report’ against him – but has never been given an explanation of what happened.\n\nHe said: “The bank only told me I couldn’t use my account and said it had been frozen until we investigate something. They then said your account is getting closed and asked me to come in and get my money at a specific time and date.\n\n“I was stopped by the police when I left the bank – they said you are not under arrest, but we are taking your money.\n\n“When they took me to the station I asked do you know anything about me? When they said no, I told them if you try googling me you will find out that I am a bitcoin trader.\n\n“It never even got to the second (court) hearing – as soon as I could explain everything, the court gave me my money back to me straight away.\n\n“The police made claims such as I had been claiming housing benefit – which was completely false information and I have no idea where that came from.”\n\nFlores said his money totally £5,500 was held for a total of around four months while the bank and police investigated.\n\nHe added: “I have probably lost around £1200 trying to get it back, through costs such as solicitor’s fees. Surely they should have to prove there is a crime before they take the proceeds?\n\n“I have no idea if I have been left with a black mark on my credit rating or anything as a result, I just don’t know.”\n\nLaura Irvine, of Edinburgh-based bto solicitors, who represented Flores, said his money had been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. This allows police to seize money if they have ‘reasonable grounds’ for suspecting that it is the proceeds of crime.\n\nIrvine said: “The legislation tends to be used typically for drug dealers who there is maybe not enough evidence to convict them of any criminal offence, but there is plenty of intelligence in the background which suggests that is what they are up to.\n\n“When money is found in their possession that they have no other explanation for then the default is that it is the proceeds of crime and the Crown can take it.\n\n“However when you look at the circumstances of Flores case it may be a slightly less justified approach\n\n“There was evidence of money going through his bank accounts and it is correct to say that is typical of money laundering, and it is correct to say Max didn’t have an income at that point - so it may look on the face of it to be strange.\n\n“But they certainly knew that bitcoin trading was in the background. That to me was the most disturbing aspect of this – there was no real identification of what the criminal conduct was.”\n\nPol Clementsmith, Scotland officer with the Open Rights Group (ORG), which campaigns on digital rights, said: ""ORG Scotland are pleased with the outcome of this appeal because it illustrates that currencies like bitcoin have a positive role to play in our society in the digital age.\n\n“Unfortunately, in banking and law enforcement circles, there is a suspicion that digital currencies are de facto illegitimate because they are mainly used to perpetrate illegal proceeds of crime transactions - but this is simply not true.\n\n“Digital money is no more likely to be criminal than the cash you have in your pocket.\n\n“Currency isn\'t illegal in and of itself; it\'s what people choose to do with that currency which may be illegal.”\n\nHe added: “Thankfully Mr Flores has been vindicated in the first case of its kind in Scotland and it is hoped that in future cases where digital currencies are involved that the authorities will learn from the mistakes made in this case.”\n\nA spokesman for the Crown Office said:“Trading in bitcoins is perfectly legal.\n\n“In this case, however, suspicions were raised about the specific nature of some transactions\n\n“The cash was seized, pending an inquiry that was hampered by the individual’s initial refusal to provide any information about its source.\n\n“Once the investigation was complete and no basis for forfeiting the cash had been established, it was handed back.”', 'MIKE BLAKE | Reuters | BDN MIKE BLAKE | Reuters | BDN\n\nBRENDAN MCDERMID | REUTERS | BDN BRENDAN MCDERMID | REUTERS | BDN\n\nBAZ RATNER | REUTERS | BDN BAZ RATNER | REUTERS | BDN\n\nThe virtual currency Bitcoin recently took another step closer to becoming a mainstream tool of finance, thanks to the debut of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX: GBTC). The trust represents the first mechanism for trading Bitcoin on a public exchange, bringing it out of the shadows of alternate currencies.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Bitcoin, it is a decentralized monetary system where all transactions are logged into the “Blockchain,” a giant third-party accounting ledger for worldwide transactions. The supply of Bitcoins is limited and based on increasingly difficult cryptographic puzzles that are solved by “miners” that bring Bitcoins into existence (“miners” being intentional to mimic the mining of precious metals, another limited resource).\n\nWhy was the Bitcoin Investment Trust created?\n\nPrior to the Bitcoin Investment Trust, the only way to invest in Bitcoins was buying them either from an individual or from one of several online Bitcoin exchanges. This required tracking your Bitcoins in your digital “wallet,” an application that allows encrypted digital storage on your computer or smartphone with a private key. There is no central authority to send you a new key, so without a backup, your Bitcoins could be lost (“orphaned” in Bitcoin-speak) in case of a crash or a lost key. The Bitcoin Investment Trust makes investing easier and relatively hassle-free since you do not have to worry about storing and handling issues.\n\nHow does the investment trust work?\n\nAs a publicly traded vehicle, the Bitcoin Investment Trust also allows Bitcoins to be incorporated into some retirement accounts as a potential higher-return component, furthering mainstream acceptance.\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust began as a private trust, with investors being allowed to sell their shares after a twelve-month lockup period. That period ended at the beginning of May, but original investors have been slow to sell any of their holdings. As a result, shares were scarce and the fund had been selling at a considerable premium over the Bitcoin price — although that gap has closed considerably as of mid-July.\n\nThe open-ended trust was set up to represent 1/10 of the current value of Bitcoin (as of this writing, one Bitcoin was worth slightly over $292). It is relatively small, with only $35.58 million in assets and just over 14 million shares outstanding. A fact sheet on the trust may be found here.\n\nHow has the trust done so far?\n\nResults are mixed at best. After some volatility and sluggish trading during the early weeks of May, the Bitcoin Investment Trust has been steady at around 30 through June and July. Mainstream investors may still be slow to warm to Bitcoin due to a lack of understanding, or they may consider it too risky and unproven. The trust also charges 2 percent in fees, a relatively high rate for this type of fund.\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust does have some enthusiastic backers, most notably the West Coast brokerage and investment bank Wedbush. Gil Luria of Wedbush says Bitcoin has “the potential to disrupt the existing financial infrastructure over the next few years,” especially with its potential use in cross-border online payments, micropayments (since Bitcoin can be divided into eight decimal places), and possibly in future machine-to-machine transactions (think the Internet of Things).\n\nCompetition may be coming soon in the form of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, which is undergoing SEC review and would be the first official exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Bitcoins. The Bitcoin Investment Trust is not a true exchange-traded fund, although it operates like one.\n\nIf you are intrigued by Bitcoin but uninterested in the purchasing and maintenance of Bitcoins directly, the Bitcoin Investment Trust may be worth your consideration — or you may want to wait for the Winklevoss offering to compare fees. Most analysts consider Bitcoin to still be a high-risk, high-reward investment, so if you choose to invest in Bitcoins, be sure to give it the proper risk assessment in your portfolio.\n\nRelated stories:', 'How seriously should you take a company with a marmot named Doug for a mascot?\n\nThat has been the subject of debate surrounding Eris Industries and its blockchain solutions platform for some time. Founded in 2014, Eris has evolved to become one of the more novel projects in the blockchain space in terms of its operating thesis, officially launching in December with a goal toward a ""1.0 release"" this summer.\n\nIn its short history, Eris has made a point to trumpeting its belief that bitcoin should be thought of as a shared software database, not as a network for sending money or value. In the process, it has successfully highlighted the evolving debate regarding how the technology and its capabilities should be conceptualized and articulated to the public.\n\nA focal point of Eris\' view is that the same strong data management provided by the blockchain can be brought to ""virtually any other business process"".\n\nOf note is the somewhat antagonistic nature with which Eris has sought to stress its belief that blockchains can exist without bitcoin, meaning they don\'t need assets like bitcoin that are tradeable and that have a floating market value. This view has naturally clashed with proponents of bitcoin who are financially incentivized to see its tokens, worth nearly $300 at press time, used more widely.\n\nGiven the hesitation by major banks toward the perceived regulatory risks of cryptocurrency, Eris has found a growing audience, and according to its claims, a number of business partners willing to use its blockchain tools.\n\nStill, Eris COO Preston Byrne argues that this early customer base doesn\'t define the project and its goals.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The biggest misconception is that we want to build stuff for banks. We\'re about providing developer tools for anyone and everyone to do whatever they want without our knowledge or consent. We\'re an open-source company.""\n\nIn candid conversation following Byrne\'s address at American Banker\'s Digital Currencies + the Blockchain conference Tuesday, Byrne is more effusive in his praise for bitcoin as a technology. During the conference, he gave a somewhat breathless overview of blockchains and the Eris view on their utility, issuing comments that clashed with those put forth by more long-standing industry advocates.\n\n""We had to differentiate ourselves, but to be honest with you, the public blockchain is an essential component of the private blockchain infrastructure,"" Byrne stated. ""Bitcoin is the world\'s best, most resilient data source.""\n\nUnorthodox origins\n\nIf Eris\' concept seems unique, its origins are just as unusual. The project was originally produced after a $100,000 bounty was issued by entrepreneur Olivier Janssens on Reddit.\n\nThough Eris won the contest by creating a way to decentralize the industry\'s leading trade organization, the Bitcoin Foundation, it eventually abandoned its focus on governance.\n\nAccording to Byrne, the big break from the original idea occurred when Eris began exploring smart contracts, agreements between parties that can be executed in code on a blockchain. To date, the most significant advancements in this technology have come from the Ethereum project, though Mirror has touted an unreleased smart contract system for the bitcoin network.\n\nThe end result, he said, is that Eris wants to frame blockchain technology in the context of Internet architecture.\n\n""If you look at bitcoin as a cash system, it disintermediates the IP of a financial institution. We\'re trying to make it possible to disintermediate servers on other types of computer networks where you need that consistency,"" he said.\n\nA smart contract for a loan on Eris, he said, might look like a traditional loan, but attached would be a dynamic registry of changes stored away from the blockchain so it could be altered more dynamically.\n\n""With a blockchain, the problem is you can\'t go back and erase something and block something out. The only way you can do that is making sure that the blockchain has a directory in it and if you refer to it at any time,"" he continued.\n\nUnderstanding Eris\n\nByrne\'s view is that Eris is an attempt to turn an entire blockchain into a series of smart contracts, thereby allowing a forward momentum of data collection, history and management, but with the ability to change entries on the chain with more creativity.\n\nThe company prefers to think of blockchains as ""distributed rulebooks"" that can track changes and write permissions using private keys to achieve more secure data management. Eris\' goal is to create software that enables developers to control who can broadcast transactions, which actions can be performed and how data is referenced on a blockchain.\n\nFurther, it seeks to enable blockchain structures to have more expansive coding for communication, ultimately using the collection of data into blocks as a way for those involved in the database management to agree on its history.\n\nIn practice, Byrne says Eris is a set of tools that include Eris:db, a database and smart contract management system, and Eris Worker, which allows developers to build libraries of smart contracts and related applications.\n\nHowever, Byrne indicated that he can\'t ""go into specifics"" about the clients Eris claims as users.\n\n""The use cases are far and varied,"" he said. ""This can range from asset trading to something like compliance functions.""\n\nBecause of its focus on non-financial applications of the blockchain, however, he said it is less involved with projects that involve asset trading, clearing and settlement.\n\nThe COO was equally opaque about Eris\' revenue model, which he characterized as ""service-based"".\n\nNetwork of blockchains\n\nIn practice, Byrne proves more moderate in his opinions than pundits such as R3CEV advisor Tim Swanson, though it\'s these critical takes on bitcoin\'s design that have helped to propel his company to the forefront of industry conversation.\n\nRather than believing that private blockchains will replace bitcoin, Byrne believes bitcoin\'s killer use case will come from serving as a trusted way to verify that activities on these private networks are occurring as their owners claim.\n\n""If you ask yourself, \'What do blockchains do that nothing else does?\', it\'s you have a consistent web server or SQL application with no central server. What does bitcoin do that nothing else does in the blockchain space? It\'s the most resilient to destruction and attack,"" he said.\n\nThese properties, Byrne said, would make a public blockchain like the bitcoin network an inexpensive way for companies to show proof their records have not been tampered with. As for what prompts users of private blockchains to use a public blockchain for this purpose, Byrne also has a clear thesis as well.\n\n""If you combine a private blockchain with a public ledger verification mechanism, what you have is a very inexpensive way to create a data infrastructure without really doing a whole lot of scaling in a classical sense,"" he said, adding:\n\n""It\'ll be smaller organizations that really benefit from this the most, financial startups have a burden to preserve their data and preserve your data and then on-demand by a regulator produce evidence that that data is correct.""\n\nFocus on applications\n\nByrne also discussed the work currently being done by Blockstream, which is broadly seeking to improve the bitcoin protocol through efforts such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, the later of which seeks to allow users to create alternative blockchains which are then interoperable with the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe COO suggested that he believes such projects, while well-funded, are perhaps misguided in their allocation of resources. As a competing system to cash payments, Byrne asserted, bitcoin needs more reasons for mainstream users to fulfill its original value proposition.\n\nHe spoke out against the idea that everything on a blockchain needs to be tied to a token with independent value, a development he called impractical. That\'s not to say he doesn\'t see the need for systems that can creatively govern these types of assets.\n\n""If you want a currency to be used you have to have an infrastructure in which it makes sense to use it,"" he continued, suggesting that projects like a distributed Reddit, YouTube or Spotify would prove the most valuable in onboarding new users.\n\nHe believes that it is this application layer where the network can excel, as opposed to instances where data structures are less reliant on value, such as in corporate environments.\n\nByrne concluded:\n\n""If bitcoin is an internet currency, that\'s great, but it doesn\'t make sense until you can have services rely on bitcoin to work and there are people saying, \'Give me this currency, I\'ll give you a service. There are not enough peer-to-peer applications.""\n\nImage via Sid Kalla for BTCGeek.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Il est suspecté d'avoir créé artificiellement de la monnaie. 60% des échanges de bitcoins passaient par cette Bourse. Sa chute en a fortement terni l'image.\n\nLe roi du bitcoin bientôt derrière les barreaux? Mark Karpelès, fondateur de la société MtGox, principale Bourse d'échange du bitcoin jusqu'à son dépôt de bilan en février dernier, a été arrêté samedi au Japon, a annoncé la police nippone. Celle-ci dit l'accuser d'avoir falsifié des données informatiques en 2013, de façon à créer artificiellement près d'un million d'euros de monnaie virtuelle.\n\nUn peu plus tôt, des médias japonais cités par l'AFP affirmaient que le Français était également accusé d'avoir joué un rôle dans la disparition en 2014 de 850.000 bitcoins, pour une valeur de 355 millions d'euros. Mark Karpelès a toujours affirmé que sa société avait été victime d'une attaque informatique ayant abouti au vol de ces bitcoins et à la faillite de sa société, basée au Japon. Mais selon la chaîne de télévision NHK, la police le soupçonne au contraire de connaître les circonstances de la disparition de cet argent, qui aurait été transféré sur un compte contrôlé par lui. Le quotidien Yomiuri Shimbun évoque même plusieurs transferts de bitcoins appartenant à des clients de MtGox sur le compte de Mark Karpelès. Samedi, celui-ci a nié en bloc ces accusations.\n\nOpacité\n\nLa faillite de MtGox avait porté un rude coup à la crédibilité du Bitcoin. Au plus fort de son activité, MtGox assurait près de 80% des transactions de cette monnaie virtuelle, créée en 2009 par un ou plusieurs informaticiens anti-étatiste(s) sous le pseudonyme à consonnance japonaise Satoshi Nakamoto. L'intérêt du bitcoin est en effet de n'être émis par aucune banque centrale et de ne dépendre d'aucun Etat, mais seulement de l'évolution de l'offre et de la demande. Le vol de bitcoins rendu public par MtGox, suivi en janvier dernier par l'attaque d'une autre plateforme d'échange, Bitstamp, pour un péjudice de 5 millions de dollars, a contribué à saper la confiance des investisseurs. Le bitcoin cote aujourd'hui 282 dollars pour un bitcoin, contre près de 1000 avant la faillite de MtGox.\n\nA ces craintes concernant la sécurité et la volatilité de cette monnaie virtuelle s'ajoutent celles des autorités, qui l'accusent de faciliter les transactions illégales. Anonyme, le paiement par bitcoin est en effet attractif pour les criminels. Le site internet Silk Road, aujourd'hui fermé, l'utilisait par exemple comme monnaie d'échange en contrepartie de drogues, de kits de piratage ou encore de faux papiers. Une opacité qui pousse les Etats à tenter d'imposer un cadre légal à l'usage du bitcoin. En France, Michel Sapin s'est prononcé l'année dernière pour l'imposition de vérifications d'identité, de plafonds de dépenses ou encore de la prise en compte des bitcoins dans l'imposition des revenus. L'Autorité bancaire européenne a de son côté demandé aux banques de ne pas développer d'applications en bitcoins tant que la monnaie ne sera pas régulée."", ""Bitcoin: bancarotta per Mt. Gox. Il ceo chiede scusa\n\n- È accusato di essere il responsabile della scomparsa di centinaia di milioni di dollari di moneta virtuale: per questo la polizia giapponese ha arrestato Mark Karpeles, l'amministratore delegato di MtGox. La società, prima di dichiarare bancarotta lo scorso febbraio, rappresentava la principale piattaforma di compravendita di bitcoin al mondo.Karpeles, 30 anni, di origine francese, è accusato di aver causato una perdita di valore dei Bitcoin di 387 milioni di dollari lo scorso febbraio . Secondo gli investigatori, il dirigente avrebbe avuto l'accesso non autorizzato per ben due volte alla piattaforma a febbraio 2013 al fine di aumentare il saldo del suo conto in dollari per un totale di 1 milione. La polizia, secondo i media nipponici, continua a indagare per verificare se il cittadino di origine francese abbia illecitamente gonfiato il suo conto di bitcoin.Solo Karpeles, che però ha respinto le accuse, aveva accesso al server o al database di Mt.Gox, secondo la polizia. Inoltre, dagli accertamenti sarebbe emerso che almeno 2,8 miliardi di yen (22,6 milioni di sollari) in contanti, depositati dai clienti su Mt.Gox, sarebbero andati dispersi al punto che gli inquirenti starebbero ipotizzando l'ipotesi della formulazione di una nuova accusa per appropriazione indebita."", 'Der ehemalige Chef der insolventen Bitcoin -Börse Mt.

Or as CEO Leanne Kemp describes it, ""putting bling on the blockchain"".\n\nAccording to a 2012 study from the Association of British Insurers, around 65% of fraudulent claims go undetected, at an expense of £2bn to insurance companies annually.\n\nDiamonds play a key part in this, Kemp said:\n\n""Insurers will meet at a conference once a year and say \'By the way, did you see our diamond fraud has gone through the roof this year?\' and they\'re like \'Hey, so has ours actually – we\'ve paid out heaps!\'.""\n\nUntil now, however, there hasn\'t been a surefire way to detect if a diamond has been stolen. Like other luxury goods, proof of ownership remains locked in paper, which is vulnerable to tampering and loss.\n\nBut, what if diamonds could be digitised? Well, Everledger, led by self-described ""super nerd"" Kemp, is doing just this, with a tamper-proof digital ledger of the world\'s most valuable stones.\n\nThe idea for the company, she said, was sketched on the back of a beer mat just a few weeks prior to Everledger’s three-month stint at the Barclays Accelerator in London, which it finished in June.\n\n""It was painfully obvious to me that the blockchain could be used to track objects, and of course one of the largest pain points that runs through the supply chain is provenance,"" Kemp added.\n\nFor it to work effectively, Everledger needs to scale. To do this the company has partnered with different institutions across the diamond pipeline, including insurers, law enforcement and the 10 diamond certification houses across the world.\n\nThrough Everledger\'s API, each of these parties can access and supply data around the status of a stone, including police reports and insurance claims. When a diamond is recovered, this can be a way to help investigators track who owned it and where to return it.\n\nAll that glitters\n\nCurrently, there are just under one million diamonds being uploaded onto the platform by Everledger\'s team, and Kemp expects this to rise significantly.\n\nThese aren\'t your average jewels either: ""We\'re interested in those diamonds that get cut and look pretty and end up on a princess\'s little finger for her wedding day,"" Kemp explained.\n\nBefore a stone like this can be digitised, pricey or not, it needs a unique identifier – a fingerprint – that allows it to be tracked on Everledger’s platform as it changes hands.\n\nThis is calculated from 40 data points related to each stone – alongside the Four C\'s. Any diamond over 0.16 carats will also have a serial number inscribed on its girdle during the grading process.\n\nWhile a criminal could reshape a stone to distort its \'digital fingerprint\', Kemp explained that diamonds are not, in fact, the sum of their parts. The cutting process results in a lot of wastage, so any attempt to alter a diamond, or split it into two, will drastically reduce its value.\n\nBoots on the ground\n\nBecause there hasn\'t been a registry of diamonds before, currently the risks aren\'t necessarily high for criminals. No one knows where your stone came from and if you do sell it, no one in the world could really tell you with any certainty that it was stolen.\n\nAdditionally, diamonds accrue value over time. So if you\'re playing the long game, there\'s no hurry to get rid of your loot, because it can function as a tidy little nest egg.\n\nAlthough £200m has been pledged from Lloyd\'s and dedicated police units now tackling the issue, the CEO said having more boots on the ground just isn\'t enough.\n\n""We\'re in a digitised world so the real solution is a globalised ledger that enables complete visibility ... for multiple insurers, police and multiple stakeholders to see and understand what is transacted around that object.""\n\nKemp is hoping that Everledger, ""literally a stolen registry of diamonds"" will lead to a reduction in crime by catching offenders and dissuading other criminals from taking these kinds of risks.\n\n""We would sit side by side with them [law enforcement] in assisting with better data, better visibility, better background which then would lead to better prosecutions,"" she said.\n\nAdditionally, retailers like eBay and Amazon would be able to vet the inventory of sellers on their platforms. The ultimate prize would be for consumers to check these items themselves at the point of purchase, similar to the system in place for motor vehicles in the UK, which has a database maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\n\nKemp says a lot of these resolution points have been solved in other categories, often on the cloud. But there has been a clear imperative for the government to do so, often for public health, in the instances of car accidents.\n\n""A lot of things come to market and say \'Hey, here\'s blockchain, here\'s a solution - oh and by the way we don\'t know where the problem is but here\'s a solution, let\'s look for a problem,"" she said, adding:\n\n""Unfortunately, as much as everyone gets excited about blockchain, it\'s actually being led by an industry need and blockchain happens to be a solution, rather than the other way around.""\n\nBusiness to business\n\nKemp emphasises that Everledger is not a consumer product, but rather a business-to-business service that bills out on access to its data.\n\nThe platform is partially public – all diamond certificates can be cross-referenced on bitcoin’s blockchain – and partially private, with sensitive data such as police reports and policy information kept on the company\'s Eris-run platform.\n\n""It would be a suicide attempt for us to put that information on the public blockchain today because there is a whole bunch of legal things around how do we deal with the privacy of data.""\n\nThe firm intends to migrate to smart contract platform Ethereum in the future, once it\'s more stable.\n\nOld diamonds, new markets\n\nFurther down the line, if the platform really takes off, Kemp foresees a whole new kind of market – vintage diamonds.\n\nBeyond fraud, knowing the life history of a stone – its age, its lineage – could be a very valuable thing.\n\n""There\'s nothing that sits in the market today that say actually the diamond that\'s on your finger, that you bought from a retailer, was actually mined in 1903.""\n\nThis potential value-add is something we\'re already seeing in play. Certified diamonds that are laser inscribed, a relatively new practice, will command around a 30% higher market value than those that are uncertified.\n\nBeyond stones, the company is also ""aggressively pursuing"" other opportunities in the luxury goods space. Many valuables, from handbags to boats, are now equipped with RFID tags - a technology Kemp has a long history with.\n\n""Luxury goods is a big spend, and there are a lot of items, a lot of money and cross-border as well - that\'s where the blockchain comes in, the ability for it to be a global ledger.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

08/02/2015,"['Bitcoin trading is the hottest game in China.\n\nThe digital currency has been embraced by Chinese users who like to take a gamble: It\'s all ""about trading, about volatility, about making a profit -- buy low, sell high,"" said Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCChina, the world\'s largest Bitcoin exchange.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions can be made without any middle men (read: no banks!), and there\'s no need to give your real name. People can buy bitcoins with real money, purchase things with bitcoins and even trade them on exchanges, much like trading a company\'s stock.\n\nIt\'s caught on fast in China, which boasts the world\'s highest penetration of smartphones. Roughly 80% of Bitcoin volume is exchanged into and out of Chinese yuan, according to a report by Goldman Sachs.\n\nLee sees the digital currency\'s boom as part of a broader explosion of gambling in Asia, much of it driven by the Chinese. Macau\'s casino industry, for example, is seven times larger than that of Las Vegas.\n\n""China will continue to have the world\'s largest share of Bitcoin trading,"" Lee said. ""Why is Macau the world\'s largest gambling market? It\'s not because Macau has the most casinos ... it\'s because Chinese are so interested in gambling!""\n\nRelated: What is bitcoin?\n\nStill, the road to Bitcoin adoption in China hasn\'t come without bumps -- laws and regulations are still catching up.\n\nIn late 2013, BTCChina was forced to stop accepting new deposits of real currency in exchange for bitcoins for several weeks, after the central government prohibited banks from dealing in the digital currency.\n\nIt wasn\'t the first time Beijing acted to curb alternative currencies. The central bank also took a dim view of the QQ coin, a popular virtual currency created by Chinese tech company Tencent. The government restricted its use to virtual products in 2009.\n\nRelated: Nasdaq will start using Bitcoin technology\n\nThe move prompted many Chinese merchants to stop accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, according to Goldman.\n\nPlus, Bitcoin isn\'t subject to capital controls in China, and transactions are anonymous, increasing concerns that it can be used to finance crime organizations, help them launder money and shift large sums across borders.\n\nBItcoin also got some bad publicity when Mt. Gox, an exchange in Japan, was shut down last year. Its founder was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of falsifying data.\n\nBut Bitcoin ""is real, it\'s simple, and it\'s here to stay -- crypto-currencies are here to stay,"" Lee said.', 'According to official statements, Hong Kong-registered firm Bit Power will take full share ownership of Coin Republic’s corporate entity, Rapid Net Profit, with Moskowitz continuing on as director and growing the Singapore market.\n\nAsked about this development, Moskowitz responded: “I’m thrilled to be working along with Gabriel at meXBT. In addition to adding liquidity to the local market we’ll be able to offer some excellent services in the future, bitcoin and blockchain are revolutionizing areas such as remittance, payments, and trade finance. It’s awesome to be a part of fintech bringing new efficiencies to the markets.”\n\nThe acquisitions is positive development for the local ecosystem. Back in October 2014, in a statement to Coin Telegraph, Adam Draper, the founder of Boost Incubator, stated: “Worldwide adoption is necessary for Bitcoin to succeed. And I believe Singapore is the place for Bitcoin in Asia.”\n\nSingapore has often been compared with Hong Kong, as a hub for Bitcoin, digital currencies and financial technology in the Asia Pacific. In communications with Coin Telegraph, CoinHako co-founder Yusho Liu has previously noted: “Singapore has been on the radar of many Bitcoin companies here in the valley due to the positive outlook from the regulators.”\n\nThe recent success of BitX in raising capital during its Series A round has been a positive indicator for the local Bitcoin space. This is the growth of fintech firms using the Asian city-state as a gateway and launchpad into the emerging markets of the Asia Pacific region. Very often, their targets are the unbanked and under-banked segments of these economies.\n\nIn a October 2013 interview with Tech in Asia, Sammel Nigel, the Singaporean founder and principal of Find Your Bitcoin Sweden (FYB-SE) commented that a small population of Bitcoin users, conservative consumers and lack of monetary literacy would hamper Singapore’s emergence as a hub.\n\nHowever, Nigel added, “…the good thing is that there’s a lot of wealth in Singapore, with plenty of investors and businesses that stand to benefit greatly from adopting Bitcoin. Singapore has great potential, due to it being an existing financial services hub and with so many investors present here.”\n\nSingapore seems well positioned to excel and built itself in this particular niche, given recent developments and the entry of this new player using Singapore as a launchpad for Asia Pacific expansion.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nBitcoin brokerage Coin Republic to be acquired?', 'Considering the varying patchwork of today’s global regulatory landscape regarding cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s greatest ally will not be a judge but technological innovation that will enable it to be one step ahead of anti-competitive laws and unfriendly jurisdictions.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin is yearning for adoption, but that is not coming easy or fast enough for some. The majority of world’s citizenry still has no idea of the opportunities the technology can offer. While the Bitcoin ecosystem is ready to move forward and change this situation, unclear and unfriendly legal environments seem to hold it back.\n\nBut is that really the case?\n\nReading through the July 2015 published The Law of Bitcoin, a book authored by a group of 10 lawyers and academics from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany, reinforces a contrary opinion.\n\nFor instance, in a few chapters focused on Bitcoin’s place within the Canadian law, Stuart Hoegner, a lawyer and accountant and member of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, explores the possibility of drafting negotiable instruments such as promissory notes and bills of exchange and denominating them in bitcoin.\n\nHe explains this within Canada’s Bill of Exchange Act, which represents well the law on negotiable instruments in the Commonwealth and, indeed, in many western countries, a bill of exchange or a promissory note must be denominated in a legal tender currency, one that is issued by a country.\n\nThat, of course, makes a negotiable instrument denominated in bitcoin likely void. In other words, if you accepted such an instrument, and the drawee declines to honor it, the courts are not obligated to provide you with any helpful recourse.\n\n“Cryptocurrency-denominated instruments do not appear to qualify as negotiable instruments under federal legislation,” reads an excerpt from The Law of Bitcoin. “We should not be taken as saying that this is a failure of any cryptocurrency, or that bitcoin, as an example, is bound to fail, in Canada or elsewhere.”\n\nIt continues:\n\n“Although it may result in some market exclusions, cryptocurrencies may generate their own solutions and grow to become more powerful tools in international finance and trade.”\n\nHow can cryptocurrency be integrated?\n\nNow, the question is does bitcoin even need a law that recognizes it as money to play a role in such business credit arrangements?\n\nThere is no doubt that negotiable instruments have played a major role in finance and trade for many centuries. Apparently the first known existence of a bill of exchange goes back to the 8th century Arab world. Thus, it’s no surprise that a 21st century monetary system, i.e. Bitcoin, encounters a lot of friction when interacting with this old way of handling credit in trade.\n\nWith that said, it is critical to recognize that these instruments are nothing more than contracts where person A promises to pay person B or the document holder at a given date or on demand.\n\nNegotiable instruments out, smart contracts in\n\nLike all contracts, enforcement of the agreement is crucial. The person accepting a bill of exchange or a promissory note must have relative confidence that the court would come to his defense in case the instrument is not honored.\n\nThe good news is that innovations on top of blockchain technology seem to provide better tools, such as proof of information, immutability of data and self-execution, for enforcing such contracts.\n\nThis way, so called smart contract applications provide a way in which Bitcoin can become an integral part of trade and commerce. While they do not take away the role of courts, the applications give confidence to users to try the new technology in the absence of relevant laws without the fear of losing their value in the process.\n\nIndeed, it is clear that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies do not even need to be on any negotiable instruments in the traditional sense. Instead, more attention should be given to the numerous applications startups like Ethereum, Factom and Blockstream, just to name a few, are building.\n\nFor instance, Factom offers banks tools for keeping track of credit records. Through these, a bank can organize, hash, secure and store all documentation regarding mortgages and loans. These same tools are likely to work well with negotiable instruments like bills of exchange and promissory notes.\n\nInnovation or bust\n\nBitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies will continue to face suppression in finance and trade via “regulation” like New York State’s BitLicense for example, that create barriers for potentially disruptive startups and would-be competitors.\n\nTherefore, just like the internet in the 1990s, digital currency and its fledgling ecosystem will largely have to rely on innovation to grow as current laws favor legacy firms and the status quo. Having smart contracts replace negotiable instruments is a good example of how the blockchain technology will permeate into everyday use.', 'It was recently a headline that Political Action Committees had been raising funds before any candidates had announced their candidacy. It seems obvious that these groups have agendas that they’re going to push, without regard for who is running for office. Whichever candidate they can bend the most to their will, that is the candidate they’re going to support the most. That much should be obvious whenever examining the contributions to any political campaign.\n\nEven the very populist candidates like Bernie Sanders, rest assured, they have large interests such as unions behind them. In an interesting twist to everything, unions in Los Angeles are looking to be exempt from the new minimum wage requirements. They see this more as an opportunity to get their hooks into businesses because then businesses working with the unions could pay less.\n\nThese events reveal obvious motivations of a political and financial nature. The use of the Bitcoin block chain could clearly alleviate much of the confusion. While it can be pseudo-anonymous, it doesn’t necessarily have to be. All donors could be required to register their sending address. Then using a block explorer, people could easily see the contributions on the block chain. There would be no need to wonder when or how the donations started because it would all be public information from the beginning.\n\nThere are more uses for block chain technology than merely moving value around for a few hundred thousand people. The block chain can be used to stamp validity onto things, the security of such stamps being hard to tamper with. The block chain can facilitate such uses without much of a footprint on the actual blocks. Factom is demonstrating this fact by using the block chain to stamp property records in Honduras, for example. Similar technology could be used in the United States to track campaign funding, and to track the contributions to Political Action Committees. There is no reason they should be exempt from special reporting requirements, given that they influence politics on a huge scale.\n\nHowever you look at it; the Bitcoin revolution doesn’t need to stop at finance. The block chain technology brings with it many more potential applications than simply moving money around. Of course, the financial implications of Bitcoin itself are incredibly important. This cannot be understated. But at the same time, there is value in the ability to stamp records immutably, in such a way that an official cannot come along later and say that this record is not valid and that the actually own the property.\n\nApplying the same technology to other highly sensitive parts of the economy, such as the stock market, wouldn’t be a horrible idea, either. These are technological applications that the block chain is simply perfect for, which would also benefit in that corruption would have to go away by design. All movements of money would be tracked, and it would be easy to require those moving money to register their public keys.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Deutsche Bank is one of the latest banks to back blockchain technology. The Frankfurt, Germany based bank has responded positively to the European Securities and Market Authority’s (ESMA) call for evidence on investments using virtual currency and blockchain technology. ESMA had called upon all the stakeholders to express their views, experiences and any information on utilization of digital currency and the technology behind it for trading and recording ownership of securities.\n\nDeutsche Bank’s response to the Call for Evidence issued by ESMA was published with other responses on 30th of last month. Deutsche Bank’s response, signed by the global head of regulatory policy — Daniel Trinder states the important benefits of using bitcoin or related systems in today’ banking environment. Some of the benefits mentioned in the report includes stability and reliability of the system, faster transaction processing and low customer costs. Apart from that, by using blockchain technology in their regular operations banks can have a more efficient, inexpensive and secure platform for meeting regulatory and maintenance requirement.\n\nFurther down the report, Deutsche Bank plays the devil’s advocate by mentioning the potential risks involved. Daniel mentions that blockchain technology may come with few potential risks and it is better to understand those risks and fix them well in advance.\n\nThe German bank’s response to ESMA also contains information about its new innovation labs which was launched recently as part of Deutsche Bank’s Strategy 2020 initiative.

Even if the government ordered someone to shut down Bitcoin for a site like Backpage, they’d be unable to do it. So long as the people at Backpage could create a wallet, they could receive money. This is by design, considered a feature, not a bug. Whereas with many of the legacy systems, it’s pretty basic to shut off an account. Banks and others wield this power for legal and other justifications, but in the end, the movement of money should only be up to its owners. There shouldn’t be other parties in between. This is the very premise of Bitcoin, which is why the situation with Backpage strikes to the heart of the Bitcoin movement.\n\nRoux writes in her blog:\n\nThis is obviously an awful situation; many sex workers rely heavily on Backpage for their business. While it would be wonderful to have a magic wand and fix this problem, bitcoin is one of the few payment methods still accepted by Backpage and I want to make sure those who need it can use it. Bitcoins may seem scary. It’s a new technology, with lots of technical jargon surrounding explanations of how to use it. The good news is, bitcoin has gotten a lot easier over the past couple of years and it’s not too difficult to learn how to accept and send payments.\n\nCoinbase Could Face Same Pressure\n\nFor some reason, Roux goes on to recommend Coinbase. The next story may very well be that Coinbase gives in to the same pressure from law enforcement that drove MasterCard and Visa to shut off Backpage’s accounts. Certainly, it would be wiser for the people in this industry to get their coins directly from an exchange or through LocalBitcoins.\n\nAlso read: Paypal Shuts Down in Greece – Bitcoin Still Operates\n\nMethods like these would involve less regulated entities that are less likely to cancel the deal based on the end point of the coins. Coinbase is well-known to monitor the activities of the wallets that it provides, and it may well shut down accounts that process transactions to Backpage, just as its cousins in the traditional financial industry have.\n\nRoux touches on this concern, writing:\n\nIf you’re a privacy freak like me or would like to learn more about other options for using bitcoin, Bitcoin.org is a great place to start. I personally use Bitcoin Wallet, but I recommend Coinbase as a more user friendly solution for starting out.\n\nShe also recommends that escorts could potentially bill their customers in bitcoins, and then not have to worry about acquiring them to pay for their advertisements. It would seem to be more optimum if people who were put in a position where Bitcoin was their only option had easy routes to go that retained control of their coins with them, and also helped them understand how it all works. A fair point might be that most people don’t know how their fiat money works, either, so there is little difference.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Liara Roux.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'Sommige beleggers blijven brood zien in de bitcoin, ondanks de voetangels en klemmen, fraude en onzekere status van de virtuele munt. De Amerikaanse Cameron en Tyler Winklevoss hebben een vergunning aangevraagd voor het voeren van een trust waarin particulieren en institutionele beleggers kunnen handelen in bitcoins. De Winklevoss-tweeling werd internationaal vermaard toen ze in 2004 de oprichter van Facebook voor de rechter sleepten. Mark Zuckerberg zou het idee voor het sociale netwerk van hen hebben gestolen. Een rechtszaak resulteerde vier jaar later in een schikking van 65 miljoen dollar.

08/03/2015,"['This weekend, Mt. Gox founder Mark Karpeles was arrested in Tokyo, bringing years of confusion and paranoia to an end. Starting in 2010, Karpeles ran the largest and most powerful bitcoin exchange, but the site went offline in February 2014 after it was discovered that $400 million in bitcoin had gone missing from the company\'s accounts. The official explanation was an obscure ""transaction malleability"" bug, exploited expertly over the course of years, but insiders have long suspected something more sinister was at work, and this weekend\'s arrests only lend credence to their suspicions.\n\nAs Karpeles heads to jail, his former employees are speaking up. In a blistering AMA Friday night, former CEO Ashley Barr laid into Karpeles, detailing just how ugly the site was behind the scenes, including evidence of price manipulation, bizarre coding missteps, and outright embezzlement. In one particularly alarming detail, there seems to have been no separation between Gox\'s deposits and Karpeles\' personal account. According to Barr, when you sent a deposit to MtGox, the money ended up in Karpeles\' personal bitcoin wallet. It\'s worth reading through in its entirety, but the upshot is that Gox was designed with criminal negligence and Karpeles was genuinely indifferent to the catastrophe he was causing. Even after the arrest, Barr is genuinely angry at Karpeles, saying she and the other employees ""plan to eat pizza in front of Mark while he is in prison.""\n\n""We plan to eat pizza in front of Mark while he is in prison.""\n\nIt\'s the end of one of the web\'s strangest stories, and one of Bitcoin\'s most powerful origin myths. Account-holders lost a lot of money when Gox shut down, and this is the first explanation they\'re getting of where that money really went. The answer, for the most part, appears to be Karpeles\' pocket. But Mt. Gox\'s failures weren\'t random. They grew out of disruption and decentralization — the same qualities that drew people to Bitcoin in the first place. Bitcoin created a financial system free of central banks, incumbent interests, and state power, removing the same checks that could have stopped Gox early. As a result, Karpeles ran wild, creating a cautionary tale for anyone with dreams of unregulated digital finance.\n\nTo state the obvious, it would be impossible for a conventional money service to fail this way. Even newcomers like Venmo are subject to intense regulation, and problems like Karpeles\' single account would have been spotted immediately. But Bitcoin meant escaping those systems, and there was nothing to replace them. Mt. Gox presented itself as a scrappy startup, which allowed for many of the warning signs to pass as simple glitches. For Bitcoin\'s early adherents, glitches were part of the experience. They were still discovering the quirks of the blockchain, and the downtime came hand-in-hand with wild price swings, which made many early adopters a lot of money. As long as you came out ahead, why complain?\n\nThe net result was silence\n\nEven when the problems were discovered, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin made it difficult to drive them home. For years before the shutdown, insiders had known Mt. Gox had serious problems, and Barr seems to have openly warned investors about problems on the horizon — but no one said anything. It’s not clear why, but airing the problems openly would have been a public embarrassment for Bitcoin. More than that, there\'s no guarantee it would have had any effect, since there were no institutions to hold Karpeles accountable. The net result was silence.\n\nThe marketplace alone couldn\'t fix Mt. Gox. There weren\'t the institutions for it, or a healthy enough sense of transparency. Consumers didn\'t know what to look for, and the people who knew didn\'t sound the alarm bells. In the end, Gox\'s customers didn\'t know how badly they\'d been taken until state power intervened.\n\nIf you\'re one of Bitcoin\'s true believers, you might see all this as good riddance, the end of Bitcoin\'s early growing pains. We know the problems now, and we can learn from them. We can demand better accounting and find sturdier institutions to put our trust in. There will be less outright robbery this time around, fewer drug markets. Players like Coinbase and Barry Silbert are already charting this course, headed toward a more controlled version of Bitcoin that will be safe enough for public consumption. By now, feds have learned how to track criminals through the blockchain, so you won\'t have to worry about any Silk Roads distorting the marketplace. Financial groups are already figuring out how to bring the Bitcoin protocol in line with anti-money-laundering laws, squeezing out the last drops of anonymity.\n\nKarpeles was the perfect representation of what Bitcoin meant\n\nWithout the chaos, Bitcoin feels a lot less fun. Suddenly you can\'t get rich off price swings, can\'t buy drugs, and can\'t use your graphics card to destabilize global finance. In exchange, you get cheap digital transfers and Overstock.com. It\'s easy to see why VCs still like the system — they\'re disrupting finance, carving out a piece of a trillion-dollar industry — but why do the rest of us care? There\'s no guarantee the grown-up version of Bitcoin will generate the same excitement it did when it was younger, wilder, and less competent. It\'s just regular money now, only a little bit faster and a little bit easier to steal.\n\nIf you aren\'t a true believer, then you might think we\'ve already seen Bitcoin\'s peak. In that case, Karpeles starts to look like one of the most important players in the whole drama, the perfect representation of what Bitcoin meant for those years while the world still cared about it. There was no point of principle here, as with Ulbricht\'s anti-drug war crusade. This was pure naïveté, leveraging marginal coding skills into a position at the vanguard of a growing movement, then using sleight of hand to keep the charade alive as long as possible. It fit the Bitcoin dream perfectly, rewarding good timing and libertarian principles with unimaginable wealth. Of course, the dream ended up costing Gox’s customers a lot of money, but that only makes it more important. Anyone can lose a few million on today\'s web, but losing 400 million takes vision.', 'Updated: Tuesday, August 4 at 6:00 p.m. AEST with the release of the government report, ""Digital currency—game changer or bit player.""\n\nIn a positive sign for financial technology startups, a government inquiry has set the stage for the digital currency Bitcoin to be treated like regular money in Australia.\n\nA Senate Economics References Committee review considering digital currencies in Australia has recommended they should be treated like any other currency for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).\n\nThe result is contrary to the position of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which ruled in 2014 that Bitcoin was a commodity, ""neither money nor a foreign currency,"" and was liable for the GST, as well as other taxes.\n\nThe ATO\'s guidance was met with dismay by Australia\'s nascent Bitcoin business community last year, with many startups warning they would have to move overseas to avoid the debilitating financial penalty.\n\nIn the report, the committee concluded that the ATO had placed ""an additional burden on Australian digital currency businesses.""\n\nLabor Senator Sam Dastyari, who chaired the committee, told the Australian Financial Review he hoped the finding would help keep digital innovators at home in Australia.\n\n""Without a doubt, the main benefit will be the confidence and certainty that removing a GST will provide to our own digital entrepreneurs, and the foreign businesses who want to set up here,"" he said. ""Most importantly, it will send the message to local tech entrepreneurs that their government is listening to them, and that in itself is a major step forward.""\n\nThe committee received submissions from 48 groups and individuals, including Ripple Labs, an online payment transfer company that is currently working with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. In its submission, the company said the lack of global uniformity in the regulation of digital currencies is creating serious uncertainty for the fintech industry.\n\n""Harmonizing a global standard for digital currencies could provide clarity and an even playing field for technologists and companies that innovate using digital currencies,"" the company wrote.\n\nChris Mountford, a developer at Atlassian, who also made a submission to the committee, told Mashable Australia the report was a positive step forward. ""The current position taken by the ATO is not working for anybody,"" he said.\n\n""Sam Dastyari is recognising the growth potential of innovative technology, and I take it as a sane step towards the only sensible interpretation of the GST legislation,"" he added. ""[The ATO\'s ruling] was going to be a barrier for startups, not for Bitcoin. Bitcoin was going to succeed despite Australia.""\n\nWhile it acknowledged the opportunities of digital currencies, the senate committee has flagged that more work needs to be done before Bitcoin can be properly handled by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and regulators, among other recommendations. It remains to be seen whether there is political appetite on the state and federal level to make the change.\n\nThe report is a step towards bringing Australia in line with the UK in the regulation of digital currencies. In 2014, the UK indicated it would treat Bitcoin similarly to other currencies and money. In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has ruled for tax purposes, Bitcoin is property and not a currency.\n\nThe ATO has been contacted for comment.', ""When Benjamin Lawsky announced in May that he would step down as New York State’s chief of digital-currency regulation to go into private practice, some people in the bitcoin world rejoiced. Others cried foul.\n\nOverseeing the regulation of digital-currency businesses was just one part of Lawsky’s job as the first superintendent of the state’s Department of Financial Services, created in 2011. But that task became, in the past year, the bulk of the story for Lawsky as he proposed, revised, and finally introduced the first state regulatory policy on digital-currency companies deemed “money-transmitters.” He called it the BitLicense.\n\nThe final product did not go over well. Many bitcoin policy pundits and bitcoin startup executives took issue with what they felt was an overreaching set of requirements to get the necessary license. Companies reacted in different ways: Coinbase launched a bitcoin exchange in January that had investment from the New York Stock Exchange, but it is not licensed under BitLicense; Gemini, a forthcoming bitcoin exchange from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has not yet launched because, as the brothers have said, they are waiting until they obtain a license; ShapeShift.io, a site for converting bitcoin to other currencies, shut down service in New York in protest to BitLicense.\n\nAt the end of June, with the controversial set of rules as his most recent legacy, Lawsky left office. (His chief of staff Anthony Albanese will serve as acting superintendent for the time being.) The New York Times reported that Lawsky planned to lecture at Stanford University and open his own firm in New York: “He will provide compliance and risk management advice to a range of companies grappling with data breaches and other technological challenges. His clients are likely to include technology companies.”\n\nThat sounded, to some, as though Lawsky was planning to leave office, then turn around and consult with startups (likely for big fees) on how to navigate the very rules that he created.\n\nHe registered The Lawsky Group in Delaware on June 17, the day after he left office. Bitcoin.com promptly published a passionate piece called “Ben Lawsky’s revolving door” in which it argued, “Lawsky is adding insult to injury by injecting a layer of cronyism into an already depressing regulatory landscape in New York… Lawsky is offering advice on how to deal with the burden that he created. The moral implications of such an action are undoubtedly questionable… Lawsky is making Bitcoin businesses worse off for his own personal gain… With this new consulting firm, the possibility of a cronyist and elitist Bitcoin economy in New York is much more likely to come to fruition.” Others had their say on Twitter:\n\nHold on… did Ben Lawsky just use the Bitlicense to tee up his own private practice? We're just asking… http://t.co/EG8mVCOxYT — mintcombine (@mintcombine) June 3, 2015\n\nWhy would the goings-on at the NYDFS matter to those in the business world? Well, if you believe bitcoin entrepreneurs and enthusiasts who insist that their companies have the potential to change banking (and other industries) forever, then the next NYDFS superintendent has a tall task: play watchdog to these startups without limiting their ability to innovate.\n\nLast week, the man who the Times called the “Sheriff of Wall Street” and others called a “bitcoin cop” (Lawsky told Bloomberg last year of his intent to “police Bitcoin”) at last responded to the accusations.\n\nAt American Banker‘s digital currencies conference in New York, the magazine’s editor Marc Hochstein asked Lawsky about whether his new firm represented a potential conflict of interest. “What would you say to someone,” Hochstein asked, “who would think that maybe you built yourself a revolving door?”\n\n“I can’t work on anything, for life, I ever worked on [at the NYDFS],” he said, as quoted by Reuters and Coindesk. “I’m doing no work in the virtual currency space,” he added. But the killer sound bite, for those in the bitcoin world, was this:\n\n“If anyone said, ‘I want to hire you to help me get a BitLicense… no can do.”\n\nThe statement will not do much to quell critics. On its web site, the Lawsky Group says it “provides in-depth counsel and strategic advice on financial services regulation, cybersecurity and cyber-risk, new financial technologies, compliance, consumer protection, privacy, anti-money laundering controls, crisis management, and investigations in the banking, insurance and other related industries.” Some in the bitcoin community may feel that any work with digital-currency clients at all is a conflict of interest. But for now, Lawsky has at least made it clear he cannot, and will not, work with companies on BitLicense.\n\n@ChamberDigital @DCCCertified Oh sure he will sell organic vegetables and truck tyres! Come On!! — Antoine FERRON (@a_ferron) August 3, 2015\n\nFor those in the bitcoin world fearing regulation, the focus will soon shift to the next Benjamin Lawsky, whether that be current acting superintendent Albanese or some other authority.

Spoiler alert: key data returned evidence of a distinct correlation between computer programmers and Bitcoin, and illegal activity and Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue to the fact Bitcoin users are protected by the anonymity of the currency, the study authors from the University of Kentucky used Google Trends data to examine the reasons for interest in Bitcoin. While they recognise this search data alone cannot be used as a definitive method of defining participation, they can use it to build on existing research and anecdotal evidence and create profiles for the types of people most likely to use Bitcoin.\n\nPrevious research has pointed to the three key reasons people might be using Bitcoin: curiosity, profit making and politics. Based on these observations, the researchers created four potential user groups for the cryptocurrency: tech enthusiasts, investors, anti-establishment types, who might want an alternative to mainstream banking, and criminals.\n\nThe study was conducted over a 31-month period, and analysed various search terms related to Bitcoin. The authors recognised that the sensitive nature of some Bitcoin activity could make the data difficult to analyse, but ultimately drew the conclusion that it was unlikely that Google data would undergo major social censoring. Similarly, they note that in the past there has been a strong positive correlation between Bitcoin-related Google searches and exchange prices, suggesting that interest in Bitcoin on Google was a good reflection of people actually involved in using it, or at least following its progress carefully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSearch terms included all those listed under Bitcoin as a currency -- including variations such as \'Bitcoins\', \'Bitcoin Mining\', \'Bit Coin\', \'Bitcoin exchange\', \'Bitcoin price\' and \'Bitcoin value\' -- and were combined with those that were related to computer science as a discipline. The researchers also looked at results that contained terms \'Silk Road\', \'Free Market\', and \'Make Money\', in order to gauge interest in Bitcoin in relation to criminal activity, a libertarian political stance and speculative investors.\n\nNo correlations could be found linking Bitcoin to either those seeking liberty from central banks or investors interested in making money from the currency. Instead it was primarily computer programmers and criminals whose interests most closely correlated with the Google Trends search data. ""Although many commentators have speculated about motives for using Bitcoin, our study is the first to systematically analyse Bitcoin interest, including the interest of hard-to-observe clientele,"" write the authors. ""We find robust evidence that computer programming enthusiasts and illegal activity drive interest in Bitcoin and find limited or no support for political and investment motives.""', 'A bitcoin trader in Scotland has had thousands of pounds returned to him after they were seized by police during a money laundering investigation in May.\n\nAccording to Herald Scotland, Max Flores\' money was returned to him last month, following his solicitor\'s appeal.\n\nThe trader – who is unsure as to whether the seizure will have a negative effect on his credit rating – estimates he lost approximately £1,200 of his original £5,500 in legal fees.\n\nLaura Irvine, an associate at bto solicitors, told the Herald that her customers’ money had been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which enables police to seize funds if they have ""reasonable grounds"" for suspecting that they are proceeds of crime.\n\nIrvine explained:\n\n""The legislation tends to be used typically for drug dealers who there is maybe not enough evidence to convict them of any criminal offence, but there is plenty of intelligence in the background which suggests that is what they are up to ... However when you look at the circumstances of Flores case it may be a slightly less justified approach.""\n\nFlores was notified that his funds had been seized during a visit to his bank to make a withdrawal in May this year.\n\n""I was stopped by the police when I left the bank – they said you are not under arrest, but we are taking your money.

Authorities have closed down one of these Dark Web havens, and have confiscated thousands of bitcoin wallets in association with its use.\n\nIs this Silk Road 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0?\n\nUnder code name “Operation Babylon”, Italian officials have shut down the site that hosted over 14,000 members, performing over 170,000 transactions using Tor’s web browser. The illegal activity said to have taken place ranged from child pornography to drug and arms sales, to credit card code and hacking kits. Over 200 drug dealers are claimed to have used the site for trafficking purposes, but this may be only one site of its kind out many.\n\nThe website is said to have been masterminded by an Italian near Naples. Bitcoin use seems to have been prevalent, with over 11,000 digital wallets connected to the site seized, containing over million euros worth of the digital currency. Michele Prestipino, the prosecutor who led the investigation, told a press conference in Rome:\n\n“The virtual world of the Dark Web has its own hierarchies and severe rules on access and affiliation. Getting into such a closed community was extremely difficult.”\n\nA police crackdown on child pornography led them to the site on the Dark Web, which is not available through conventional Internet searches. Gaining enough access and evidence has taken undercover authorities two years to procure. This also has brought cooperation from Europol and the FBI to help find the identities of those involved with these illegal transactions.\n\n“(There is an) incredible criminal world, parallel to The Internet, which paradoxically represents only a small part of the communications taking place over the Web,” Prestipino said. “For us this investigation is just a point of departure.”\n\nDark Web sites like Silk Road have not gone away with the closure of the site but have only revealed many variants that may be even bigger within the Internet’s underbelly. Silk Road was the largest known site of its kind in 2013, but that seems to have been just the tip of the iceberg. According to the latest information, many sites, some even larger than Silk Road, have more than filled the market gap left by Silk Road in the web’s growing underworld black market trade. Black market Dark Web sites, statistically, have become more numerous than ever before, and this is just what is known on the Internet’s surface.', ""Enlarge Bitcoin users create a digital wallet, similar to what we see banks offering today to… more\n\nCreated to take out middlemen, bitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a central bank or country. Value is generated by its use in the open market, which determines the rate of exchange and return on bitcoin currency.\n\nBitcoin is created through a process call mining, and users are known as miners. These miners use special software to solve math problems and are issued a certain number of bitcoins in exchange for the right answer.\n\nEnlarge Bitcoin users create a digital wallet, similar to what we see banks offering today to… more\n\nThis system of issuing bitcoin currency creates a gaming incentive, drawing more people to mine.\n\nBitcoin users create a digital wallet, similar to what we see banks offering today to control their transactions.\n\nWill bitcoin work for businesses? There are some opportunities and drawbacks.\n\nOn the plus side\n\nUtilizing cryptographic security technology, bitcoin transactions for making and receiving payments have limited or no fees. International transactions, whether making or receiving payments, take only 10 minutes, since bitcoin currency resides in the digital world. Here are some other pros:\n\nPCI compliance is not required, as your business doesn’t carry the costs or responsibilities that come with processing sensitive information from customers, such as credit card numbers.\n\nBitcoin accounting transparency eliminates the need for businesses to produce documents about activities.\n\nBitcoin transactions are not tied to individuals making a purchase. Bitcoin uses a program called blockchain, which creates digital wallet accounts for users.\n\nBitcoin transactions become final once confirmed, eliminating the cost of fraud risk on the merchant.\n\nBitcoin has gained some legitimacy on Wall Street as Fortress Investment Group, New York Stock Exchange, Pantera and Goldman Sachs have all invested in the bitcoin network to some degree.\n\nDrawbacks to note\n\nBitcoin provides greater flexibility and provides users more control over their money. However, these features don’t come without security risks. Securing your “wallet” is vital in using the bitcoin network. Other challenges also remain:\n\nBitcoin transactions are not as anonymous as you may think. They're stored on a public and permanent network, allowing the review of any balances and transactions from any bitcoin address, while keeping the identity of the user behind the address anonymous. Bitcoin suggests changing the address for each transaction.\n\nAn individual or business remains responsible for any required income, sales, payroll and capital gains taxes on anything of value, including bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin pricing can be unpredictable. So, placing personal or business accounts such as savings, investment, or retirement fund is not recommended for use with the bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin payments are irreversible for any transaction. Refunds can only be issued by the person receiving the funds. Make sure you use this network with trustworthy businesses or individuals.\n\nUnconfirmed transactions are not secure within the initial 10-minute window of the transaction process. In fact, during this timeframe, transactions may be considered authentic, but are still reversible.\n\nSeveral U.S. government agencies cited transaction abuse by criminals for drugs, hiring hackers, assassins, money laundering, trade child pornography and dodging taxes.\n\nBitcoin remains unpredictable. Bitcoin is still an experimental digital currency that is in real-time development and carries a high asset risk to the user."", 'Bitcoin proponents have long been eyeing one of fiat currencies’ most vulnerable areas: international borders. Where one currency ends and another begins, what should be a straightforward transfer of value quickly becomes a headache—often an expensive one. Fees accrue, foreign exchange exposure looms, and regulators sniff away in the background.\n\nIf you’re a tourist or a business-type, this is irksome, but so are trans-ocean flights, phrasebooks and the rest of it. You will presumably focus on relatively accessible and accommodating countries, or relatively lucrative ones, as the case may be.\n\nBut you can’t choose where you’re born, which makes sending remittances among the most trying experiences in the whole fragmented global currency system. If you are working in Switzerland to help support your family in Sri Lanka, you’re going to send that monthly check whether you lose 9%, 14% or 18% in the process. Deciding you’d rather send it to Bolivia makes no sense, so you’re at the mercy of whoever—Western Union (WU) and Moneygram (MGI) are the usual culprits—is around to provide the service.\n\nEnter Bitcoin. Borderless and practically fee-free, it’s the perfect solution to the torturous process of sending remittances. Which, by the way, are forecasted to total $608 billion this year, according to the World Bank. So are ""rebittances"" (there’s always a portmanteau) the blue ocean they appear to be at first glance, just waiting for a cheap, painless alternative in the form of Bitcoin? The reality as it stands may disappoint the more starry-eyed optimists, but the idea certainly has potential. The crucial step to realizing that potential is to understand the challenges.\n\nFees\n\nThe first objection Bitcoin remittance proponents have to the current system is high fees. “A typical money transfer costs up to 10% fees,” AXA Strategic Ventures’ Florian Graillot wrote for TechCrunch in May, and many others have quoted the same figure. Yet that is only sort-of true.\n\nThe World Bank’s second-quarter 2015 report on global remittance prices studied the cost of sending US $200 or the local equivalent in 227 corridors, from 32 origin countries to 89 destination countries. The average cost was 7.68%, basically flat from the previous quarter’s 7.72%. The weighted average, meanwhile, was 5.92% (5.94% in the previous quarter).\n\nThe reason for this spread between the weighted and unweighted averages is that certain corridors with large volumes of remittances are cheap: in over three-quarters of the corridors studied, fees were below 10%. In 2009, the proportion was closer to half. In certain corridors, such as the US to Mexico, transfers of $200 can be accomplished with fees as low as 1.49%, and even Western Union only charges 4.60%.\n\nBut aren’t Bitcoin’s transaction fees practically zero, at a fraction of a percent? Yes, but these are the fees involved in any Bitcoin transaction, charged by the miners who validate them; the analogous fee for a fiat currency cash transaction is exactly, not practically, zero. What matters in this case is the fee a business charges in order to turn a profit, which may or may not be competitive with the incumbents.\n\nThen again, there are corridors where remitters are forced to set huge chunks of their money on fire. Sending $200 from South Africa to Malawi will cost at least the 11.27% charged by Moneygram—and up to 32.76%, courtesy of the First National Bank of South Africa. The World Bank helpfully tracks the rates different providers charge in different corridors, so you can see for yourself which markets are likely to be fed up with current providers.\n\nThe costs of remitting money vary greatly depending on the specific corridor, so sweeping assertions are not very helpful. From the World Bank’s perspective, the global average matters; from an entrepreneur’s, the focus has to start local.\n\nForex\n\nBitcoin proponents also point to the risk inherent in exchanging money, as volatile currencies threaten to compromise the value of the money being sent home. In Tajikistan, for example, where almost half of GDP depends on remittances, the fall in the ruble has been nothing short of disastrous.\n\nBut compared to Bitcoin, that volatility is nothing. The ruble might have lost half its value, but Bitcoin has lost three-quarters. Besides, there is practically no market for Bitcoins in developing countries, and very few employees in developed countries get paid in Bitcoin; this means that, far from eliminating vulnerability to foreign exchange, it adds another layer. Now you must convert British pounds to Bitcoin to Kenyan shillings, or US dollars to Bitcoin to Indian rupees—hardly an improvement as far as forex exposure goes.\n\nCan It Work?\n\nAnd yet the intrepid are trying to make it happen. Bitstake in Nigeria. Bitspark in Hong Kong. Palarin in the Philippines. BitPesa in Kenya (and now Tanzania).\n\nI’ll focus on BitPesa here, because it provides an interesting glimpse into a particular country’s remittance market, its unmet needs, and how a Bitcoin startup could establish a foothold (mind you, this is neither an endorsement nor a prediction).\n\nFirst, a note about Kenya. It is a lower middle income country in which a great number of people depend on subsistence agriculture. Infrastructure is often woefully lacking, and ethnic and religious violence is a constant threat in large areas of the country. It is not necessarily the place one would expect to find financial inclusion—defined as people over age 15 with an account of some kind—at 75%, more than double the average for sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nKenya has leapfrogged the developed world in terms of embracing mobile money. M-PESA, Swahili for m[obile]-money, was launched in 2007 by Vodafone (VOD) on behalf of Safaricom, Kenya’s leading telecom. It enables people in remote areas to transfer cash using their phones and a network of tens of thousands of agents. Today over 40% of GDP flows through the M-PESA.\n\nSo Kenyans are perfectly comfortable with digital money, of a sort. Why then, as Richard Boase can attest, are they so unenthusiastic about Bitcoin? It is important to note that M-PESA might subvert the brick-and-mortar banking system, but it is not really a currency. The value stays in—or is at least pegged to—Kenyan shillings, Tanzanian shillings, afghanis, or rupees, depending on the market.\n\nStill, BitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiellio believes that M-PESA has blazed a trail for Bitcoin in Kenya (M-PESA did briefly integrate a Bitcoin wallet called Kipochi in 2013, but that project tanked). BitPesa raised $1.1 million in second-round funding in February, has expanded to Tanzania and is eyeing other markets such as Uganda. The company charges a transaction fee of 3%, beating every incumbent in the UK-Kenya corridor, but that is only one side of the transaction, as the sender must first acquire Bitcoins.\n\nThis is where we hit the real snag with BitPesa’s model: it is, in Richard Boase’s words, “half a business.” They receive Bitcoin remittances and give the recipients Kenyan shillings. But how sustainable is that? Will BitPesa not end up with a huge stack of Bitcoin and no way to trade it for local currency? Unless they plan on going underground, they’ll need to raise money the tax collector will accept, which presumably involves trading Bitcoin for Kenyan shillings. If they have to go through a third, intermediate currency, such as dollars or pounds, they could lose their edge in terms of transaction fees. So are there any buyers?\n\nPerhaps, soon. Bitsoko is one startup “championing the use of Bitcoin in Kenya,” but its website currently lists only two local merchants that accept the cryptocurrency, a bar and a cyber cafe. Remittances alone do not a functioning Bitcoin economy make. Unless people in developing countries adopt Bitcoin for a wider range of uses, ""rebittances"" will have a hard time getting off the ground.', 'Bitcoin trading has taken China, the world’s second largest economy, by storm as Goldman Sachs reported that 80% of the industry trading volumes are in renminbi. After all, an increasing share of the Chinese middle class is pursuing alternative investments, apart from property and equities.\n\nAccording to Bobby Lee, CEO of the world’s largest bitcoin exchange BTCChina, Chinese users who like to gamble enjoy the strong volatility in bitcoin prices. For many, buying low and selling high offers the opportunity to make quick profits.\n\nChinese Bitcoin Trading\n\nIn addition, Lee also views the rise in bitcoin trading as part of the increased market penetration of gambling in Asia. This is particularly evident in the gambling activity in casinos in Macau, which is actually seven times larger than that of Las Vegas.\n\n“China will continue to have the world’s largest share of Bitcoin trading,” Lee said. “Why is Macau the world’s largest gambling market? It’s not because Macau has the most casinos … it’s because Chinese are so interested in gambling!”\n\nAt the moment, regulation is not that strict in China when it comes to bitcoin trading. Nonetheless BTCChina did encounter some road bumps while it was setting up shop back in 2013, as it was forced to stop accepting new deposits of real currency in exchange for several weeks. This was because the Chinese central government decided to prohibit banks from dealing in bitcoin. In addition, bitcoin trading is still drawing skepticism due to the negative reputation of cryptocurrencies after Mt. Gox was hacked and shut down.\n\nDespite this, Lee maintains that bitcoin is here to stay. He acknowledged that bitcoin can be subject to criminal use, as the transactions are anonymous. Bitcoin isn’t subject to capital controls in China yet, which means that it can allow terrorist groups to shift large amounts of funds across borders without being flagged for money laundering.', ""In the ongoing debate regarding Bitcoin's block size limit, Bitcoin Core developer Pieter “sipa” Wuille has published a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to increase the maximum block size by 17.7% per year, starting in January 2017. However, like previous proposals, it seems unlikely Wuille's BIP 103 will reach a consensus within Bitcoin's development community.\n\nIn a proposal dubbed “Block size following technological growth,” Wuille argues that his suggested maximum block size limit growth is tailored to stay in check with hardware and other technological improvements. This is needed, the Core developer and Blockstream co-founder argues, because the Bitcoin ecosystem faces risks of centralization if technology cannot keep up with protocol requirements.\n\nIf blocks on Bitcoin's blockchain are too big to handle for many of its users, it could drastically decrease the number of full nodes on the network in general, and further centralize Bitcoin mining specifically, Wuille fears.\n\nHe argues:\n\n“Bitcoin's advantage over other systems does not lie in scalability. Well-designed centralized systems can trivially compete with Bitcoin's on-chain transactions in terms of cost, speed, reliability, convenience, and scale. Its power lies in transparency, lack of need for trust in network peers, miners, and those who influence or control the system. Wanting to increase the scale of the system is in conflict with all of those.”\n\nBandwidth\n\nMost importantly, the Core developer and Blockstream co-founder explains that he has taken the projected increase of bandwidth over the next decades into account. He believes this is probably the biggest bottleneck Bitcoin faces in order to scale while remaining decentralized.\n\nWuille proposes to increase the block size limit with 4.4% by January 2017 and automatically repeat this process every 97 days, more or less. This allows for a yearly block size growth rate of 17.7%. According to Wuille, this is consistent with the average growth rate of bandwidth over the past years. The increases of the block size limit will then continue up until July 2063. At that rate, the maximum block size will reach 2MB by 2021, 8 MB by 2030, and eventually end up at slightly less than 2GB in 2063.\n\nExplaining his rationale, Wuille wrote:\n\n“Waiting 1.5 years before the hard fork takes place should provide ample time to minimize the risk of a hard fork, if found uncontroversial. Because every increase (including the first) is only 4.4%, risk from large market or technological changes is minimized. The growth rate of 17.7% growth per year is consistent with the average growth rate of bandwidth the last years, which seems to be the bottleneck. If over time, this growth factor is beyond what the actual technology offers, the intention should be to soft fork a tighter limit.”\n\nNo White Smoke\n\nWuille's rationale regarding the maximum block size increase is somewhat similar to that of Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin's former lead developer and main proponent of increasing the block size. A big difference between the two proposals, however, is the preferred growth rate. Wuille's proposed growth rate is far more conservative than Andresen's.\n\nAndresen initially suggested a one-of increase of the block size limit to 20MB. This was later scaled down to an increase to 8MB, but combined with a yearly growth of 40%. The choice for 8MB was made primarily in consultation with the Chinese mining community, while Andresen said the yearly 40% increase was based on long-term growth trends for CPU power, storage, and Internet bandwidth. Perhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, Andresen indicated that he considered Wuille's growth rate too conservative. As such, the former lead developer effectively ruled out the possibility of a consensus on BIP 103 among Core developers.\n\nCommenting on BIP 103 on the developers mailing list, Andresen wrote:\n\n“I think that [reaching 2 MB blocks by 2021] is much too conservative, and the most likely effect of being that conservative is that the main blockchain becomes a settlement network, affordable only for large-value transactions.”\n\nAdding:\n\n“I don't think [the] proposal strikes the right balance between centralization of payments (a future where only people running payment hubs, big merchants, exchanges, and wallet providers settle on the blockchain) and centralization of mining.”\n\nPrevious BIPs\n\nIt is widely agreed that at some point an increase of the block size limit will be needed to allow the Bitcoin network to handle more than 7 transactions per second. The Bitcoin Core development team, however, has so far not been able to reach consensus on the correct timing and strategy to accomplish this.\n\nWuille's BIP 103 is the fourth BIP drafted to increase Bitcoin's block size limit. The first BIP designed to raise this maximum was Core developer Jeff Garzik's BIP 100, which would effectively hand the power to determine the block size limit over to Bitcoin miners. The second proposal was Andresen's BIP 101, which would increase the limit to 8MB in combination with a 40% automated yearly growth. Only two weeks ago, Garzik drafted the alternative BIP 102, which would bump the limit to 2MB as a temporary measure.\n\nIf no consensus will be found on the block size limit, Andresen has indicated to implement BIP 101 in Mike Hearn's alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT. If this alternative Bitcoin implementation garners enough support among Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin XT will activate BIP 101, hence forcing a hard fork and subverting the current stalemate among the Bitcoin Core development team.""]"

But that\'s exactly what will happen when the Senate Economic References Committee makes public its recommendations from an extended review into the treatment and regulation of Bitcoin and other digital currencies this week. By recommending the government amend the definition of money in the GST Tax Act to include digital currencies, it will effectively bring the controversial Bitcoin crypto-currency one step closer to mainstream financial integration. It would bring Australia into line with the UK, which has set itself up to be a leader in the burgeoning financial technology, or Fintech, scene, and herald a more progressive approach to a currency that has long been associated with money laundering and drug trafficking.\n\nBitcoin still incites rolled eyes and derisive snorts among many, but as more people begin to understand the underlying technology of Bitcoin and its decentralised ledger – called the blockchain – more businesses are identifying creative ways to use the digital currency and its network.\n\nWhereas email once revolutionised society as ""communication over internet protocol"", Bitcoin is often heralded as the next step in the internet revolution: ""money over internet protocol"". Wild West notoriety Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has earned itself a Wild West-like notoriety through rollercoaster price fluctuations between highs of more than $US1,000 a coin and lows of $7 and being the currency of choice for now-defunct drug platform Silk Road. Just last Saturday Japanese police arrested Mark Karpeles, the head of collapsed Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox. Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy in February, 2014, saying it had lost around 850,000 Bitcoins – worth about $US500 million at the time. A lack of regulatory framework protecting these accounts meant customers never saw their money again.\n\nSenator Sam Dastyari says Australia has a real opportunity to be a world leader in digital currencies. Daniel Munoz\n\nWhen the Australian Taxation Office announced last August that Bitcoin was to be treated as an ""intangible asset"" for tax purposes, the relatively small (but loud) Australian Bitcoin industry cried foul. The nature of Bitcoin as a store of value as well as a method of payment meant each Bitcoin transaction would attract a GST charge twice. At the time Ronald Tucker, chairman of the Australian Digital Currency Commerce \xadAssociation, said: ""The ATO\'s paper has unfortunately taken the position to treat Bitcoin \xadsupply transactions the same way as an exchange of a commodity; something that would involve the costly and impractical imposition of GST on every single Bitcoin transaction."" Arbitrage funds experimenting with price fluctuation froze, businesses mining Bitcoin using computational power grew wary and CoinJar, Australia\'s biggest Bitcoin exchange platform swiftly packed up shop and moved to the UK, where Bitcoin use didn\'t attract a VAT tax. ""The GST issue really hit the Australian Bitcoin market and several companies were forced to downsize or shut down completely,"" says CoinJar CEO Asher Tan. ""If the definition is changed to a global currency, this would be a positive step to encourage the Bitcoin market to continue innovating. The Australian Bitcoin market will significantly improve.""\n\nAsher Tan, CEO and co-founder of Australia\'s biggest bitcoin exchange CoinJar, moved his company to the UK as a result of the ATO\'s GST ruling. Paul Jeffers\n\nGovernment action But now all this is subject to change after months of lobbying, submissions and hearings. Just after the ATO decision in October, the Upper House\'s Economics Reference Committee, chaired by Labor Senator Sam Dastyari, kicked off an inquiry to look into the ATO\'s treatment of Bitcoin, and also to envisage other regulatory frameworks to protect those dabbling in the new space. Dastyari and Nationals Senator Matthew Canavan hoped to look at how Bitcoin could be regulated to provide safety for consumers, but without stifling an industry before it had even gotten off the ground.\n\nThe Inquiry received submissions from all corners of the financial services industry; AUSTRAC, Mastercard, the Australian Federal Police and a swathe of digital-currency start-ups, all voicing opinions on how Bitcoin and the blockchain technology might be regulated. Most agreed the interpretation of digital currencies as a ""commodity"" rather than a ""currency"" misunderstood the premise of the technology and the ""double taxing"" meant small entrepreneurs were burdened with extra costs. ""We\'ve heard from all over the world – Silicon Valley, Miami, Paris, Hong Kong – everyone is watching to see what Australia will do,"" Senator Dastyari says. ""It is a brand new and, frankly, very exciting technology – and Australia has a real opportunity to be a world leader. Digital currencies could revolutionise aspects of the payments industry, how we conduct financial transactions, or trade existing fiat currencies.""\n\nHearing from many groups With the written submissions in, it was time for industry players to lay out case in person. In early March, the Senate Committee heard evidence from organisations including the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (the vocal Bitcoin lobby group headed by Ron Tucker), the Australian Bankers Association and the Australian Crime Commission, to name a few. The security agencies stressed the nature of peer-to-peer transactions meant governing bodies like financial intelligence agency AusTrac were unable to monitor behaviour, due to the lack of a central reporting body. AusTrac CEO John Schmidt has said visibility is limited, but Bitcoin\'s limited use in Australia puts it down the list of potential threats. Notably, the Reserve Bank of Australia put in its two cents, saying it isn\'t overly concerned the digital currency will pose a huge risk to competition of the financial system on the whole. It still remains the realm of tech startups wanting to experiment with new technology. But in encouragement to the fledgling industry, the RBA\'s head of payment policy Anthony Richards said digital currencies represent an interesting development in the broader payments and financial system landscape. ""The concept of a decentralised ledger is an innovation with potentially broad applications for a modern economy,"" he said. It is understood the Senate committee has found that further investigation will be needed before Bitcoin can be fully regulated by the likes of the RBA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, something that Big Four banks have indicated will be required before they consider offering customers the possibility of banking their Bitcoins. Other committee recommendations are understood to include the need to further investigate how Bitcoin is treated for income tax and FBT purposes; the creation of a digital economy taskforce to conduct greater examination of how Bitcoin is being used and its related risks for regulation purposes; and also a move to insist that anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations are applied to Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nCautious banks Australian banks have been watching Bitcoin innovation closely and have been dabbling in the possibilities: Westpac recently acquired a stake in US based exchange Coinbase, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Westpac are all experimenting with a sister blockchain technology, Ripple. Overseas, Citigroup has been researching ways to move money from country to country more effectively, and has developed its own blockchain structure and cryptocurrency (imaginatively dubbed CitiCoin). Barclays has signed a Proof of Concept agreement with Swedish-based Bitcoin exchange, Safello, to explore benefits from the blockchain. And investment bank Goldman Sachs has sunk a reported $US40 million in Bitcoin company Circle, hedging its bets on the future of Fintech. There are no Bitcoin legislation blueprints, but a number of different regulatory models have emerged. In June, the New York State Department of Financial Services released final BitLicence rules for digital currency firms, requiring them to apply for a license then comply with rules on consumer protection, anti money laundering and cyber security among other things. In July, the European Union ruled against a value-added taxation for Bitcoin trading. However, until now, the unregulated nature of Bitcoin has kept mainstream financial institutions wary. Bitcoin\'s history steeped in Silk Road drug transactions and the possibility to finance terrorist organisations, have kept it on the fringes of mainstream adoption. Indeed, like cash, it is difficult to track once it\'s left traditional mainstream pathways. Strict regulations In Australia, strict ""Know Your Customer"" programs require financial institutions to have optics on their customer\'s habits and understand their financial activities, allowing authorities to better identify money laundering and terrorism activities. As Bitcoin performs peer-to-peer transactions, it bypasses banks, allowing regulators limited visibility on the movement of Bitcoins, only the buy and sell point when fiat currency is swapped into the Bitcoin universe. This is known as on-ramp, off-ramp visibility and it has made it difficult to build a regulatory framework.', 'UPDATE (5th August 6:50 BST): This story has been updated with comment from the Federal Services Agency.\n\nJapanese government officials are weighing whether to regulate bitcoin exchanges in the wake of new developments in the ongoing investigation of Mt Gox.\n\nMedia reports from The Japan Times and The Japan News suggest that the government, including those from the country\'s Financial Services Agency, may seek to implement a registration system for exchange operators. Such a framework may include a licensing scheme and user identification requirements.\n\nThe Times quoted Finance Minister Taro Aso who said that government officials would need to ""carry out studies"" on how to properly regulate digital currency exchanges.\n\nThe news follows the arrest of Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Friday. The former Bitcoin Foundation board member faces market manipulation and embezzlement charges related to the now-defunct business, and comes nearly a year after the government decided against implementing regulation.\n\nAccording to The Times, investigators believe Mt Gox may have been insolvent as early as November 2013, months before the exchange fully halted withdrawals and subsequently declared bankruptcy. Other reports suggest that the seizure of $5m in bitcoin by US officials may have exacerbated the situation.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a representative the Financial Services Agency told CoinDesk:\n\n""We are aware of some media reports writing about regulation systems to be applied to the trading of virtual currencies. However, no official decision has been made yet regarding the FSA\'s stance in relation to bitcoins and other virtual currencies.""\n\nCoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.\n\nJapan image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The product, he said, is already being used in an enterprise pilot program, and is the subject of interest by major banks.\n\nSpeaking to the crowd, Byrne explained the larger goals of the new platform and why he believes it to be a milestone in the history of trading:\n\n""We built a platform and we\'re launching tØ.com, where the trade is the settlement. That\'s the big disruptive idea, the entry is both the trade and the settlement, it doesn\'t have to be a separate process.""\n\nElsewhere, the event kicked off with talks by tØ co-founder Johnny Tabacco, Jones Day partner Lee Armstrong and Overstock president Stormy Simon, all of which sought to emphasize the innovative nature of the project and the genius of Byrne, who was described as a maverick, visionary and philosopher.\n\n""We had built a system that allowed couches to be hand delivered in a box, and back then, that was a hard conversation, helping retailers see how their business would be changed in the future,"" Simon said in her remarks. ""Today shipping couches doesn\'t feel like a big deal.""\n\nDespite his staunch support for the bitcoin network, Byrne was also keen to stress that tØ intends to be ledger agnostic, meaning it can work with any decentralized ledger, he said, with a few weeks of integration.\n\nMentions of bitcoin were noticeably absent from most of the talk, even in references to the enterprise testing of blockchain-based trading systems such as those being developed Nasdaq, which explores how the bitcoin blockchain could be used to trade shares in private companies.\n\nAll attendees at the event, however, did receive $25 in bitcoin, an announcement that followed the main presentation.\n\nHistory of trading\n\nFollowing the opening speakers, Byrne used his talk as a forum to discuss changes in the nature of Wall Street trading systems, using simplistic analogies as a way to showcase the larger innovations that could be unlocked by distributed ledger technologies.\n\nFor instance, Byrne used an example where a grandmother sought to purchase a baseball glove from a neighbor, noting how in this instance trade is conducted directly and without any intermediaries.\n\nByrne then evolved the example to showcase how the same trades have been conducted by Wall Street, from the time of bike messengers, until later when these physical messages were replaced by computer systems, and ultimately, different representations of these trades.\n\n""True settlement would be, Grandma wants to buy a catcher\'s mitt and she gives money for the sale. Imagine that could be put on a public ledger,"" Byrne said.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""Imagine this ledger is cryptographically protected, public and transparent. Grandma\'s money can be turned into US dollar coins and when she buys the catcher\'s mitt, we\'re wiping out one coin and replacing it on another ledger.""\n\nRather than pose this innovation as threatening to Wall Street business models, Byrne sought to stress that tØ intends to license the product to enterprise trading firms.\n\n""We want to work with you,"" he continued. ""We think this is a much better system.""\n\nBuyer beware\n\nByrne also sought to distance tØ from other competitors who are looking to sell blockchain-based products to the New York financial market, suggesting some may fall short of delivering on what he considers the true innovative nature of the technology.\n\n""This is all about true settlement, there\'s no need for net settlement,"" he said. ""If people come along and say they\'re introducing these crypto-based platforms, ask if it stays net. Other people working on such systems, some of the ones I know about will keep settlement net, I\'m suspicious of why you would even do that.""\n\nBuilding on this narrative, Byrne suggested that real gross settlement would ""make impossible"" certain wrongdoings that have become common in financial markets.\n\nHe also strived to frame real-time settlement as an original goal of Wall Street, one that is finally being made possible by distributed ledger technology, concluding:\n\n""That is what we\'ve built at tØ.com and that\'s the original version of Nasdaq, a peer-to-peer (P2P) settlement system, this just happens to be based on new technology.""\n\nImages via Overstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Senior Operating Director & International Marketing Director, Liu Yuewen, and the co-founder and COO of Caimao, Gao Yaohua, explained to CoinTelegraph why mobile trading is becoming increasingly important, how it is eyeing Western users, and what the company hopes to achieve as bitcoin is experiencing a “bearish period,” according to Liu.\n\nThe new mobile app allows users to register, verify, trade, deposit and withdraw from your smartphone. You can also receive professional price alerts and real-time market updates. In addition, multi-currency trading is also supported making it the first one-stop bitcoin trading option for CNY and USD order books.\n\nCoinTelegraph: How will a mobile trading app help Huobi’s expansion plans in China and abroad?\n\nLiu Yuewen: As our time has become more fragmented, people tend to live their lives in a more mobilized way. The Huobi mobile app upgrade is a great leap complying with this developing trend. It enables users to trade BTC/LTC anywhere at any time and the price alert function can help traders to make the orders at a precise time. This will definitely help improve our user experience and increase users’ engagement while attracting new traders.\n\nCT: Who do you view as your main competitors in mobile apps?\n\nLY: The main competitors of Huobi app include the ones developed by trading exchange and the ones providing market information. Since the latter kind doesn’t allow users to trade -- which is actually a very core feature -- our competitors are mainly apps of other exchange platforms. Since Huobi app’s latest upgrade, statistics and user feedback has shown that this version is already leading in the bitcoin industry.\n\n“We believe that the future lies in the mobile end.”\n\nCT: Will you offer Caimao as part of the app?\n\nGao Yaohua: We have planned to develop a mobile app for Caimao. It'll be an independent one, not as part of Huobi app. There’s difference between Huobi and Caimao’s target group and we want to bring the very core functionalities on the mobile APP for both groups.\n\nWe believe that the future lies in the mobile end, so we would like to provide better user experience not only by developing and expanding the bitcoin application scenario, but also enabling them with full functionalities, especially on their mobile phone.\n\nCT: Given the relatively low price right now, how do you view Bitcoin’s future?\n\nLY: We still see a bright future of Bitcoin even though we’re experiencing a relatively hard time. The industry has witnessed several companies seek to change business to other fields and a host of senior management and co-founders once under the spotlight have left the business.\n\nHowever, Huobi keeps on making great effort in raising Bitcoin awareness in public during the past year and our core team members are also very stable. We hope that the re-launch of Huobi app will be quite encouraging news for the whole Bitcoin community at this special time when BTC price stays in a bearish period. As one of the biggest bitcoin exchange platforms in China, we hold a strong faith in the prospect of bitcoin and its blockchain technology, and aim to build a safe and trustworthy exchange."", 'Microsoft’s Bing rewards site gets a great deal of traffic. Many visitors of the site may have gotten their first taste of Bitcoin this morning, noticing a $500 sweepstakes sponsored by Snapcard. CCN previously reported about Snapcard and the way that it accepts multiple cryptocurrencies at real world businesses, among other stories.\n\nToday Bitcoin got a rather big boost thanks to Snapcard’s promotion of a $500 sweepstakes. The company will open the winner a wallet on their own platform and provide them with the money. Presumably there would then be nothing stopping the winner from moving the money to their own Bitcoin wallet. The contest seems aimed at newcomers to the Bitcoin space rather than veteran Bitcoiners who know their way around the system.\n\nAlso read: Wix.com Integrates with Snapcard Allowing 53 Million Online Websites To Accept Digital Currency\n\nWhile Bitcoin is widely considered a technological tour de force and a truly revolutionary application of economics, the technology has not spread widely to common people as of yet. By going out and giving away significant sums of bitcoins, such as Snapcard has done here, companies and individuals can truly spread the word. Even nominal sums, such as in the case of faucets, have managed to stimulate interest and bring in new members of this community. Certainly free money buys a lot of interest.\n\nMicrosoft has recently embraced Bitcoin more and more, as a whole. The company began accepting it for some digital products awhile back, and more recently the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced a pioneering project in Africa that would involve Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'July 31 saw participants such as the World Bank and other financial elite from Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan gather in Argentina and Brazil to witness the potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, particularly for the Latin American region.\n\nMuch enthusiasm\n\nThe place, Argentina and Brazil; the day, July 31; the spectators: representatives from JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Santander, Itáu, Cielo (Brazil’s largest credit card processor), the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank, Deloitte and the Central Banks of Argentina, Brazil and Chile, among many others. Indeed, the Bitcoin event gathered about 250 people from the banking industry led by the very reputable Pinheiro Neto, a superstar Brazilian law firm who advises all these financial giants in addition to Brazil ’s Government and Central Bank.\n\nThis is the first time the Latin American banking establishment has attended a bitcoin conference and with such enthusiasm, as sources from Pinheiro Neto confirm the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Participants such as the World Bank are now very interested in contributing to the development of Latin America and the rest of the world through its member IFC (International Finance Corporation); a group which invests and collaborates with the private sectors of emerging economies to foster development.\n\nIn Argentina , the event was hosted by the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in its Parque Patricios auditorium as the local policy makers are interested in digital currency.\n\nNot only banking firms were spectators, as the event was streamed to 11 bitcoin communities, from Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, México, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Venezuela, Paraguay and even… Slovakia . In addition, English was used to overcome language barriers.\n\nAmong the several speakers that contributed to this conference of special interest are Constance Choi (Kraken’s co-founder) who spoke about how to regulate blockchain technologies while maximizing innovation and prosperity; and Juan Llanos (former BitReserve) who indulged in explanations about the current regulatory landscape for virtual currencies.\n\nTo get further information, CT spoke with Bitcoin Latam Founder Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar and Gabriel Kurman, CFO of Investment Fund Koibanx; both speakers—and co-organizers—of the event with Pinheiro Neto.\n\n“This opens a door for dialogue that previously didn’t exist.” - Latam Founder Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar\n\n- Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar and Gabriel Kurman\n\nCT: Pinheiro Neto. That name’s not familiar. What can you tell us about them?\n\nDiego: It is the biggest law firm in Brazil , it is not known outside of Brazil , but it’s like saying Marval, O’Farrell & Mairal in Argentina , the studio has 700 lawyers…\n\nGabriel: ...and it has a revenue of a billion Brazilian Reals, and its own conference room that is the one where the conference was held. All the biggest banks in Brazil , every financial entity, the government, the central bank, each and every one of them are clients of Pinheiro Neto.\n\nDiego: Yes, that’s why for us this is a milestone in the relationship of Latin American Bitcoin communities and the financial and regulation sector. This opens a door for dialogue that previously didn’t exist. That a company with the reputation of Pinheiro Neto helps organize this, validates the importance of Bitcoin even more for the traditional sector. Until now conferences were very much for enthusiasts of technology and finances, we have never had the chance to build something of this institutional level.\n\nCT: What can you tell us about the speakers and the talks?\n\nGabriel: First we covered all the technical and historical aspects of Bitcoin and the history of money. Then we opened with speakers such as Juan Llanos and Constance Choi, the founder of data authority, and then Diego Gutierrez Zaldívar who is the president of the Bitcoin Latam and Bitcoin Argentina ONGs.\n\nDiego: Yes, they are very much niche speakers, Constance and Juan are considered two of the, I would say, five speakers that know the most about the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\n“With these talks we’re avoiding that the same that happened to New York happens to us.”\n\nCT: Let’s be honest, how are we going to regulate bitcoin? How is that possible?\n\nGabriel: We’re not trying to regulate bitcoin.\n\nDiego: With these talks we’re avoiding that the same that happened to New York happens to us, that is, that someone comes in to specifically regulate bitcoin and make really bad mistakes, NY has fallen behind regarding bitcoin adoption [..] the application of the bitlicense generates a barrier of entry too high for anyone trying to innovate while doing something new. If Bitcoin is to fit in the current system, it must be done by regulating its uses; not the technology itself.\n\nCT: Let’s say the government learns that some people are using Bitcoin to dolarize their savings. They might not like it very much.\n\nGabriel: [...] Bitcoin as a currency is just the tip of the iceberg, the key here is the blockchain technology. Fifty percent of the planet’s population is not banked, and they will have smartphones; that way we can bring banking services to the poor in Latin America , the poor in the world, those people. With regulators, we want to make emphasis that we believe that there is no need for new regulation, that according to its use, we will decide under which already existing criteria we want to frame it. Bitcoin is so much more than a currency, if one only looks into the purchase of dollars with bItcoin that’s only the tip of the iceberg, that’s what makes us have the dollar as a unique reserve of value in the world, and that’s what limits us to bank the poor of Latin America .\n\nCT: What do you think is the key point of the conference? For them to see the possibilities of this tech?\n\nDiego: Exactly. Our two fundamental points, when I opened the conference with them as objectives, were that they understood that the technology has an enormous disruption potential in finance, beyond its use as currency; and that it might have a really large social impact in the region because we can give those people that have no access to bank accounts a chance at micro-financing, give them a way to save money; because now they can’t, they store their money under their mattress and they go to work fearing that it will be taken from them. Those two were the strongest concepts that we were working on since the beginning of the conference until the end.\n\n“The World Bank was really interested about how to use it to contribute to the development of Latin America and the rest of the world.”\n\nCT: Now that a couple of days have passed have you got an idea about the feedback from those firms?\n\nGabriel: The people from Pinheiro Neto were really happy about that. The Brazilian Central bank’s feedback was really positive, in addition to the people invited they had a dedicated room where the conference was being streaming. The World Bank was really interested about how to use it to contribute to the development of Latin America and the rest of the world.\n\nCT: Did you speak in English? Portuguese might be a little complicated…\n\nDiego: Because we were going to stream it to Latin America but we knew that people from different parts of the world watch it we made it in English to unify. But still there were parts in Portuguese…\n\nGabriel: No, the parts in Portuguese were a panel of local Bitcoin companies and the regulatory framework where Pinheiro Neto talked about the current application of laws in Brazil . That was in Portuguese because it was very local. For example, in Argentina , there were also local talks because local Argentine bitcoin companies and first rate lawyers had their own talks. Right there we cut the streaming, because, well that was a very local component. Also, CNN covered it.\n\nCT: Pinheiro Neto sounds like they deserve the Bitcoin-promoter of the year award.\n\nGabriel: Absolutely. They are true believers in the potential of this technology. the partner that led the organization with us, the one responsible of financial services and payments in Pinheiro Neto, saw the potential of this technology and positioned themselves as the expert lawyers in the matter here in Brazil.\n\nDiego: They are the main advisors of the Central Bank of Brazil; they help them fine-tune the regulation for payment systems.\n\nGabriel: They, together with us, said:', 'To Klarna North America CEO Brian Billingsley, bitcoin and the blockchain hold the promise to solve many of the ""great problems"" affecting the payments space.\n\nHowever, he says his Sweden-based company, which boasts more than 1,200 employees in 18 markets, isn\'t ready to join the list of online checkout startups like Shopify and Stripe that have embraced bitcoin as a payment method. According to Billingsley, the value proposition for the technology in payments and online commerce still remains unclear.\n\nAddressing Klarna\'s bitcoin strategy at this week\'s Keynote 2015 conference, Billingsley indicated that his company\'s overarching goal is to remove friction for online consumers, something that today bitcoin as a digital currency doesn\'t quite achieve.\n\nBillingsley told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'ve done internal pilots with bitcoin. We love the concept of a consumer paying with bitcoin, [but] we haven\'t seen a consumer experience to date that really makes it super frictionless.""\n\nBillingsley did indicate that Klarna is ""actively tracking"" the technology\'s development, even speaking to Swedish regulators to determine when they may allow consumers to spend bitcoin with their more than 50,000 merchant partners.\n\nDespite moving forward on this front, though, Billingsley stressed that he feels that bitcoin as a digital currency, while appealing to a tech-friendly audience, won\'t be effective at increasing sales for Klarna\'s merchants.\n\n""If shoppers have bitcoin, there are great use cases, but it will take us a while to figure out how to integrate this into our experience in a way that makes the average consumer happy,"" he said.\n\nIn interview, the FIS and Alliance Data veteran elaborated on the potential he sees for the technology in payments, noting specific challenges that he believes could be solved by bitcoin or the blockchain even as more attention is directed toward their non-monetary use cases.\n\nTechnology disconnect\n\nIn his conference speech and in conversation, Billingsley spoke at length about friction in the online payments process, questioning how bitcoin as a digital currency could remove e-commerce hurdles given that any new user would need to first purchase bitcoin.\n\nBillingsley suggested this roadblock weakens the use cases for the technology, even in areas where it could gain traction, such as allowing merchants to accept payment from high-risk shoppers without assuming this added liability.\n\n""That runs into the chicken-and-egg problem. If you\'re coming through the experience, our system says you\'re a high-risk transaction and you need to pay with bitcoin, what if the consumer isn\'t using bitcoin, does the conversion fall off?"" he asked.\n\nEven established companies like Coinbase, he said, face this issue, as no matter how easy it is to buy bitcoin with a credit card, most consumers won\'t see the value in the transition.\n\n""Unless there\'s a very specific merchant that only accepts bitcoin, there isn\'t that reason for the average consumer to set up and buy bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nStill, he suggested that a model similar to the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) where merchants band together to create a bitcoin payments system in an effort to lower fees would be one of the most compelling models.\n\n""I think over time more and more people will be turned on [to the technology], but there needs to be some event,"" he continued. ""What if an MCX was successful and said \'If you pay with bitcoin you get 3% off everything?\' Otherwise it might be this long slog.""\n\nThe comments echo strategies currently being executed in early stages by companies like Fold and Purse.\n\nInternational payments\n\nOne trend that Billingsley does believe could be an indicator there are big problems for bitcoin and the blockchain to solve is the increasingly global reach of small merchants.\n\n""It\'s shocking how global merchants are becoming, even when they\'re really small,"" Billingsley said. ""We\'re seeing $5m–$10m merchants where 20% of their volume is from all over the world.""\n\nThese merchants, Billingsley explained, face significants tax burdens from e-commerce sales, a situation that sometimes forces businesses to establish multiple corporate entities around the world.\n\n""If you\'re a $10m merchant, it\'s tough to figure out how to scale,"" he said, calling this one of the biggest roadblocks to merchant growth.\n\nBillingsley added:\n\n""If blockchain can alleviate payments and taxes around local entities I think it would be really powerful.""\n\nSuch business use cases, he argued, are more compelling than those aimed at consumers, as feels even those who favor cash aren\'t likely to adopt bitcoin.\n\n""I think those consumers are probably some of the least tech savvy,"" he said. ""How do you convince them that bitcoin is as safe as keeping greenbacks in your wallet?""\n\nB2B opportunities\n\nLike other panelists at Keynote 2015, Billingsley was bullish on the ability for bitcoin and the blockchain to penetrate business-to-business (B2B) payments verticals.\n\n""The cross-border payments companies should be trying to figure out how to use blockchain technology or they should be really scared about what could happen,"" Billingsley said. ""The Western Unions of the world should be really worried.""\n\nBillingsley indicated that Klarna is curious about how it could leverage the bitcoin network to send payments between its global offices.\n\nHowever, Billingsley noted that, as Klarna is a bank in Sweden, it is still weighing the risks of partaking in this use case, noting how the company remains cautious about garnering any added regulatory oversight on top of the credit and fraud risk it assumes in online shopping.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""There\'s times when we\'re needing to settle out to a variety of different merchants and here is a way we can potentially settle in a better, faster and cheaper way.""\n\nOnline commerce image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin is an unregulated, near anonymous virtual payment method. Account holders use an encrypted electronic signature for payment, which amongst others, may attract those with something to hide. Recent research in the Journal of Applied Economic Letters builds on existing research and anecdotal evidence, using Google Trends data to examine Bitcoin interest and potential user profiles.\n\nPast research on Bitcoin usage revealed 3 key motivations; curiosity, profit making and politics. Authors Yelowitz & Wilson analyse Google Trends search data for terms related to Bitcoin and its users. They focused on 4 possible clientele groups; tech enthusiasts, investors, anti-establishment and criminals. Each group has a sensible rationale for using Bitcoin: programmers can \'mine\' for more Bitcoins by authenticating transactions. Marked Bitcoin price fluctuations attract potential investors. Those seeking liberty from the central banks feel the benefit of Bitcoin and criminals have been able to safely and anonymously trade online in drugs and fake passports using Bitcoins. The authors conducted a 31 month time series in several US states for the popularity of Bitcoin in each group.\n\nThe results of this unprecedented systematic review revealed definite correlations between computer programmers and Bitcoin and illegal activity and Bitcoin. No such link was established for the other 2 potential market segments. During the period of the study the authors observed highest Bitcoin interest in Utah, Oregon, California, Washington, Nevada, New Hampshire and Vermont.

08/05/2015,"['A new inquiry from the Australian government is looking to change current tax codes for Bitcoin in Australia, which are proving to be controversial and counter-productive, hurting businesses and growth. The initiative seeks to establish similar progressive standards as in nations like the UK, Canada, and Singapore, where Bitcoin is considered money.\n\n‘A positive step’\n\nBitcoin regulation has been, and will continue to be, a hot topic as it continues to gain momentum and interest in personal and corporate finance, worldwide. This issue has been a main focus of the Australian Senate over the past year, as bitcoin is becoming an increasingly popular commodity in the Oceanic country.\n\nIt is attracting business to the nation, and bitcoin ownership in Australia is among the world’s highest per capital, with 7% of the world’s bitcoin circulation running through the continent nation.\n\nThe problem recently has come with the addition of the GST, or Goods and Service Tax, levied on Bitcoin transaction by Australia’s Taxation Office last year. This labeled Bitcoin an “intangible asset” causing a double-taxation effect for Bitcoin businesses.\n\nCoinjar recently moved their operations from Australia to the UK due to the effect of these new regulations. The United Kingdom has excluded bitcoin from VAT (Value Added Tax), which has attracted many companies, with London becoming a global hub for Bitcoin business activity.\n\nCoinjar CEO Asher Tan told IBTimes:\n\n""If it is defined as a global currency, this would be a positive step to encouraging the bitcoin market to continue innovating. The Australian bitcoin market will significantly improve.”\n\nRemoving the GST\n\nPrimarily, the current GST levy causes Bitcoin users to pay a tax when they buy the digital currency initially, and pay another tax when they make a purchase with the currency. These recommended revisions, expected officially next week, would simplify the tax code for users and businesses dealing in the currency, hence making it more attractive, overall.\n\n""The opportunities for trade, investment, high salaries and world-leading skills are far more important [than any potential loss of revenue], and I urge the states to work with the Commonwealth to make what amounts to simple change,"" Labor Senator Sam Dastyari, told the Australian Financial Review. “Without a doubt, the main benefit will be the confidence and certainty that removing a GST will provide to our own digital entrepreneurs, and the foreign businesses who want to set up here. The Treasury ministers need to work with the states to make the changes necessary to bring our legislation into the 21st century.”\n\nCash still king?\n\nOne unfortunate downside is the alleged threat of money laundering and terrorism financing. This potential will be mitigated by all Bitcoin and digital currency companies having to catalog all users through the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center. This will make it easier for Bitcoin businesses to “better identify and mitigate money laundering and terrorism financing risks in the conduct of their transactions.”\n\nGiven these developments and the risk of losing business investment is forcing Australia’s hand. While they can lead, follow or get out of the way, Australia appears to have chosen to follow, though it is encouraging that they are betting on Bitcoin’s economic benefits moving forward.\n\nUnfortunately, all Australians who use bitcoin being treated like a potential criminal is baked into the cake by the authorities. Interestingly, similar measures are not taken when using Australian dollars for any transaction, underscoring the inherent freedom and benefits of using cash as an option. It appears freedom from persecution and bitcoin cannot seem to get on the same page in The Land Down Under.', 'Since I’ve delved into Blockchain and the Arts with my various posts on the subject, one thing that has become resoundingly clear is that there’s tremendous misunderstanding about fundamental concepts.\n\nAn example: I was speaking to someone the other day, and I mentioned that I had been writing about Blockchain. The person asked, “What’s Blockchain?”\n\nDrawing from my favorite explanation, I said, “The Blockchain is a distributed database that sequentially records transactions….” I saw his eyes glazing over, and so I pulled my trump card – something I knew would grab his attention — and mentioned Bitcoin.\n\nThe person stopped me mid-sentence, and with a tremendous amount of authority in his voice declared: “Oh, Bitcoin is a scam!”\n\nWith a degree of self-restraint that is unusual for me, I managed to not say what I was thinking — “So… you don’t know what the Blockchain is, but you\'re a Bitcoin expert?” — and just redirected the conversation.\n\nOften, when it comes to emergent technologies, everyone is an “expert.” This is because while the foundational knowledge is being constructed, it is not yet able to be validated by many real-world applications. Simply put, there aren’t enough case studies.\n\nBlockchain is currently in this place. There are few show-rather-than-tell use cases to explain the Blockchain. Thus, when people like myself try to do so we turn to future applications; such as, Venture Capitalist, Andy Weissman’s “Nirvana State,” or Imogen Heap’s ""Mycelia Project.""\n\nBeyond these types of forward-looking examples, the current example that people do have some awareness of, for better or worse, is Bitcoin. In this way, Bitcoin and Blockchain have been linked, and many people view the two as synonymous. They are not.', 'I’m not a big fan of the “X accepts bitcoin” type of post but this one is near and dear to my heart – and actually interesting. LOT Polish airlines, the official Polish air carrier, is now accepting bitcoin. What does that mean? It means that you’ll soon be able to pay BTC to go to KRK.\n\nThe transactions are being handled by Adyen and BitPay. Interestingly, Poland is a leader in payments with a number of clever smaller banks offering more NFC and bitcoin payment options than anywhere else in Europe.\n\nIn a fairly tortured press release, Jiri Marek, LOT Sales and Distribution Executive Director, said:\n\n?”We are open for every need of every single client. We go for innovations thanks to which their journey is even more comfortable and pleasant not only on board, but also much earlier – at the stage of buying the ticket. Many of them do the shopping online, including plane tickets. It’s just the matter of time when payments with the online currency will become as popular as using credit cards today. We notice this potential, which is why we are one of the first airlines in the world to give its passengers the possibility of paying with Bitcoins as early as today.”\n\nairBaltic and Air Lituanica are also accepting bitcoin but LOT is the first major carrier to do so in Europa Centralna. Hopefully soon we can pay for our Tyskie in Satoshis.', 'The European Securities and Markets Authority has published a number of responses stemming from a request for information on the topic of virtual currency.\n\nThe ESMA, which regulates securities activity in the European Union, first sought submissions from the finance and digital currency industries in April. The agency published 14 responses from participants such as German megabank Deutsche Bank, Italian banking group Intesa Sanpaolo, regional trade group European Central Securities Depositories Association (ECSDA) and interbank messaging network SWIFT, among others.\n\nThe submissions offer varied perspectives on how European regulators should approach overseeing activity on the continent. At the same time, the documents show how some of these organizations are adapting to the technology as it evolves.\n\nIntesa Sanpaolo, like a growing number of banks worldwide, has gone as far as to establish an internal working group called an “Innovation Area” focused on cryptocurrencies as part of a broader effort to innovate on the technology side.\n\nThe letter noted:\n\n“This Area is performing in depth research on virtual currencies and blockchain technologies. Through its dedicated task force, Intesa Sanpaolo is also implementing cryptofinance projects [and] integrating them with its strategic vision about the evolution of the financial services industry.”\n\nThe bank did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.\n\nBitcoin as potential ‘global standard’\n\nIntesa Sanpaolo noted that among its possible use cases, bitcoin could function as a network for rights management, writing that ""[the bitcoin protocol’s] potential is far from being fully explored especially as a means to transfer rights and value in a very secure way"".\n\nThe bank went on to suggest that ESMA avoid using the phrase ""virtual currencies"", offering alternatives such as ""distributed ledger technology"", ""limited supply digital entitlement"", ""digital scarce asset"" and ""mathematical commodity"".\n\nAt the same time, Intesa Sanpaolo wrote that among both implemented and envisioned distributed ledgers, bitcoin itself remains “the first and the most important of Internet of Value protocol"", citing the adoption of TCIP-IP over alternatives as possible precedent.\n\nThe bank wrote:\n\n""There are high chances that it can establish itself as a global standard, as it leverages at least four powerful network effects: [the] bitcoin network has by far the largest hashing power (and so the greatest security), the higher capitalization, the largest user (and merchant) adoption, the best and largest developing and maintenance effort around it.""\n\nThe bank further argued that alternative algorithms, including proof-of-stake, are ""still not validated from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view"", stating that NXT and other networks depend ""on some kind of centralization in validation checkpoints"".\n\nCall for dual oversight\n\nThe ECSDA, which represents 41 central securities depositories in Europe, said that it supports a regulatory regime for digital currencies, adding that such a framework ""needs to be developed to avoid ... disturbances to financial stability"".\n\nPerhaps echoing a divergence to come as banks look at implementing bitcoin’s underlying blockchain for use as permissioned database instead of currency networks, it added:\n\n“Looking at technological developments in conjunction with, but also separately from, virtual currencies and virtual currency investments, could enable securities regulators to find the right balance between promoting innovation and mitigating the related risks.""\n\nOn the other hand, the group said that its members from within the securities depositories industry are actively exploring the technology for use as a settlement mechanism but are not ready to disclose specific findings.\n\n“Most of the work at CSD level however remains exploratory at this stage, and ECSDA is not yet able to share any conclusions,” it wrote.\n\nImage credit: gnoparus / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Researchers from the University of Kentucky claim computer programmers and persons involved in illegal activity top the list of bitcoin users, reported wired.uk.com, a London, U.K.-based technology news source. Several comments on wired.uk.com took issue with these findings.\n\nThe authors set out to determine what types of people use bitcoin and their reasons for using it. They used Google Trends data to explore reasons for interest in bitcoin. They acknowledged the search data in and of itself did not provide a definitive method for defining bitcoin use. But by building on existing research and anecdotal evidence, they created profiles for likely bitcoin users.\n\nTop Reasons For Bitcoin Use\n\nPrior research indicated three reasons for bitcoin use: curiosity, profit making and politics. Based on these findings, the researchers created four user groups: tech enthusiasts, investors, anti-establishment types, and criminals.\n\nThe study analyzed bitcoin-related search terms over a 31-month period.\n\nThe authors acknowledged the sensitivity of some bitcoin activity could make it hard to analyze the data, but they concluded it was not likely Google data would be subjected to major social censoring. They also noted there has been a correlation between bitcoin-related Google searches and exchange prices. This suggested that interest on Google reflected people using bitcoin or following its progress.\n\nThe authors used all search terms listed under bitcoin as a currency. These include terms such as “bitcoins,” “bitcoin mining,” “bit coin,” “bitcoin exchange,” “bitcoin price” and “bitcoin value.” The researchers combined these terms with those related to computer science as a discipline. They examined results containing terms “Silk Road,” “free market,” and “make money” to determine the level of bitcoin interest related to criminal activity, a libertarian political position and speculative investing.\n\nAlso read: Luxembourg Researchers Find A Way To Unmask Bitcoin Users\n\nNo Correlation To Liberty From Central Banks\n\nThe authors found no correlation linking bitcoin to seeking liberty from central bankers or investors looking to make money from the currency. They determined that computer programmers and criminals interests most closely matched the Google Trends search data\n\n“Although many commentators have speculated about motives for using Bitcoin, our study is the first to systematically analyse Bitcoin interest, including the interest of hard-to-observe clientele,” the authors said. “We find robust evidence that computer programming enthusiasts and illegal activity drive interest in Bitcoin and find limited or no support for political and investment motives.”\n\nThe findings drew several comments from readers who took issue with the study’s methodology.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Patrick Byrne, CEO and chairman of Overstock.com. Joe Pugliese/WIRED\n\nThe global stock market spans about $101 trillion in financial securities. And at any given moment, about $1.7 trillion is out on loan.\n\nHedge funds, mutual funds, and other traders don\'t just buy and sell stock. They borrow it. Sometimes, they\'re looking to short sell: If they borrow shares, sell them, and the price goes down, they reap a profit. Other times, they borrow as a way of hedging their stock positions or settling other deals. In the US alone, according to research from DataLend, about $954 billion in securities is typically on loan to some fund or another.\n\nMany players benefit from this little-discussed market. Sure, the borrowers can make some extra money. But the same goes for those who lend the securities out, including retirement funds and other large stock holders. They charge a fee for that loaned stock. And, yes, middlemen take a cut too, including prime brokers such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and dedicated lending houses, or ""agent lenders,"" like BNY Mellon and State Street. The agent lenders alone make about $19.2 million a day helping organizations lend out their stock, and the prime brokers likely make even more.\n\nIt\'s an enormously lucrative market. And it\'s a market controlled by a relatively small group of players, most notably the prime brokers. ""Securities lending has historically been a closed network,"" says Josh Galper, who runs a financial consulting firm, Finadium, that closely tracks stock loans. ""In order to lend or borrow securities, you need to be one of the players in this market.""\n\nPatrick Byrne, the iconoclastic CEO of e-commerce site Overstock.com and an unwavering voice for reform on Wall Street, wants to bust this market open. Using technology based on the blockchain—the technology that underpins the bitcoin digital currency—he wants to move the stock-loan market onto the Internet and put it in the hands of, well, everyone. He wants to break the hold of the agent lenders and prime brokers, arguing that, as it stands, they make untold amounts of money from the loan market without giving stock holders their proper share. ""We\'re taking a market that\'s in the dark,"" Byrne says, ""and we\'re putting it on an exchange.""\n\nThe Dark Arts\n\nOn Tuesday evening, at a cocktail party held inside the Nasdaq stock exchange, Byrne unveiled his bitcoin-inspired stock-loan system under the aegis of an Overstock subsidiary called TØ.com. TØ.com has also used the blockchain to create an online system that can replace the primary stock markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. On Tuesday, Byrne unveiled this system too, saying it was on the verge of receiving approval from the SEC. But the world knew that was coming. The stock loan system was an unexpected reveal. The irrepressible Byrne wants to reform the financial markets in more ways than one.\n\nIn both cases, Byrne and TØ aim to remove the dark arts out of the financial markets, to put them online in a way that all transactions can be carefully verified, to ensure we always know who holds a given share, to limit the role of Wall Street middle men. The blockchain is essentially a massive online ledger, driven by a vast network of independent machines. With bitcoin, this ledger puts the money system in the hands of the people, limiting the role of big government and big banks. Now, Byrne wants to do the same for the financial markets.\n\nSome question whether Byrne is in a position to change these markets—no matter how powerful his technology. But separate from his efforts, Wall Street is waking up the notion that the blockchain can streamline our financial markets. This spring, Nasdaq itself announced that it will use the blockchain to drive a private stock market, and two other outfits, Digital Asset Holdings and Symbiont, are developing their own blockchain-based systems for the securities trading.\n\n\'Pre-Borrow Assurance Tokens\'\n\nBut Byrne\'s stock loan system is unique. Based on blockchain-like technology from a startup called Peer Nova, it will allow pension funds and other stock holders to lend shares directly to hedge funds and other traders, essentially removing middlemen such as agent lenders and prime brokers from the process.\n\nThe setup is relatively simple. Stock holders will attach bitcoin-like digital tokens to each share of stock. Hedge funds and other traders will bid for the right to borrow shares. And then, thanks to the tokens, known as ""Pre-Borrow Assurance Tokens,"" or PATs, stock holders can closely track each transaction involving their loaned stock.\n\nThe system is an outgrowth of Byrne\'s well-documented experiences on Wall Street. A decade ago, Overstock was the victim of what\'s called naked short selling, where traders exploit a loophole in the system to short sell stock without actually borrowing it—a practice that can drive down a stock\'s value. After the financial crash of 2008, the SEC moved to close this loophole. But with his blockchain-based systems, Byrne wants to ensure this kind of thing is eradicated entirely—in addition to streamlining the stock loan system as a whole.\n\nRisk Versus Reward\n\nGalper calls the system interesting, though he questions whether the existing players will end up using it. ""As with any closed system, the greatest beneficiaries of that system are the biggest participants,"" he says. ""Would the largest borrowers and lenders be keen to move to a new system and to provide more equal access to borrowers and lenders? I don\'t believe so.""\n\nWhat\'s more, he explains, lenders are happy with the existing system because the agent lenders (typically large banks) provide what\'s called ""counter-party default indemnification."" This amounts to insurance for the shares sent out on loan. With TØ\'s system, lenders must have a similar assurance that when they loan their stock, they\'ll get it back.\n\n""This is a question of risk versus reward,"" Galper says. ""If you\'re willing to take additional risk by lending directly to a hedge fund, then you\'re going to get greater reward. On the other hand, it is your responsibility to monitor that hedge fund, to insure that it is a good credit risk, that it pays on time, and that you get your stock back at the end of the transaction.""\n\nAccording to Byrne, TØ.com does have ways of limiting counterparty risk. Initially, he says, lenders can use these system while keeping their shares with a large prime broker, such as Goldman Sachs, who can continue to provide default indemnification as always. So, the prime brokers will remain part of the process, but they may not benefit nearly as much as they did in the past.\n\nThe New Middleman\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Galper believes, smaller hedge funds may be keen to use TØ\'s system. After all, it will allow them to borrow shares at a cheaper rate. ""The smaller a hedge fund you are, the more incentive you have to look for alternatives. If you have an opportunity to eliminate your middleman, then you can lower your price for borrowing.""\n\nYes, Byrne and TØ.com are now Wall Street middlemen. But Byrne insists that they will charge lower rates than the incumbents, because their technology takes so much fat out of the market. And the larger point, he says, is this new system can give the market the transparency is has never had.\n\nEven if the system fails to replace the existing players, he says, it can push Wall Street in the same direction. On Tuesday evening, his primary message was that he\'s willing to share this technology with others. ""We\'ve shown the world what we have,"" he says, ""and now I\'m willing to listen to anyone who wants to talk.""', 'Yesterday, social media lit up with the news that bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto had emerged from the shadows to make a transaction.\n\nThe mysterious figure is estimated to own somewhere in the region of one million coins, all mined during the currency\'s early months. His fortune, now worth $281.6m, has not moved in six and a half years.\n\nYet speculation bubbled after a user spotted what appeared to be signs that some coins had moved, according to data from Blockchain.info. The site displayed coins in bitcoin\'s genesis block, or \'block one\', moving to an address created this year.\n\nDespite initial excitement – and concern – from some, other users spotted a data discrepancy across alternative block explorers. Sites including Blocktrail, Blockr.io and others did not display the transaction, indicating that perhaps the movement didn\'t actually happen.\n\nObservers have stated that the issue was due to Blockchain.info\'s API accepting transactions without validating them, eliciting criticism across social media platforms. The company later acknowledged the issue on Twitter, stating that more details would be forthcoming.\n\nFunds attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto have not moved. They are unconfirmed by the Bitcoin network and likely spoofed. More details to follow. — Blockchain (@blockchain) August 4, 2015\n\nEarlier today a user took to Reddit claiming to have been responsible for the transaction, stating that he is a researcher from Central Europe who wanted to test the response to sending invalid transactions.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith characterized the event as a ""publicity stunt"", arguing that the network would have never validated the transaction.\n\nHowever, the company has updated its API with a fix that Smith says will prevent a similar situation from developing in the future.\n\n""I think we can do a better job of filtering and we currently employ a lot of custom filtering rules so people don’t use our API for malicious purposes like spamming, dust transactions, etc.,"" he told CoinDesk.

So maybe Apple\'s next year of sales is going to be softer, Mohan argues. ""The iPhone 6/6 plus represents a super cycle, in our opinion, demand is being pulled in from the next year, and we see the December quarter of 2014 as the peak shipment quarter for iPhones until the potential iPhone 7 release in Sep 2016,"" his note to investors from last night says.\n\nHere are a couple of charts that illustrate that problem.\n\nFirst, iPhone sales in China are becoming a much more important part of Apple\'s sales than they used to be.\n\nApple is becoming more and more dependent on China:\n\nNow, with demand for iPhones temporarily sated, Apple is losing market share against Android phones again. While demand and share cycles are cyclical, note that over the long term Apple\'s share of all phones sold is fairly unpredictable and lumpy.\n\nApple\'s market share in China is not guaranteed:\n\n""The iPhone sales over the past 3 quarters combined with the replacement rates (see above) suggest that there was a significant acceleration of replacements driven by the iPhone 6/6+, which has since tailed off sharply, offset by very strong new user adoption,"" Mohan writes. ""The stronger new user growth is bullish overall (installed base grows larger over time) but also makes the quarterly sales more volatile. We view this latter dynamic at significant risk given the headwind being created by the stronger dollar, and broader economic uncertainty which can lead to lower sales from large markets like China.""\n\nWhat might that look like?\n\nWell, a good guide is what happened to Apple in the post 2012 period, when the company released a small-sized iPhone 5S when sales of large-sized Androids (like the Galaxy S4) became huge. Apple did OK, but because the 5S wasn\'t a great improvement on the 5, and because there were more interesting Android alternatives, Apple\'s sales growth went into a trough.\n\nYou can see that trough on this chart from BI Intelligence (below).\n\nThe iPhone 5S global sales trough:\n\nThere are two ways to interpret that 2013-2014 trough. You can say that this was when Apple appeared to lose the initiative, giving Samsung momentum it never should have never had. In this theory, Samsung\'s main strategy here should be to lean on sales of the Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy Note 5. Both phones offer a different physical shape and features (a curved screen and a stylus, respectively) than the iPhone does, in a parallel of the way that the Galaxy S4 and Note 2 and 3 offered a far bigger screen than the iPhone 5S did.\n\nAlternatively you can say that this merely part of Apple\'s natural two-year product cycle, and the real action comes with iPhone 7 in 2016, which will once again wipe the floor with whatever Samsung has on the market at the time.\n\nEXCLUSIVE FREE SLIDE DECK:\n\nThe Next Smartphone by the BI Intelligence Research Team.\n\nGet the Slide Deck Now » The Next Smartphone by the BI Intelligence Research Team.', ""Vermont has recently taken some legislative steps that could see the state using Bitcoin’s technology for state records, smart contracts and other applications in a drive to become “a leader in the field.”\n\nLegislative moves\n\nOn June 3, 2015 Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin signed into law “No. 51. An act relating to promoting economic development. (S.138),” which contained “Sec. A.3. Study and Report; Blockchain Technology.”\n\nThis mandates that a report be written by January 15, 2016, which has “… finding(s) and recommendations on the potential opportunities and risks of creating a presumption of validity for electronic facts and records that employ blockchain technology.”\n\nThere was also an amendment (not yet signed into law) by Senator Balint which appears to be Vermont’s roadmap if there are favorable findings in the report due early next year. On April 8, Amendment to S.138 added in a third reading “Sec. 47. 9 V.S.A. Chapter 2: Electronic Verification Of Facts And Records: § 11. Blockchain Enabling.” It states in part that:\n\n“Blockchain technology shall be a recognized practice for the verification of a fact or record, and those facts or records established through a valid blockchain technology process shall have a presumption of validity for matters to be determined subject to, or in accordance with, the laws of the State of Vermont.”\n\nBlockchain good, Bitcoin bad\n\nOf note neither the bill signed by the Governor nor the amendment put forth by the Senator reference “Bitcoin” but rather the distributed immutable worldwide ledger database that Bitcoin runs on - the blockchain.\n\nThere has been an increasing trend recently of individuals disassociating themselves with Bitcoin and co-opting the blockchain. In part, this has to do with the unfair negative association of Bitcoin with cases ranging from Mt. Gox to Silk Road. Both of these services conflated legacy systems (entrusting third parties with private keys) with Bitcoin to patch together unsafe conduits for trade.\n\nLegislation such as that from Vermont seems to follow this same path of burying Bitcoin and at the same time embracing it. This also has to do with the recent Bitcoin 2.0 awakening that the Bitcoin blockchain public ledger is not merely a rail to move virtual currency, but a powerful means to transmit information and has even been referred to as a “truth machine” among other applications.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nThe amendment was drafted by Oliver R. Goodenough, Director of the Center for Legal Innovation, Professor of Law at the Vermont School of Law. In an April 1, 2015 Memorandum to The House Committee on Commerce and Economic Development, Re: Making Vermont’s Legal Structure Hospitable to e-Commerce, Goodenough provided a background and a summary of his testimony which included a “Draft Vermont Blockchain Enabling Law,” which includes some verbiage that’s virtually identical to the amendment.\n\nGoodenough’s testimony includes a section entitled “General e-Contract Recognition” and following is an excerpt:\n\n“Significant progress is being made in systems that will permit the statement of contractual obligations in software. This ranges from academic work such as my co-authored paper with Mark Flood of the Treasury’s office of financial research to the application work of companies like Etherium [sic] and Exari. Vermont has already explicitly recognized this possibility in its digital corporation legislation. Extending this principle to other contexts would again make Vermont a leader in the field […].”\n\nThe memorandum’s citations are very interesting and also includes a reference to an Office of Financial Research (OFR) of the U.S. Department of Treasury Working Paper “Contract as Automaton: The Computational Representation of Financial Agreements” from March 26, 2015---just a few days prior to Goodenough’s testimony.\n\nThe paper includes a reference to a YouTube Ethercast, “Ethereum Contracts as Legal Contracts, Computational Legal Studies,” which features Tom Johnson, a patent attorney delivering a presentation at the Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup at the Plug and Play Tech Center. Johnson describes how Ethereum and smart contracts can be a legal contract.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum features a Turing-complete, universal scripting language, and was recently launched on July 30. According to Wikipedia, Ethereum is a “blockchain-based virtual machine featuring stateful user-created digital contracts and a Turing-complete contract programming language.”\n\nIn a nod to a 2008 article by founding executive editor of Wired Magazine Kevin Kelly, the working paper concludes in part that:\n\n“[…] Putting computational tools to work in the context of law and justice has the potential to revolutionize aspects of the legal system, with significant consequences for markets, government, and society. Law is being ‘Turing’d’; it is time to recognize the fact and to work to make the process as beneficial as possible”\n\nThe concept of smart contracts is widely believed to be conceived of by cryptographer Nick Szabo. “Smart Contracts: Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks was published by First Monday Peer-Reviewed Journal in September 1997. The abstract from this paper below explains what a smart contract is reads like it could have been written just yesterday:\n\n“Smart contracts combine protocols with user interfaces to formalize and secure relationships over computer networks. Objectives and principles for the design of these systems are derived from legal principles, economic theory, and theories of reliable and secure protocols. Similarities and differences between smart contracts and traditional business procedures based on written contracts, controls, and static forms are discussed. By using cryptographic and other security mechanisms, we can secure many algorithmically specifiable relationships from breach by principals, and from eavesdropping or malicious interference by third parties, up to considerations of time, user interface, and completeness of the algorithmic specification.”\n\nVermont’s track-record\n\nEarlier this year, state regulators forced Vermont's only Bitcoin ATM to shutter the machine because it was violating state law. However, Vermont Finance Commissioner Susan Donegan told Coindesk that Vermont doesn’t need a an equivalent of New York State’s BitLicense\n\nIn 2012, Jeremy Hansen, an assistant professor of computer science at Norwich University made headlines when his independent campaign for Vermont State Senate announced that he would accept bitcoin donations.\n\nIn 2014, John Ford of Vermont a self proclaimed “commoner, Fringe dweller, with interests in monetary reform” posted a manifesto of sorts entitled “Banking On A Altcoin For A Free Vermont” on his website Vermont Currency Commons.\n\nFord envisions a Vermont Coin or Vcoin and notes that “Vermont […] may have a(n) advantage in building out a fully distributed altcoin ecosystem due to its small size and the ability to innovate more cohesively.”\n\nThe same might be said of Vermont embracing the Blockchain. We’ll just have to wait and see how the Study and Report on Blockchain Technology plays out. Stay tuned.\n\nNote: Senator Balint and Professor Goodenough did not immediately respond to request for comment on this article."", 'UBS and Barclays are the front runners when it comes to experimenting with Ethereum, a new technology in the class known as Bitcoin 2.0, a source at Barclays told IBTimes.\n\nEthereum is a not-for-profit organisation which offers an open-source distributed computing platform plus a value token – ether – which can be mined by its network like bitcoin.\n\nThe Barclays source said what the banks were doing with Ethereum was not happening ""in any great depth"".\n\n""You are talking about 100 or 200 people that are building stuff with this and some of them are from banks,"" he said.\n\n""It\'s the beginning.

Ethereum for instance is not easy to debug. He said next generation ledger technologies can be tested as ""shadows"" alongside existing systems.\n\nAt a recent technology briefing on the eve of Ethereum\'s Frontier launch, communications officer Ken Kappler said the platform was ""the only game in town for banks looking to build blockchains"".\n\nNew \'bank-friendly\' version of Ethereum\n\nThe source also said Ethereum is working on another version of its platform which he said would be ""more amenable"" to banks, suggesting a nod in the direction of permissioned ledgers.\n\nHe said this technology was running alongside, but was not actually part of, the firm\'s Serenity roadmap. He said this would follow the same open access, not-for-profit strategy, like the rest of Ethereum.\n\nAn Ethereum spokesman said: ""There are several groups not directly affiliated with Ethereum investigating such a thing.""\n\nThe source continued: ""The whole value proposition here depends on banks being open and working together. They don\'t really do this. They seem to be worried about being competitive.

Previously with the bank’s mergers and acquisitions team, he became an executive director of credit quantitative modeling at Goldman, where quants like Schlaefer are highly valued.\n\nIn February he gave that up, and launched a company called Crypto Facilities Ltd, a bitcoin derivatives trading platform, which now has six employees. For now, the platform trades bitcoin forwards, which are directly linked to the price of bitcoin, but it’s also developing other digital currency derivative products.\n\n“This is uncharted territory,” said Schlaefer. “It’s an exciting opportunity to participate in a new area of technology that has massive potential.”\n\nBitcoin is a virtual or online currency created through a “mining” process where a computer’s resources are used to perform millions of calculations. Once mined, bitcoins can be stored in an online wallet, traded in an online exchange, or used to buy goods and services.\n\nOnce the province of small-time investors driven by their distrust of government-backed currencies, now Wall Street bankers and traders are leaving high-paying jobs to join bitcoin start-ups, while big firms hire in-house to get their arms around bitcoin and the related ‘blockchain’ technology.\n\n“A lot of people are entering the bitcoin space as the sector has reached an overall level of funding that’s hard to ignore,” said Jaron Lukasiewicz, founder and chief executive officer at New York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter. Lukasiewicz, 29, moved to the bitcoin world in late 2012, having left behind a six-figure salary in private equity at The CapStreet Group in New York.\n\nBitcoin is not backed by a government and its value fluctuates. On Thursday, it was trading at $278 BTC=BTSP, making the value of outstanding bitcoin worth about $4 billion. It has had a volatile history, with a rapid rally in 2013 that boosted its value to more than $1,150 per bitcoin at one point.\n\nRight now, Crypto Facilities’ Schlaefer probably won’t make anywhere near the kind of money that he would potentially earn at Goldman. But it’s less about the compensation for Schlaefer and more about being part of the growth in bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain - a ledger or list of all of a digital currency’s transactions - is viewed as bitcoin’s main technological innovation, allowing users to make payments anonymously, instantly, and without government regulation.\n\nSoftware engineers have started developing multiple applications for the blockchain, including a land title record system in Honduras to the clearing of trades in financial markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street firms are doing their own hiring in the cryptocurrency realm. In June, online bitcoin job ads surged to a record high of 306, according to data from Wanted Analytics, with demand coming from banks such as Capital One and tech companies such as Intel and Amazon. In previous months, Citigroup and TD Canada Trust posted bitcoin job ads as well.\n\nRISKY BUSINESS\n\nFor 31-year-old Paul Chou, founder and chief executive officer of Ledger X, an institutional trading and clearing platform for bitcoin options, moving into the digital currency space represents what he hopes results in lucrative profits down the road. But there are other reasons for his shift.\n\nLedgerX is awaiting regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to trade and clear options on bitcoin. Chou said the firm hopes to operate the first regulated exchange and clearinghouse to list and clear fully-collateralized, physically-settled bitcoin options for the institutional market.\n\n“I took a very large salary pay cut to do this, in return for equity in a start-up that can be worth a lot someday,” Chou said.\n\nBefore LedgerX, Chou worked at Goldman Sachs in New York as a quant equity trader after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with degrees in computer science and mathematics. Chou said his hours are much longer as an entrepreneur - he’s constantly refining ideas for strategy and thinking which areas to focus on.\n\n“The domain expertise, relationships, and career equity I’ve built are things I never could have done while at Goldman,” Chou said. “As a former trader, I‘m glad I made this trade-off at the stage of my career that I did.”\n\nIt’s a risky move, however. There are already several tales of bitcoin company failures and mismanagement.\n\nU.S. bitcoin marketplace Buttercoin, for instance, shuttered its operations in April this year despite raising $1.3 million in funding. Bitcoin exchange MyCoin closed its doors in February of 2015, leaving about 3,000 investors out of pocket.\n\nTokyo-based Mt. Gox, once one of the most dominant bitcoin exchanges, closed its doors without warning in February last year, filing for bankruptcy and leaving investors approximately $500 million in the red.\n\nBITCOIN INVESTMENTS, HIRING\n\nTotal investments in bitcoin companies for the first half of 2015 - totaling $375.4 million - have already exceeded 2014’s total of $339.4 million, data from CB Insights showed. Last year’s venture capital funding of bitcoin start-ups grew roughly 280 percent from 2013.\n\nThe number of bitcoin start-ups has increased by more than 80 percent from last year. As of end-July, there were 814 start-up digital currency companies, up from 444 a year earlier, according to Angel List, an online marketplace for start-ups seeking to raise money from angel investors.\n\nAs banks defer compensation and add more clawback provisions that give them the right to limit bonuses, traders are seeing better risk opportunities elsewhere, said San Francisco-based Rick Henri Chan, chief operating officer at Airbitz, a digital wallet platform.\n\nChan, 47, who joined the bitcoin industry three years ago, worked for Deutsche Bank as head of its over-the-counter derivatives technology in Japan, and was a trader at UBS and Morgan Stanley.\n\nHe works long hours at Airbitz, doing everything from strategy to raising money, but the work environment is more flexible. At Deutsche, Chan had a multi-million dollar package, and he admits to missing that paycheck.\n\n“But we’re doing something special here at Airbitz. And I do think our company will be valued at a lot more in the future,” he said.', 'ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BitPay, the world’s leading bitcoin payment processor, has recently announced several partnerships with payments companies from around the globe. During the first half of 2015, the company has signed deals with PSPs Payfirma, Sonic Payments, BillPro, Kadu, OpenPay, and Ixopay. These payments companies are based on three continents and, in total, serve more than 100 countries.\n\nBitPay’s recent partnerships have made it easier for thousands of companies to implement a bitcoin payment method directly through their PSP, without needing a separate solution. During the last two quarters, BitPay has seen interest in bitcoin increase exponentially from traditional payment companies. Some of BitPay’s recent partners have been happy to share why they feel bitcoin is such an important innovation for the payments industry.\n\nSonic Payments is a US-based payment processor that is revolutionizing the way property managers and landlords handle rent collections. In addition to supporting traditional payment methods like credit and debit cards, eChecks and ACH, Sonic has introduced all-new options, including the ability to pay rent with cash at major retail stores like 7-Eleven, Dollar General and CVS.\n\n""We believe in bitcoin\'s potential to be an integral part of the future of money, and we\'re excited to add it to our growing list of ways to pay. The rental space has been stagnant for far too long, but we\'re working with both property managers and DIY landlords to change that. Delivering the power to seamlessly accept digital currency as an alternative to traditional rent payment options is just one example of how we\'re driving innovation in this thriving market,"" Chris Cashwell, Founder and CEO of Sonic Payments.\n\nBillPro is one of Australia’s largest payment processors, whose management team has over 25 years of experience in the financial services industry, with merchants ranging in location from Australia, Europe, and Asia.\n\n“We had many clients asking for bitcoin services. After meeting BitPay and working with their team, we felt comfortable with moving forward with them because of their expertise in the space and their history of being a reliable and trustworthy company. We believe bitcoin will enhance our cross-border transactions greatly by lowering chargebacks while reducing fraud for our merchants,” Daria Rippingale, CEO of BillPro.\n\nIxopay is a distributing PSP in Europe and provides an all-in-one gateway solution for credit card and alternative payment methods around the world. With offices in Vienna, Los Angeles, and Orlando, IxoPay has access to a vast network of payment methods, acquirers, and service providers.\n\n""At IxoPay, we focus on finding just the right mix of local and alternative payment methods for our merchants; Bitcoin, as the first true global payment method, is a good fit for many of them, and we love how BitPay makes it easy to understand and accept the cryptocurrency,"" Gox Mailer, Strategic Advisor of IxoPay.\n\nBitPay’s expansion within the payments industry began with their existing partnerships with large players including PayPal and Neteller. Sonny Singh, Chief Commercial Officer of BitPay attributes the growth to a global interest in bitcoin.\n\n“We have seen dramatic growth in the bitcoin ecosystem over the past year. The US is no longer the only country where adoption is happening. Latin America and Asia have shown significant growth over the past six quarters, and we anticipate that there is considerably more potential for expansion in these regions. Payment service providers play a key part in the bitcoin ecosystem, and we are fortunate here at BitPay to be working with some of the biggest, most trusted companies in the industry.”\n\nAbout BitPay\n\nBitPay is the global leader in bitcoin payment processing with offices throughout North America, Europe, and South America. The company has raised over $32 million from top investors including Index Ventures, Founders Fund, and Sir Richard Branson.', 'Poland’s national airline LOT announced August 4 that airline tickets can now be purchased with bitcoin.\n\nLOT airlines is Poland’s state-owned carrier and still perceived by some as a non-innovative post-communist era relic. Now with the acceptance of bitcoin for ticket purchases, however, the company has entered a new world of digital payments. Tickets can be purchased on the airline’s website or via its mobile app. The transaction is “convenient and fully secure,” according to a press release.\n\nPart of the announcement reads:\n\n“The new payment method is addressed to everybody who has a Bitcoin wallet, and is an active user of this currency when doing the shopping online. Bitcoins can be used to pay for any LOT flight on the majority of the markets where the airline sells tickets.”\n\nHowever, LOT does not process bitcoins itself. When booking a ticket on its system, the passenger chooses their currency first, which is converted into bitcoin at the very last stage of the payment process via payment processor BitPay.\n\n“We go for innovations thanks to which [the customers’] journey is even more comfortable and pleasant not only on board, but also much earlier – at the stage of buying the ticket,” explained Jiri Marek, LOT Sales and Distribution Executive Director in the press release. “Many of them do the shopping online, including plane tickets.”\n\nLOT has also updated its website with the bitcoin logo, placed next to credit cards and other electronic payment methods. Marek continued:\n\n“It’s just a matter of time when payments with the online currency will become as popular as using credit cards today. We notice this potential, which is why we are one of the first airlines in the world to give its passengers the possibility of paying with Bitcoins as early as today.”\n\nLOT airlines, however, is not the first national air carrier to embrace bitcoin in the industry. Latvia’s Air Baltic was the first such carrier to make headlines back in 2014.', 'The Australian Tax Office (ATO) decided that bitcoin would be considered an intangible asset, which would double tax bitcoin. This was to be a huge inhibitor for bitcoin businesses operating within Australia\'s jurisdiction.\n\nThe main question that always surrounded the tax treatment of bitcoin was its legal characterisation. According to its guidance, the ATO was of the view that the digital currency is a legal form of property. From this flowed bitcoin’s tax treatment.\n\nAt the time the ATO had taken the view that bitcoin is a taxable supply for GST purposes. This created a fair amount of concern to those offering bitcoin as a means of payment. In the instance where they hold bitcoin and then wish to exchange it for fiat currency ‘double GST’ could have been applied.\n\n- CoinJar\n\nCoinJar appears to have made every effort to be compliant with the original guidance, however, the ATO’s ruling proved enough for the company to incorporate overseas. “On 1 December 2014, CoinJar relocated our headquarters to the United Kingdom as part of a global expansion that will provide customers more freedom to buy, sell and use bitcoin as a global digital currency. We are now officially incorporated as a UK company, CoinJar UK Limited, and have taken up residence in London\'s financial district,” said CoinJar\n\nAccording to the company\'s announcement, the move away from Australia would not only catalyse the growth of CoinJar, but their customers would no longer be subject to the taxation involved, “the UK relocation will mean CoinJar customers will no longer be subject to 10 per cent GST (Goods and Services Tax) when they buy bitcoin using our services. HMRC (Her Majesty\'s Revenue and Customs) in the UK exempts digital currency trading from value added tax (VAT), so new and existing CoinJar customers will not be levied any additional taxes.”\n\nThe UK Government has maintained a hands off approach to bitcoin. The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has been quite vocal on this front. In a speech last August he stated, “...with the right backing from government, I believe we can make London the Fin Tech capital of the world. For me this is not an add-on to what the City already does. It has to be what the City becomes in the future.”\n\nNow Australia wants to get back in the game. Labor Senator Sam Dastyari appears to be pushing regulators in the direction that the UK has taken. Dastyari warned Australian banks last year not to ""act like a bunch of ostriches"" by sticking their ""heads in the sand"" when coming to grips with bitcoin. He urged \xadcompanies to provide feedback to a \xadSenate inquiry, exploring how to regulate the highly volatile digital currency, and it appears the result may be in bitcoin’s favour.\n\nThe Senate inquiry is now set to re-align the guidance from the ATO. Bitcoin and other digital currencies are now to be treated the same way as traditional currencies, following expected proposals from the Australian government.\n\n""The opportunities for trade, investment, high salaries and world-leading skills are far more important [than any potential loss of revenue], and I urge the states to work with the Commonwealth to make what amounts to simple change,"" Dastyari, told the Australian Financial Review.\n\n- Senator Sam Dastyari\n\nThe Senate Economics References Committee ruling into digital currency, which is to be tabled this week, drew comment from Coinjars CEO and Co-Founder, Asher Tan. ""If it is defined as a global currency, this would be a positive step to encourage the bitcoin market to continue innovating."" He concluded that ""The Australian bitcoin market will significantly improve.""\n\nIt will be interesting to see the direction Australia chooses when moving forward with Bitcoin. If Australia wants to walk arm in arm with United Kingdom, other changes will also have to be addressed.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) recently lodged their second stop order against a Bitcoin company\'s IPO. This is the second issuance in a month against the Melbourne based mining operator Bitcoin Group Ltd, for undisclosed reasons. Bitcoin Group Ltd is not required to stop their IPO until a final notice is issued, however it isn’t a warm welcome for the startup.\n\nAustralia also has some regulatory issues surrounding the use of cryptography, a core component of the digital currency industry. The Defense Trade Control Act (DTCA) prohibits anyone without a permit from supplying technology on the Defense and Strategic Goods List to anyone outside of Australia. Since encryption falls within these classifications, any citizen of Australia who shares information on encryption with a person outside the country could face criminal charges.\n\nIt is apparent that Australia is changing its view on the digital currency industry, but much like New York and the BitLicense, improvements can be made.', 'Turns out that paying for your rent and other utilities with bitcoin is every easy with a private and simple method that has been right under our noses.\n\nPaying rent\n\nIf you are a hardcore Bitcoin fan, then Satoshi\'s brain child is much more to you then just a speculative investment, or a cool new kind of database. It is akin to a new country, the country of the sovereign international people of the Internet, or something like that. As such you want to get paid and pay for everything only with your crypto coins.\n\nOr maybe you are traveling to a third world country and want to minimize your exposure to the local currency.\n\nWell, there is a solution that’s been largely overlooked for paying rent or even your utility bills with bitcoin. This solution does not require you to ""convince your landlord to accept bitcoin,” and has been flying under the radar of Bitcoiners, until now.\n\nThe following method should work anywhere LocalBitcoins exists and where there\'s some kind of legacy payment system, be it M-pesa, Mexico\'s Spei, SWIFT etc.\n\n1. Learn about your landlord\n\nIf direct bitcoin deposit is a no-no for your landlord, then the next step is to ask them if you can pay them through a bank deposit. Chances are that your landlord has some kind of digital banking account, wherever you are, and if so, you can probably use this to pay him with bitcoin.\n\nOnce you know his preferred payment method, say through a bank deposit in the US, then you can move to the next step - finding the right bitcoin to fiat exchange.\n\n2. Choose your bitcoin exchange\n\nMost countries have at the least a LocalBitcoins community, which exchanges bitcoin for fiat through the use of various legacy payment methods like PayPal or Western Union. In most relatively developed countries there will be some kind of banking system which is being using to trade the currency and thus there is probably an exchange or two that trade bitcoin.\n\nIf using LocalBitcoins, make sure to research the payment method and educate your self on the precautions you need to take to avoid chargebacks and other risks.\n\nFind your exchange of choice, one that can do deposits into your landlord\'s preferred payment method and…\n\n3. Create a bitcoin exchange account for your landlord\n\nHere\'s the magic: if your landlord does not want to bother with bitcoin, that\'s OK! They don\'t have to. This does not mean you have to carry the burden of KYC regulations and its intrusive questions. Let those that want to use fiat and legacy banking give up their personal information, but you don\'t need to.\n\nFind out what authentication documents are required by the exchange to link the deposit account from your landlord. This will likely include some kind of bank to bank special account number as well as a copy of their government approved identification papers. Maybe it’s a picture of a passport or a driver\'s license.\n\nAsk your landlord for this information over Facebook if you need to, and given how normal it is for people to give their personal information, they\'ll probably hand it over. With this information, you can now host a bitcoin-to-fiat account for them on your chosen exchange.\n\nAlso note that this information will likely be enough to only deposit funds into their account. Withdraw details tend to be even more secure, requiring pins, in person withdraw requests, debit card numbers or other details, depending on your jurisdiction.\n\n4: Pay with bitcoin!\n\nOnce you\'ve created a bitcoin-to-fiat account on behalf of your landlord and verified it, you can easily pay with bitcoin without sacrificing your personal information or even touching fiat.\n\nIn fact, you may even be able to sway your landlord into paying all of your utilities with this method. This means you could pay for Internet, electricity, water and all that directly with bitcoin, through your landlord.\n\nNow deposit some bitcoin into that exchange, convert to fiat and deposit into their bank account!\n\nCongratulations, you\'ve reached Bitcoin wizard status.\n\n\n\n', ""With the marijuana industry growing across the United States and bitcoin slowly gaining popularity as a payment method, one startup is hoping to combine the two by creating a new weed delivery service. The company isn't stopping there with its innovative business model, Trees delivery service is also planning to drop pot at customers' doors using drones.\n\nDigital Deliveries\n\nOnce up and running, Trees says it will deliver marijuana to customers on the same day they order it. Customers can log in using a mobile or laptop and order without ever speaking to a person. The delivery will then be dropped off by a drone, eliminating the need for human interaction completely.\n\nBitcoin Payment\n\nTrees offers a range of marijuana kits that come complete with things like rolling paper, filters and of course, cannabis. The boxes cost between $99 and $149 and can be paid for using cash, credit card or bitcoin.

(NASDAQ: AMZN), who see drones as a good way to conduct cheap deliveries.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration regulations still require drones to be flown within the pilot's line of sight and strict rules about where and when they can operate have made it impossible for companies like Trees to use them. However, Trees says as the legislation changes, it will be working to develop its drone delivery system and hopes to roll it out as soon as possible."", 'Online survey giant Qualtrics has added bitcoin as a rewards option for consumers who respond to surveys and research requests issued by its enterprise clients.\n\nThe Utah company, which is valued north of $1bn following a $150m Series B in 2014, boasts more than 700 employees and investors including Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners. The offering was made possible by bitcoin payments processor SnapCard\'s recent integration with digital rewards platform Tango Card.\n\nConsumers who want to access the platform to obtain rewards points must first sign up to the service to begin taking surveys. Once Qualtrics users earn 50 points for their participation, they receive a Tango Card gift code, which can then be redeemed for Amazon and Target gift cards as well as bitcoin.\n\nQualtrics head of strategy and research Mike Maughan indicated that by offering bitcoin as a rewards option, he believes the company\'s clients will be more easily able to reach the increasingly important millennial demographic.\n\nMaughan told CoinDesk:\n\n""Millennials are most familiar with and most likely to be part of the bitcoin movement.

Led by Murgio (chapter president) and Aaron (secretary), dozens of fraternity brothers paid their way through school writing Google ads that persuaded people to click links for everything from dating websites to electronics. Working in shifts, the brothers brought in thousands of dollars a month in commissions. For Murgio and Aaron, college life was an education in making fast cash online.\n\nFederal prosecutors say the 31-year-olds have since used their skills unlawfully. In indictments unsealed on July 21, Murgio is accused of running a Bitcoin exchange that laundered money for hackers. Aaron is accused of a pump-and-dump scam that used expertly crafted spam e-mails to lure investors into worthless penny stock purchases, generating $2.8 million in illicit profits. Although those indictments don’t involve hacking, an FBI memo reviewed by Bloomberg also links the two men to last summer’s cyber attack on JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest bank hacks in U.S. history.\n\nNo one has pieced together how Aaron and Murgio may have gone from being promising business students to top-drawer cyber criminals, but there are hints of what may have happened along the way. Murgio racked up more than $500,000 in debt while trying to become a nightlife mogul, and Aaron moved to Israel and linked up with an alleged stock scammer.\n\nFriends and family say they’re shocked by the charges. “They were always very business-minded but always very ethical and good people,” says Drew White, a video producer and fraternity brother. Lawyers for Murgio declined to comment.

Aaron grew up in a brick colonial on a corner lot in the affluent Washington suburb of Potomac, Md. Murgio’s family home sits on an acre abutting a private 18-hole golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla. Aaron’s parents, Bob and Marsha, learned about the indictment hours after its unsealing and declined to comment. Murgio’s father, Mike, a former high school principal who serves on the county school board, said friends would vouch for his son’s “trustworthy and kind” character.\n\nBoth men had grown-up sensibilities at a young age, friends say: Neither did drugs, they were usually the designated drivers on nights out, and they were determined to become successful entrepreneurs. Murgio was outgoing and hammy, while Aaron was serious and reserved. In social media posts, Murgio called him “the Don.”\n\nAfter a brief stint selling kitchen knives door-to-door, Aaron introduced Murgio and their fraternity brothers to “affiliate marketing,” a then-nascent business in which they crafted Google ads for companies willing to pay for traffic, taking a cut when people clicked. Friends say it was a popular job on campus, and Murgio later wrote on a personal Web page that he’d “started working for major corporations. Was flown all over the world, taken out to dinners all day and night … lots of fun.”\n\nMurgio, who also built vacation-rental websites, later said he’d made $800,000 in college. He poured it into opening a restaurant and nightclub three blocks from campus after graduating in 2007. He was profiled in Tallahassee Magazine in 2010, and YouTube videos show long lines of students waiting to get into the club.\n\nAaron dropped out in 2005 and relocated to Miami, where he started a series of companies in pricey Palmetto Bay. Among them were a maker of air purifiers, a home-security business, and an Internet marketing firm. He and Murgio stayed close. “I still work with Josh, and we currently market many products on the Internet for various companies around the world,” Murgio wrote on his personal Web page in 2013.\n\nAaron left few traces online, unusual for an Internet marketer. His partner in a marketing firm he started in 2010 was a former securities broker previously banned for life by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for violations including marketing worthless technology stocks.\n\nAccording to Aaron’s indictment, a year after starting the firm he was deep in a stock-fraud scheme with an Israeli friend, which continued into this year. Aaron had moved to Israel and married a tax lawyer he met there. His bachelor party in Amsterdam reunited some of the frat brothers, including Murgio. The wedding was Sept. 10, 2014, two weeks after it became public that the FBI was investigating a breach at JPMorgan.\n\nStarting around 2010, Murgio’s nightlife business crumbled. He was in litigation with his landlord and was arrested in October 2011 after clashing with police over noise complaints. He filed for bankruptcy protection six months later, citing $545,000 in debt, and in early 2013 was arrested on charges that he stole $111,000 in unreported sales taxes his businesses collected. Murgio told friends it was a paperwork mistake, and the charges were dropped after he paid the taxes.\n\nMurgio and Aaron saw each other less after Aaron moved to Israel, but they did rendezvous in Russia\n\nSoon he was back on his feet. Murgio, who often posted about libertarian causes and uses a photo of himself with Ron Paul as his Facebook profile, registered the Coin.mx domain in October 2013 and started a Bitcoin exchange. “He is a bit ADD when it comes to new ideas. Comes up with a new one every day, then on to the next,” says Taylor Wilson, an ex-girlfriend. “He liked the idea of Bitcoin, liked the principle behind it, but I don’t know that it was his end-all. He is an entrepreneur, always will be.”\n\nProsecutors allege the Bitcoin exchange laundered illicit funds, including extortion payments made to hackers. In a 16-month period it exchanged a total of at least $1.8 million, according to court documents. “Anyone who really knows him believes this is all a misunderstanding,” Wilson says.\n\nNeither Murgio nor Aaron is accused of directly hacking JPMorgan. But the October FBI memo outlined some evidence linking them to the attack, including records of Aaron logging in to servers associated with the breach of the bank’s main data center, where the hackers made off with personal data of 83 million customers over three months. Only relatively low-value data were removed, such as names, addresses, and e-mail addresses—exactly what you’d want for a pump-and-dump scheme, say three people familiar with the investigation. A group of elite Russian hackers that the people say teamed with the Florida State alums appears to have done the actual hacking, and the FBI hopes to use Murgio and Aaron to build the larger case.\n\nMurgio and Aaron saw each other less after Aaron moved to Israel, but they did rendezvous in Russia. Murgio visited Moscow at least a half-dozen times starting in 2014, drawing puzzled notes from Facebook friends. Court documents show he was working closely with Russian payment processors. Social media posts show him in selfies drinking vodka and soda and posed in front of the Kremlin and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He partied at the City Space Bar on the 34th floor of the lavish Swissotel Krasnye Holmy in downtown Moscow, and he posted a photo of himself smoking a hookah. “Doesn’t get better,” he wrote in a caption. “If it wasn’t 25 degrees, I wouldn’t leave.”\n\nAaron and his wife also traveled frequently to Russia starting in 2015. In a photo posted on social media accounts this year, he’s wearing a Russian fur cap and posing in front of the Kremlin. He and his wife also drank at the City Space Bar. Aaron and Murgio met there in July. A photo shows them smiling as they dine along the Moscow River. Two weeks later, they were charged.\n\nMurgio was arrested in Tampa and is free on bond. Aaron’s whereabouts are unknown. Friends of both men say it’s unfathomable they would be involved in the crimes they’re accused of. “I’m still trying to wrap my head around it,” says frat brother White. “There must be something else going on here, or some kind of misunderstanding. They both just shared a passion for business.”\n\nThe bottom line: Murgio met bail. The whereabouts of Aaron, his fraternity brother and longtime collaborator, are unknown.\n\n(Updated to correct Phi Sigma Kappa's name in first paragraph)"", 'Bitcoin hoarding has been dubbed as one of the “major problems” hampering the adoption growth of this disruptive digital currency. While there are over 14 million bitcoins in circulation at the time of publication, only a fraction of that amount is changing hands on a regular basis. As a result, there are a lot of coins not moving to different owners, leading to various addresses “hoarding” bitcoins.\n\nAlso read: New Economy Movement Focuses on Equal Opportunities\n\nConsumers not Incentivized to Spend Bitcoin\n\n\n\nOne of the more common reasons for the Bitcoin hoarding problems can be blamed on lack of incentives for consumers to spend Bitcoin. While merchants are reaping the benefits from paying lower transactions fees on Bitcoin transactions, the everyday consumer is still paying the same amount for goods and services, rather than receiving a discount.\n\nOn top of that, the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin payments is still fairly low, despite that number increasing over time. Despite there being lower transactions fees for merchants, as well as the option to has Bitcoin transactions converted to fiat currency and receiving the money in their bank account the next business day, most people are still wary of Bitcoin.\n\nAt this time, the Bitcoin ecosystem is in a make-or-break phase. Either the number of transactions will continue to increase, regardless of incentives to spend BTC for goods and services, or the number of transactions will start to decrease very soon. Luckily for Bitcoin enthusiasts, the latter does not seem to be as worrying as it sounds, as more and more Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a quarterly basis.\n\nMerchant adoption is not the only factor influencing the Bitcoin hoarding issue, though. As long as the Bitcoin community can grow, there will always be enough reasons to send Bitcoin transactions to other people in the world. Loans, wages and even gifts in Bitcoin are a great way to support friends, family and loved ones.\n\nVarious companies around the world have been focusing their efforts on bringing Bitcoin — and blockchain technology — to all corners of planet Earth. Many people have limited to no access to a financial infrastructure, and Bitcoin could present a financial vehicle these people have been waiting for for a long time. But these companies are, in their own way, also a part of the Bitcoin hoarding problem.\n\nBitcoin Companies are Hoarding BTC as Well\n\n\n\nEvery Bitcoin company is earning their revenue in BTC directly, which is their main purpose of being active in the digital currency ecosystem. On top of that, most of these companies will pay their staff – either in full or partially – in Bitcoin as well, creating a list of transactions every month. As a result, Bitcoin companies are trying to fight the hoarding system in a way.\n\nBut here is the twist: there is always a portion of BTC left in the company’s wallets that are not being transferred. There is no reason to convert those Bitcoins to fiat currency when it’s not needed, but there are other expenses that can be paid with this BTC balance. One of those expenses is advertising and marketing, an area Bitcoin companies will have to work on if they want to help digital currency gain mainstream adoption.\n\nIt is no secret that Bitcoin has a serious PR problem, due to mainstream media associating the digital currency with fraud, scams and hacks all the time. Every Bitcoin company has the responsibility to help push Bitcoin awareness and adoption to new levels. Advertising and marketing efforts are the easiest way to do so, as these types of campaigns will attract new customers from all over the world.\n\nThere is an argument to be made on behalf of these companies as well, however. Various Bitcoin companies will not pay for advertising campaigns due to the low BTC price at this time. There is a certain merit to that statement, but the Bitcoin price will not increase as long as people keep hoarding coins either. “You have to spend money to make money” seems to be an appropriate saying in that regard.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Bitcoin companies affecting the hoarding problem?

08/07/2015,"['While banks and financial trading firms become more involved with bitcoin, a crop of youthful financial professionals is forsaking traditional careers and becoming cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, according to Reuters. Bitcoin is no longer strictly the province of small-time investors seeking an alternative to government-backed currencies.\n\nJason Lukasiewicz, 29, left a six-figure salary in private equity at The CapStreet Group in New York to move to the bitcoin world in late 2012. He is founder and CEO at Coinsetter, a New York-based bitcoin exchange.\n\nBitcoin Funding: Hard To Ignore\n\n“A lot of people are entering the bitcoin space as the sector has reached an overall level of funding that’s hard to ignore,” said Lukasiewicz.\n\nTimo Schlaefer, 34, had a doctorate in financial engineering and was working at Goldman Sachs in London. After working with the bank’s mergers and acquisitions team, he became an executive director of credit quantitative modeling.\n\nIn February, he left his promising position to launch Crypto Facilities Ltd., a bitcoin derivatives trading platform. The platform trades bitcoin forwards, which are directly linked to the price of bitcoin. It is also developing other digital currency derivative products. The company now has six employees.\n\n‘Uncharted Territory’\n\n“This is uncharted territory,” said Schlaefer. “It’s an exciting opportunity to participate in a new area of technology that has massive potential.”\n\nSchlaefer won’t make anywhere near the kind of money that he would potentially earn at Goldman in the near term. But for him, it’s less about the compensation and more about being part of the growth in bitcoin and its underlying block chain technology.\n\nMany Wall Street firms, meanwhile, continue to invest resources in cryptocurrency. Online bitcoin job ads in June surged to a record high of 306, according to Wanted Analytics. Banks such as Capital One and tech companies such as Intel and Amazon have placed ads. In previous months, Citigroup and TD Canada Trust also ran bitcoin job ads.\n\nPaul Chou, 31, worked at Goldman Sachs in New York as a quant equity trader after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with degrees in computer science and mathematics. He left that position to pursue a bitcoin career. Chou is the founder and CEO of Ledger X, an institutional trading and clearing platform for bitcoin options. He is awaiting regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to trade and clear options on bitcoin.\n\n“I took a very large salary pay cut to do this, in return for equity in a start-up that can be worth a lot someday,” he said. He said his hours are much longer as an entrepreneur. He is constantly refining ideas for strategy and thinking about which areas to focus on.\n\n“The domain expertise, relationships, and career equity I’ve built are things I never could have done while at Goldman,” Chou said. “As a former trader, I’m glad I made this trade-off at the stage of my career that I did.”\n\nThese entrepreneurs face risks, as not all endeavors have proven successful.\n\nButtercoin, a U.S. bitcoin marketplace, ceased operations in April after raising $1.3 million in funding. MyCoin, a bitcoin exchanged, closed in February of 2015, leaving about 3,000 investors out of pocket.\n\nMt. Gox, a once-dominant bitcoin exchanges, closed up shop without warning in February last year, filing for bankruptcy and leaving investors approximately $500 million in the red.\n\nAlso read: Wall Street Investment Firms Can’t Resist Bitcoin\n\nInvestment In Bitcoin Grows\n\nIn the first half of 2015, investment in bitcoin companies totaled $375.4 million, exceeding 2014’s $339.4 million, according to data from CB Insights. Venture capital funding of bitcoin start-ups increased about 280 percent in 2014 from 2013.\n\nBitcoin start-ups have increased by more than 80 percent from last year. By July’s end, there were 814 digital currency start-ups, compared to 444 the prior year, according to Angel List, which tracks start-ups seeking to raise money from angel investors.\n\nSome traders see better risk opportunities as banks defer compensation and add provisions that give them the right to limit bonuses, said San Francisco-based Rick Henri Chan, COO at Airbitz, a digital wallet platform. Chan, 47, worked for Deutsche Bank as head of its over-the-counter derivatives technology in Japan, and was a trader at UBS and Morgan Stanley before entering the bitcoin realm three years ago.\n\nHe had a multi-million dollar package at Deutsche and he now works longer hours.\n\n“But we’re doing something special here at Airbitz. And I do think our company will be valued at a lot more in the future,” he said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The man, from Kyoto, was seeking repayment of 458 bitcoins\n\nA Japanese court has ruled against a man hoping to claim compensation over lost bitcoins, saying the virtual currency cannot be owned.\n\nThe Kyoto man lost 458 bitcoins worth around 31 million yen (£160,000) following the collapse of the MtGox exchange last year.\n\nBut the Tokyo District Court said the currency was ""not subject to ownership"".\n\nConsequently, the lawsuit seeking repayment was dismissed.\n\nThe judge in the case, Masumi Kurachi, ruled that the Japanese law only allowed for proprietorship of tangible entities that occupy space and which allow for exclusive control over them.\n\nAs such, the virtual currency could not be owned.\n\nAn example given by the judge was that transactions between users must involve a third party and therefore exclusive control over bitcoins was not possible.\n\nLost Bitcoins\n\nThe MtGox exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February last year and reported that it had lost 850,000 bitcoins worth about £240m at the time.\n\nEver since, users whose bitcoins disappeared have been attempting to stand up legal cases in order to gain some form of compensation.\n\nA class-action lawsuit in North America over the MtGox catastrophe was settled out of court last year, for example.\n\nRecently, the former CEO of MtGox, Mark Karpeles was arrested in connection with the lost bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin developer Mike Hearn told the BBC he was a little surprised by the Tokyo court\'s ruling but added that there was still a great deal of confusion over the legal status of Bitcoin in many nations.\n\n""What\'s we\'ve seen a bunch of times is different governments in different parts of the world coming to different conclusions about Bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nHe commented that compensation claims over MtGox were unlikely to get anywhere, even with judicial endorsement.\n\n""It\'s quite obvious that MtGox doesn\'t have the money so where these compensation claims would be paid from is not clear,"" he explained.\n\nMr Hearn also said that the looming question mark over Bitcoin was beginning to harm the growth of the virtual currency.\n\n""One of the biggest and most common reasons especially for more established companies to say, \'we\'re not getting into Bitcoin\', is regulatory uncertainty,"" he said.', 'CodaPay, which names Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, Golden Gate Ventures and a Skype Co-Founder Toivo Annus as investors, offers a digital payment product designed for the Southeast Asia’s unbanked population. The company works with a number of big online companies in the region, including Baidu and Huawei.\n\n- Neil Davidson, CodaPay CEO\n\nBitcoin’s use a retail payment option was one of its early selling points. After a large spike in activity during 2013, and a number a multi-billion dollar companies signing on, it has largely fallen by the wayside.\n\nBitpay, one of the main pioneers of bitcoin retail payments, recently admitted this in an interview with Business Insider, customers aren’t taking to digital currency as they hoped. “It\'s going to take some time,” commented BitPay\'s co-founder and CEO Stephen Pair. “In the industry there’s a realisation that yes it’s an incredible technology but it’s going to take a while for it to mature.""\n\n""We keep adding merchants — we\'re up to over 60,000 now — but they\'re selling to the same pool of Bitcoin early adopters,” he added, noting that the startup is now looking into how its bitcoin payment technology could be used by banks.\n\nA recent post by BitPay revealed the number of merchant sign ups, and transaction growth for the first two years. While not particularly spectacular, the figures show solid growth in all regions. Asia saw minimal growth, where BitPay has limited operations, while Europe and North America were responsible for the vast majority of bitcoin transactions and new merchants.\n\nLatin America really shined, with 510% growth in BitPay’s second quarter. The result was in part due to the company enabling the first Latin American airline to accept bitcoin.\n\n- Bitpay\n\nLuno (formerly BitX), who is focused on bringing bitcoin to the developing world and already operates a number of exchanges in African and Asian countries, believes the same growth could be seen in Asia if properly pursued. Until recently, bitcoin payments have been largely unexplored in Asia, despite significant interest in bitcoin trading in countries like China and Singapore.\n\n“We’re seeing tremendous growth in bitcoin activity in Southeast Asia and we believe that bitcoin will play a significant role in enabling fast, cheap and safe online transacting for large segments of the population that were previously excluded from this market,” added Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of Luno. “We are particularly pleased to partner with Coda given their deep local knowledge and presence across multiple markets.”', 'UPDATE (10th August 10:16 BST): Since the publication of this article, bitcoin exchanges Kraken and Bitfinex have also confirmed they will not apply for a BitLicense to operate in New York.\n\nBitcoin businesses wanting to continue serving New York residents have approximately 24 hours left to file their BitLicense application.\n\nThe deadline, set for 8th August, marks the end of a 45-day grace period following the publication of the BitLicense in the New York State register.\n\nFormulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the long-awaited regulatory framework has proved divisive among companies in the space.\n\nThe question on many people\'s lips is: who\'s staying and who\'s going? With the deadline looming, CoinDesk has spoken to various industry players to find out just how the BitLicense will impact the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n\'A necessary evil\'\n\nNew Yorker Jesse Chenard, \u200eCEO at bitcoin exchange MonetaGo – which recently launched in 40 countries – confirmed his company submitted its 500-page-long BitLicense application earlier this week.\n\nThe lengthy application process – it took MonetaGo\'s legal team 30 days to prepare the submission – Chenard said, would constitute a barrier to some startups in the space.\n\nApplying for a BitLicense incurs a $5,000 non-refundable fee and companies may also face additional application charges set by the NYDFS. Applicants are also expected to submit a detailed background history of company employees, their financial and legal histories and outline their plans for operating their digital currency business.\n\nDespite this, the CEO noted that the BitLicense was a ""necessary evil"".\n\nHe added:\n\n""We see the BitLicense as a necessary step in the evolution of the bitcoin ecosystem. With regulation comes increased oversight and cost but also clarity. The list of bad actors in the early ecosystem was largely a result of lack of general checks and balances that most financial institutions have to live with.""\n\nChenard continued: ""With the BitLicense this brings us to the same standard [as other financial institutions].""\n\nFor Chenard, the increased scrutiny is part of the reality bitcoin currently finds itself in. ""As bitcoin becomes a tool for value transfer and more, over the next few years \u200bthe need for regulators to be able to track massive cash movements is imperative,"" he said.\n\nLooking to the future, the CEO hopes to eventually outsource some of MonetaGo\'s services to help fledging bitcoin businesses to prosper without having to make the leap for the license themselves, but still remain within the law.\n\nStaying in New York\n\nNew York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter, which acquired Canadian exchange Carvitex earlier this year, is also applying for a BitLicense.\n\nJaron Lukasiewicz, founder and CEO of Coinsetter, said the decision was motivated by the desire to maintain a solid footing in the state of New York and bring additional confidence to consumers.\n\nWith regards to the long-term impact of the BitLicense, Lukasiewicz said it was too early to tell, but noted the huge impositions of the regulatory framework for such a nascent industry as bitcoin.\n\n""Even though we are in the final stage of submitting our BitLicense application .... I believe that the majority of its impact is still ahead of us.""\n\nHe added: ""I personally do not believe that the industry\'s size justifies the regulatory requirements mandated by the BitLicense. That said, we are committed to operating in New York in a compliant manner and will strive to fulfill our obligations in the state.""\n\nSmall businesses\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, on the other hand, has decided to stop serving New York residents.\n\nThe decision, said Tristan D\'Agosta, founder and CEO, is due to the fact the BitLicense does not cater to small businesses such as Poloniex.\n\nHe added:\n\n""There are always pros and cons to regulations like BitLicense ... for a small business like ours, a $5,000 non-refundable application fee is a nonstarter. Consider what would happen if every state in the union followed suit – it would cost $250,000 just to apply for licenses in all fifty states. That\'s an enormous investment with no guarantee of obtaining a single license.""\n\n""We find ourselves in \'no man\'s land\', where we very much want to service our New York customers, but we are not big enough to qualify for a License,"" said D\'Agosta.\n\nAlthough the CEO said he empathised with state regulators – tasked with drafting and enacting laws to safeguard their constituents – to an extent, he believes that, like any industry, cryptocurrency has businesses of all shapes and sizes. ""BitLicense was not written with small businesses in mind,"" he concluded.\n\nIncreased costs\n\nPoloniex is not the only bitcoin business planning to cease operations in New York. For GoCoin, a digital currency payment gateway, the decision behind not applying is largely based on cost.\n\nSteve Beauregard, GoCoin CEO, told CoinDesk:\n\n""The volumes for bitcoin payment processing are so low, that going through the registration process will be more costly than the fees we would expect to earn from New York residents in the next two years or perhaps more.""\n\n""Eliminating a single state by geofencing is far more cost effective than going through the registration process and paying a fee that is more than we have made in revenue from any single state since the inception of the GoCoin business,"" he added.\n\nFor Beauregard, the BitLicense is about providing customer protection to people who are not actually requesting it. The regulatory framework, he said, was brought on largely by the failings of now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.\n\nIn terms of long-term impact, Beauregard said the BitLicense would effectively drive bitcoin businesses out of New York and the US in their quest for more welcoming jurisdictions. ""It is a shame to see government stomping on innovation at a time when many financial systems around the world are failing.""\n\nHe concluded: ""The US government and large merchants have shown they cannot effectively safeguard our personal and financial information. Now an invention [bitcoin] comes along that helps to solve the problem, and this BitLicense regulation seeks to carry on the legacy of failure to protect the very people it claims to be serving by applying the old rules to this new technology.""\n\n\'Orwellian\' requirements\n\nErik Voorhees, CEO of digital currency exchange ShapeShift has spoken out against the BitLicense in the past and confirmed his company would stop offering its services to residents based in New York during an interview with the New York Post.\n\nSpeaking at the time, Voorhees said the customer data requirements imposed by the BitLicense were ""Orwellian"".\n\nThe bitcoin scene is showing clear signs of division, with some companies continuing to keep a stronghold in the Big Apple and others packing up and leaving.\n\nAlthough the extent of the BitLicense\'s true impact is yet to be determined, it is fair to say it will leave some New York residents with fewer bitcoin-related options.\n\nFurther Reading: Buy Our Bitlicense Research Report\n\nHourglass image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But haven’t we been here before?\n\nHaving made a splash last year, Qora, a platform that promised an impressive set of 2.0 features as a social network, faltered and then crashed into obscurity. Launched on 16 May 2014, the then new protocol had been designed to address and solve Bitcoin’s biggest problems whilst adding new features.\n\nA press release from July 2014 disseminated by the organization proclaimed that: “Qora promises to be the best hope for the future of cryptocurrency” and the Qora Community was “poised to gain market share in the current slew of altcoins [i.e. cryptocurrency] as a result of number of innovative features and fast-moving development processes.\n\nThe statement added: “While most other cryptocurrencies have been built on Bitcoin’s code, Qora was built from the ground up in Java, using native C libraries to perform the most CPU-intensive tasks.” It was noted too that whilst Bitcoin was popular, it has been “mirred in conceptual flaws” that cause its value to fluctuate wildly.\n\nNow however with a new development team, new marketing and further additions to its protocol by implementing a Turing-Complete smart contracts mechanism and a databases management system - empowering the whole infrastructure - Qora provides users many more tools than ordinary payments that a simple wallet can facilitate. “It could be the phoenix of crypto” according to Ronny Boesing, CEO of CCEDK. Well, that’s the hope anyway.\n\nFounded in 2014, CCEDK is a platform upon which buyers and sellers meet and transact their business directly with the new digital currency Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc., with the Danish exchange acting as intermediary between parties. Additionally they offer fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies like BitUSD and Nubits offering users leverage to reduce volatility risk in their trading activities.\n\nQora is touted as a ‘proof-of-stake’ coin that requires no miners - thereby aligning the interests of coin holders with those who secure the network. Some of the features include trading assets for assets and multi-dividend payments for asset holders.\n\nBoesing explains: “Its development roadmap included an asset exchange for crypto-stocks; aliasing (a way to associate information with strings of characters, which enables all kinds of applications including decentralized DNS registration); decentralized voting; encrypted or plain-text arbitrary messages, and more.” Qora, which has been added to the Danish exchange’s range of currencies, will trade against BTC and three fiat currencies - US dollar, Euro and Chinese Renminbi.', 'Xapo CEO Wences Casares has been one of Bitcoin’s strongest supporters since 2011, but not many people have heard the story of how he originally got into this new form of digital money.\n\nThe Argentinian-born entrepreneur has been able to create one of the most well-capitalized companies in the space, and he was able to mystify the likes of Dick Costolo, Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and other Silicon Valley giants by transferring roughly $250,000 worth of bitcoin between multiple smartphones within a matter of minutes. But what led Casares to Bitcoin in the first place?\n\nTrying to Send Money to Friends in Argentina\n\nUnlike many of the Bitcoin proponents who talk about how the digital money is going to change the world without having their own, personal need for it, Casares came across Bitcoin while attempting to send money to childhood friends in Argentina. The Xapo CEO explained the process of finding out about Bitcoin on arecent episode of EconTalk:\n\n“I first learned about Bitcoin in 2011. I live in California, in Palo Alto, and a group of childhood friends from Argentina were doing a project where we needed to send money to that project. And I couldn’t send money from California to Argentina, so I was looking to see if my sister, who’s there, could give the friends some money and I could pay her later. And one of my friends – who’s not tech savvy or financially savvy – said, ‘Hey, why don’t you use Bitcoin?’”\n\nGiving Bitcoin a Chance\n\nAlthough Casares admits he was skeptical at first, he decided to give Bitcoin a chance as a new international payment mechanism. He described the entire process of using Bitcoin to send money to his friends in Argentina in his recent EconTalk interview:\n\n“So, I was curious and I looked [it] up online, and, I think on Craigslist, I found someone who was willing to meet with me at the cafe in Palo Alto and gave me some bitcoin and I gave them the cash. Then, I just got the bitcoin on my cell phone and I sent them to my friend in Argentina and the next day he has . . . [Argentine] pesos. And I just couldn’t believe what happened.”\n\nMany bitcoiners remember the first time they used the digital money because it is a strange feeling to have actual value stored on an electronic device as a string of bits.\n\n“I felt like I was witnessing the beginning of the Internet. It was that kind of fascination,” Casares said.\n\nAbra is the Mainstream Version of Casares’s 2011 Experience\n\nWences Casares’s story has been repeated many more times all over the world since 2011, and there is now an app that captures the essence of that experience in a user-friendly manner. Abra allows users to send digital cash to anyone else in the world, and that digital cash can then be transferred to local currency via a peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer.\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the app is that it also locks the value of the digital cash to U.S. dollars, which means users don’t need to worry about bitcoin’s price volatility for the duration of the transfer. Abra is powered by smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAbra is just now coming to market, but Casares already experienced this new phenomenon four years ago. As time goes by, we will continue to see more apps developed that were first thought of in the early days of IRC chatrooms and bitcointalk.org threads.\n\nPhoto Christopher Michel / Flickr', 'With assistance from Joseph Bonneau, Lee Tien, and Jamie Williams\n\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto would never have qualified for a license under California’s proposed virtual currency regulation\n\nA.B. 1326 (Dababneh) is a bill that would require “virtual currency businesses” to apply for and obtain a license in order to offer services in California, and it includes significant fees and administrative hurdles. Unfortunately, the bill’s language is so vague that it’s unclear what companies are, in fact, “virtual currency businesses.” So in spite of carve-outs for smaller companies and for software developers who don’t exercise control over the currency, the proposal threatens the future of virtual currency experimentation and innovation in the state.\n\nThe bill has percolated in the California legislature for months. EFF has been engaged with the author of the bill, explaining our concerns, opposing the bill, and helping to strip out some of the worst elements of the initial text.\n\nBut the time for conversation is over: the bill is moving ahead for a vote in the next few weeks, and it still has huge problems. We’re urging concerned Californians to speak out against this legislation by calling, emailing, and tweeting at their state elected officials immediately. Please speak out now.\n\nWe have philosophical issues with A.B. 1326—both the type of regulatory scheme it’s proposing as well as the timing of this regulation in relation to the development of new virtual currency technologies—and we also have concerns about how the bill is technically written. Here’s an overview of our concerns, starting with the larger philosophical issues:\n\nThe regulation is premature; digital currency is an industry in its infancy.\n\nWhile we sympathize with the ideals behind the legislation—protecting consumers—we fear this bill will have unintended long-term consequences that hurt consumers more than it helps. We don’t know what the future of cryptocurrencies will look like, but this legislation locks in a burdensome regulation before we know either where the technology is headed or what its likely uses will be. We’ve seen this happen before in the technology policy space. In 1986, Congress rolled out an email privacy law known as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). While it was forward-thinking at the time, it didn’t envision that people would store years of email in free webmail services, and as a result ECPA has weak privacy protections for emails stored with a service provider for more than 180 days. We’ve spent more than a decade combating ECPA’s obsolete assumptions about email use, arguing that law enforcement can’t access emails in the cloud without a warrant even if they are older than 180 days. We’re still fighting in Washington to update the law. Years of battling over email privacy law could have been averted if the law wasn’t tied to a specific moment in the early development of email technology. Virtual currencies are developing as quickly—or even more quickly—than email was back in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. Let’s make sure that a forward-thinking law aimed at protecting consumers doesn’t have unintended negative consequences in the future as the technology changes, like ECPA did. That means watching the early development of technology before rushing in to regulate and being extremely cautious about adopting clear, narrowly tailored, and accurate legal definitions of technological terms relating to crypto currencies. As we explain below, A.B. 1326 fails in these respects.\n\nWhile we sympathize with the ideals behind the legislation—protecting consumers—we fear this bill will have unintended long-term consequences that hurt consumers more than it helps. We don’t know what the future of cryptocurrencies will look like, but this legislation locks in a burdensome regulation before we know either where the technology is headed or what its likely uses will be. Having different regulations for cryptocurrencies in every state will create confusion for consumers.\n\nThis bill is attempting to regulate virtual currency businesses that maintain “full custody or control of virtual currency in this state on behalf of others” (emphasis added). Not only is this language vague, but virtual currencies transcend state borders. As a result, pretty much all virtual currency businesses would have to either cut off California customers or seek a license in the state. But this won’t stop with California. New York has already adopted digital currency regulations, and we’ve seen regulatory proposals elsewhere. Lobbyists have described A.B. 1326 as model legislation that could be replicated in other states. This could create wildly different standards for individual users, who may not know what rights they have and what legal protections exist. Even lodging a complaint could be confusing, with different regulatory bodies and processes in every state. Strong state laws are often appropriate and can help establish rights for individual consumers—such as in the case of data breach notification and health privacy laws. But banking regulation is already an amalgamation of confusing standards. (As Rose Marie Kushmeider describesit for the FDIC Banking Review: “the overlap in tasks among federal regulators and between federal and state regulators, particularly for banks, creates a confusing system that no one building a system anew would want to duplicate.”) Adding state regulations for cryptocurrencies will only exacerbate the complexity of regulatory standards, leaving consumers in a miasma of legal uncertainty. At the end of the day, cryptocurrencies are distributed software projects that can be accessed from across the world. They shouldn’t be regulated like brick-and-mortar businesses that serve a specific locality or community.\n\nThis bill is attempting to regulate virtual currency businesses that maintain “full custody or control of virtual currency on behalf of others” (emphasis added). Not only is this language vague, but virtual currencies transcend state borders. As a result, pretty much all virtual currency businesses would have to either cut off California customers or seek a license in the state. The bill could chill virtual currency innovation in California.\n\nThe bill is designed for established Bitcoin businesses—companies with the significant financial and administrative resources needed to navigate the licensing process. Compliance requires substantial nonrefundable fees for registration and for examination. The bill proposes a carve-out for startups and small companies, but as we explain below, that carve-out is woefully inadequate to protect the rights of hobbyists and innovators. This means that California consumers might not benefit from groundbreaking new developments in the virtual currency space, as a complicated and burdensome regulatory process scares off potential innovators. This would be at odds with a state that has long been a haven for innovation and experimentation, and which currently has a thriving community of virtual currency enthusiasts and companies.\n\nWe also have concerns about how the bill was drafted. The bill language indicates technological ignorance about cryptocurrencies, indifference to due process for license applicants, and inadequate safeguards for hobbyists and innovators in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe bill’s definition of “virtual currency businesses” is vague, so it’s impossible to tell what the bill will do.\n\nAs mentioned, the bill defines “virtual currency business” as “maintaining full custody or control of virtual currency in this state on behalf of others.” But the bill doesn’t explain what it means to have “full custody or control” of a virtual currency or what it means for a virtual currency to be located “in this state,” and the drafters have so far refused to further define these terms. As is, this bill could be applied far too broadly, such as to smart contracts.\n\nAs mentioned, the bill defines “virtual currency business” as “maintaining full custody or control of virtual currency in this state on behalf of others.” But the bill doesn’t explain what it means to have “full custody or control” of a virtual currency or what it means for a virtual currency to be located “in this state,” and the drafters have so far refused to further define these terms. As is, this bill could be applied far too broadly, such as to smart contracts. The application requires irrelevant data from the applicants, and applicants can be denied a license with no explanation with limited opportunity to appeal.\n\nTo qualify for a virtual currency license, applicants have to turn over extensive data. For any entity applying for a license, the following must be provided for every officer, manager, director, or “person that has control” (another term that is not defined, as discussed in more detail below): Legal name Any fictitious or trade name Home and work address Employment history for 10 years Any criminal convictions and material litigation in the last 10 years Educational background There is a range of problems inherent in this type of data collection. First, a lot of this data simply isn’t relevant to whether a virtual currency is well-run and protecting consumers. The rule requires applications to include convictions for nonviolent drug offenses, peaceful protests, or reckless driving. Being a college dropout might also crop up. Will these things bar the applicant from receiving a virtual currency license? Will having five different employers in a 10-year period be a black mark on an application? Nobody knows. Because while the virtual currency license is very clear on the data that must be handed over to the commissioner, there’s little information about why an application could be rejected. If an application is rejected, there’s no inexpensive administrative appeal option, and the commissioner isn’t required to provide any report to the denied applicant. In fact, the commissioner doesn’t even have a specific time period in which he must respond. Applications can languish unresolved—indefinitely. This type of data collection could also deter innovators and developers who prioritize privacy and security. Many with a deep passion for privacy might not want to hand over all this data to the government, either because it’s invasive or because they fear that the government databases storing the data won’t be secure. People who might bring powerful innovation to the virtual currency space—especially those who might be most interested in privacy-protective features—may well steer clear. A prime example? Satoshi Nakamoto—the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin—never provided his home address, employment history, or educational background. Satoshi would never have qualified for a license under California’s regulatory proposal unless he sacrificed his much-guarded privacy.\n\nTo qualify for a virtual currency license, applicants have to turn over extensive data. For any entity applying for a license, the following must be provided for every officer, manager, director, or “person that has control” (another term that is not defined, as discussed in more detail below): The commissioner has complete discretion to revoke licenses.\n\nThe commissioner can revoke a license for a wide range of reasons. This means the commissioner, at his sole discretion, can choose to favor some virtual currency services over others, which builds a lot of ambiguity into the bill. Reasons for revocation include: If a licensee doesn’t “cooperate” with an investigation or examination. If the commissioner believes that the “competence, experience, character or general fitness” of the licensee or any director, officer, employee (yes, employee ), or person “in control of a license” indicates that “it is not in the public interest” to allow the person to provide virtual currency services.\n\nThe commissioner can revoke a license for a wide range of reasons. This means the commissioner, at his sole discretion, can choose to favor some virtual currency services over others, which builds a lot of ambiguity into the bill. Reasons for revocation include: The provisional license is no panacea.\n\nThe bill has a carve-out for small businesses and startups, whereby they can get a provisional license for two years for only $500 (instead of the typical $3,500 application fee and $2,500 renewal fee). To be clear, we’re glad this carve-out exists. But this isn’t a cure-all for the things wrong with the proposal. The commissioner has an amazing amount of discretion with the provisional license, just as he does with the primary virtual currency license, so it’s ambiguous who will even qualify for a provisional license and how it will operate. Qualifying for the carve out might be harder than it seems: to qualify for the carve-out, a business must both be conducting business with less than $1 million in outstanding obligations and have a business model that the commissioner decides at his sole discretion represents “low or no risk to consumers.” Both of these criteria are troubling. First, this regulation fails to take into account how volatile virtual currency markets can be, as they are driven entirely by market interest. One could easily imagine spikes in the market creating obligations of over a million dollars that lasted mere days. If this happens, the business has a mere 15 days to notify the commissioner and then must apply for a virtual currency license within 30 days. Similarly, the smallest company in the world might not qualify for the provisional license if the commission decides it is a “risk” to consumers. Since virtually all cryptocurrency businesses carry some risk to somebody, this exception could swallow the provisional license provision entirely. Just like the virtual currency license, qualifying for the provisional license may require detailed personal data. It’s unclear from the bill whether the provisional license applicants must turn over all the data that are necessary to apply for the regular virtual currency license. It almost doesn’t matter, because the commissioner can always requests more “reports and documents” and may audit the provisional license applicants at will—raising the same data collection concerns that exist with the full license.\n\nThe bill has a carve-out for small businesses and startups, whereby they can get a provisional license for two years for only $500 (instead of the typical $3,500 application fee and $2,500 renewal fee).

The commissioner has an amazing amount of discretion with the provisional license, just as he does with the primary virtual currency license, so it’s ambiguous who will even qualify for a provisional license and how it will operate. The legislation is technically inaccurate. The bill defines a virtual currency business as “maintaining full custody or control of virtual currency in this state on behalf of others.” Not only is this vague and overbroad, but it also does not reflect how many virtual currencies actually function. For example, what constitutes being “in this state” is unclear. Virtual currencies don’t exist in a single physical location. Instead, cryptocurrencies’ “existence” often reflects the location where keys are stored—which might be in the cloud, on a server in your house, or in several other geographic places all at the same time!In addition, the question of who maintains “full custody and control” of virtual currencies will likely prove to be complicated and implicate multiple parties specified in a “smart contract.” To dive into the technology for just a moment: new cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum allow arbitrarily complicated user-written contracts to be written in a form of code to determine who controls a given unit of the currency. Due to the classic Halting Problem in computer science, it is in fact impossible to always determine which parties may be in control of currency in such a system. The vague language of the bill will undoubtedly leave those in the virtual currency space unclear about their obligations, and may also deter those who are thinking about getting involved in the nascent industry. The bill often refers to a “person in control,” a “person in control of a licensee,” or a “person that has control.” These traditional concepts do not easily translate to the world of virtual currencies. In cryptocurrencies, it is keys—not people—that dictate control. A server holding Bitcoin keys can run some software and make automated decisions to move money without any individual signing off on it. Is the person in control the individual who installed and configured all the software? Or does the term refer to somebody with higher-level administrative control to set policy? The term “person in control,” as it is currently used, is vague and not reflective of the technical complexity of virtual currencies. The bill forces all virtual currency companies that get a license to provide a disclosure statement to consumers. The statutorily mandated disclosure is written to be specific to Bitcoin—despite that there are and will be many other types of digital currencies. Yet despite its focus on Bitcoin, its description of how Bitcoin works is just wrong . For example, it requires a company to state: “once submitted to the network, a virtual currency transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time (usually less than one hour, but up to a day or more) pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the network.” However, there is no fixed amount of time after which a Bitcoin transaction is definitively “confirmed”; six confirmation blocks (roughly one hour on average but highly variable) is simply a popular choice. Even worse, this language is completely inaccurate for many other types of cryptocurrencies. Some popular currencies ( e.g ., Litecoin) use the same model as Bitcoin, but with 10 times faster the “confirmation.” For other virtual currencies (such as Stellar, Ripple, or Tendermint), the notion of confirmation time is completely different; transactions are confirmed within seconds . More generally, it is a mistake to mandate this kind of technical description given the large variety of possible technical designs.\n\nIt’s bad for video games.\n\nThe bill attempts to exempt video game currencies from regulation. However, many video game currencies would still fall within the regulation. The bill states that “Virtual currency does not include ... Digital units that are used solely within online gaming platforms with no market or application outside of those gaming platform.” This exception only applies to trade of digital artifacts that have no value whatsoever outside of the game. But any game currency that can be shared, traded, or gifted among users may result in market value outside the game, whether or not the company’s terms allow for these transactions. Because the definition of “virtual currency business” includes maintaining full custody of the currency, this bill could require any video game company that offers an in-game currency that can be traded externally to get a license.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWe recognize that the most recent draft of the legislation is greatly improved over earlier drafts, and we appreciate that the author of the bill has made adjustments to address many of our original concerns. We also share the California legislature’s concerns about consumer welfare during the rocky and unpredictable rise of cryptocurrencies. But rather than rushing to adopt comprehensive regulations, the legislature should carefully observe the landscape as it develops This would allow the legislature to better address a wider range of virtual currency models and challenges.\n\nIn the meantime, there are immediate ways to protect consumers. This could include public education campaigns, working with virtual currency services to improve security practices to avoid malicious hacking, and convening virtual currency companies to help create self-regulatory standards that prioritize protecting consumers, privacy, and freedom.\n\nIf you are in California, please speak out against this bill.', 'As any Bitcoiner will tell you, you can buy almost anything for Bitcoin.

The New York musician is the woman behind the first ever artist coin. Her forthcoming LP will be the first funded entirely in cryptocurrency form.\n\nMoroz, who graduated from Berklee College of Music, has independently released two LP’s, two EPs, and several singles. She releases her forthcoming, third LP in Fall 2015. Her latest project, Tatiana Coin, allows her to work together with her fans to bring them what they want. Moroz believes there are incredible opportunities to use block chain technology in music.\n\nBlock Chain + Music = Artist Empowerment\n\n“There are lower processing fees, the ability to micro-tip, and, of course, create artist tokens as I have done,” Moroz told CCN.\n\nProjects like Ascribe.io can revolutionize the digital rights management process, so it rewards all artists quickly and equitably.\n\n“There are ways to track streaming and use of digital music being developed,” she said. “Overall, I think the block chain can bring fans and artists closer together, as well as save the artists money on administrative expenses, freeing resources for making more music.”\n\nMoroz launched Tatiana Coin last year. She raised funds in June of 2014, and, with the help of Adam B. Levine from Let’s Talk Bitcoin, Moroz executed the idea. Tatiana Coin used Counterparty for the coin and organized a crowd-sale through CoinPowers.\n\n“I considered myself the willing guinea pig, providing real feedback on what an artist would want and also making sure that things were easy enough to understand,” Moroz, also the founder and CEO of Crypto Media Hub, said. Her coin is different from other altcoins: She considers the coin a ‘meta-coin’ since it derives value from the content Moroz creates.\n\n“I wanted to be sure that there wasn’t any pumping and dumping, as that defeats the point,” Moroz told CCN. “I was lucky that the people helping me were ethical and totally on the same page with that.” Despite a great team, there have been hurdles for the artist.\n\n“I didn’t know what I was getting into, and it isn’t a matter of just creating the coin. You have to make it easy for people – especially non-Bitcoiners – to participate,” Moroz explained. “You also have to have a place where people can use it.”\n\nCoinPowers Disappears\n\nWhen CoinPowers closed unexpectedly in November, one of the main components for the coin’s functionality – having a place to use the coins – was eliminated. For her, the hard work was worthwhile.\n\n“Artist tokens seem to be the most accessible way to involve the creative community with Bitcoin,” Moroz said. “It’s a longer term relationship than just a regular Kickstarter type campaign.” Moroz believes artist tokens allow an artist to connect with fans directly, and provide rewards to those who followed an artist from the beginning.\n\n“The journey of an artist is an incredibly dramatic one,” Moroz admits. “We feel things keenly, and it can be very challenging. Knowing exactly who your fans are and getting their support, not only financially, but almost as members of your tribe through a token system, is truly encouraging.” Coin holders can also offer artists feedback on marketing, Moroz points out.\n\n“I think the fans enjoy Tatiana Coin, too,” Moroz adds. “It’s like a fan club with rewards, but coinified.”\n\nWith the token sale, Moroz collected enough money to fund her forthcoming third LP. While recording the album, she paid her musicians and engineer in Bitcoin. She even signed up the studio where she recorded the album, Premier Studios in New York, to accept Bitcoin. As far as she knows, the album will be the first ever funded completely through digital currencies.\n\nWhile her album is recorded, recording can be but a small part of the total sum when it comes to releasing recorded music. Some mainstream labels spend more than a million dollars on marketing an album alone.\n\nTo that end, Moroz is still offering tokens. Levine and Tokenly have designed a wallet as a Chrome extension for the coin and, on her website, one can purchase Tatiana coins with a credit card. Moroz did not design Tatiana Coin solely for digital music. She can also sell autographed albums, personal concerts, and even consult other artists in exchange for the artist coin.\n\nIn the future, I would love to be able to incentivize my fans to share my music on social media by rewarding them with Tatiana Coin. Throughout history, music, and the arts have been a way of speaking for the people. Artists can influence culture and show the truth in a way that can’t be said by people in other professions.\n\n“There is a great power in the emotional connection to music that transcends lines of color, language, and class. As a musician, I strive to connect with other humans and hopefully make a positive impact on the world.” She loves Bitcoin for idealistic reasons, ones that mesh with her musical aspirations.\n\n“Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can be a great liberator of untapped talent and productivity around the world,” Moroz told CCN. “It’s a way to fight poverty through empowerment, and a way to educate people on the truth about the modern banking system.”\n\nIt’s not only the modern banking system the musician and businesswoman opposes.\n\n“When I use Bitcoin, I can withdraw support for the war machine by starving it of its lifeblood, the inflated US dollar,” she said. “At the least, it provides competition to the antiquated systems of old and encourages transparency. It is all-inclusive and fair.” For this reason, Moroz penned ‘The Bitcoin Jingle.’ While others develop apps to change the world, Moroz believes there is a place for music towards the same pursuit.\n\nSupport for Ross Ulbricht\n\n“I think connecting with people on an emotional level may be a better way when combined with advances in the tech,” she said. “Red Bull has a recording studio. Why? It’s not because they need to make music. It’s because they realize music ‘makes them cool’ and gives them street cred.” Moroz envisages a new music studio model based on cryptocurrency. It’s her Libertarian background that led to these views on the future of music, as well as to write the song, ‘The Silk Road.’\n\nAlso read: Lyn Ulbricht Sounds the Alarm About Government Abuse in the Digital Age\n\n“I wanted people to understand the very real struggle for freedom. I wanted to bring a semblance of sanity and compassion and help people to see that the prison population is not all murderers and rapists,” the artist says. “They are flawed people with problems.” Ulbricht inspired Moroz.\n\n“Ross did a very brave thing and did it because he thought it was the right thing to do,” she adds. “That kind of character is rare.”\n\nAs a singer-songwriter, there have been many frustrating moments in Moroz’s career due to the nature of the music industry. Part of the reason for her lack of success early on, she believed, was her lack of resources.\n\n“I used to be the manager at several high-end recording studios, and I used to get depressed listening to the music coming from the rooms,” Moroz told CCN. “The artists who were often funded had a lousy message and weren’t the best talent. Meanwhile, great artists weren’t able to get signed because the industry only wanted 14-year-old artists who were easy to manipulate.” Technologies like BitTorrent, in a way, did a disservice to independent artists.\n\n“The advent of illegal downloading sucked the money out of the system making it harder and harder to compete.” For Moroz, music always provided her great comfort and guidance. In her opinion, over time, the quality of music has declined. So has the message.\n\nEditor’s note: Tatiana Moroz contacted us and asked us to clarify that her belief is that digital music piracy “made it harder” for the music industry in general, not just independent artists like herself.\n\n“The messages usually encourage the basest behaviors,” the artist said. “This is so discouraging to someone like me who grew up influenced by the singer-songwriters of the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s and 1970s.” Moroz is skeptical of modern airwaves.\n\n“Today’s music is basically about glorifying violence and an expensive party lifestyle that no one can afford,” the indie artist noted. “I am not a prudish person by any stretch, but why is almost every music video a porno? This music doesn’t resonate with the soul; it’s vulgar stupidity.”\n\n“Indie music is the lifeline of music,” she added. “It is empowering, but difficult to maintain.” For music to reach its true pinnacle, Moroz believes something must change. Hence, TatianaCoin.\n\n“If you are not wealthy, then you have to have a full-time job, and then when you get home, you have to have the energy to create,” she told CCN. “That would maybe be manageable, but there are recording costs, artwork, marketing expenses, attorneys, and the conceptualization and execution of a strategy.”\n\nAlso read: Interview with 22Hertz, the Band Who Put a Song on the Bitcoin Block Chain\n\n“Getting a manager isn’t easy, and of course you have to worry about getting screwed over left and right,” she said. “All of this can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars at a minimum. Most artists are not business people, and even for someone like me who is business-minded, it’s simply too much. That stress alone is enough to kill creativity.”\n\n“The possibilities are endless,” she said. “My only concern is that the benefits of block chain technology will be utilized only by the big companies. The Tatiana Coin concept is about the indie artist, it’s about freedom, and that is something that I hope can benefit all artists, not just the industry that eats them for breakfast.”\n\nHowever, in Moroz’s opinion, the industry is necessary. “We need people to help artists flourish and to manage all the other aspects that go into making a successful career. Hopefully with these developments, a more equitable, transparent, and efficient system can be put into place.”\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Tatiana Moroz.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Vitalik Buterin is a programmer and writer. He founded Ethereum, a decentralized web 3.0 publishing platform, for which he won the World Technology Award in 2014. In this article, he explores the differences between public and private blockchains and the pros and cons of both.\n\nOver the last year, the concept of 'private blockchains' has become very popular in the broader blockchain technology discussion.\n\nEssentially, instead of having a fully public and uncontrolled network and state machine secured by cryptoeconomics (eg proof-of-work, proof-of-stake), it is also possible to create a system where access permissions are more tightly controlled, with rights to modify or even read the blockchain state restricted to a few users, while still maintaining many kinds of partial guarantees of authenticity and decentralization that blockchains provide.\n\nSuch systems have been a primary focus of interest from financial institutions and have, in part, led to a backlash from those who see such developments as either compromising the whole point of decentralization or being a desperate act of dinosaurish middlemen trying to stay relevant (or simply committing the crime of using a blockchain other than bitcoin).\n\nHowever, for those who are in this fight simply because they want to figure out how to best serve humanity, or even pursue the more modest goal of serving their customers, what are the practical differences between the two styles?\n\nFirst, what exactly are the options at hand? To summarize, there are generally three categories of blockchain-like database applications:\n\n1. Public blockchains\n\nA public blockchain is a blockchain that anyone in the world can read, anyone in the world can send transactions to and expect to see them included if they are valid, and anyone in the world can participate in the consensus process – the process for determining what blocks get added to the chain and what the current state is.\n\nAs a substitute for centralized or quasi-centralized trust, public blockchains are secured by cryptoeconomics – the combination of economic incentives and cryptographic verification using mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of stake, following a general principle that the degree to which someone can have an influence in the consensus process is proportional to the quantity of economic resources that they can bring to bear. These blockchains are generally considered to be “fully decentralized”.\n\n2. Consortium blockchains\n\nA consortium blockchain is a blockchain where the consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes; for example, one might imagine a consortium of 15 financial institutions, each of which operates a node and of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid.\n\nThe right to read the blockchain may be public, or restricted to the participants, and there are also hybrid routes such as the root hashes of the blocks being public together with an API that allows members of the public to make a limited number of queries and get back cryptographic proofs of some parts of the blockchain state. These blockchains may be considered “partially decentralized”.\n\n3. Fully private blockchains\n\nA fully private blockchain is a blockchain where write permissions are kept centralized to one organization. Read permissions may be public or restricted to an arbitrary extent. Likely applications include database management, auditing, etc internal to a single company, and so public readability may not be necessary in many cases at all, though in other cases public auditability is desired.\n\nDistinctions\n\nIn general, so far there has been little emphasis on the distinction between consortium blockchains and fully private blockchains, although it is important: the former provides a hybrid between the “low-trust” provided by public blockchains and the “single highly-trusted entity” model of private blockchains, whereas the latter can be more accurately described as a traditional centralized system with a degree of cryptographic auditability attached.\n\nHowever, to some degree there is good reason for the focus on consortium over private: the fundamental value of blockchains in a fully private context, aside from the replicated state machine functionality, is cryptographic authentication.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that the optimal format of such authentication provision should consist of a series of hash-linked data packets containing Merkle tree roots; generalized zero knowledge proof technology provides a much broader array of exciting possibilities about the kinds of cryptographic assurances that applications can provide their users.\n\nIn general, I would even argue that generalized zero-knowledge-proofs are, in the corporate financial world, greatly underhyped compared to private blockchains.\n\nFor now, I will thus focus on the simpler “private versus public” blockchain discussion. In general, the idea that there is “one true way” to be blockchaining is completely wrong headed, and both categories have their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nPrivate blockchain advantages\n\nFirst, private blockchains. Compared to public blockchains, they have a number of advantages:\n\n1. Rule changing\n\nThe consortium or company running a private blockchain can easily, if desired, change the rules of a blockchain, revert transactions, modify balances, etc. In some cases, eg national land registries, this functionality is necessary; there is no way a system would be allowed to exist where Dread Pirate Roberts can have legal ownership rights over a plainly visible piece of land, and so an attempt to create a government-uncontrollable land registry would in practice quickly devolve into one that is not recognized by the government itself.\n\nOf course, one can argue that one can do this on a public blockchain by giving the government a backdoor key to a contract; the counter-argument to that is that such an approach is essentially a Rube Goldbergian alternative to the more efficient route of having a private blockchain, although there is in turn a partial counter-argument to that that I will describe later.\n\n2. Known validators\n\nThe validators are known, so any risk of a 51% attack arising from some miner collusion in China does not apply.\n\n3. Cheaper transactions\n\nTransactions are cheaper, since they only need to be verified by a few nodes that can be trusted to have very high processing power, and do not need to be verified by ten thousand laptops.\n\nThis is a hugely important concern right now, as public blockchains tend to have transaction fees exceeding $0.01 per tx, but it is important to note that it may change in the long term with scalable blockchain technology that promises to bring public-blockchain costs down to within one or two orders of magnitude of an optimally efficient private blockchain system.\n\n4. Well-connected nodes\n\nNodes can be trusted to be very well-connected, and faults can quickly be fixed by manual intervention, allowing the use of consensus algorithms which offer finality after much shorter block times.\n\nImprovements in public blockchain technology, such as Ethereum 1.0’s uncle concept and later proof of stake, can bring public blockchains much closer to the “instant confirmation” ideal (eg. offering total finality after 15 seconds, rather than 99.9999% finality after two hours as does Bitcoin), but even still private blockchains will always be faster and the latency difference will never disappear as unfortunately the speed of light does not increase by 2x every two years by Moore’s law.\n\n5. Privacy\n\nIf read permissions are restricted, private blockchains can provide a greater level of, well, privacy.\n\nGiven all of this, it may seem like private blockchains are unquestionably a better choice for institutions. However, even in an institutional context, public blockchains still have a lot of value, and in fact this value lies to a substantial degree in the philosophical virtues that advocates of public blockchains have been promoting all along, among the chief of which are freedom, neutrality and openness.\n\nPublic blockchain advantages\n\nThe advantages of public blockchains generally fall into two major categories:\n\n1. Users protected from developers\n\nPublic blockchains provide a way to protect the users of an application from the developers, establishing that there are certain things that even the developers of an application have no authority to do. From a naive standpoint, it may be hard to understand why an application developer would want to voluntarily give up power and hamstring themselves. However, more advanced economic analysis provides two reasons why, in Thomas Schelling’s words, weakness can be a strength.\n\nFirst, if you explicitly make it harder or impossible for yourself to do certain things, then others will be more likely to trust you and engage in interactions with you, as they are confident that those things are less likely to happen to them.\n\nSecond, if you personally are being coerced or pressured by another entity, then saying “I have no power to do this even if I wanted to” is an important bargaining chip, as it discourages that entity from trying to compel you to do it. A major category of pressure or coercion that application developers are at risk of is that by governments, so “censorship resistance” ties strongly into this kind of argument.\n\n2. Network effects\n\nPublic blockchains are open, and therefore are likely to be used by very many entities and gain some network effects. To give a particular example, consider the case of domain name escrow.\n\nCurrently, if A wants to sell a domain to B, there is the standard counterparty risk problem that needs to be resolved: if A sends first, B may not send the money, and if B sends first then A might not send the domain.\n\nTo solve this problem, we have centralized escrow intermediaries, but these charge fees of three to six percent. However, if we have a domain name system on a blockchain, and a currency on the same blockchain, then we can cut costs to near-zero with a smart contract: A can send the domain to a program which immediately sends it to the first person to send the program money, and the program is trusted because it runs on a public blockchain.\n\nNote that in order for this to work efficiently, two completely heterogeneous asset classes from completely different industries must be on the same database – not a situation which can easily happen with private ledgers.\n\nAnother similar example in this category is land registries and title insurance, although it is important to note that another route to interoperability is to have a private chain that the public chain can verify, btcrelay-style, and perform transactions cross-chain.\n\nNecessity\n\nIn some cases, these advantages are unneeded, but in others they are quite powerful – powerful enough to be worth 3x longer confirmation times and paying $0.03 for a transaction (or, once scalability technology comes into play, $0.0003 for a transaction).\n\nNote that by creating privately administered smart contracts on public blockchains, or cross-chain exchange layers between public and private blockchains, one can achieve many kinds of hybrid combinations of these properties.\n\nThe solution that is optimal for a particular industry depends very heavily on what your exact industry is. In some cases, public is clearly better; in others, some degree of private control is simply necessary.\n\nAs is often the case in the real world, it depends.\n\nThis article was first published on the Ethereum blog and has been republished here with permission.\n\nPrivate sign and public sign images via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

08/08/2015,"['Last month, I hit upon the first fifteen ways Bitcoin is changing how money works worldwide. It turns out that was just the beginning, as Bitcoin is a concept of few limits and compromises and many empowering capabilities. This week, we double-down on why your best people should start using cryptocurrency now and in the future. Let the good times roll!\n\nAbility to replace, or compliment, the legacy fiat currency system\n\nFor consumers, you can live on bitcoin, and replace fiat currency altogether. Many people, like bitcoin wizard Andreas Antonopoulos, get paid, live, and travel exclusively via bitcoin. Nations are very, very unlikely to adopt a decentralized digital currency to represent their nation, but it could be done. Governments are all about control.\n\nThe word government even means ""control mind"" in the Latin root. What Bitcoin can do is be the next version of PayPal, only so much more than that, as you’ll see. Everybody can have a bitcoin account to move money easily online while still using a government-issued currency for income and taxes. You can have the best of both worlds.\n\nDigital currency means programmable money\n\nProgrammable money means you can program bitcoins to only be spent in a certain city, country, or even purpose. You can give a child a bitcoin, to spend on schoolbooks, and the bitcoin can be programmed to reject all other uses. This is not widely done, but it is well within the protocol\'s capabilities. Bitcoin security can have as many levels as you want. And there is so much room for business growth to exploit these innovative features.\n\nBitcoin builds new industries, businesses and jobs worldwide\n\nPoliticians are starting to see that Bitcoin means new businesses, which means new jobs as entire industries can be born. Security for bitcoin, trade, bitcoin services like legal, marketing, and social media equals high-paying IT job growth, which only increases with adoption.\n\nThe cheapest way for money to fly\n\nTransferring money is one of the world’s oldest and most profitable businesses. Just ask Western Union, who has made hundreds of billions of dollars over the years because they have virtually zero competition in many parts of the world.\n\nThey can charge people up to 15% in fees to transfer money from one country to another depending on where and how much you are sending. Bitcoin can do the same thing for mere pennies, regardless of the amount of or the location of the transfer. Plenty of businesses see an opportunity for growth here. This money is better spent by the people receiving it, and the investment in their communities.\n\nMakes Identity Theft Obsolete\n\nYou aren\'t sending your personal information when you make a Bitcoin transaction. When you swipe you debit card, your whole account, with your name, social security or national ID number, address, and balance are all sent into third-party systems. You HOPE the information is safe there. Then it goes to a clearing house, your bank, and there are plenty of people touching your transaction along the way.\n\nThese stops along the way attract hackers like flies, and most current systems are nowhere secure enough to stop hackers in 2015 and beyond. No wonder almost 5% of people in the U.S. have suffered identity theft. Bitcoin users wouldn\'t know about identity theft. The best way to protect user information is to not attach it to financial transactions in the first place. Bitcoin enters stage left.\n\nRecord Important Files within the Blockchain Forever\n\nPeople have been married on the Bitcoin blockchain. Books have been ""etched"" there. Contracts, Wills, and many more agreements are becoming normal fare for Bitcoin\'s public ledger. Now, real estate ownership in less secure areas of the world is being verified with Bitcoin technology. This will be one of the greatest uses of the blockchain going forward.\n\nNatural Appreciation\n\nIf you are currently saving your fiat currency in the bank like people were taught to do decades ago, you are losing money every day. Real-world inflation in the U.S. is around 5%, and that easily beats any interest being accrued. Bitcoin is designed to increase in value over time and is anti-inflationary because there will always be the same amount of bitcoins.\n\nAsk people who bought a thousand BTC 5 years ago how they\'re doing. A little bit better than your savings account, I can tell you. Five years ago, 1 BTC was worth a nickel. Now, it\'s worth about US$280. The Mt. Gox/China bubble is all that has stopped the fiat currency value from being a smooth progression upward, but it has gained about 60% in value over two years ago, and about the same since the middle of January. Plus, with Bitcoin’s production halving scheduled for next summer, expect the value to go higher by the end of 2016. Usage has steadily increased and supply will drop noticeably to 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes, so call the second half of 2016 a period of hyper-appreciation.\n\nEndless Security Options\n\nBitcoin can be more complex, but at least Bitcoin is as secure as you want it to be. The best way to lose bitcoins is to give someone your ""private key."" Many people today place convenience above all else and throw bitcoins away. The options are many, including multi-sig technology, passwords, PINs, paper wallets, vault storage, cold storage or offline storage. Humans are not very good at storing information over physical items, but Bitcoin is ready for that when you are.\n\nPower to the People\n\nBitcoin gains value and economic power the more people use it. So....what are you waiting for? A new form of money has emerged that can empower billions of people by removing barriers, friction and corruption. Bitcoin brings economic power to anyone on the planet ready to take control of money themselves. Are you ready to wield such power?\n\nEncrypted security worldwide\n\nThe most basic and essential reason for the success of Bitcoin is the encrypted technology behind it. Through encryption, which has been vetted through your military and banking systems for decades, you can send currency worldwide in seconds, with total protection. It’s like putting your money into a vault that can only be opened by your friends/customers. No central bank control.\n\nA Bitcoin Lives without Borders or Limits\n\nA land’s borders are meant to keep us apart. Bitcoin is meant to bring us together. Being the world’s first global currency, a Bitcoin in Japan is the same as a Bitcoin in Sydney. It is not indigenous to one nation, and you should find plenty of people looking to buy your BTC in many of the countries you travel. Omnipotence is a standard feature.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t know how to discriminate\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol is called a ""dumb network."" This means it doesn\'t care how much money you have, how old you are, what color you are, where you live, or how old you are. Are you a citizen of the country you are in right now? Bitcoin doesn\'t care, and it doesn\'t discriminate. If you have a wallet, you can use Bitcoin, anywhere, anytime, for anyone. It is truly technology for The People. All of the people.\n\nCapped Bitcoin Limit of 21 Million Units\n\nThis is a big idea so simple that fiat currency today misses it. Bitcoin has been agreed upon to be held to a 21 million bitcoin limit, to end production in the year 2140. In order to change this, the entire block chain would have to agree to change this value, a highly unlikely scenario. The benefit of a limit is appreciation in bitcoin value now, and forever. Since bitcoin can be broken down to a Satoshi, i.e. 100 millionths of a bitcoin, the ability to obtain bitcoin on a global scale is retained.\n\nMassive information transfer capabilities\n\nTechnically speaking, money is speech according to the U.S. Supreme Court and information. A bitcoin can send one thousand bits of information with secure encryption. Send pdfs, digital files, combinations, and more in complete security.\n\nGives 20th Century Banking Systems a much needed Upgrade\n\nAs has been in the news this year, the world’s largest banks cannot use a decentralized currency, but banks love the blockchain concept because it’s faster and smarter than their ancient systems. They are working on making their own altcoins and versions of blockchains for internal uses. Maybe in five years wire transfers will take minutes, not days. Kinda like the abilities Bitcoin provides users right now, only they take your information and a fee to do so. Aren’t they clever?', 'We all had to send money abroad and may be frustrated by either the transaction cost, the foreign exchange rate, or by the constraints of the amount being sent that shouldn’t be exceeded. Some may also question the safety of banks, especially as one can just look to Greece, where banks control the money of its clients by allowing them to take out a maximum of $60 per day, due to capital controls. Today, many people seek to no longer be tied to a financial system that make them dependent. They started using cryptocurrencies, and specifically Bitcoins that helped them control their own money, and send it abroad at no cost and with no limit. Cryptocurrencies were more interesting to them because they are not tied to any government. Thus, in case of crises, people are not affected. Some cryptocurrencies saw the light later but were not as successful as the Bitcoin, as they didn’t bring a lot of technical innovation.\n\nHow can just a group of people create a new currency without being tied to any government and give this currency a value? The came question can be asked regarding how one dollar is worth one dollar? A group of people agreed on it to be priced at one dollar. Like for the dollar, a group of people agreed on the value of the Bitcoin. However, the Bitcoins have many downsides that were corrected by this new cryptocurrency that starts seeing the light: the GeoCoin.\n\nHow does GeoCoin work?\n\nEvery GeoCoin has a specific latitude and longitude on Earth. Every GeoCoin represents 11 square meters on the finite Earth surface. One can look for a GeoCoin after downloading an app called GeoCoin Snap, only available on Google Play at the moment, and will be launched on the App Store in August 2015. Once registered on the app, one is given a unique ID. A satellite is linked to the phone with its unique credentials and unique ID, and one can find a GeoCoin by being at a specific location and then snapping it. Snapping consists in sending a request to the satellite to acquire the GeoCoin. The satellite then checks if nobody before you has acquired this GeoCoin at the same latitude and longitude. If not, the GeoCoin is yours. It is linked to your unique identifier and unique coordinates through the app. Another way to acquire a GeoCoin is if someone gives it to you or if one exchanges it with traditional money.\n\nDue to the Earth’s finite surface, the value of the GeoCoin will appreciate. On the contrary of the Bitcoin, which requires solving complicated programs to acquire it, one doesn’t need to be a software programmer to find a GeoCoin. Thus, this new cryptocurrency came with a new feature. It is geo-context, meaning it is linked to a GPS or GIS Satellite. Therefore, the app can identify where one snapped the GeoCoin, and thus help in improving its security, avoiding the GeoCoin from being replicated at these same coordinates.\n\nWhy does this new feature make the GeoCoin different from other cryptocurrencies?\n\nBecause of the high volatility of the Bitcoin, many people are scared to use it. They don’t want their money to drop by 40% between the time they put it in their wallet and the time they are willing to buy goods. Thus, a currency needs to be stable to become effective, and the Bitcoin does not fulfill that role.\n\nAccording to Noah Smith, assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University,\n\n“Fiat money is very stable in value during the short term, making it useful for buying things”\n\nThe GeoCoin came to correct this flaw, having this fiat feature of money, and this is why it may attract more people than the Bitcoin. In fact, the GeoCoin has a reserve value, which means that it has a minimum value it should not go below, limiting the risks of volatility. Thus, it can create profit but reduces the loss if it happens. One knows that whichever may happen to the GeoCoin, he or she can still come out with the reserve value, feeling more secure about their money. Additionally, due to the geo-context, the GeoCoin can be tied to any fiat index, making it worthy. Contributing to its stability is its volume, that depends on the per capital GDP of the country where it is available, the GeoCoin is stable.\n\nThe cost of mining a Bitcoin is higher than the cost of snapping a GeoCoin\n\n21 million Bitcoins were created, and they can be released through programs solving. Every four years, about half the remaining Bitcoins are given out. For the moment, a Bitcoin is released every 10 minutes. This means that by 2140, no further Bitcoin will be created. These programs are more and more complicated to solve, so as time goes by, it is more difficult and time consuming to release Bitcoins. However, the GeoCoin works more easily. Just like Bitcoins, GeoCoins are finite. Moreover, it is a greener alternative than the Bitcoin and its derivatives, as it uses satellites. In November 2014, the cost of electricity from mining a Bitcoin has hit the market price of the Bitcoin, and now it is no longer profitable to mine a Bitcoin, as the cost of mining is higher than the Bitcoin itself. For mining Bitcoins to be profitable, there should be sophisticated machines that are costly, and thus are not affordable by anyone. The GeoCoin is less costly as one will only need a smartphone to create the GeoCoin.\n\nTo conclude, the GeoCoin is a soon-to-be stable currency and its Co-Founder, Enoch Cruz, is planning to tie it to the Euro and the Dollar. Thanks to its stability and simplicity to be found by anyone, the GeoCoin is secure and has all the features of money without being tied to any government. Thus, one becomes their own bank, managing real money.', 'With interest growing in bitcoin\'s blockchain and distributed ledger systems more broadly, industry events are increasingly focused on highlighting applications for the emerging technology beyond the world of finance.\n\nThis has included more time and investment dollars devoted to applications in fields such as identity and security that, while not explicitly financial, play an equally prominent role in the global transactions process. As further proof that interest in the technology is widening, Keynote 2015 dedicated a speaking slot to a less-frequently addressed area of impact of the technology – consumer protection.\n\nThere to speak to this subject was Joe Colangelo, executive director at Consumers\' Research, a US non-profit that was among the first to begin publishing monthly magazines dedicated to helping consumers make informed buying choices.\n\nIn an interview, Colangelo opened up about the more than 80-year-old organization\'s increasingly active work in the bitcoin and wider blockchain industry, noting that he believes the technology could bring about a sea change in consumer protection.\n\nColangelo told CoinDesk:\n\n""Consumers have always had to trust third parties in order to use money, even if it\'s cash. The whole consumer protection model is based on the assumption that consumers can\'t easily figure out which third parties are reliable.""\n\nRather than being left conducting the organization in ways that ""made sense in the 1920s"", Colangelo is moving for Consumers\' Research to play an active role as these third parties are replaced by the blockchain\'s ability to enable secure, peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nAs profiled in The Wall Street Journal, he recently organized a retreat at New Hampshire\'s famed Bretton Woods that gathered industry luminaries including MIT Media Lab\'s Michael J Casey and ChangeTip community manager Victoria van Eyk, among others.\n\nThe goal, Colangelo said, was to create a research document that can help inform regulators and legislators interested in the technology of its opportunities and benefits.\n\n""I\'ve gone to maybe half of the major bitcoin conferences in the last two years,"" Colangelo explained. ""We get this concentration of near genius and they talk about what they\'re doing and then they leave.""\n\nIn total, Colangelo said 19,000 words were compiled by those gathered at the three-day event, research that is being compiled to be eventually distributed to the public.\n\nNew third parties\n\nOf course, while bitcoin and blockchain technologies enable consumers to have direct control over their funds, many of the digital currency\'s users interact with third parties. These include hosted web wallets, bitcoin exchanges and private key custodians who help bitcoin users safeguard their digital money.\n\nOf these developments, Colangelo is most interested in multi-signature wallets, those that allow consumers to control their accounts, yet share access with other institutions as a way to ensure the safety of their funds.\n\nColangelo believes this application of the technology will be increasingly beneficial to consumers, especially when it becomes possible for personal data to be managed similarly.\n\n""Social engineering is one of the major ways that people gain access to steal things, that gets incrementally harder when you\'re dealing with multiple parties,"" he said. ""If I have a third party that helps me hold my bitcoin and I have one key with a partner like Third Key Solutions, I don\'t think it\'s twice as hard, I think it\'s four times as hard.""\n\nUltimately, it\'s this ability for bitcoin to allow consumers to programatically provide access to their money and data that Colangelo finds most appealing.\n\n""You can start adding in other rules, like you cannot transfer more than 1 BTC per day out of this wallet and that\'s mathematically proven. You can mitigate that risk down to zero if you can program the money to respond in certain ways.""\n\nColangelo suggested he looks forward to blockchains allowing consumers ownership over their personal data. In the future, he asserted, it could be possible to share data access with companies, without having to store the information on centralized servers.\n\n""We won\'t need to share our information, we can issue it temporarily to FitBit or Facebook or American Airlines and then revoke it. We can grant them 24-hour access and maintain that information,"" he explained.\n\nSmall business empowerment\n\nColangelo also admitted to being a user of bitcoin products and having a broad personal interest in the technology. For example, he indicated he is considering receiving part of his paycheck in bitcoin through payroll solutions provider BitWage.\n\nThis is influencing his company\'s editorial direction, as Colangelo spoke about his desire to launch a bitcoin-specific issue of Consumers\' Research that would review hardware products such as those offered by Case, KeepKey and Ledger.\n\nAlso a co-owner of California-based mead company Golden Coast Mead, Colangelo sees bitcoin and blockchain technology as potentially beneficial for tech-savvy small businesses.\n\nColangelo said he\'s explored using colored coins, or digital assets managed on the bitcoin blockchain, to sell futures contracts for his company\'s products, thereby allowing for the sale of pre-order purchases that could lower Golden Coast\'s liability should products be produced that don\'t meet sales expectations.\n\nHinting at the larger debate over private and public blockchains, he sought to paint bitcoin as an Internet-like utility that would benefit those without the resources to build perhaps more optimized distributed ledger alternatives.\n\n""With the tech as it stands today, it would be easier to issue a colored coin for 500 bottles of mead than it would be for me to employ [blockchain] technology from someone like an Eris,"" he said. ""I\'ll log in create to a blockchain, I\'ll find a few other computers [to secure the network]. I could do it on a number of cloud providers, but at the end of the day, I can do it for free.""\n\nThis ability, he said, will extend to the financial industry, allowing smaller banks to offer better services at a lower cost, adding:\n\n""JPMorgan will probably implement private blockchains, but an open-source alternative like bitcoin will allow Joe\'s bank to compete on the same level from an efficiency standpoint.""\n\nPromoting innovation\n\nIn his remarks, Colangelo was also keen to stress he believes those involved in the current bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem are coming together at a special time in history, one that will be looked at similarly to the dawn of the Internet.\n\nFurther, he remarked on what he saw the limitless abilities of the technology to help transform how consumers interact in similar ways.\n\n""In 1994, we thought we did everything we could with the Internet, that maybe we\'ll make graphics better,"" he continued. ""We couldn\'t see Uber back then. Some of these third-party services might get written out of existence by a teenager who\'s coding over the weekend and makes an open-source platform because the economics are there.""\n\nHowever, he believes it will be increasingly important for organizations like Consumers\' Research to inform the public about these new offerings. At the end of the day, he said, bitcoin companies can\'t expect working families to invest time and effort in understanding how a new wave of financial products might be of benefit.\n\nUltimately, he asserted it\'s this sense of purpose that has encouraged him to align his brand with the technology, concluding:\n\n""Even if Consumers\' Research doesn\'t get vaulted to the front of CNBC when bitcoin does blow up, even if we don\'t go along for the ride, we can say we did this important stuff when bitcoin was just a few thousand passionate people.""\n\nConsumer protection image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Pero hay otro sector que está tomando ventaja rápidamente de los beneficios de las criptomonedas: el sector sin fines de lucro. Si bien esto puede sonar desconcertante al principio, existen razones que le confieren sentido. Muchas organizaciones no lucrativas han decidido aceptar donaciones Bitcoin con la finalidad de aprovechar esta nueva oportunidad para obtener la financiación necesaria para apoyar su misión y sus actividades. Pero además, esta tecnología ofrece numerosos beneficios para estas organizaciones y para los donantes.', 'Siden lanseringen av bitcoin i 2009 har det vært et omdiskutert tema, og for mange synonymt med valutaspekulasjon, svarte penger, en mystisk opprinnelse og ideologiske visjoner. Fellestrekket ved kontroversen rundt bitcoin er sterkt knyttet til bitcoin som valuta. Det er i denne sammenheng viktig å skille mellom bitcoin som valuta og blockchain, som er den underliggende teknologien bak bitcoin.Blockchain-teknologien kan sees på som en offentlig distribuert hovedbok eller database, og det er her det store potensialet ligger.\n\nValutaen har vært svært volatil og har opplevd kurssvingninger fra 1,245 dollar på topp til bunnen på 178 dollar i januar i år. I tillegg kommer avsløringen av det illegale nettstedet Silk Road som benyttet bitcoin som primær valuta og ønsketekninger om bitcoin som alternativ valuta for kriserammede land som Hellas.\n\nMen bitcoin er fortsatt i en tidlig fase og kan sammenlignes med måten Napster og lignende fildelingstjenester utfordret musikkbransjen i år 2000. Men Napster var kun beviset på at distribusjon av musikk gjennom fildeling var mulig og ikke lenge etter lanserte Apple iTunes som kommersialiserte digital distribusjon av musikk. Dersom bitcoin er finansbransjens Napster, så er det stor sannsynlighet for at finansbransjen vil få sin iTunes basert på blockchain teknologien.\n\nDet siste året har flere fått øynene opp for disse mulighetene, og både finansinstitusjoner, investorer og nasjonale myndigheter ønsker å være med på den videre utviklingen.\n\nCitibank er en bank som annonserte nylig at de er i ferd med å utvikle sin egen løsning, Citicoin for å skaffe seg en bedre forståelse av hvordan digitale valutaer vil forme fremtidens finansbransje. Dette underbygges av Goldman Sachs, som er tydelige på at digitale valutaer vil forme fremtidens finansbransje og Santander som hevder å ha identifisert 25 bruksområder der blockchain teknologien kan appliseres. I tillegg er alle de største navnene innen venturekapital involvert i investeringer i bitcoin, med skandinaviske Northzone som intet unntak. Men det er ikke bare privat kapital som er satser på digitale valutaer, den amerikanske sentralbanken har i samarbeid med IBM igangsatt et prosjekt for å utvikle en egen blockchain med hensikt å etablere en digital representasjon av en sentralisert valuta som dollaren.\n\nI tillegg til økende interesse for blockchain-teknologien, er det en rekke potensielle konkrete bruksområder, med ulik modenhetsgrad.\n\nPengeoverføringer på tvers av landegrenser er i dag en svært kostbar tjeneste som også ofte tar lang tid å gjennomføre. En distribuert reskontro som blockchain muliggjør potensielt både betalinger, clearing og oppgjør i sanntid. Australske banker som WestPac, ANZ og Commonwealth Bank of Australia utforsker muligheten for å kombinere nasjonal betalingsinfrastruktur med den distribuerte betalingsprotokollen Ripple for internasjonale sanntidsbetalinger. Dette viser hvordan nasjonale initiativ knyttet til sanntidsbetaling potensielt kan kombineres med blockchain for å skape en løsning som kombinerer det beste av begge verdener. En mulig løsning er å benytte standarden for betalingsformidling, ISO 20022 som meldingsformat og blockchain-teknologien for å bekrefte at transaksjonen har funnet sted.\n\nKostnader og kompleksitet knyttet til betalinger gjelder også netthandel, som opplever stort kundefrafall i betalingsøyeblikket, og må betale høye gebyrer til kredittkortnettverkene Visa og Mastercard. Både Microsoft, Dell og en rekke andre nettbutikker har begynt å akseptere bitcoin som betaling, og selskaper som Bitstamp og Bitpay tilbyr løsninger med sanntids oppgjør konvertering til dollar i kjøpsøyeblikket. Løsningen har en forenklet utsjekk og en flat gebyrstruktur som ligger lavere enn Visa/Mastercard.\n\nDigitale valutaer vil også potensielt fjerne den nedre grensen for størrelsen på betalinger, noe som åpner for nye muligheter innen mikrotransaksjoner. For eksempelvis mediebransjen vil dette åpne for nye inntektsmodeller basert på pay-per-use/pay-per-view, der det er mulig å kapitalisere sidetrafikk gjennom automatiserte mikrotransaksjoner til en marginal pris for hver sidevisning. Til sammenligning har en standupklubb i Barcelona tatt i bruk ansiktsgjenkjenningsteknologi for å ta seg betalt per smil for å stoppe frafall av publikum.\n\nEttav de mest spennende bruksområdene for blockchain-teknologien er etableringen av smarte kontrakter, hvor kontraktens formål gjennomføres automatisk når forhåndsdefinerte betingelser blir oppfylt. Dette kan forenkle en rekke finansielle prosesser produkter som aksjer, obligasjoner og derivater uten involvering av tredjeparter og manuelle operasjoner.\n\nI Norge har dette også stort potensiale som et neste steg i innføringen av elektronisk handel i planleggingen, gjennomføringen og oppfølgingen av offentlige anskaffelser av varer og tjenester, der smarte kontrakter kan benyttes til å automatisere manuelle operasjoner knyttet til saksbehandling og kontraktsoppfølging basert på standardiserte formater gjennom EHF og BIS.\n\nFor en potensiell fremtid der hver tredje jobb kan bli erstattet med roboter de neste 20 årene kan smarte kontrakter potensielt spille en sentral rolle i de tilfeller kunstig intelligens kan stå juridisk ansvarlig for sine handlinger.\n\nDette er kun noen eksempler på bruksområder for digitale valutaer, men det viser at det eksisterer et uforløst potensiale i å utforske temaet fremfor å avfeie bitcoin som en spekulativ valuta for svart økonomi.\n\nDigitale valutaer vil nok ikke erstatte tradisjonelle valutaer, men den underliggende teknologien vil gjøre transaksjoner raskere, sikrere og mer effektive. I tillegg er bruksområdene for en distribuert reskontro ikke begrenset til valuta og finansielle tjenester, men kan potensielt revolusjonere måten vi ser på digitalt eierskap i fremtiden.', 'Mos consumers view social media as a godsend, providing an easy way to stay in touch with friends, family, and loved ones. At any time or place, a status update tells the whole world what something about you. However, Facebook’s methods of handling direct communication may indicate that social media is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.\n\nAlso read: Social Media Plays Pivotal Role in Bitcoin Media Consumption\n\nLinking People Around the World for Mutual Benefits\n\nWhen social media started making headway as a mainstream trend, the advantages became visible for everyone to see. You can connect online with people you know, as well people you don’t know, at no cost. Share personal opinions with the world through networks such as Twitter, and open lengthy discussions on topics you and your friends find interesting.\n\nIn this day and age, it is important to build up a network of friends, colleagues, and people you love, as our society has grown estranged from each other. Even though none of us sees the people they care about as often as we would like, social media gives people around the world a powerful tool to stay in touch at any time.\n\nIn recent years, however, it has become abundantly clear that social media never had noble intentions in terms of using personal data consumers willingly provide to these platforms. Advertisers get access to sensitive consumer information through these social media platforms in order to create targeted ad campaigns. Consumers do not get paid for their information, since they agree — whether they know it or not — to give it away for free to platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.\n\nEven social media platforms need to find creative ways to make money, and an IPO does not raise enough funds on a constant basis to keep things going. Advertising campaigns are just one of the many evil things social media platforms can do with consumer data, and it looks like Facebook wants to step up their game, albeit not in a positive manner.\n\nCompanies can Send Unsolicited Messages to Individual Facebook Users\n\nHanding over sensitive customer data for targeted advertisement campaigns is clearly not enough, as Facebook now allows companies to send private, unsolicited messages to individual users. Luckily for the recipients, they have the option of blocking further unwanted communication from these companies.\n\nWhenever an individual Facebook user writes on a company’s page, that company can then send a private message to that individual. While there is a clear use case for such a service in terms of support-related questions, it also opens up the door for spam, advertising, and who knows what else.\n\nThe system also works the other way around: individual users can contact companies on Facebook and directly respond to advertisements. It is important to note that both companies and individual users can turn off this new Facebook feature on their profile pages. However, the feature rolled out without previous warning and went live just the other day.\n\nEven though this feature may seem to be a valuable addition to the Facebook ecosystem, it will be interesting to see how companies and individuals decide to use it. Advertising and spam are just a few clicks away on both ends, and it may not be long until this feature is disabled by most business and individuals to prevent that sort of behavior.\n\nTime for Decentralized Social Networks?\n\nCentralized social networks such as Facebook and Twitter take a more aggressive stance towards harvesting customer information. Although both platforms are easy to use and offer social benefits, users sacrifice a lot of privacy when using these social network. In a world where digital privacy is a topic of growing concern, the way social media gathers user data will have to change sooner or later.\n\nBlockchain technology can be adopted to create decentralized social networks, where users from all over the world can communicate with each other. There would be no centralized authority involved, as there is no physical network or data center. Every piece of information would be broadcast through a network of blockchain nodes, similar to how Bitcoin transactions work.\n\nThe beautiful part of blockchain technology is the fact that is has been created for the individual users, by the individual users. There is nothing that can’t be achieved with blockchain technology, as layer upon layer of innovation is stacked upon each other. And all of this technology can be used with or without integrating Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nDo social media platforms take data harvesting too far?

To understand how blockchain works requires dedicated study, but non-specialists might think of it as a publicly viewable spreadsheet that records every bitcoin transaction — who sent how much to whom (it\'s possible to remain fairly anonymous). Every few minutes, a ""block"" of new rows is added. But old blocks on the chain can\'t be edited. They\'re locked tight by theoretically unbreakable computer code.', 'UPDATE 9th August 21:00 UTC: An earlier version of this article indicated that Bitstamp, not Bitfinex, had withdrawn services from New York.\n\nKraken and Bitfinex, two of the largest bitcoin exchanges by investment funding and daily trading volume, have indicated they will not be applying for licenses to operate in New York.\n\nThe development is the latest in the ongoing debate over the BitLicense, New York\'s state-specific regulation for bitcoin businesses, which continues to be a lightning rod for criticism from both within the bitcoin community and more widely among mainstream technology advocacy groups. State regulators had previously set 8th August as the submission deadline for business already serving consumers in the third-largest US state by population.\n\nSo far, more well-capitalized exchanges including Bitstamp have applied for a BitLicense. Smaller businesses including merchant processor GoCoin and altcoin exchange Poloniex, however, recently revelead they would not continue efforts to reach customers in the state.\n\nBased in San Francisco, Kraken and its executives have long had a contentious relationship with US regulators, withdrawing services from the domestic market in early 2014 and stopping all US dollar services until October. US dollar trading is still not available for US residents.\n\nThe exchange wrote:\n\n""While we’re sure that the protection from New York law enforcement is valuable, it comes at a price that exceeds the market opportunity of servicing New York residents. Therefore, we have no option but to withdraw our service from the state.""\n\nIn statements to CoinDesk, Powell suggested the move was likely to affect the ""several thousand"" clients of the exchange. Despite the sometimes political rhetoric, however, Powell implied there were also strong business motivations behind the action.\n\n""The increasing competition in the US did play a role in the calculation,"" Powell said. ""We don\'t see the entire NY exchange market being worth the costs associated with compliance with the BitLicense, and we sure don\'t see the point in bleeding out over a red ocean.""\n\nHong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex was more straightforward with its announcement, quoting from the BitLicense before indicating it would be ceasing services in the state as of the 8th August deadline.\n\nBoth exchanges indicated they would continue to monitor the regulatory situation in New York with the goal of re-opening services.\n\nPolitical ammo\n\nIn its blog post on the subject, Kraken used exaggerated language to impart its stance on the law, characterizing it as a ""foul"" and ""cruel"" beast that was more formidable than the mythological creature whose name the exchange has adopted.\n\nThe informal introduction aside, Kraken suggested it did not apply as the BitLicense does not guarantee bitcoin companies the ability to obtain banking services, offer protection from unlicensed competitors or come with an exemption from traditional money service business (MSB) licensing. To operate in New York, exchanges must either receive a New York banking charter or be more broadly registered in the country as an MSB.\n\nNotably, the company characterized New York as a market too small to justify the expense of the licensing process.\n\nApplications for the BitLicense cost $5,000, a figure that doesn\'t include additional charges for document preparation and personnel allocation.\n\nIn light of the cost, Powell implied Kraken simply saw moving its focus on customer growth abroad as a better way to allocate its spending.\n\n""We\'ll spend our money on blue oceans and green pastures and maybe get back to New York when sanity has emerged and we\'ve got a bigger bankroll,"" Powell remarked.\n\nFund withdrawal\n\nBitfinex indicated it would modify its terms of services as a result of the decision, stating that customers would need to withdraw funds by 21:00 BST on 15th August.\n\nThe exchange also detailed how its process will be modified to reduce its liability for unlawful deposits from New York residents.\n\n""We strongly encourage New York residents to specify ‘Locked Withdrawal Addresses’ that we will use to automatically sweep any funds that may be sent to one of your deposit addresses in the future,"" the exchange wrote. ""Failure to set these Locked Withdrawal Addresses will result in the automatic liquidation of future deposits.""\n\nThose with funds in the exchange, it said, will have any cryptocurrency converted to US dollars after the 15th August deadline.\n\n""The resulting USD balance will be available in customer accounts for customers to access at any time,"" the post said.\n\nNew York residents will be unable to use any of the exchanges services, including its fiat and digital currency trading services.\n\nBitfinex did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nBitLicense visualization via Kraken\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Help Foo in his quest for gold and, like him, you will also have a chance to win real Bitcoin!\n\nTo earn Bitcoin users have to sign up for a free bitLanders account, and although it’s not made clear in the game details, it would be presumed that each game of Flappig would only be paying out small fractions of Bitcoin per play, however for players who are seriously into these sorts of games it would accumulate over time.\n\nbitLanders launched in August 2014 and primarily offers a “Social RPG” that is said to offer a parallel universe that merges Bitcoin, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and WordPress into one content platform that pays users in Bitcoin based on something called a “BUZZ Score,” a proprietary algorithm that measures the users creation of and engagement with quality content, and the reach and influence to broadcast this content to a larger audience.\n\nAs of January 2015 the company claims to have 500,000 users with 125 million fans and friends, and has even gone as far as sponsoring Judo championships.\n\nbitLanders has also moved into charitable giving, launching the site bitCharities back in May to encourage philanthropy through Bitcoin donations along with encouraging its own users to give.\n\nGet paid to play\n\nRewards-based incentives to encourage people to undertake activities online are nearly as old as the world wide web itself, and variations on the theme over the years have come into the gaming space.\n\nThere are other mobile games that offer Bitcoin payments for play available, although as far as we can ascertain, Flappig is the first to feature a flying pig; the irony given what some of the critics of Bitcoin say about the cryptocurrency is undoubtedly intentional.\n\nAt a time where mobile games are in the tens of millions, if not close to a hundred million, defining one game to the next is becoming near on impossible; paid to play, particularly using Bitcoins which offer a cheap way to make those payments is a solid marketing strategy to help any app stand out from the crowd, let alone one like Flappig.\n\nFlappig is available for Android and iOS.\n\nImage via bitLanders', ""Jean-Louis Schiltz is a guest professor at the University of Luxembourg and legal advisor to several virtual currency companies (since his first involvement with bitcoin through MIT Media Lab). He is also a former Cabinet minister in Luxembourg. In this article, he examines whether it is possible for one place to emerge as the world's bitcoin hub and whether regulation will have a hand in this.\n\nBitcoin and its regulation have been hot topics in and around the financial industry for some time now.\n\nIn the early days, the focus was (to repurpose a Shakespearian quote): to regulate or not to regulate?\n\nNow, a small number of jurisdictions, such as the UK and New York, have moved to the next step: either they are in the course of determining what parts of bitcoin businesses should be regulated and how (as is the case in the UK), or they have recently adopted a regulatory framework specifically for virtual currencies (as is the case in New York).\n\nOther jurisdictions decided quite some time ago to regulate large areas of bitcoin activity. One example of such a jurisdiction is Luxembourg.\n\nBitcoin regulation in Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg’s regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), has been at the forefront of the move towards regulating bitcoin, in that the CSSF announced – on Valentine’s Day 2014 – that professional bitcoin actors must be regulated.\n\nFirstly, it stated that virtual currencies are considered money just like fiat currency and, secondly, it recalled that no financial activity can be carried out in Luxembourg without authorization from the financial regulator.\n\nOne key message from the CSSF to the bitcoin community – almost two full weeks before Mt Gox went bankrupt – was to warn them not to try to set up businesses in Luxembourg that would not pay attention to regulation.\n\nBitcoiners have since been on notice that they would not be allowed to develop their business in a Wild West environment in Luxembourg.\n\nA recipe for success\n\nPerhaps more importantly, by issuing its statement more than 15 months ago, the CSSF gave bitcoin companies the basic regulatory recipe for success.\n\nIn its statement, the CSSF outlined a number of basic principles that remain valid and might now even be considered mainstream principles for digital currencies in the light of the recent New York regulations.\n\nThis is particularly true with respect to the regulatory status of exchanges. Despite the fact that the term 'exchange' cannot be found in the CSSF statement, the Luxembourg regulator describes possible categories of regulated activities such as issuing means of payments, provision of payment services and setting up markets or platforms.\n\nMoreover, in the final sentence of its statement, the CSSF advises bitcoin actors to define their business purpose and activity in such a way that the regulator would be able to immediately determine what categories of regulated activities the entity would need to be licensed to conduct its business in an orderly fashion.\n\nWhile perhaps slightly elliptic, this final bit of advice does not only constitute a clear pro-regulation statement, but also establishes that, depending on their activities, bitcoin actors might well become payment institutions, electronic money institutes, markets or multilateral trading facilities under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or possibly even banks in a few months or years.\n\nApplying existing rules\n\nIt is also interesting that, unlike New York, the CSSF did not put in place or invent one or more new categories of regulated entities, but rather applied existing EU rules to new types of businesses.\n\nFurther, its statement implies that risk mitigation, in general, and anti-money laundering concerns, in particular, are better addressed in a regulated environment than in a non-regulated one.\n\nThe same is true for consumer protection, even though we are never going to have a zero-risk world for bitcoin consumers. But, risk exists in the real world (as opposed to the virtual world) and in the old e-commerce world, too.\n\nRemember, no one is obliged to do business, or get involved as a consumer, with virtual currencies, and that is a major difference between virtual currency and fiat currency.\n\nOne hub\n\nWhile I have the impression that some jurisdictions seem to think they are in a race to become the one and only bitcoin hub, I do not believe there can, or will be, just one such hub.\n\nFor obvious regulatory reasons, hubs will first arise on both sides of the Atlantic and probably in Asia, too.\n\nThose hubs may well arise in the places where key financial actors in Europe and in the US already conduct business. As for Europe, I predict that one or two hubs will emerge within the Eurozone and another will develop outside the Eurozone (perhaps even outside the European Union).\n\nThat said, and assuming more and more bitcoin and other virtual currency actors follow the payment rail route (that is concentrate on business-to-business activities aiming at facilitating payments, thus putting the correspondent banking system under attack), there could well be more than a few virtual currency hubs around the world in the very near future.\n\nDigital currencies will then be everywhere. Whether it is going to be bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency that will be in the lead is a different question.\n\nLuxembourg image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Louis CK mentioned on his website:\n\n“We have the price set to 5 dollars but you can lower it to 1 dollar or raise it to 85. that's the maximum, because beyond that, I don't want your crazy money.”\n\nLouis C.K is the first comedian ever to accept bitcoin for comedy albums and shows. C.K integrated BitPay on his website louisck.net, to enable his fans and customers to purchase any of his shows, albums and recordings with bitcoin.\n\nApart from other possible reasons, it is most likely that Louis C.K began accepting bitcoin payments for his cheap albums and audio-only shows on his site, including the LIVE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN comedy show.\n\nAs mentioned above, users can purchase audio files for as little as US$1, and using financial/mobile payment platforms like PayPal can be incredibly inefficient and expensive. PayPal charges around 7~10% in transaction fees, and can freeze user accounts sporadically.\n\nAfter the announcement, a number of fans began to purchase his albums with bitcoin.\n\nOne fan stated:"", 'We can use bitcoin to buy almost anything these days, or at least that’s what we read about in the news. But how many people are really paying with bitcoin to buy goods and services from those vendors who accept bitcoin? The answer to this question is a bit disappointing. It is because not many people are really using bitcoin to buy goods and services, even while doing business with vendors who accept bitcoin.\n\nUnless the bitcoins out there in the ether starts circulating on a regular basis, we can’t expect the rate of bitcoin adoption to improve. We have lots of bitcoin payment processors who are enabling merchants to accept bitcoins across the world. But still when we take a head count of the number of merchants across various geographies accepting bitcoin, we will find the distribution to be uneven. The western countries like United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Netherlands and Germany have more merchants who accept bitcoin compared to Asian and Eurasian countries.\n\nCoinmap shows that at present there are close to 7000 businesses across the world that accept bitcoin. Now when we take a look at the same map in “World View” we can observe that the heat map is strong in North American and the Eurozone region as compared to rest of the world.\n\nMerchants in countries other than those in North America and Eurozone are not so enthusiastic about bitcoin because there are not many good exchange facilities available for them to exchange bitcoin to fiat and also the purpose of bitcoin usage is mainly for remittance in these countries. Whereas in US, UK and other countries, bitcoin is more used for everyday transactions.\n\nREAD MORE: Major Challenges Facing Bitcoin Adoption\n\nAlso, buying things with bitcoin makes sense to people only when they are making an overseas payment for some product or service they ordered. When merchants accept bitcoin payments, they enjoy the benefits of low transaction fees, whereas customers are not incentivized in any way as they end up paying the same as they pay in fiat currency. Without any additional benefits, the used would rather pay with fiat currency and save the bitcoins for future use or to trade them when the value goes up. This in turn will lead to hoarding and if many people start hoarding bitcoins, then the rate of adoption will become even slower.\n\nREAD MORE: Bitcoin Adoption Sees an Uptick in Vietnam\n\nUnless there is some kind of incentive for people to pay with bitcoin, there won’t be any significant increase in retail transactions.', 'New York has long been the financial hub of the United States and it is the home of the famous Wall Street stock exchange. However, as a technological instrument of finance and exchange, Bitcoin has not seen favorable treatment in this celebrity city of the financial industry. This is due to one piece of legislation: the infamous BitLicense.\n\nIn the wake of the final draft of BitLicense two major Bitcoin exchange have announced their exit from New York and will not do business with customers there. Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex and San Fancisco-based Kraken have both announced their withdrawal from New York.\n\n“Due to financial regulation changes in the State of New York, certain Bitfinex services are no longer available for New York Residents,” the exchange operators wrote in an announcement. Reasons cited for leaving include the overly burdensome nature of the BitLicense regulation. Residents of New York who use Bitfinex as an exchange must withdraw their bitcoins before 4:00 pm EDT on August 15, 2015.\n\nWorld’s largest Bitcoin exchange announces it is leaving New York due to BitLicense “All NY Residents must withdraw” https://t.co/oLhYproPpc — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) August 7, 2015\n\nAccording to the BitcoinAverage.com market index, Bitfinx represents 39.22% of all current bitcoin volume transactions across the world. This should make the tweet above from Erik Voorhees, co-founder of Bitcoin payment processor Coinapult and founder of Bitcoin exchange Shapeshift.io, hit close to home.\n\nKraken took to its retreat from New York with a particular timbre of humor using a reference to online gaming by profiling BitLicense as a 40-man raid boss from a game such as World of Warcraft.\n\nBitLicense is described by Kraken thusly, “a creature so foul, so cruel that not even Kraken possesses the courage or strength to face its nasty, big, pointy teeth.” And adds that it includes a list of attributes, attacks and debuffs:\n\nno guarantee of support from New York banks no guarantee of enforcement against unlicensed competitors reduced consumer protection unjustifiable burden and restrictions on global operations unjustifiable bifurcation of the service for New York alone unjustifiable expense for the opportunity to compete for the small market no exemption from traditional money transmission licensing no onramp for small businesses dubious value to the consumer\n\nAnd finally, that defeating this particular monster is actually pyrrhic victory because it drops only one useful item: “Scroll of Protection: New York Law Enforcement.”\n\nThe less-humorous, more-serious section of the announcement from Kraken cites that the price of licensing in New York far exceeds the market opportunity for servicing New York Residents. And encourages clients living in New York to escape (in a reference to the John Carpenter movie Escape from New York starring Kurt Russell.)\n\nThe BitLicense regulatory framework was finally released in June of this year and now the fallout is happening.\n\nBitLicense roundly criticized by the entire Bitcoin industry\n\nThe first draft proposal of BitLicense emerged over a year ago and is the brainchild of then New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky. With each subsequent draft released the entire industry has chimed in repeatedly that many of the regulations exceed those provided to similar financial institutions, which already must abide by anti-money laundering laws and other regulations at state and federal levels.\n\nIn July 2014, the first draft of BitLicense came up for public comments and it took a beating—however, very little would change. Criticism for the draft and its changes came from almost all angles including wallet services Circle and BitPay, also Bitcoin exchange Kraken. At the October 2014 closure of comments even Reddit, the Internet Archive, and the EFF had weighed in on the problems persistent with BitLicense.\n\nThe regulation was described as “sprawling’ and possessing problematic elements such as highly invasive identification requirements not present for other financial tools. BitPay and others criticized the regulation as too stringent and burdensome for Bitcoin startups in the industry space and warned that as a result smaller Bitcoin-related businesses would look elsewhere to open up shop.\n\nShortly after finalizing BitLicense, Lawsky quit his role as superintendent of the NYDFS. This move generated some controversy over his behavior during the drafting and finalization of BitLicense.\n\nImage credit: Avco Embassy, Escape from New York movie poster.', 'The Free Republic of Liberland is a sovereign state located between Croatia and Serbia on the west bank of the Danube River.

One of such traps was discovered earlier this August 7, which could fool some users into thinking they had the private keys of newly generated public addresses on Widows Ethereum clients.\n\nSpecifically, the clients affected are AlethZero and eth implementations on Windows. Users of Frontier command line interface geth are unaffected. Jutta Steiner of the ETH team writes:\n\n“While setting privacy permissions on the keys directory, insufficient error handling can cause the key files to not be written; this may be widespread on the Windows platform. As such, current versions of AlethZero and eth may include identities for which there exists no underlying key. Ether Presale Claim functionality of AlethZero may result in funds automatically being transferred to these lost identities.”\n\nAs a specific work around, Steiner writes:\n\n“Users of AlethZero version 0.9.39 and earlier should NOT use the “Claim Presale Wallet” function; users of AlethZero and eth versions 0.9.39 and earlier should not attempt to mine or receive funds into their addresses.”\n\nAdding that “Users of eth and AlethZero on all platforms should consider themselves safe once they have confirmed that they do indeed have the underlying key.

Offenbar gibt es eine Reihe von Kriminellen, die systematisch nach verwundbaren Brainwallets suchen.\n\nEs klingt zunächst nach einer attraktiven Idee: Bei Bitcoin-Brainwallets muss man den Schlüssel für eine Bitcoin-Adresse nicht speichern. Man merkt sich lediglich ein Passwort, der zugehörige Bitcoin-Schlüssel kann dann aus dem Passwort jederzeit neu generiert werden. Diese Brainwallets erfreuen sich seit einiger Zeit großer Beliebtheit in der Bitcoin-Community. Auf der Def-Con-Konferenz in Las Vegas warnt der Sicherheitsforscher Ryan Castellucci allerdings vor Brainwallets und bittet alle Nutzer, die Nutzung sofort zu beenden und das Geld auf eine andere Bitcoin-Adresse zu transferieren. Bereits vor der Def Con hatte Castellucci eine entsprechende Warnung in seinem Blog veröffentlicht.\n\nPasswort erzeugt privaten Schlüssel\n\nBrainwallets generieren aus einem Passwort durch einige einfache Hashing-Schritte einen Bitcoin-Schlüssel. Einer der Vorteile von Brainwallets soll unter anderem sein, dass anschließend kein Beweis mehr für die Existenz eines Bitcoin-Kontos auf einem Computer vorliegt, man spricht auch von ""Plausible Deniability"". Ein TEDx-Talk propagiert sogar, dass derartige Brainwallets von Flüchtlingen, die ihr Land in Not verlassen müssen, genutzt werden könnten, um ihr Geld sicher über die Grenze zu schaffen.\n\nDoch das alles scheitert daran, dass Menschen sehr schlecht darin sind, sich gute Passwörter zu merken. Das Problem: Sämtliche öffentlichen Schlüssel sind in der Bitcoin-Blockchain für jeden einsehbar. Und mit entsprechender Rechenpower kann man die Passwörter durch Brute-Force-Angriffe durchprobieren. Vergleichbar ist das mit einer geklauten Datenbank, die Passwort-Hashes enthält - nur dass in diesem Fall niemand die Datenbank klauen muss, da sie bereits öffentlich ist. Doch der Angriff ist sogar einfacher als gegen eine gängige Passwort-Datenbank, denn die Bitcoin-Brainwallets haben keinen Salt und sie verwenden auch keinen für Passwörter geeigneten, besonders langsamen Hash wie Bcrypt oder Argon2.\n\nWem gehören die 250 gefährdeten Bitcoins?\n\nCastellucci entwickelte zunächst einen einfachen Passwort-Cracker für Brainwallets und nutzte dafür eine Liste mit gängigen Sätzen. Nach kurzer Zeit fand er ein Bitcoin-Konto mit 250 Bitcoins, zur damaligen Zeit etwa 20.000 Dollar. Das dazugehörige Passwort war der Satz ""how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood"".\n\nCastellucci hätte das Geld natürlich stehlen können, doch er wollte den rechtmäßigen Besitzer über die Lücke informieren, was sich als nicht einfach herausstellte. Zusammen mit Dan Kaminsky entwickelte er die Idee, einen kleinen Betrag auf das Konto zu transferieren und anschließend wieder abzubuchen - in der Hoffnung, dass der Besitzer das bemerken und sich melden würde. Allerdings passierte ein Fehler und versehentlich wurde das gesamte Geld auf eine automatisch durch Castelluccis Bitcoin-Client angelegte Adresse abgebucht. Er überwies das Geld anschließend wieder zurück.\n\nLetztendlich gelang es Castellucci auf andere Weise, den Besitzer ausfindig zu machen und zu warnen: Das Geld war durch einen Mining-Pool erzeugt worden, der Betreiber des Mining-Pools war in der Lage, den Kontakt herzustellen.\n\nCode für Passwort-Cracker Brainflayer veröffentlicht\n\nCastellucci entwickelte anschließend die Software Brainflayer, einen optimierten Passwort-Cracker für Bitcoins. Den Quellcode hat er inzwischen auf Github veröffentlicht. Auf einer Amazon-EC-Instanz lassen sich damit für einen Dollar 560 Millionen Passwörter durchprobieren.\n\nBrainflayer ist zwar schneller als bisherige öffentlich bekannte Ansätze, doch Castellucci weist explizit darauf hin, dass er davon ausgeht, dass bessere Tools möglich sind. Die Berechnungen könnten weiter optimiert werden, mittels Grafikkarten, FPGAs oder ASICs könnte man die Geschwindigkeit weiter erhöhen. ASICs, die fürs Bitcoin-Mining optimiert wurden, können allerdings nicht eingesetzt werden. Es werden dort andere Hash-Algorithmen verwendet.\n\nBrainflayer lädt die gesamte Bitcoin-Blockchain herunter und vergleicht Passwort-Hashes mittels eines sogenannten Bloom-Filters mit der Blockchain. Der Bloom-Filter ermöglicht es, in sehr kurzer Zeit alle Bitcoin-Adressen zu prüfen. Die Strategie dabei ist, zunächst mit einem Algorithmus, der in den meisten Fällen eine korrekte Antwort liefert, zu checken. Dieser liefert entweder zuverlässig die Antwort, dass keine Adresse übereinstimmt oder die Antwort, dass wahrscheinlich eine Adresse übereinstimmt. Bei letzterem kann anschließend ein langsamerer Check das Ergebnis prüfen und falsche Treffer aussortieren.\n\nAls Kandidaten für Passwörter nutzte Castellucci nicht nur gängige Wortlisten, sondern auch Sätze. Dafür scannte er Webseiten wie Wikiquote, nutzte kostenlose Bücher vom Projekt Gutenberg, Mailinglisten, Reddit-Posts und Ähnliches. Ergebnisse fanden sich einige.\n\nProfessionelle Bitcoin-Diebe knacken Brainwallets\n\nOffenbar gibt es bereits eine Reihe von Leuten, die professionell nach Accounts mit schwachen Passwörtern suchen. Erst letzte Woche tauchte ein Account mit einem leeren Passwort und 50 Bitcoins auf, etwa 12.000 Euro. Innerhalb von Sekunden wurde das Geld gestohlen. Insgesamt hätte Castellucci mit seinem Tool in den vergangenen Jahren 733 Bitcoins stehlen können, etwa 180.000 Euro. Wie viel davon von anderen gestohlen wurde, ließ sich nicht feststellen.\n\nLaut Castellucci gibt es inzwischen eine Reihe von Personen, die offenbar gezielt nach Bitcoin-Adressen mit schwachen Passwörtern suchen und das Geld sofort stehlen. Diese konkurrieren miteinander und müssen somit alle besonders schnell arbeiten. Mit Brainflayer könnte man hier vermutlich nicht mithalten. Um besonders schnell zu sein, müsste man große Lookup-Tables erstellen, die sofort ein Ergebnis liefern. Accounts mit trivialen Passwörtern bis zu fünf Zeichen, die Castellucci testweise mit kleinen Beträgen anlegte, wurden sofort geleert.\n\nCastellucci geht davon aus, dass nahezu jedes Passwort, das sich ein Mensch selbst ausdenkt, von einem intelligenten Angreifer früher oder später erratbar ist. Er verweist auf einen XKCD-Comic, der Tipps für sichere Passwörter gibt. Demnach soll man sich einen möglichst sinnlosen Satz ausdenken. Brainflayer würde ein entsprechendes Passwort auf einer EC2-Instanz innerhalb einer Woche finden.\n\nAls Alternativen schlägt Castellucci Passwörter vor, die aus von einem Programm zufällig ausgewählten Wörtern bestehen. Sich die zu merken, dürfte allerdings schwieriger sein. Weiterhin gibt es auch Passwort-Wallets, die bessere Passwort-Hash-Funktionen benutzen, WarpWallet etwa nutzt Scrypt. Allerdings: Auch das verlangsamt den Angriff lediglich und schützt nicht vor schlechten Passwörtern. Alles in allem erscheint es mehr als fragwürdig, dass die Brainwallet-Idee überhaupt praktikabel ist.\n\nWarnung bereits vor zwei Jahren\n\nWirklich neu sind die Gefahren von Brainwallets übrigens nicht. Ein Blogpost des Hackers Darren Martyn warnte bereits vor zwei Jahren vor entsprechenden Angriffen. Auch finden sich zahlreiche Berichte über gestohlene Brainwallets in Foren. Auf Reddit berichtete ein bestohlener Nutzer, dass er einen Satz aus einem Gedicht in Afrikaans als Passwort genutzt hatte. Aus der Bitcoin-Community gab es Reaktionen, die die Gefahren bestritten und meinten, man müsse lediglich ein gutes Passwort wählen. In welchem Ausmaß Menschen schlechte Passwörter wählen, scheint offenbar für viele nicht vorstellbar.\n\nCastelluccis Warnungen, untermauert mit einem praktisch einsetzbaren Tool, werden offenbar ernster genommen. Die Webseite brainwallet.org wurde kurz nach dem Vortrag offline genommen und zeigt im Moment nur noch die Meldung ""Closed Permanently"" (dauerhaft geschlossen) an.']"
08/10/2015,"['Throughout history, legislation and regulations pertaining thereto have been passed amid significant dissent. The Bitlicense proposal, from start to finish, might serve as a thorough example, leaving out none of the telltale characteristics:\n\nFriday, professional trader-friendly Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex announced to clients residing in New York that all remaining deposits would be liquidated to cash at then-market rates on Friday. Fundamentally, Bitfinex expressed dissent concerning the Bitlicense’s passage and the new requirements made as a result. Its inevitable conclusion was that its business model was no longer compatible with the State of New York’s financial hall monitors.\n\nDue to financial regulation changes in the State of New York, certain Bitfinex services are no longer available for New York Residents. […] Bitfinex is not applying for a BitLicense at this time. Accordingly, Bitfinex is modifying account privileges for New York Residents, effective August 10th, 2015.\n\nSunday, San Francisco-based exchange Kraken, who brought on compliance veteran Howard Bernstein in May, announced that it, too, would no longer be offering its services to New York-based clients. Kraken illuminated the issue with a list of clear reasons for declining to apply for a Bitlicense, as well as the following creative epithet.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Exchange BitFinex’ Hot Wallet Hacked\n\nWhile we’re sure that the protection from New York law enforcement is valuable, it comes at a price that exceeds the market opportunity of servicing New York residents.

Virtual currency, like bitcoin provides a good example.""\n\nCurry said the agency has put together a working group that will ""develop a framework to evaluate new and innovative financial products and services"".\n\n""We have a team with representatives from across the agency – policy experts, examiners, lawyers, and others – considering this question,"" he said. ""We’re still early in the process, so I can’t tell you exactly where we’ll end up.""\n\nCurry added one result could be the creation of an office dedicated to financial innovation.\n\nMoving away from the banking sector\n\nNotably, Curry acknowledged during his speech that financial technology is largely being developed outside regulated entities like banks.\n\nHe said:\n\n""There are a number of reasons why that’s so, but the one that’s of most concern to me is the perception that it’s too difficult to get new ideas through the regulatory approval process.""\n\nThe working group, he said, was launched ""to address that perception – and any reality that might lie behind it"". He also called on regulators to ""view new ideas with an open mind and not dismiss them as either sorcery or voodoo"".\n\nCurry noted in his speech that he sees a ""transformation"" continuing to take place outside the banking sector that could lead to new products and services, particularly those geared toward the underbanked.\n\n""I’m betting that much of that transformation will take place inside the traditional banking system, and I want the OCC to be ready to deal with it,"" he said.\n\nThe agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nImage Credit: Mark Van Scyoc / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Joshua Aaron, a friend of Mr. Murgio and one of his college classmates from Florida State, also came to the attention of the F.B.I. early on.\n\nMr. Aaron was one of three men charged by prosecutors in Manhattan with operating a series of schemes to pump up the prices of otherwise worthless stocks who also is said to have some link to the JPMorgan attack. Two of those men were arrested in Israel on the day that Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev were arrested in Florida.\n\nMr. Aaron, who moved to Israel several years ago, could not be arrested at his home in Tel Aviv because he was out of the country. Mr. Aaron, 31, is thought to be staying in Russia with his wife, Alona Chaim Aaron, an Israeli citizen, based on social media posts from several weeks ago.

Both men have been detained by Israeli authorities at the request of federal prosecutors since their arrest on July 21.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein had asked for the men to be released from prison and confined to home arrest. Israeli prosecutors had wanted both men held for an additional 40 days.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFederal prosecutors are beginning to seek to extradite Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein to New York. But the process could take months.\n\nAs with Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev, neither Mr. Aaron nor his associates in Israel are facing any charges arising out of apparent theft of information from JPMorgan.\n\nThe authorities have declined to discuss what led them to conclude Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron might have some information about the JPMorgan attack. People briefed on the matter said that Mr. Aaron might have used information gathered in the breach, like purloined email addresses and customer home addresses, to put together a list of potential victims to pitch the stocks for their various schemes.\n\nPeople familiar with stock manipulation schemes said a high-quality list of email addresses — like the customer contact information taken from JPMorgan — could sell for several million dollars on the black market.\n\nMr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron were known to have visited Russia in the last few years. The authorities suspect the actual hackers may be in Russia or another European country.\n\nFederal authorities are under some pressure to develop information that could lead to the filing of charges related to the breach, especially against Mr. Aaron, Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein, now that charges have been filed against them with regards to the stock manipulation. Legal experts said once a defendant was extradited from a foreign country it was difficult to file new charges against that person, especially if the charges arose from a different offense.\n\nThe time constraint facing authorities then would seem to give leverage to anyone charged in either case but willing to take a plea and provide evidence linking the crimes to the attack."", ""Reuben Bramanathan is associate counsel at Coinbase and Lecturer of Digital Currency Regulation at the University of Nicosia. He was involved with a number of submissions to the Australian Senate inquiry. Here, he explains the importance of the Senate Economics References Committee Report on Digital Currencies and what it means for bitcoin.\n\nThe release of the Senate Economics References Committee Report on Digital Currencies marks the start of the next phase for bitcoin in Australia.\n\nThe 74-page report, which is the result of 10 months of hearings, submissions and research by the committee, will serve as the roadmap for regulation of bitcoin and other digital currencies in Australia.\n\nIt is the first comprehensive analysis of digital currencies in the context of the Australian legal and financial system, and it indicates the government is focused on the huge potential impact of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTop five things you need to know about the report\n\nIt is a committee report, which contains a number of recommendations, but it has not been adopted by the government, and there are no changes to laws or regulations yet.\n\nThere is a clear statement of intent to fix the Goods and Services Tax (GST) problem for bitcoin, but the process it will take some time.\n\nExchanging bitcoin for fiat or other digital currencies does not require any license in Australia, and nor does holding bitcoin on behalf of others. However, providing payment processing or remittance services using digital currency may require an Australian Financial Services Licence.\n\nAnti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws currently do not apply to digital currencies, but this is likely to change as part of an ongoing review of AML/CTF laws.\n\nOverall, the report recommends a ‘wait-and-see’ approach, notes the importance of balanced regulation and encourages self-regulation in the meantime.\n\nTaxation of bitcoin in Australia\n\nBy far the most important aspect of the report is the committee’s recommendation that the GST law should be changed to include digital currencies within the definitions of ‘money’ and ‘financial supply’. This would mean that GST would not apply to bitcoin exchange transactions, and it would only apply once when bitcoin is used to pay for goods or services.\n\nHowever, this type of change to the GST law would need to be approved by each state, in addition to being legislated by the Federal Parliament. This is a lengthy and political process, and bitcoin is not currently a high priority for federal or state governments. One beacon of hope is the ongoing review of the federal tax system, which may result in broader changes to the GST, and the recommended bitcoin changes could be pushed through together with those changes.\n\nHowever, this means Australian bitcoin businesses are stuck with the current double-GST problem for the immediate future.\n\nAnother unresolved problem is Fringe Benefits Tax, which applies to an employer who pays their employees in bitcoin. This remains a problem for bitcoin startups and their employees who want to avoid the friction of multiple bitcoin/AUD conversions. Addressing this issue needs to be a priority to promote growth of the bitcoin ecosystem in Australia.\n\nLicensing requirements\n\nAustralia’s corporate and securities regulator, ASIC, has issued a clear statement that bitcoin is not considered a financial product, which means that no licence is required to exchange bitcoin, or hold bitcoin on behalf of others. The report supports this view and recommends that further research should be undertaken before any changes are made in this area.\n\nHowever, the areas of payments processing and remittance are less clear. A business operating a payments or remittance service involving bitcoin could be regulated as a ‘non-cash payment facility’, which requires an Australian Financial Services License, or needs to rely on a low-value exemption.\n\nThe report endorses industry self-regulation, to develop best practice guidelines and standards for digital currency businesses in Australia. It will be important that these are developed in consultation with the entire industry to provide appropriate guidelines for the different types of business models.\n\nAML and KYC requirements\n\nCurrently, bitcoin is not subject to AML/CTF laws in Australia, including know-your-customer (KYC) checks and transaction monitoring and reporting.\n\nThe report recommends that the ongoing review of Australia’s AML/CTF laws should consider whether to broaden the laws to include activities involving bitcoin and other digital currencies. The most likely outcome is that, consistent with the approach from around the world (most recently announced in the UK and Singapore) the AML/CTF laws will be expanded to digital currency exchanges.\n\nAlthough KYC checks are not required at this stage, the report also notes a problem for bitcoin startups which want to voluntarily conduct KYC (for example to prevent fraud and to help strengthen their banking relationships) – they cannot access the Document Verification Service and have to rely on other sources for KYC.\n\nThe report notes the difficulty Australian bitcoin businesses are experiencing in establishing and maintaining banking relationships, but, apart from bringing bitcoin businesses under the AML/CTF laws, does not make any real recommendations about how this problem could be addressed.\n\nOverall good news for bitcoin in Australia\n\nThe report is a strong endorsement of the potential of digital currency in Australia. Although the GST issue remains a problem, many bitcoin businesses have already adopted business models which do not attract GST.\n\nImportantly, there is no risk of a BitLicense-type regulation in Australia anytime soon.\n\nWith a generally tech- and mobile-savvy population and a strong banking system, Australia is becoming an attractive target market for global bitcoin businesses.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are Reuben Bramanathan's, they do not necessarily represent those of the companies he works for.\n\nSydney image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Recently Santander InnoVentures and other financial firms launched a call to action to banks, financial institutions and financial technology businesses to work together to reboot the banking and financial services industry.\n\nWhile seasoned financial professionals like Schlaefer are founding or joining Bitcoin startups, banks and Wall Street companies are fishing for top talent in Bitcoin waters, Reuters reports. In June, online bitcoin job ads surged to a record high of 306.\n\nReuters notes that Schlaefer probably would make more money at Goldman, but what attracts him and other migrants from Wall Street is the ability to be part of the growth in Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology.\n\n“A lot of people are entering the Bitcoin space as the sector has reached an overall level of funding that’s hard to ignore,” said Coinsetter founder and CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz, who moved to the Bitcoin world in late 2012 from private equity firm The CapStreet Group.\n\nTotal investments in Bitcoin companies for 2015 – totaling $375.4 million in the first six months – have already exceeded 2014’s total of $339.4 million. According to Tomasz Tunguz, a partner at venture capital firm Redpoint, Bitcoin is the fastest growing area of startup investment in 2015, but it is still relatively underfunded, which makes it an ideal investment target for venture capitalists and institutional players alike.\n\nIn fact, as recently reported by Bitcoin Magazine, major financial players such as Citi, UBS and Barclays are exploring the blockchain, while a BNP Paribas analyst is persuaded that the blockchain could revolutionize finance. According to the Santander Innoventures report “The Fintech 2.0 Paper: Rebooting financial services,” blockchain-based technology could save banks $20 billion per year by 2022.\n\nOther top financial professionals who made the jump to Bitcoin mentioned in the Reuters article are Paul Chou, founder and chief executive officer of Ledger X (formerly at Goldman Sachs), and Henri Chan, chief operating officer at digital wallet platform Airbitz (formerly at Deutsche Bank, UBS and Morgan Stanley).\n\nFormer JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive Blythe Masters, the creator of the modern credit default swap, (a derivative used to trade credit risks), who now heads blockchain company Digital Asset Holdings, is not mentioned in the Reuters article but is probably the best known financial heavyweight now active in the blockchain space. At the recent Exponential Finance 2015 conference in New York, Masters said that the market for financial blockchain applications ultimately will be measured in the trillions.\n\n“How seriously should you take [the blockchain]?” Masters asked. “About as seriously as you should have taken the concept of the Internet in the early 1990s. It’s a big deal.”', 'It’s never too early to teach children about Bitcoin. Parents everywhere are teaching their youth about digital currencies. When kids are learning math, code and consensus, the financial system of the past has something to worry about.\n\nMy children are two and six and they both know Bitcoin quite well. My youngest can say many of the terminologies involved with the virtual currency, while my six-year-old can understand it even more. Discussions on the topic of Bitcoin are a regular occurrence in our household. Discussions ranging from understanding what a cryptocurrency is, to its scarcity and digital storage. My children have a further grasp on the subject than most adults. Of course, like learning any foreign language, being younger always helps.\n\nWith games like Minecraft, Counter Strike and Spells of Genesis all now accepting digital currencies, it’s no wonder kids are hearing about Bitcoin. Their favorite games contain the use of exchanging digital currency for special achievements, weapons and skins for their customized gaming experience.\n\nYou can’t slip a dollar bill through the Xbox console, children understand this. An online token of value is needed to acquire the certain objectives the players want in the game and Bitcoin is the natural choice. With Microsoft and Xbox Live accepting BTC as payment, now children from all over the world can participate in this economy in their own way.\n\n[tweet_box design=”default”]It’s never too early to teach children about Bitcoin. When kids are learning math, code and consensus, the financial system of the past has something to worry about.[/tweet_box]\n\nChildren are eager to learn and do this faster than adults. A child is more open to certain concepts when they are not flooded with beliefs and bias. Understanding Bitcoin is no different as lots of children are quickly learning how to send and receive the currency.\n\nBut what are they learning actually?\n\nWell, they are learning how to keep strong passwords and addresses safe from the public eye. Learning to manage their virtual assets online like they manage their skins and mods. Children are learning the speed and fluid action of Bitcoin and how they can receive gratification to their online experience instantly. They discover how to operate and transact with value and be responsible with it from a young age. One of the most important aspects is it provides kids with a sense of independence.\n\nBitcoin gives us all sovereignty and independence. From young children to the elderly, we can all benefit from the use of the digital currency.\n\nImportant aspects that are known to both adults and kids are the three core attributes of the protocol: these are decentralization, open source code, and peer-to-peer applications. Children are more apt to pick up these fundamentals from an early age. These three concepts are now defaults in most of the up and coming online applications, with the youth at the helm of all its design.\n\nChildren like decentralization and not being tethered to a central authority. We all know what it’s like or have seen how independent kids can be. Bitcoin is a great application for kids to understand that there is no authority to the application. No boss or parent figure telling the network what to do. This may be appealing to children who see their parents’ money buy less and get taxed through centralization.\n\nWith the inflation of fiat currency, adults unknowingly must purchase less goods for their kids because the current currency is devalued. With taxation from a central authority point, the youth see their parents hard earned wealth dissipate to certain forced entities. What children in this world actually like to have less buying power? When parents are unable to afford things this may create conflicts between children and adults. Scarcity and saving incentives offered by Bitcoin give the cryptocurrency an edge over its fiat competitor.\n\nOpen source code and opening data globally is becoming widely known for its great incentives. Children are becoming aware and quickly learning educational techniques from open source information. In this age they can simply go online to learn their favorite video game move or learn how to code their own.\n\nBeing able to access code, data, and analyzed research is helpful to everyone. Children see this and are expanding this social network of learning exponentially. Seeing a currency’s code that can be worked on and democratically updated is appealing to the youth of today. There is no age limit or regulated licensing involved with being a young developer. Bitcoin’s core code and decisions rest on the network’s user base. This would include children and teenagers using the virtual currency.\n\nThe peer-to-peer evolution is happening drastically and children are the most integrated. From the use of the social media apps and sharing protocol online, people of all ages are able to swap their favorite things. From MP3s to their favorite ebook and now even money. Being able to exchange value online has become a trend for the young generation and continues to find new supporters.\n\nThroughout the elaborate play of video games and file sharing, kids learn external subjects as well. While using Bitcoin, children may discuss how the protocol works and operates, learning the underlying math that goes along with the digital currency. They could possibly get to meet the characters of public and private keys.\n\nFor the first time in history a form of money is able to be exchanged without a central authority. Just as skateboards, hip-hop and the internet changed our culture, Bitcoin will do the same. The protocol is just as exciting as all of these things and will be relevant for generations and years to come. The youth are learning math and consensus through adoption at an early age. With this new education in time these children will be the sole contributors to the network.\n\nTeaching kids about Bitcoin and the attributes of the blockchain is an excellent idea. It teaches them more about the three previously listed core values, which all of them relate to daily.\n\nDigital currency is the future of money\n\nChildren should all know the fundamentals of digital money, which will give them more inclusiveness and opportunities. Seeing how the uber-esque sharing economy and Bitcoin’s unique application power affect their lives will greatly emulate throughout the world and to generations to come. When you think about it, Bitcoin is no different than the skateboard revolution and Nirvana’s music, all changing our global culture.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, 99Bitcoins.', ""CoinTelegraph spoke with Jose Rodriguez, the VP of payments at Bitso, a Mexican based Bitcoin exchange, payment processor and Ripple Gateway, on the country’s cryptocurrency prospects, and whether BBVA could be the most bitcoin-friendly bank.\n\nBBVA’s Innovation Center is not only one of the first to publish a cryptocurrency tutorial on YouTube, but was also part of the investors in the US$75m funding round for Coinbase in addition to hosting an Open Talent challenge where 10 of the 50 finalists are Bitcoin and Blockchain based startups, which included Bitso.\n\nAdditionally, seven months ago BBVA Ventures’ Jay Rainemann said that they needed to better understand the industry and how merchants and consumers interact with bitcoin. This, along with the success of the First Latin American Forum on Virtual Currencies in the Financial and Regulatory Environment, the current trend is looking very bright for Bitcoin’s future.\n\nBitcoin is certainly not a new thing for BBVA, since as early as April 2013 the bank has released online material describing what bitcoins are, how they have evolved and what risks are associated. BBVA has also offered one of the conference rooms for the upcoming Mexican bitconf and have sponsored the second edition of the Digital Currency Summit in Madrid back on April 23.\n\nCT: What do you think about BBVA’s Bitcoin Friendliness?\n\nJose Rodriguez: I love it, I’ve met them at events all over Mexico. They like it and they are really updated as to what we and their investments are doing. I’m surprised at how friendly, open and interested they’re in this technology. It goes lengths to show this the amount of Bitcoin companies that are among the finalists. They even offered us the BBVA center at some new offices they’re about to open, to host this December’s bitconf.\n\n“I’m surprised at how friendly, open and interested [BBVA is] in this technology.”\n\nCT: How long have you guys been around?\n\nJR: With Bitcoin almost three years as a speaker and investing, two years organizing meetups; and 3 months in Bitso after the acquisition of Unisend Mexico. We had already collaborated earlier with meetups, conferences and keynote talks. Also I invited them when I talked with Banco de México last year.\n\nCT: How do you see Mexico’s prospects regarding cryptocurrency?\n\nJR: We still need more developments, we’re not even 10 Bitcoin companies in Mexico. We have worked a lot promoting it on media, universities and conferences to accelerate its adoption. We have seen some results.\n\nCT: What about Bitso?\n\nJR: With Bitcoin and Ripple, we’re a Ripple gateway and have developed B2B solutions for international payments. Right now, several remittance, service payment and cross-border payment companies are using Bitso as a bridge towards the Mexican Peso. This is where we see great potential and opportunities for growth.\n\nCT: Do you think Mexico has an innate advantage for Bitcoin adoption? You don’t have Argentine level inflation to help you. What’s the immediate advantage for some bitcoins over there?\n\nJR: No, here it would be more of a costs and efficiency thing. As a currency not so much, as a means or system yes. Except for last month where the peso has seen a great depreciation, it was stable so it wasn’t that much of a refuge.\n\nCT: Can you imagine a future where each bank issues their own coins?\n\nJR: Citi is trying to, and most of the bank's money is electronic, so it makes sense. Whether it is for listing financial products, to manage them or to have better internal control in banks such as Citi or BBVA that operate in several countries and have budgets they need to “dollarize.”"", 'More and more companies are tapping into the Asian market when it comes to financial technology investment, as the region has seen growth in remittances while some countries have weak banking sectors. This opens up a market gap that could make room for bitcoin opportunities later on.\n\nJust recently, startup Apis was able to raise $150 million in funding for its private equity house focused on investing in financial services across Africa and South Asia. Apis Partners was founded a year ago and has started deploying capital while seeking more investors.\n\nBitcoin Opportunities in Asia\n\nWith that, Apis Partners can be able to put some of its capital in bitcoin startups in the region. As it is, most of the cryptocurrency companies are seeking to fill gaps in traditional banking sector or to offer money remittance services that are more cost efficient.\n\nIn Indonesia, Blossom is offering halal or Islam-approved loans for Muslims who are not allowed to take interest-bearing loans. In the Philippines, startups like Palarin are able to facilitate money transfers at lower fees compared to credit or debit card transactions.\n\nAccording to FT, the speed of Apis’s fundraising underlines how backers of private equity are increasingly keen on funds that are devoted to specific sectors and untapped niches and markets. Apis itself aims to back rising players in finance, investment, insurance, and other sectors.\n\n“We felt the real sweet spot for financial services in emerging markets was $20m to $40m, using growth equity rather than buyout capital,” said Udayan Goyal, co-founder of Apis. “People now understand you can’t be a jack of all trades.

08/11/2015,"['If you haven\'t been paying attention to Bitcoin because you don\'t understand how a digital currency might be relevant to your business, you might want to reconsider.\n\nIt\'s unlikely that Bitcoin will replace the dollar, pound, Euro, or yen anytime soon (or ever). However, you\'re still going to be hearing a lot more about it. That\'s not because people are willing to consider it money. What\'s most interesting about Bitcoin actually has very little to do with money — and everything to do with its underlying technology, known as the blockchain, which could challenge our assumptions about what makes commerce secure and trustworthy.\n\nIn a blog post last year, Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman dismissed Bitcoin as a fever dream for anti-government partisans. Still, he agreed that ""[I]t does indeed solve an interesting information problem — although it’s not at all clear whether solving that problem has any economic value.""\n\nHowever, leading names in finance say the blockchain is the economic value. They say that blockchain technology could very well transform the world in the next decade. What\'s more, they make the provocative claim that anyone who fails to pay attention today risks being caught as flat-footed as those who failed to see the potential of the Internet.\n\nBehind the blockchain\n\nThe details are complex and large amounts of computing power and cryptography are required, but The Economist\'s simplified explanation covers the basics. Think of the blockchain as a sequential spreadsheet of transactions, constantly updated on a global network of computers, which serves as a distributed ledger. The ledger is encrypted as it\'s being written so the transactions it contains can be safely verified by legions of other computers across the network.\n\nEssentially, the blockchain is the long sought-after solution a logic puzzle known as the ""Byzantine Generals Problem"". A general in the Byzantine army sends orders via messenger to other generals about whether to attack an enemy. However, every general knows that one or more of them is a traitor. How can any general be sure that, after receiving an order to attack, the same order was sent to the others and he’s not being ordered to attack on his own? Or that the other generals will faithfully give the correct order to their troops, and not try to undermine the plan? Until now, there’s been no solution that didn’t require introducing a trusted third party who can guarantee to everyone\'s satisfaction that an order is authentic.\n\nSimilarly, this is why third-party institutions like banks must exist in today’s economy. Banks provide the high levels of trust required to verify financial transactions. They guarantee that parties legitimately have the money they claim to possess, that they follow through on commitments to transfer ownership, and that these transactions cannot be reversed or otherwise subverted.\n\nWhy is the blockchain disruptive?\n\nThe blockchain removes the need for a trusted third party to guarantee a transaction. By combining distributed architecture with powerful encryption, the blockchain itself coordinates agreement among all the parties in a transaction — and does so in a way that\'s highly resistant to interference.\n\nThe process is simple, yet sophisticated: The entries in a digital ledger are created and protected with cryptography that becomes increasingly secure the more people participate in it. In the case of Bitcoin, individuals are paid (through mining or small transaction fees) for their work in verifying blockchain transactions. With tens of thousands of individuals verifying every transaction, colluding to subvert things becomes so expensive and difficult that there\'s simply no point in trying. Thus, rewards for honest behavior are built into the system, while dishonest behavior isn\'t rewarded.\n\nIronically, this has made Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (as the blockchain is called when applied to money) more attractive to criminals. As a recent story in the New York Times points out, cryptocurrency transactions can easily serve as the digital equivalent of the briefcase full of unmarked cash: decentralized, unalterable, and irreversible.\n\nStill, blockchain technology itself is no more inherently criminal than a banknote. Just the opposite, in fact. Because the ownership and provenance of a transaction can be embedded in the blockchain at the earliest stages of the transaction and verified at every subsequent stage, it has direct relevance to any transaction that needs to be secure and verifiable. Examples include:\n\nvalidating the authenticity and accuracy of a broad range of documents: voter IDs, birth certificates, passports, wills, contracts, criminal records, medical records, building permits, health and safety inspections, business licenses, vehicle registrations, and many more\n\nestablishing and clarifying land rights ( Honduras began creating land titles based on blockchain technology in May 2015)\n\nenabling trade in stocks and bonds\n\nestablishing ownership and provenance of all kinds of intellectual property\n\nmanaging ownership of and access to physical items, from homes to vehicles to safe deposit boxes\n\nreleasing funds in transactions only when certain conditions are met, e.g., when a document is filed appropriately or a third-party consents\n\nverifying the chain of custody of sensitive data\n\nmanaging software and hardware licenses\n\nprotecting patents, copyrights, and trademarks\n\nIn an increasingly insecure world with a multiplicity of bad actors eager to interfere with transactions for power and profit, blockchain technology creates a highly tamper-resistant structure that can make almost any kind of transaction secure and verifiable. Despite the controversies, the blockchain model of trust, through massively distributed digital consensus, is a breakthrough that could reshape commerce across the entire digital economy.\n\nTo learn more about how exponential technology will affect business and life, go to SAP Digital Futures. This article also appeared in SAP Business Trends\n\nFollow me on Twitter', 'Labor Market Tacks on 215,000 Jobs Getty Images What Happened:\n\n\n\nThe U.S. economy managed to create 215,000 jobs last month, slightly below the 235,000-addition trend seen over the last three months. Revisions to job numbers from May and June also added about 14,000 more jobs to the labor market than were originally reported.\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate and labor force participation rate were both unchanged from June, at 5.3 percent and 62.6 percent, respectively. And the number of people no longer in the workforce increased by 144,000.\n\n\n\nAverage hourly earnings ticked up 5 cents in July to $24.99 and are now up 2.1 percent year over year.\n\n\n\nWhat It Means:\n\n\n\n""There is nothing in the report that should dissuade the [Federal Open Market Committee] from their initial [interest] rate increase in September,"" Scott Anderson, senior vice president and chief economist at Bank of the West, told U.S. News Friday in an email. ""With only one more employment report before the September FOMC meeting, it would probably take a sharp slowdown in job growth in August ... or even negative job growth for the FOMC to delay their initial rate hike until December.""\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates in either September or December, and many economists are leaning toward the September time frame. It\'s no secret that Fed officials watch the Labor Department\'s monthly jobs reports closely, and Friday\'s report was – while not stellar – still good enough to keep a fall rate hike on track.\n\n\n\nJob additions slowed but were still above 200,000. Earnings ticked up modestly. The labor force participation rate didn\'t get any worse. And unemployment was unchanged. Unless any major indicators plummet in the next month or so, September is shaping up to be a likely liftoff point.\n\n\n\n""The language in the [Fed\'s most recent policy] statement suggests that it is confident that it is close to, if not already achieving, its employment goal,"" Joseph Lake, global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told U.S. News Friday in an email. ""The sooner the Fed moves, the more room it creates to take action during the next downturn."" SEC: Companies Must Disclose Pay Ratio\n\nSEC: Companies Must Disclose Pay Ratio (The Associated Press) What Happened:\n\n\n\nThe SEC\'s five commissioners, in a tight 3-2 vote Wednesday, elected to adopt a new regulation that will require public companies to disclose how wide the gap is between their CEOs\' compensation and the salaries of median employees.\n\n\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was signed more than five years ago, called on public companies to unveil a ratio comparing CEO and median worker pay. But the act didn\'t set a specific deadline for the ratio\'s adoption, which has allowed opponents to drag out the rule\'s implementation.\n\n\n\nWhat It Means:\n\n\n\nThe regulation\'s adoption has been hailed by many as a victory for transparency. Companies will be required to disclose the new pay ratio during their first fiscal year following Jan. 1, 2017.\n\n\n\n""Chief executives in the United States are paid over 300 times the median, according to many accounts, while other competitive economies have far lower ratios. This same ratio was closer to 40 in the 1980s and closer to 20 in the 1950s,"" Darren Rosenblum, a law professor at Pace Law School in White Plains, New York, said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\n\nBut opponents of the rule\'s adoption have said it\'s not the SEC\'s place to pay-shame chief executives.\n\n\n\n""To steal a line from [Supreme Court Justice Antonin] Scalia, this is pure applesauce,"" SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher said in a dissenting statement Wednesday. ""And yet here we are, on the cusp of adopting a nakedly political rule that hijacks the SEC\'s disclosure regime to once again effect social change desired by ideologues and special interest groups."" Trade Deficit Expands\n\nTrade Deficit Expands Eric Gay/AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nAmerica\'s trade deficit ballooned to $43.8 billion in June, up $2.9 billion from May\'s revised $40.9 billion shortfall, according to a Bureau of Economic Analysis report released Wednesday.\n\n\n\nJune exports ticked down slightly to $188.6 billion, while imports climbed 1.2 percent to $232.4 billion. The nation\'s trade deficit currently sits 0.6 percent higher than where it was a year ago.\n\n\n\nWhat It Means:\n\n\n\n""For the last three years, the trade balance has been zig-zagging around its current level,"" Patrick Newport, an economist and director of long-term forecasting at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a research note Wednesday, citing America\'s strong dollar as an exacerbating factor to the trade deficit. ""Going forward, for the next two years, we expect net exports to be a drag on growth.""\n\n\n\nImports are an overall drag on economic expansion, while exports bolster gross domestic product figures. Still, while rising import levels aren\'t necessarily a bad thing and can be a sign of rising consumer spending in the U.S., June\'s weaker-than-expected export numbers undoubtedly disappointed analysts. The good news, however, is that May\'s deficit was revised down about 2.4 percent from an originally reported $41.9 billion.\n\n\n\n""With the wider trade deficit in June, but the revision to the May deficit, the report is roughly neutral for second-quarter growth,"" Gus Faucher, senior vice president and macroeconomist with The PNC Financial Services Group, wrote in a research note Wednesday. Puerto Rico Defaults on Bond Debt\n\nPuerto Rico Defaults on Bond Debt Ricardo Arduengo/AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nPuerto Rico on Monday missed a scheduled $58 million debt repayment, effectively plunging the U.S. territory into default.\n\n\n\nThe island faces roughly $72 billion in outstanding debt, which it managed to rack up over the years by issuing an unsustainable amount of municipal bonds. Investors across the country flocked to Puerto Rican bonds, in part because of their so-called triple tax exemption that circumvents income taxation at the federal, state and local level.\n\n\n\nWhat It Means:\n\n\n\nSome analysts speculate Puerto Rico had the money to make the $58 million payment but defaulted to draw creditors to the negotiating table. Puerto Rican officials have expressed concerns in recent weeks about the island\'s cash reserves, but the liquidity shortage isn\'t expected to be a serious problem until November. Few can blame the island\'s leaders, but it seems Puerto Rico is prioritizing its people over its payments.\n\n\n\n""Regardless of the fact that the Constitution of Puerto Rico does not specifically guarantee this payment, it is the moral obligation of our government [to pay its debts], at the very least,"" Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico\'s nonvoting delegate in Congress, said Monday in an interview with CNBC\'s Kate Kelly.\n\n\n\nPuerto Rican officials are attempting to negotiate a haircut with bondholders, and there is talk of extending Chapter 9 bankruptcy to the territory\'s municipalities and public corporations (though little progress has been made on either front).\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, two of the island\'s primary bondholders, OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers, sent a letter Wednesday to the Puerto Rico Public Finance Corporation\'s president demanding payment.\n\n\n\n""The path that the current administration has chosen will steer Puerto Rico towards litigation and create further deterioration in the capital markets\' trust in Puerto Rico, potentially leading to years of economic turmoil for the people of Puerto Rico,"" the letter said. ""Not only is this failure to pay unprecedented in modern times, it also violates the requirements of Puerto Rican law."" Auto Sales Surge as Consumer Spending Expands', 'Tampa resident Anthony Murgio appeared in a Manhattan court Monday to face federal charges that he ran an illegal Bitcoin money exchange and is thought to have information about last summer\'s hacker attack against JPMorgan Chase, the New York Times reports.\n\nTampa Bay Times readers may recognize the name Anthony Murgio from earlier coverage in July that said authorities accused him of involvement in laundering cash for criminals.\n\nThe federal complaint says Murgio, 31, registered the domain Coin.mx, which he used to host a business that exchanged cash for bitcoins, an anonymous form of Internet-only currency, beginning in late 2013. Investigators say Murgio and his co-conspirators knowingly exchanged cash for bitcoins for thousands of victims of online ransom-ware attacks by Russian hackers. The cyberattacks locked users\' computers and Murgio would then unlock those computers for a price — enabling the criminals responsible to receive proceeds from their crimes, according to investigators.\n\nAppearing in court Monday, Murgio remained silent. His high-profile attorney is Greg Kehoe of the Greenberg Traurig firm. He is a former defender and prosecutor of international war criminals whose work includes time on a tribunal facing former Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\nMonday\'s Manhattan court hearing was brief. Murgio ""has run a number of less-than-successful businesses since graduating from Florida State University,"" the New York Times stated. He remains free on $100,000 bond, but faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of money laundering.\n\nNews reports say Murgio is the son of Palm Beach County School Board member Mike Murgio.\n\nMurgio does not face charges related to the JPMorgan hack last year but federal authorities believe the FSU business graduate and a fellow FSU fraternity Phi Sigma Kappa brother have knowledge of the incident. Both young men, according to a Bloomberg profile this week, were determined to become successful entrepreneurs.\n\nContact Robert Trigaux at [email protected]', 'Blockchain technology could be used to bypass today\'s centralised financial infrastructure entirely, according to a report by BBVA Research US.\n\nThe report, titled Blockchain Technology: The Ultimate Disruption in the Financial System notes that the application of blockchain technology would first be useful in the payments space, where it would eradicate the need for any intermediaries and significantly reduce costs for banks.\n\nHowever, decentralised public ledgers could disrupt the financial system as a whole, adds the report. ""Given that the majority of financial assets such as bonds, equities, derivatives and loans are already electronic it may be possible that someday the entire system is replaced by a decentralised structure.""\n\nTouching upon smart contracts, the report also noted how being able to register and trade assets on a decentralised register increases efficiency.\n\nIt adds:\n\n""In this environment, the current system where financial institutions record individual\'s accounts in a centralised fashion and the bank\'s reserves are stored by the central bank would be replaced by the \'Internet of money\' or the \'Internet of finance\' – a fully decentralised financial system.""\n\nChallenges and risks\n\nThe possibility of a decentralised public ledger replacing the current centralised system, the report says, also comes with various risks and challenges.\n\nFirstly, a decentralised system would have to offer the same or a higher level of trust and protection than the current centralised financial structure.\n\nFor this to happen, the report explains the decentralised system would have to concentrate a ""massive amount"" of computer power and in turn be able to cope with the huge energy consumption required to support it.\n\nFurthermore, the decentralised system would also have to deal with legal and regulatory concerns, as well as with matters of national security, such as money laundering, fraud, tax evasion or terrorism.\n\nThe report notes that digital currencies could also suffer price volatility, which could have sizeable negative effects. ""These shocks could generate systemic risk and severe economic downturns ... in this scenario, monetary policy would not be able to respond effectively if it fails to boost demand among a large share of economic agents that use digital currencies.""\n\nThe risks aside, BBVA Compass believes blockchain technology has a bright future ahead. Its report concludes:\n\n""Therefore, the key question is not how, but when the disruption will become far-reaching. As other industries that have been transformed by new technologies and digitisation, blockchain technology could reshape the financial industry well beyond the payments system.""\n\nBBVA and crypto\n\nBBVA Research is the economic research department of BBVA Group, but this is not the first time the global Spanish banking group has entered the crypto arena.\n\nBBVA Ventures, the private equity branch of BBVA, participated in Coinbase\'s $75m Series C funding round – the biggest investment in a bitcoin company at the time.\n\nJust recently, BBVA\'s Open Talent competition – a global fintech startup competition – included nine crypto startups in its three regional finals.\n\nBBVA Innovation Center also posted an online tutorial to inform consumers on the uses of digital currencies and give them a better idea of where these could be purchased.\n\nBBVA mage via Hadrian / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While other stakeholders will help legitimise cryptocurrencies, ""[their] full potential ... may be realised only when the market makes the leap from the hands of investors into the hands of consumers,"" it reads.\n\nNear-term challenges\n\nBefore adoption can happen, PwC outlines a number of near-term challenges that cryptocurrencies must overcome.\n\nBitcoin, for example, is simultaneously a currency, a financial asset and a technology protocol. Because of this, there is a danger the industry could \'splinter\' in different directions, and fast, the report says.\n\nThis classification issue is also likely to discourage larger, risk-averse firms from using cryptocurrencies, as they will want to avoid violating SEC, CFTC or IRS regulations.\n\nIn conjunction with its report, PwC released the results of its survey of US consumers. Some 83% of respondents said they were \'slightly\' or \'not at all\' familiar with cryptocurrencies, while only 3% had used them in the last year.\n\nThis is in line with other surveys, which indicate cryptocurrencies are yet to appeal as a user-friendly service.

The Committee released its report last week, with a particular focus on tax.\n\nLast year, the ATO published several rulings outlining how bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies should be treated under the Australian income tax and GST regimes.\n\nThe rulings provided useful clarity on bitcoin’s tax treatment, but the ATO’s approach received widespread criticism.\n\nBitcoin purportedly functions as money, but the ATO rulings treat bitcoin as a commodity for tax purposes. This disparity creates a number of tax inconsistencies.\n\nThe impact is particularly acute under the GST regime, where bitcoin transactions are taxed as barter transactions. Australia’s GST regime applies somewhat clumsily to barter transactions, which may cause double taxation, or at least double tax administration, as we emphasised in our submission.\n\nWhy should the law be changed?\n\nImposing 10% GST on bitcoin transactions increases the price of purchasing bitcoin from Australian vendors, affecting the commercial viability of operating a digital currency business in Australia, as we have highlighted before. Submissions to the inquiry outlined the potential benefits the industry could offer Australia, but many argued the GST treatment stood in the way of success.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, supporting Australian digital currency intermediaries to establish an industry here is likely to make financial supervision and taxation easier for government.\n\nThe ATO’s characterisation of digital currencies as a commodity is probably the best interpretation of the current law, which emphasises wide use and sovereign backing for currencies. But it’s not clear cut. There is a legal basis to treat digital currencies as money based on their function as a medium of exchange, especially as this becomes more widespread.\n\nDigital currency and GST\n\nThe Senate report identified the GST anomalies arising from the ATO’s characterisation of digital currencies and recommends the government amend the GST regime to treat digital currencies as money. This would promote fairness and neutrality in the taxation of both modern and traditional forms of money.\n\nImplementing the necessary changes to the GST Act and Regulations will ultimately require approval from the Commonwealth and all State governments, as it affects the GST base.\n\nAdopting the report’s GST recommendation would bring Australia’s GST treatment in line with the UK, and some other EU nations. Last year, the UK changed its VAT laws (the UK’s GST) to exclude digital currencies from taxation as a commodity.\n\nWhen the UK first introduced this approach, it was praised for supporting the local digital currency industry, although there is little empirical evidence at this early stage.\n\nDigital currencies are also treated by the ATO as commodities for income tax. The evidence before the Committee, although limited, suggests most bitcoin holders are investors not traders.\n\nThe report did not recommend any alterations to the income tax treatment at this stage – and we agree that caution is needed before altering income tax treatment. The report recommended further research to determine whether change is needed.\n\nThe regulatory future of digital currencies\n\nThe Committee concluded that digital currencies fall outside the scope of many of Australia’s financial, banking, and consumer protection regulations. It recommended that Australia’s anti-terror and anti-money laundering regimes should be extended to ensure they encompass digital currency activity.\n\nHowever, the report does relatively little to address the longer-term regulatory concerns surrounding digital currencies. At this early stage, the report proposes to allow the industry to self-regulate, with oversight from a proposed “Digital Economy Taskforce”, rather than introducing a specific regulatory framework.\n\nThe Committee accepted that extensive regulations might stifle the growth of the digital currency industry. Although digital currencies’ utility has been emphasised recently, their future remains uncertain. Bitcoin, the largest digital currency, has seen a steady, significant price decline over the past two years. Further, much of the industry’s innovation comes from small start-ups, which have relatively few resources to comply with regulations. Regulatory simplicity seems proportionate at this stage.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how effective the self-regulation approach is, particularly given digital currencies’ historic [involvement in illicit activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace) and the regulatory concerns voiced by other governments and the OECD.\n\nThe combination of introducing a more favourable GST treatment, and a relatively simple regulatory framework will hopefully foster this nascent industry’s development. If the industry experiences any major growth in Australia, the greater number of users (and more tax dollars at stake) may heighten regulatory attention surrounding the technology.\n\nUltimately, the self regulatory approach and Digital Economy Taskforce is the beginning, not the end, of the government’s involvement in regulating and taxing this new technology.', 'Amidst all of the adulation and positive energy surrounding Bitcoin these days, it may seem like the series of mining closures of 2014 seem like a decade ago. Alas, there are some casualties to speak of today, as 37Coins, who has been a popular Bitcoin wallet provider since 2013, has shut its doors.\n\nFunding and Issues Overseas Mentioned as Causes\n\nBig hopes and dreams of providing the over 2 billion unbanked with Bitcoin accounts started their venture. Making a simple destination for Bitcoin newbies to make digital currency transfers worked in the short-term. 37Coins started off fast and was an attractive alternative to massive wallet sites like Blockchain.info and LocalBitCoins.com. Marrying different regions by text messaging for monetary transfers proved much more difficult than they imagined.\n\n“The decision to cease operations and to shut down our service was difficult,” their blog states. “Despite the best of intentions, we were unable to deliver a quality product that showed product-market fit.

Much more quietly, another exodus is underway. This one is of the more traditional, mainstream “money changers” on Wall Street, heading towards the freedom of decentralized currency within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nMigration from Wall Street to the Blockchain\n\nWhen a person changes companies or starts a new one, it rarely makes global news, but that all changed earlier this year. When Blythe Masters left JP Morgan to begin the Bitcoin startup Digital Asset Holdings, it was a wake up call for the financial industry in the Western world, and she is not alone. This was merely the lightning rod in a thunderstorm of industry movement.\n\nTimo Schlaefer, who has a doctorate in financial engineering, was enjoying a budding career at Goldman Sachs in London. Transferring from the Mergers and Acquisitions department to become an executive director of credit quantitative modeling, he suddenly picked up and left in February.\n\nHe left the security of Goldman Sachs to launch a company called Crypto Facilities Ltd, dealing in derivative trading within Bitcoin. What would motivate a successful executive to take such a perceived risk with his career? Certainly, getting in the ground floor of an entire industry is enticing. Schlaefer explained:\n\n""This is uncharted territory. It\'s an exciting opportunity to participate in a new area of technology that has massive potential.”\n\nFunding for Bitcoin businesses is at an all-time high, with venture capital in 2015’s first half already exceeding 2014’s totals for the entire year. Many execs are “following the money” even if it is relatively small compared to more established industries. Seemingly, some prominent people in the financial industry are noticing that Bitcoin and its ecosystem are trending upward in 2015.\n\nThis influx of talent towards digital currency certainly predates 2015. Back in 2012, when very few knew of Bitcoin or digital currency at all, Jaron Lukasiewicz, founder and CEO of the bitcoin exchange Coinsetter entered the market. Lukasiewicz left a high-paying position at The CapStreet Group in New York for Bitcoin and hasn’t looked back.\n\n""A lot of people are entering the bitcoin space as the sector has reached an overall level of funding that\'s hard to ignore,"" said Lukasiewicz.\n\nBitcoin job boom\n\nNew jobs with the digital currency markets are also booming, with heavy-hitters like Capital One, Intel and Amazon posting ads within this space. In June, online Bitcoin job ads surged to a record high of 306, according to data from Wanted Analytics. TD Canada Trust and Citigroup are also joining the fray in search for more Bitcoin talent. No one wants to be left behind, and a group momentum seems to be developing.\n\nAnother Goldman Sachs refugee, Paul Chou, walked away from a top position as a quant equity trader in New York. This was after graduating from the MIT with degrees in computer science and mathematics, with every intention of becoming a part of the establishment’s way of doing business.\n\nNow, he has also migrated and started LedgerX, an institutional trading and clearing platform for bitcoin options. He’s looking to become the first regulated exchange and clearing house to list and clear fully-collateralized, physically-settled bitcoin options for the institutional market. The opportunity to start something within Bitcoin was too big to pass up.\n\n""I took a very large salary pay cut to do this, in return for equity in a startup that can be worth a lot someday,"" Chou said. “The domain expertise, relationships, and career equity I\'ve built are things I could never have done while at Goldman. As a former trader, I\'m glad I made this trade-off at the stage of my career that I did.”\n\nRick Henri Chan was also bitten by the Bitcoin bug in 2012. He worked for Deutsche Bank as head of OTC Derivatives Technology in Japan and was a trader at UBS and Morgan Stanley. Currently, he works for Airbitz, raising money and planning a way forward for the company. Chan had a multi-million dollar package at Deutsche, and he admits he misses the paycheck but loves the flexibility he has now.\n\n""We\'re doing something special here at Airbitz. And I do think our company will be valued at a lot more in the future,"" said Chan.\n\nAppetite for risk\n\nSuffice to say Bitcoin startups are not just runaway dreams by unemployed geeks in their mother’s basement, looking for a way out. There are many raging successes, at the top of the financial industry, also looking for a way out or a better way forward. Their desire for something bigger and better than the status quo forces them to take the road less traveled, and gamble on untold success in an emerging market.\n\nThese aren’t common gamblers, but the market’s most conservative, educated, and established executives making uncommonly dynamic moves towards an uncommonly dynamic technology that just might change everything. The saying goes: life favors the bold; and these pioneers seem to be willing and capable of testing that age-old adage for many years to come.\n\nIn a very shaky financial economy, betting their careers on a new technology few truly understand or accept is bold to say the least. Let’s hope their internal beacons are as stellar as their corporate resumes.', 'While last week\'s Keynote 2015 conference saw the introduction of new voices to the conversation surrounding bitcoin and blockchain technology, none may have been heard louder and with more skepticism than CardLinx CEO Silvio Tavares.\n\nTavares used his forum at the conference to discuss his organization\'s focus on developing standards for promoting card-linking, a process by which the consumer data managed by payment companies is shared with merchants to target discounts and rewards. Founded in 2013, CardLinx boasts founding members including Bank of America, Facebook and Microsoft.\n\nGiven that the attendee base was composed of many from the bitcoin and blockchain industry, it may not be surprising that attendees greeted Tavares\' positive appraisal of the credit card industry with skepticism. At the event, Tavares sought to attack the idea that credit cards aren\'t affordable and don\'t offer privacy, and further, that the payments industry isn\'t innovative.\n\nIn interview, Tavares expanded on this view further, asserting that contrary to their perception in bitcoin and blockchain circles, payments companies are innovating at a faster rate than ever, creating a higher hurdle for new technologies.\n\nTavares told CoinDesk:\n\n""If you think about payments and digital advertising, there\'s enormous innovation transforming how people find and pay for services and the business model for how traditional payments work. ... There\'s a huge amount of innovation in the space and that\'s both a challenge and opportunity for bitcoin.""\n\nA former senior vice president at Visa and First Data, Tavares added that in this current environment dominated by payments innovation, being safer and cheaper hasn\'t been enough to propel the technology to the mainstream.\n\nThat\'s not to say that Tavares doesn\'t believe there will be applications for bitcoin in payments, it\'s just that he believes the technology is still searching for a niche.\n\n""I don\'t see bitcoin as replacing card payments anytime soon. I don\'t see bitcoin replacing card-linked capabilities anytime soon,"" he said. ""But, I think that technologies like bitcoin and credit cards can co-exist and complement one another.""\n\nThe comments follow increasing debate about the strength of bitcoin\'s value proposition to merchants following reports of declining adoption and a broader shift in interest toward the technology\'s applications as a distributed database.\n\nAwareness a non-issue\n\nOne indication that the technology is still not ready for mass market as a payment method, Tavares said, is that adoption has been disproportionately low when compared to public interest.\n\n""You can hardly look at The Wall Street Journal, Businessweek or Harvard Business Review without reading an article about bitcoin. Bitcoin is everywhere, but yet we haven\'t seen consumer adoption,"" Tavares said.\n\nTavares indicated that, part of the issue, is that consumers perceive bitcoin as more difficult to use than other forms of payment. The assertion is backed by recent studies, like one in April that found bitcoin was perceived to be the ""most inconvenient"" payment method.\n\nHe went on to call ease of use and small merchant acceptance the biggest issues with bitcoin and its applications for payments, even though he acknowledged how integration has been added by companies such as PayPal, Shopify and Stripe.\n\n""At the end of the day, merchants want to accept as many payment methods as possible, but if it\'s hard for them to implement, it becomes a challenge,"" he said.\n\nTrust and control\n\nTavares also framed bitcoin as a potential complement to payments industry practices like card linking, suggesting that, while this process relies on information sharing, the pseudonymity bitcoin offers isn\'t a roadblock to such use cases.\n\nRather, Tavares asserted that consumers want to control how they pay, so long as they\'re also able to share relevant information with select parties as well.\n\n""Consumers want to be able to control how they pay, but they also want to share this information with people who deliver value. I think consumers are not so focused on maintaining anonymity, they want to have anonymity with the right people,"" he continued. ""Consumers like privacy, but they don\'t want to live in cloaked world where no one knows who they are.""\n\nTavares suggested that card linking has struck this balance by enabling consumers to elect who they share data with in exchange for a quantifiable reward. However, he said he doesn\'t foresee a blockchain removing the role of trusted intermediaries, even in the exchange of data for rewards.\n\nTime and education, he said, will need to play a role as other industries are just realizing one of the core innovations of the blockchain is its ability to reduce or eliminate trusted counterparties in the transaction process.\n\n""When you look at the blockchain as a counterparty, you\'re putting your faith in the wisdom of the crowd and that\'s not a very well established model yet,"" he said. ""People place their trust in institutions and companies and they\'re used to that because they see how that works.""\n\nInnovating at scale\n\nThat said, he believes incumbent payments providers currently have two huge advantages in that they have capital and established user bases on which to test new ideas. Many of the challenges bitcoin and blockchain companies are working on, he said, are being attacked by firms with bigger budgets and more resources.\n\nFor example, when asked about the ongoing effort by Gyft to tokenize gift cards on a blockchain, he noted that there are other companies such as Raise seeking similar solutions for the same challenge – illiquidity in the gift card market.\n\n""It would be a mistake to think that the large companies are not already focused on those inefficiencies and investing heavily to solve them,"" he said. ""I do think there are going to be some opportunity for bitcoin as well, the key question is where is that going to be and where is it well suited to address challenges.""\n\nMore broadly, he noted that he believes bitcoin has already ""captivated"" the payments space, but that channeling this interest into business opportunities remains a roadblock.\n\n""There are a lot of great killer apps that are growing quite rapidly in the payments space,"" he continued. ""Given that we have 24 hours in a day, and you can only place your bets in a certain number of spaces, you want to base them in ones with acceptance.""\n\nPromoting cooperation\n\nOverall, Tavares said the goal of his speech at the Keynote event was not to antagonize, but rather to help a new generation of technology entrepreneurs learn how their space is being viewed by incumbents.\n\n""I wanted to share how much innovation there is in the traditional payments space, because I think that gives a perspective to bitcoin\'s value-add capabilities,"" he said.\n\nGoing forward, Tavares expressed an interest in having more bitcoin and blockchain companies join the CardLinx Association, given its broad interest in digital commerce.\n\nTavares believes that both technologies can thrive alongside each other given that, at the end of the day, both consumers and merchants are incentivized to use and accept as many payment methods as possible.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""It\'s not just cards. This is really about digital commerce and how you can more effectively match merchants with consumers. That\'s why I\'m very, very confident bitcoin can co-exist.""\n\nImage via Keynote 2015\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

08/12/2015,"['The world’s largest peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace Local Bitcoins and bitcoin marketplace BitQuick have terminated their services in New York due to the strict restrictions and fees demanded by New York’s BitLicense.\n\nLocal Bitcoins is a unique case; as every single seller on Local Bitcoins would be required to pay $5,000 to apply for BitLicense. The Local Bitcoins team wrote on their blog:\n\n“From today onwards users from New York are no longer allowed to use LocalBitcoins because of the legislation known as the BitLicense (23 NYCRR 200) which makes it a federal offense to sell virtual currency to people living in New York unless you have applied for the license. This new regulation would require anyone selling Bitcoins through our service to acquire the BitLicense if they sell Bitcoins to residents of New York.”\n\nNew Yorkers who have depended on the services of Local Bitcoins would have to cross the river and sell or purchase bitcoin in New Jersey legally.\n\nBitQuick\n\nBoost VC-backed bitcoin trading platform BitQuick has restricted access to New York residents and decided to join Shapeshift and GoCoin’s PleaseProtectConsumers.org campaign. The Please Protect Consumers campaign was first started by Shapeshift to educate the general population about the government’s deep involvement in Bitcoin, privacy and security.\n\n“The fee and the compliance costs are just the start,” Jad Mubaslat CEO and founder of BitQuick told Bitcoin Magazine “No doubt those two things make it a deal killer for any small startup, but even putting that aside, this sets a dangerous precedent to other states. If every state did what New York did, it’d be $250,000 just to apply to do business in the United States. No American wants that.”\n\nBitQuick said that the regulations and restrictions set for digital currency startups in New York is overbearing compared to the size of the Bitcoin industry. The worst part, BitQuick and Shapeshift say, is that the government is trying to get hold of sensitive customer data of all exchanges. Such storage of data leaves sensitive customer information vulnerable to data breaches and hacking attacks.\n\n“Even multinational companies and trillion-dollar governments have been unable to build a track record of data security,” the Please Protect Consumers campaignstates. “Consider that in America alone, identity theft resulting from these treasure troves of personal data caused over $24 billion in losses to consumers and businesses in 2012, compared with only $14 billion for all household burglary, vehicle and property theft combined.”\n\nOnce exchanges begin to store sensitive customer data for every transaction/trade, they’d have to build separate storages to keep such data for government agencies and law enforcements to retrieve.\n\nCoinSetter Settles\n\nWhile eight bitcoin startups have already left New York, one bitcoin exchange, CoinSetter, has decided to meet every requirement of BitLicense.\n\nAlmost every startup in New York has left or is planning to leave the state due to BitLicense. By submitting to BitLicense, CoinSetter hopes to remain as the only “legal” and “licensed” bitcoin exchange in New York to serve bitcoin users abandoned by their previous bitcoin exchanges/startups.\n\n“While we serve a global user base of bitcoin traders, New York has long been Coinsetter’s home,” Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz said. “We are happy to announce that Coinsetter will continue to be headquartered in New York City, a global capital of banking and financial technology, and to serve customers throughout New York State.”', 'Colu, a platform using Bitcoin blockchain technology, today announced that it has beta launched its platform for developers. Individual developers and companies are now welcome to build on the Colu platform. In addition, Colu has announced Revelator as its first partner. Revelator is a cloud-based provider of sales and marketing intelligence for independent music businesses.\n\nColu has developed a platform based on Bitcoin blockchain technology, which for the first time can be used by developers and consumers with little to no bitcoin knowledge to build and exchange digital assets for everything from financial industry (shares, bonds, stocks), records (certificates, copyrights, documentation) to ownership (event tickets, vouchers, gift cards etc.). With the beta launch of the platform, individual developers and enterprises are now welcome to develop relevant digital assets and services according to their own and broader customer needs at Colu.co.\n\nColu is working with music-tech industry leader, Revelator, to build a Rights Management API. Today, there remains a complicated chain of rights ownership and usage in the digital distribution of music. This API will provide the secure issuance and distribution of digital assets including listing and registration of musical works for its clients and helping collecting societies provide more transparency and efficiency to all market participants.\n\n“We are very excited about the potential for Colu’s platform to simplify the management of music rights, starting with those associated with songwriters and their compositions,” says Bruno Guez, founder and CEO of Revelator. “Colu has made the complex technology of the blockchain accessible for integrations into platforms like ours, and we’re looking forward to exploring all the ways it can improve service to our clients.”\n\nD.A. Wallach, whose essay “Bitcoin For Rockstars” widely popularized the concept of a decentralized repository for music rights ownership, expressed enthusiasm for the partnership between Colu and Revelator. He said:\n\n“I am thrilled that such capable entrepreneurs are chipping away at the vexing lack of transparency that makes it so hard for artists today to understand their sources of income. There is great opportunity for this approach to evolve into an industry-wide standard.”\n\nBlockchain technology has been gaining momentum as a platform to enable secure ownership and sharing of various consumer assets, with more than US$1B in capital already recently invested in blockchain startups. Colu raised a US$2.5 million seed round of funding led by Aleph and Spark Capital in January 2015, and has since been developing its developer platform and consumer mobile application.\n\n“The Colu team has been working closely with various companies to finally leverage blockchain technology in a consumer-friendly way,” said Amos Meiri, Colu CEO and co-founder. “We’re excited to launch this beta more broadly so solutions and services can be used by consumers down the road, starting with an industry as dynamic as music and entertainment. Colu is committed to making blockchain technology easily and safely accessible for everyone.”', 'A Michigan man has been indicted for allegedly using bitcoin to buy and sell illegal gun components on the dark web.\n\nBenjamin James Cance, from Plainwell, is facing charges for shipping illegal arms, possession of an unregistered machine gun and money laundering.\n\nCance appeared before Magistrate Judge Phillip J Green yesterday and pleaded not guilty. He has since been released on bond and is awaiting trial, although no official date has been set.\n\nInternational arms shipment is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, whereas the maximum penalty for money laundering and possession of a machine gun carries a 10-year prison sentence, statements from the Department of Justice indicated.\n\nThe investigation of the case is being carried out by the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service, the US Postal Inspection Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nBenjamin James Cance Indictment\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Further, it has grown its employee base to 17, with the addition of Coinzone\'s sales staff.\n\nCoinify CFO Christian Visti Larsen indicated that the purchase comes as his firm is seeking to shift its focus from acquiring individual merchants to payment service providers (PSPs). He explained Coinify is seeking to replicate a model invoked by its US peer Bitnet, in that it will seek to partner with larger entities that provide payments support to thousands of online merchants.\n\nVisti Larsen told CoinDesk:\n\n""More merchants today do business with a PSP and would rather have multiple payment options through a PSP. Most of Coinzone\'s partners were asking for this service, so it seemed like a perfect match.""\n\nVisti Larsen also commented on the success of this model in the US, where bitcoin payments are already supported by PSPs such as CardinalCommerce, PayPal and Stripe. He suggested it was time for the European market to ""step up"" its performance and said Coinify is working on as many as eight deals with European PSPs.\n\nOutgoing Coinzone CEO Manuel Heilmann told CoinDesk his firm\'s existing management staff will remain at the company for a ""transition period"", though no executives will join Coinify in full-time roles. Heilmann said he is seeking to return to the e-commerce industry, but will continue to advocate for the technology.\n\nFounded in 2014, Coinzone is an Amsterdam-based payment processor that had garnered most of its traction in eastern Europe.\n\nAcquisition image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

We upgrade to new models which are faster, smaller and lighter than the last. Our laptops are replaced on average every three years to make use of rapidly advancing processor technology.\n\nWe populate these devices with an endless stream of apps that re-define the way we work, shop and communicate. We see such an incredible pace of innovation within increasingly digital lives and as we look to the technological horizon it's almost impossible to imagine what comes next.\n\nHowever, in some areas it’s the experiences of today that enable us to anticipate what will be our ‘Beyond Digital’ tomorrow.\n\nDigital is seemingly everywhere today. We have become accustomed to a digital option being available for almost everything that we need in our everyday lives. Every so often, however, we experience a jarring in that expectation. For many last month’s general was a case in point.\n\n> See also: Can security start-ups save Bitcoin from early demise?\n\nIn the digital world of 2015 the UK General Election had the appearance of a pantomime of pencil and paper. As the polling officer ceremoniously assisted you through the cross-checking, form-filling and ballot-posting in your local school, church hall or community centre, you probably felt some sense of discord with the experiences accessible via that smartphone impotently tucked away in your pocket.\n\nNational plebiscites are complicated political activities which might explain why change has been slow and why the election process is yet to take full advantage of digital technologies. And yet in a world travelling so fast it is at the wrong end of a rubber band held in place by the friction of tradition. Friction will certainly be overcome by the digital forces massing on the horizon. And none more so than the Blockchain.\n\nWe are increasingly familiar with Bitcoin, a new digital type form of currency where the balance of power is decentralised, removing the role of validating transactions from our banks and re-allocating to the crowd.\n\nWhile on the surface this technology appears to be specialised to the world of finance, the democratising concept that works behind it, the Blockchain mechanism, could also revolutionise the way we vote.\n\nThe Blockchain is designed to validate the authenticity of transactions. It does so by a conceptually simple mechanism of ‘chaining’ the transaction records it stores in its ledger. When a new transaction is placed into the Blockchain ledger its record is validated by the previous transaction; like a Lego brick it fits uniquely on top of the brick underneath.\n\nThis means that anybody attempting to insert a fraudulent transaction into the ledger would have to amend every single transaction that went before and after it. It’s an immensely powerful way of authenticating a transaction. Or a vote.\n\nThe key thing about Blockchain is that it ‘disintermediates’ the validation activity. That means it removes the central function of cross-checking transactions from the process. Validation happens but it is done, essentially for free, by the crowd.\n\nRather than maintain a complicated validation activity around the electoral roll, returning officers could rely on the power of the Blockchain to check that a vote is authentic.\n\nThe entire concept of the blockchain is still in its formative stages and new applications are being found every day. At its core it can decentralise and digitalise any and all centrally controlled process and make them faster, cheaper, more trust-worthy and secure.\n\nAs we have seen with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies it is already transforming finance, but there are other industries where there is serious exploration of the Blockchain’s potential.\n\nThe diamond trade has long been blighted by widespread organised crime through theft, forgery and blood diamonds. Knowing the provenance of a diamond – where it was mined and through which hands it was sold – is key to maintaining value within the market.\n\nThrough its chained model of validation, the Blockchain is particularly suited to this job and the diamond industry is already developing and using Blockchain ledgers to record every time the diamond trades hands and revealing areas of potential criminal activity. And it’s not just diamonds. The wine industry is following suit using the same shared ledger approach to track its finest vintages.\n\n> See also: A match made in heaven: why analytics and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are perfect partners\n\nBlockchain is also beginning to appear in the world of public services. The government of Honduras has been exploring how the unique properties of the Blockchain can be employed to handle support its land registry. In a country where land disputes have been violent and large scale, the technology will be used to tackle fraud by maintaining a crowd verified record of every time the land has changed hands.\n\nToday, we are only scratching the surface of the Blockchain, but it is clear that, as with other drivers of disintermediation – how technology removes intermediary steps from transactional processes – it offers significant opportunity to transform service delivery models. When I look ‘Beyond Digital’ to investigate which technologies will shape our future, the Blockchain gets my vote.\n\nSourced from Ben Gilburt, Innovations Consultant, Sopra Steria"", 'Foreign currency prices have an intimate impact on financial markets and this week, China’s yuan devaluation came as a reminder of how fragile the Chinese economy is at the moment. A significant financial crisis is developing on the country; it seems that the model of economic growth has reached its natural end.\n\nSimilar to what happened in Greece, Chinese citizens seem to be buying bitcoin in order to preserve the value of their cash. Many already perceive the unexpectedly sharp devaluation of China’s yuan as an opportunity for bitcoin.\n\nAs the dollar and yuan move further apart, bitcoin could become a middleman for yuan holders looking to hedge their Investments. If bitcoin continues to rise, traders can change their cash back into yuan to turn a profit. On the other hand, if the cryptocurrency loses value, They can change it again into U.S. dollars, which are on the rise against the yuan.\n\nWhen Greeks turned to bitcoin, the country had enacted capital controls making it difficult for people to move money. For that same reason, bitcoin was an attractive option since it allowed citizens to escape the government capital controls. In China, capital restrictions aren’t keeping people from freely moving their cash into other currencies, but this might happen at any moment and bitcoin presents an interesting opportunity whether the yuan falls further or not.\n\nThe digital currency has been regarded by traders as highly unstable, but market surprises like this one make bitcoin much more appealing, since Bitcoin volatility is decreasing as well.\n\nSo far, we’ve seen bitcoin having its best performance when traditional financial markets are in turmoil. This is likely to have a reaction on the Bitcoin panorama inside the country. In the future, the country is likely to have more and more businesses adopting new currencies like Bitcoin that are immune to interference. The financial crisis in the country is most certainly going to be a positive thing for Bitcoin.\n\nSource & Image', ""Lightning Network is a proposal for an off-blockchain network that would support super-fast transactions and boost Bitcoin scalability. Wednesday, miner hosting company HashPlex unveiled an alpha Lightning Network hub implementation, as developers continue to refine the layer (sometimes called layer-2) on testnets.\n\nThe python Lightning implementation works with the open source Bitcoin node. Integration tests on a local network, which include three Bitcoin nodes, show that users can open a channel, close a channel, unilaterally close a channel, and send and receive money. The three nodes are able to make near-instantaneous transactions off the blockchain, according to the developers.\n\nAs is, Bitcoin isn't scalable. To give you an idea, the network currently supports roughly seven transactions per second, while Visa supports roughly 45,000 per second. The Lightning Network supports faster transactions at a greater volume (as the below graphic succinctly illustrates).\n\n“As of today, our hub could be made secure on the Bitcoin testnet with the Blockstream extensions that they call 'alpha net' (which allow for things like Lightning and Sidechains),” HashPlex Founder Bernard Rihn explained.\n\nDeveloper Jasper Hugunin led the project. HashPlex will run a Lightning hub and plans to open-source all future protocol work. “We plan on bringing on contributors and letting a quorum drive its direction according to the interests of the community,” Rihn said.\n\nHashPlex is known for building a hydropowered miner hosting facility, which was a first for Bitcoin. Lightning Network development is a great departure from this kinda stuff, but so it goes in Bitcoinland."", 'Credit card processing company Visa is exploring the usages of bitcoin and blockchain technology in payment applications. The company is conducting its research through its innovation labs, which are focused on improving the Visa Checkout and mVisa products.\n\nPrior to this, Visa has said that it doesn’t see blockchain technology as a threat to its current operations but that the company might support bitcoin as a payment method. “India will soon have teams that will jointly work with our two research labs in US and Singapore in studying the many aspects of blockchain,” said Visa executive vice president of technology Rajat Taneja.\n\nBlockchain Technology Applications\n\nOther banks and finance-related companies are already tapping into blockchain technology applications, most notably Australian banks Westpac and CBA that are working with Ripple Labs to see how the distributed ledger can be used in internal operations.\n\nBlockchain refers to the public ledger of bitcoin transactions which is verified and updated through bitcoin mining or by a network of computers solving complex algorithms. Several companies have explored its potential applications for record-keeping and trade settlement.\n\nVisa is also considering partnerships with companies including Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services that would also focus on blockchain technology projects. Currently, most of the research is being done in the company’s Benglaru office, which has 400 engineers at the technology innovation lab and might scale up to a thousand soon.\n\nEarlier this year, Visa already hired a former Google scientist, Min Wang, to lead cryptocurrency research teams based in San Francisco. The company also outsources some of its work to other Indian firms with which they are looking to work jointly in developing bitcoin and blockchain technology applications.\n\n“India will soon have teams that will jointly work with our two research labs in US and Singapore in studying the many aspects of blockchain,” added Taneja.', 'Some of the earliest adopters of the digital currency Bitcoin were criminals, who have found it invaluable in online marketplaces for contraband and as payment extorted through lucrative “ransomware” that holds personal data hostage. A new Bitcoin-inspired technology that some investors believe will be much more useful and powerful may be set to unlock a new wave of criminal innovation.\n\nThat technology is known as smart contracts—small computer programs that can do things like execute financial trades or notarize documents in a legal agreement. Intended to take the place of third-party human administrators such as lawyers, which are required in many deals and agreements, they can verify information and hold or use funds using similar cryptography to that which underpins Bitcoin.\n\nSome companies think smart contracts could make financial markets more efficient, or simplify complex transactions such as property deals (see “The Startup Meant to Reinvent What Bitcoin Can Do”). Ari Juels, a cryptographer and professor at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech, believes they will also be useful for illegal activity–and, with two collaborators, he has demonstrated how.\n\n“In some ways this is the perfect vehicle for criminal acts, because it’s meant to create trust in situations where otherwise it’s difficult to achieve,” says Juels.\n\nIn a paper to be released today, Juels, fellow Cornell professor Elaine Shi, and University of Maryland researcher Ahmed Kosba present several examples of what they call “criminal contracts.” They wrote them to work on the recently launched smart-contract platform Ethereum.\n\nOne example is a contract offering a cryptocurrency reward for hacking a particular website. Ethereum’s programming language makes it possible for the contract to control the promised funds. It will release them only to someone who provides proof of having carried out the job, in the form of a cryptographically verifiable string added to the defaced site.\n\nContracts with a similar design could be used to commission many kinds of crime, say the researchers. Most provocatively, they outline a version designed to arrange the assassination of a public figure. A person wishing to claim the bounty would have to send information such as the time and place of the killing in advance. The contract would pay out after verifying that those details had appeared in several trusted news sources, such as news wires. A similar approach could be used for lesser physical crimes, such as high-profile vandalism.\n\n“It was a bit of a surprise to me that these types of crimes in the physical world could be enabled by a digital system,” says Juels. He and his coauthors say they are trying to publicize the potential for such activity to get technologists and policy makers thinking about how to make sure the positives of smart contracts outweigh the negatives.\n\n“We are optimistic about their beneficial applications, but crime is something that is going to have to be dealt with in an effective way if those benefits are to bear fruit,” says Shi.\n\nNicolas Christin, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has studied criminal uses of Bitcoin, agrees there is potential for smart contracts to be embraced by the underground. “It will not be surprising,” he says. “Fringe businesses tend to be the first adopters of new technologies, because they don’t have anything to lose.”\n\nIndeed, some criminals have made significant gains from Bitcoin. The way it can make digital payments more anonymous has aided the rise of malicious “ransomware” (see “Holding Data Hostage: The Perfect Internet Crime?”). And Christin published a paper this week tracing the evolution of online marketplaces for contraband that have been partly enabled by Bitcoin. It shows that although the most notorious, Silk Road, was taken down by U.S. law enforcement in 2013, others rose in its place and together make sales estimated at around $400,000 a day.\n\nStill, Christin notes that the scale of criminal activity made possible by Bitcoin today, and perhaps by smart contracts in the future, is tiny compared with more traditional, cash-based physical crimes. Smart contracts are also more complex to use than Bitcoin transactions, he adds. Writing a smart contract or properly understanding the terms of one takes specialized programming skills.\n\nGavin Wood, chief technology officer at Ethereum, notes that legitimate businesses are already planning to make use of his technology—for example, to provide a digitally transferable proof of ownership of gold, and to power a lottery system.\n\nHowever, Wood acknowledges it is likely that Ethereum will be used in ways that break the law—and even says that is part of what makes the technology interesting. Just as file sharing found widespread unauthorized use and forced changes in the entertainment and tech industries, illicit activity enabled by Ethereum could change the world, he says.\n\n“The potential for Ethereum to alter aspects of society is of significant magnitude,” says Wood. “This is something that would provide a technical basis for all sorts of social changes and I find that exciting.”\n\nFor example, Wood says that Ethereum’s software could be used to create a decentralized version of a service such as Uber, connecting people wanting to go somewhere with someone willing to take them, and handling the payments without the need for a company in the middle. Regulators like those harrying Uber in many places around the world would be left with nothing to target. “You can implement any Web service without there being a legal entity behind it,” he says. “The idea of making certain things impossible to legislate against is really interesting.”', 'Jack C. Liu is head of international at OKCoin and OKLink. He is based in Beijing and previously held roles at Barclays Capital and bitcoin exchange Kraken. In this article, he explores whether the crypto industry should be pushing fiat wallets, rather than bitcoin wallets, if it wants digital currency to go mainstream.\n\nSince bitcoin was introduced in 2009, we have seen endless efforts to make it mainstream.\n\nThese efforts have spanned the launches of the world’s ‘easiest bitcoin web wallet’, ‘easiest bitcoin mobile wallet’, ‘consumer multi-sig wallets’ and ‘easiest way to buy bitcoins’.\n\nThe user interface has improved by leaps and bounds. We as a community even spent more than a year debating ‘bits’ vs ‘bitcoin’ in an effort to make new bitcoin owners feel wealthier. Startups who act as custodians of customers\' bitcoins began advertising ""we are fully insured"", ""we have proof of reserves"", ""we have the world’s most secure vault"" and ""we are fully licensed"".\n\n\n\nWhat has been achieved so far?\n\nOne could argue that instead of mainstreaming bitcoin as a payment network, we’ve instead encouraged the speculation on bitcoin prices.\n\nIn the past couple of years, as volatility became an issue in light of a more than 70% drop in bitcoin prices, merchant services offered retailers the ability to accept fiat over the bitcoin network.\n\nThe way it works is that consumer bitcoins would be sent to the merchant processor, who then settles with the merchant in the desired fiat currency. However, the benchmarks of success for these services have included statistics on the percentage of revenues merchants keep as bitcoin.\n\nIt begs the question: Why does that even matter?\n\nThis spring, on the consumer side, services such as OKLink, Coinbase, and Circle have solved the volatility issue for consumers by adding or pre-announcing fiat wallets linked to the bitcoin network. CNY (OKLink) and USD (Coinbase and Circle). This will let users pay and receive in their local currency, while the transfer is made using bitcoins in the background and without any currency exchange risk.\n\nThus far, this is being offered as somewhat of a side feature. These services are maintaining the dual mode of allowing users the choice to use bitcoin as the front end (bitcoin wallet over the bitcoin network) or the back end (fiat wallet over the bitcoin network).\n\nThis is akin to a gas station offering you a core service of buying and storing oil, while giving you the optional side service of filling your car.\n\nIn no way am I disparaging bitcoin’s long term value and the promise it holds as the best money the world has ever seen. A different approach towards mainstreaming adoption of the network won’t weaken this function, and could in fact strengthen it.\n\nBitcoin\'s three common user functions\n\n1. Opting out of the system – be your own bank\n\nServices range from Blockchain.info, Mycelium, Breadwallet, Ledger Nano, LocalBitcoins, etc.\n\n2. Investing in bitcoin the asset\n\nServices range from bitcoin exchanges such as OKCoin, to investment vehicles including Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), NASDAQ ETN, to paper wallets.\n\n3. Using bitcoin as the open payment network\n\nWhat’s magical about bitcoin is that it can be all three. It can even be a hundred more things. However, if we are to accelerate the process of bitcoin becoming mainstream, there is good reason to focus on strengthening the third function – the universal payment network.\n\nThe opting-out lifestyle is currently a choice made by a minority of people. Bitcoin as an investment is largely for those looking to diversity their portfolio or those with excess funds to spare. Bitcoin as an open payment network however, is something that the entire planet can use. That is mainstream by definition.\n\nThe store of value/unit of account conundrum\n\nAs long as the currency used for store of value (bitcoin) and the currency used for unit of account (fiat) are different, the short-term balance sheet risk is something the majority will not accept even if bitcoin generally appreciates in value.\n\nTo suggest otherwise, one would come across as being out of touch with the lives of most people who live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nWe can’t sit around waiting for a financial crises or a massive inflation in fiat currencies to help bitcoin take off. The mark of a superior technology is that it never relies on failures of its predecessor.\n\nBitcoin is not for the unbanked, just as email was not for those without access to the post office. Email did not wait for postage stamps to become more expensive or mail to be lost to gain adoption.\n\nSure, bitcoin may eventually have the greatest impact on the lives of the unbanked just as $25 Android phones have proven to. However, it should be noted that smartphones did not start in those markets.\n\nTaking all this into consideration, it is my thought that perhaps companies should consider fiat wallets as the sole option for consumers and merchants, or at least the default option.\n\nImagine making micro-payments to anyone using any service instantly for free, in your preferred currency without any systemic counter-party risk. That’s something we could all use.\n\nThe more the bitcoin payment rails are accepted, the more those who live on bitcoin and those who invest in bitcoin the asset will benefit. It’s virtuous.\n\nThis article was originally published on jackcliu.com, an edited version has been published here with permission.\n\nFiat phone image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

08/13/2015,"['In the aftermath of the BitLicense application deadline this week, a number of prominent bitcoin companies have ceased operations in New York.\n\nAlthough the reasons behind startups\' reluctance to apply for a license are varied, cost has played a significant part.\n\nOf those who did apply – and fronted the $5,000 non-refundable application fee, most have alluded to an arduous process and high costs.\n\nBut just how much did their expenditure amount to?\n\nCoinDesk has spoken to various companies in the space to breakdown the cost of the BitLicense application process both in monetary and non-monetary terms.\n\n\'Expensive and difficult\'\n\n""Applying for the BitLicense is an expensive and difficult process, as many have noted. Some other firms have chosen to abandon the New York market entirely, rather than comply. We do not fault them for doing so,"" said George Frost, executive VP and chief legal officer at Bitstamp.\n\nFrost estimated the application cost Bitstamp roughly $100,000, including time allocation, legal and compliance fees.\n\n""Our UK parent company has contributed a lot of time, expertise and money in the BitLicense effort, but much of this investment will benefit the entire Bitstamp group,"" said Frost.\n\nBitstamp, the world\'s third largest exchange in terms of BTC/USD trading volume, proceeded with the application for various reasons. Firstly, because, if approved, it would allow the company to offer a fully compliant trading platform for New York residents. Secondly, Frost said he expects to be able to offer a broader range of financial tools to customers – including Automatic Clearing House (ACH) deposits, domestic wire transfers and debit card transactions.\n\nThe application efforts, he added, included establishing a new operating subsidiary in the US, developing a business plan, establishing appropriate financial controls, hiring a US compliance officer – Lisa Dawson, former senior VP and compliance officer at Citi Group – and spending months ""analysing and agonising over"" the BitLicence\'s requirements and providing industry comments to the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).\n\nHe added:\n\n""We drafted a detailed risk assessment of Bitstamp USA and the Bitstamp group overall, and more than 30 policies, training manuals and internal procedures guides that we believe are compliant with the New York regulatory regime ... These included hundreds and hundreds of pages of plans covering every aspect of our intended operations. All of this internal scrutiny and drafting has made us a lot smarter company, albeit one with corporate tunnel syndrome.""\n\nAlthough a costly and cumbersome process, Frost said he believed greater regulation for the ecosystem is inevitable.\n\n""Like others, we regret the loss of economic freedom occasioned by the onset of regulation. [But] by participating, we are better positioned to help create an industry – and regulatory environment – that achieves widespread adoption and preserves as much individual autonomy as possible.""\n\nManning the effort\n\nUnlike Bitstamp, which claims to employ up 50 people, bitcoin exchange MonetaGo is sizeably smaller.\n\nAlso unlike, Bitstamp, the New York-based company is a relative newcomer to the bitcoin scene, but by no means less eager to comply with the New York State\'s regulatory framework.\n\n""Given that we are a new startup company we have been extremely diligent with our expenditures. In terms of hard costs we\'ve spent approximately $50,000 ... by far the biggest costs have been the man-hours to date,"" said Patrick Manasse, chief compliance officer.\n\nManasse estimates that the team spent approximately 1,200 hours compiling the documentation for the BitLicense application, but noted that an additional 2,000 man hours had already been invested in developing MonetaGo’s global compliance program.\n\nEfforts were spent on providing compliance training to all of the officers and directors, working with lawyers and consultants in various regions and communicating with banks and other relevant authorities.\n\n""Add to this programmers and developers putting in place systems and service providers, and you start to get a sense of the size and scope of the undertaking,"" he said, noting: ""If all the hours were added up, the total would easily be upwards of a quarter million US dollars.""\n\nSo, while putting the actual application together took MonetaGo\'s team members the better part of the past 45 days – the grace period following the publication of the BitLicense in New York\'s Register – the process, Manasse said, really began at the company\'s inception.\n\nManasse said the ongoing costs, should MonetaGo\'s submission be approved, are hard to estimate accurately. He believes they will depend on the approach taken by the NYDFS:\n\n""The Department could easily make it completely unfeasible for startups to continue operating in the space, but that is not the sense that we have gotten from our interactions with them thus far. It is our hope that a measured approach will be taken.""\n\nHowever, Manasse suggested that being a relatively new company could potentially work to MonetaGo\'s an advantage in terms of cost.\n\n""A compliant company such as ours which is newly launched and has a limited operating history probably doesn\'t require the same amount of scrutiny as other players which have been around since the early days of bitcoin.""\n\nSignificant undertaking\n\nA spokesperson for Coinbase confirmed that the San Francisco-based company had submitted its BitLicense application.\n\nAlthough they declined to divulge specific details, the spokesperson noted the process was a ""significant undertaking"", but one the company had no problem carrying out because it had sufficient internal resources.\n\nMeanwhile, Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO and founder of Coinsetter, noted his company had spent approximately $50,000 on BitLicense-related expenses over the past two years. ""I think its bigger cost, though, has been in the uncertainty it created for investors looking to invest in our space – hopefully that will begin to reverse itself now.""\n\nBittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange, also applied for the license. Bittrex founder Bill Shihara told CoinDesk he estimated the process to have cost his company between $18,000 and $20,000, whilst employees spent approximately 80 hours compiling and reviewing the paperwork.\n\n""I am sure larger companies incurred much higher costs than we did ... we were lucky that we had a lot of the paperwork already available.""\n\nAlthough he noted the BitLicense was a significant undertaking for companies, he said customers should welcome it:\n\n""Ultimately, I think customers should be happy about the BitLicense. While it is burdensome for us, the core of the paperwork involved consumer protection. The BitLicense requires background checks on the principals who handle your funds; detailed information of how the funds are stored and credited to our users; proof that the company is profitable; as well as security and incident response plans.""\n\n""If the BitLicense reviewers do their jobs right, passing the application process means the company holding your funds is a legitimate business that you should want to work with,"" he concluded.\n\nLegal perspective\n\nMarco Santori, counsel at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, described the application process as ""consultative and iterative"".\n\n""The NYDFS will not simply take your $5,000 and deny you without ceremony. They will certainly accept the application fee, but if the staff takes issues with some of the applicant\'s responses, or find deficiencies, they will address them with the applicant. Their objective is to bring businesses into the BitLicense regime, not to block them out of it,"" he added.\n\nThe NYDFS, Santori said, has 90 days to grant or deny a BitLicense application, but the Superintendent may extend that period for a reasonable amount of time sufficient to enable compliance with the BitLicense regime. ""It is not clear whether that means compliance by NYDFS or the applicant. I expect that – certainly during the early stages – applications will take longer than 90 days to be approved.""\n\nIf an application does not satisfy all the criteria, the authorities may decide to grant a conditional license, which will entail periodic review. ""This is an amorphous thing. The are no criteria set forth in the regulation for what kind of company might qualify for a conditional license or what conditions might be attached for that license.""\n\n""Unilateral discretion in that regard,"" Santori added, ""is left to the Superintendent. Those seeking a conditional license should submit their application along with a cover letter explaining why they believe one should be granted, and what conditions they believe should attach. It will likely take a bit of advocacy.""\n\nFurther Reading: Buy Our Bitlicense Research Report\n\nNew York image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'ItBit has revealed new details about its formerly top-secret Bankchain project, a private consensus-based ledger system aimed at appealing to enterprise financial institutions.\n\nWith the formal unveiling, the New York-based bitcoin exchange has joined the number of blockchain firms seeking to compete for the attention of banks that want to utilize the efficiencies of distributed databases without using bitcoin or its blockchain.\n\nIn a new interview, Steve Wager, head of global operations for itBit, spoke at length about the project, rumors of which first began surfacing in late July. Speculation was followed by confirmation from the exchange it would host a private, one-day summit in New York to promote its release.\n\nCalled the Bankchain Discovery Summit, Wager said the event drew 100 participants from 25 leading financial institutions, including custodians, broker-dealers and those providing infrastructure support for the industry.\n\nWager said that itBit built Bankchain using insight from its team\'s history in the finance industry and input from Wall Street firms, who favor the idea of using a distributed ledger to tokenize existing assets.\n\nWager told CoinDesk:\n\n""It is a proprietary itBit protocol, not blockchain based, but is derived off of blockchain. We will also not be using bitcoin as the native token it will be an itBit proprietary token.""\n\nAs for market fit, Wager said Bankchain will seek to appeal to institutions seeking to leverage the blockchain for clearing, settlement and custody, though he was also scant in providing details as to any partnerships itBit has secured.\n\n""We\'ve actually been focused on the custodian and broker-dealer community,"" he continued. ""We\'ve had over 200 unique meetings in New York and California, where they have expressed interest in clearing and custody.""\n\nOne of the older bitcoin exchanges in the ecosystem, itBit was also one of the first to raise a significant amount of venture capital, garnering $3.25m in late 2013 from investors including Canaan Partners, Liberty City Ventures and RRE Ventures then as a Singapore-based firm.\n\nItBit most recently finalized a $25m Series A in May, at which time it relocated its headquarters to New York.\n\nInspired by the blockchain\n\nToday, Bankchain remains in its infancy, with the platform being operated and used solely by itBit. Wager noted that Bankchain is being used for itBit\'s cash markets and that nodes on the Bankchain network are currently ""view-only"", meaning it is not yet accepting outside participants, as in the Ripple network.\n\nWager sought to underscore that Bankchain is ""inspired by"" bitcoin\'s blockchain, but that it is a consensus-based alternative system. Upon release, he said itBit has no plans to open source the code or distribute it outside of participants in the network.\n\nMoving forward, Wager said Bankchain\'s underlying technology is currently being subject to peer academic review. Further, he asserted that itBit has received a ""soft commitment"" from as many as 15 firms that are considering implementing the technology.\n\nStill, he cautioned that itBit\'s potential clients are still learning about the technology, emphasizing the need for a potentially lengthy education phase. In addition, he said, itBit is still determining how it would go about integrating with enterprise clients.\n\nWager expects any expansion of the project to be delayed until the end of 2015 or early 2016.\n\n""Eventually down the road, we\'re also looking at running our exchange through it, so we\'ll be able to use the consensus mechanism and then we\'ll be able to issue tokens,"" he explained.\n\nShifting strategies\n\nWhile typically thought of as a bitcoin exchange, Wager said that itBit sees itself as capable of being competitive across multiple verticals.\n\n""We have our cash bitcoin exchange, we\'ve rolled out an over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace and within our global community we will be offering a lending product for bitcoin,"" Wager said.\n\nAs itBit has the ability to act as a custodian for both fiat and bitcoin-denominated funds, Wager said he foresees this being broadly useful, allowing it to serve as a repository for assets held in retirement or other investment accounts.\n\nBankchain, however, aims to underlie all of itBit\'s services.\n\n""People who interact with Bankchain will have a modular selection of capabilities that they\'ll be able to chose from whether its trading, clearing and settlement or custody,"" he continued. ""We believe that the tying in of different business models will increase our competitiveness in the bitcoin space.""\n\nWager further characterized Bankchain as being capable of satisfying the growing demand for settlement solutions on Wall Street, adding:\n\n""Itbit is the only one who can allow true settlement finality on a tokenized basis for both assets as well as cash.""\n\nTrust advantage\n\nWhen asked how itBit will handle market competition in New York given its newcomer status to the state, Wager was quick to note that the exchange is the only entity currently operating with a New York banking charter, though rival Gemini has applied.\n\nAs such, he argues that itBit will be able to use this licensure to improve its Bankchain service, which in addition to tokenizing assets, will also allow these digital assets to be converted into US dollars.\n\n""Moving assets across the chain is relatively straightforward,"" Wager continued, ""But being able to settle to US dollars on the back of that is a different situation.""\n\nWager said that the banking charter allows itBit to ""tie into"" the existing financial structure in the US, and potentially other national financial services, should it seek to expand abroad. He added:\n\n""We can become a member of the national settlement service, and that\'s important because of the fact that most of the firms in blockchain tech have not been able to solve the problem in regards to delivery of a tokenized transaction.""\n\nWager was also quick to note that itBit is likely to benefit from the ongoing issues stemming from New York\'s enforcement of the BitLicense, its regulatory scheme for the industry.\n\n""We can continue to service clients in New York state as well as the US,"" he said, noting that other exchanges, including market leaders such as Bitfinex and Kraken, have chosen to avoid the market rather than bear the cost of licensing.\n\nStill, while beneficial for itBit\'s prospects, Wager was sympathetic to the hurdle the regulation is likely to put in front of those seeking to compete in the ecosystem.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""We of course feel for the other exchanges out there, but we do think regulation is a natural evolution for bitcoin as a business that can bring legitimacy to the system.""\n\nAdditional reporting contributed by Stan Higgins.\n\nTop secret image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'In April, Bitcoin Magazine reported that UBS was planning to investigate blockchain technology in a new innovation lab based in London. The innovation lab located in Level39, Europe’s largest technology accelerator space for finance and cyber-securities, focuses on exploring the role of blockchain technology in financial services.\n\n“Our innovation lab at Level39 will provide a unique platform to explore emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and to understand the potential impact for the industry,” said UBS Group CIO Oliver Bussmann.\n\nUBS, a Swiss global financial services company with its headquarters in Basel and Zürich, Switzerland, provides investment banking, asset management and wealth management services for private, corporate, and institutional clients worldwide. Operating in more than 50 countries with about 60,000 employees around the world, UBS is the biggest Swiss bank and is considered as the world’s largest manager of private wealth assets, with more than 2.2 trillion Swiss francs (CHF) in invested assets.\n\nNow UBS has launched a call for ideas to the financial technology community.\n\n”Today is a very exciting day for UBS,” writes Bussmann on Linkedin’s Pulse. “We have launched the UBS Future of Finance Challenge, a competition which is open to entrepreneurs and startups around the world with potentially disruptive technological ideas and solutions to support the transformation of the banking industry.”\n\nEntries can be submitted by entrepreneurs and startups with revenues of less than $3 million USD, which have received less than $10 million USD in funding and were incorporated on or after January 1, 2010. The closing date is September 23, 2015. UBS is offering the regional and global finalists cash prizes and accelerator places worth more than $300,000 USD and more than 300 hours of dedicated coaching from UBS mentors and partners.\n\n“We recognize there is a lot we can learn from entrepreneurs and startups,” says Bussman. “Hence why we were so pleased to be the first global bank to move into Level39 in London. Ultimately our ambition is to help shape a more open and collaborative financial services industry and to jointly develop new solutions for our clients.”\n\nThe Future of Finance Challenge is divided in four main categories where technology can transform how the bank works and what it delivers for its clients: Secure Banking, Client Experience, Superior Offering and Banking Efficiency. In order to address these challenges, UBS suggests a long list of innovative approaches and potentially disruptive technologies that might be relevant. The list includes a wide range of currently hot technology buzzwords, including some that are (at this moment) only weakly related to the business of banking, such as immersive virtual reality environments and quantum processing.\n\nBitcoin Magazine readers and Bitcoin companies interested in participating in the UBS Challenge will be especially interested in these technologies mentioned in the UBS call: blockchain applications, blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, data analytics, digital identification, digital marketplaces, digital vault, distributed ledgers, mobile technology, security and privacy verification and smart contracts. It seems likely that, by leveraging these technologies in combination with the others mentioned in the UBS call, participants will be able to come up with innovative ideas and solutions for UBS and the banking industry.', 'Peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange LocalBitCoins has joined the exodus of companies exiting the state of New York refusing to comply with the BitLicense.\n\nFarewell New York\n\nThere has been a torrent of activity over the last few days over the August 8 deadline for declaring corporate compliance with New York’s infamous BitLicense regulation.\n\nMany companies have chosen to opt-out of the regulation and the New York State market altogether. This verdict seems to also apply to the popular Bitcoin wallet provider and peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitCoins.com, who has posted a message on their site regarding this lightning rod legal issue.\n\nThe Localbitcoins community manager, Max, posted this statement publicly:\n\n“We’re sad to say that due to regulators another region has had to be blocked from LocalBitcoins. From today onwards users from New York are no longer allowed to use LocalBitcoins because of the legislation known as the BitLicense (23 NYCRR 200) which makes it a federal offense to sell virtual currency unless you have applied for the license. This new regulation would require anyone selling Bitcoins through our service to acquire the Bit License if they sell Bitcoins to residents of New York. As the Bit license is time consuming, expensive and difficult to obtain for anything but large companies we’ve taken the decision to protect our US based traders and not allow New York based users to use our service. If you reside in the US, you will get a one-time pop up notification requiring you to confirm whether or not you live in New York. All new users will equally have to answer the same question. This is an unfortunate state of affairs and we hope that the regulation will in the future accommodate small time bitcoin sellers who do not have the possibility to comply with regulations made for big financial institutions. For the time being though, we bid New York farewell”.\n\nAre you a New Yorker?\n\nUpon entering the website, particularly if you reside in the US, you will get a one-time pop-up notification or “lightbox"" on your screen. You will not be able to continue using LocalBitCoins.com until you answer one very important question.\n\nBitLicense has proven to not only send Bitcoin business anywhere else but New York, but it ultimately hurts the state’s residents the most. Impressively, this BitLicense edict would imply that New York regulators can discern the state of residency of every Bitcoin owner, user, or every transaction going forward, in order to enforce this regulatory mandate.\n\nFor U.S. tax purposes, you’re supposed to declare any Bitcoin transactions that result in capital gains. But what if you just wanted to buy and hold bitcoin, as a hedge against inflation, or against an impending currency collapse? It seems this would be a non-option for the unfortunate residents of New York state unless they deal only with BitLicense-certified companies.\n\nWould New York residents be criminalized in a similar fashion to a drug smuggler for buying bitcoin from an unlicensed Bitcoin services provider? The goal may be to make it so onerous and inconvenient to obtain or transfer bitcoin that any would-be competitor, startup or disruptive fintech service are barred from doing business in the state without paying a hefty fee. This seems to be the net effect of the legislation.\n\nThe price of an apartment is not the only thing that is incredibly high in New York. So is the price of economic freedom.', 'A white-hat hacker has released a new tool designed to illustrate the ease with which illicit actors can steal bitcoins from brainwallets, a type of bitcoin wallet iteration where passwords are not stored digitally – but in the memory of the user.\n\nOriginally conceived as a way to keep sensitive wallet data offline and make bitcoin addresses easier to remember, the brainwallet was partly undone due to how it interacts with the bitcoin blockchain. A brainwallet uses a single, long password or phrase, converts it to a private key, a public key and finally an address. Using an offline attack, it\'s possible to rapidly guess potential passwords to see if they\'re correct.\n\nNew research by Ryan Castellucci, a security researcher at digital fraud firm White Ops, indicates there is as major flaw in this method. He highlights that the final bitcoin address is recorded in the blockchain as a password hash. When used for website authentication, password hashes help determine whether the word or phrase supplied is correct, meaning this data can be used as a reference to bad actors looking for the password.\n\nReleased on 7th August at DEF CON 23, one of the world\'s largest annual hacker conventions, Castellucci\'s brainwallet cracker, called Brainflayer, is capable of guessing 130,000 passwords a second. Running on more powerful computers, $1 can be used to check 560 million passphrases, according to its creator.\n\nWhen this firepower is applied to ASCII passwords, ones constructed from US keyboard characters, and XKCD passwords, those comprised of four common words, Castellucci suggested a botnet could check every bitcoin address that has ever received funds in a single day.\n\nIn an interview, Castellucci sought to emphasize that, while the tool he released could be used by criminals, he hopes its release will encourage bitcoin users to adopt better security practices.\n\nCastellucci told CoinDesk:\n\n""You can scream from the rooftops that something is weak and vulnerable, but many people will just stay in denial without a working proof of concept. I think that the concept of letting humans choose their own passwords and passphrases for high security applications is fundamentally flawed.""\n\nIn this case, however, Castellucci\'s presentation didn\'t fall on deaf ears.\n\nFollowing the release, BrainWallet.org, a website that used JavaScript to generate private keys for users, went offline. Though others services remain available, the closure was widely praised by members of the bitcoin security community.\n\nProject beginnings\n\nAccording to Castellucci, the genesis for the project came in mid-2013, when bitcoin users first began reporting issues with brainwallet security.\n\nAround the same time, a vigilante Reddit user known as btcrobinhood began stealing from brainwallets, returning the funds to their rightful owners in an effort to expose the vulnerability of the technology.\n\nInspired, Castellucci created an original cracker able to issue 10,000 password guesses a second, a far cry from Brainflayer\'s capabilities. Still, as he recalls, he was able to feed the program simple word lists and achieve powerful results.\n\nWhen he returned to his computer, he found the prototype Brainflayer had retrieved 250 BTC, then worth $20,000 from cracked brainwallets.\n\nCastellucci said he was put into a difficult ethical situation as a result. He had two options – take some bitcoins as part of an effort to alert the wallet user that their security is vulnerable, or try to contact them through other means. Ultimately, he said he wasn\'t sure what to do.\n\n""For a while I just stopped my research,"" he said. ""I hoped the problem would go away. After all, many experts were saying that brainwallets were bad.""\n\nWhen the problem didn\'t disappear, he decided to return to the research, arguing that it was his responsibility to disclose the vulnerability so people could take appropriate steps to keep themselves protected.\n\n""The idea is that if someone like me discovers a bug, they make a good faith effort to get the bug fixed before sharing it with the world. I\'ve done this in the past, and I think it\'s generally the right approach,"" he said in a recent blog post.\n\nFuture of the tech\n\nThe issue with brainwallets, however, is also one that affects anything secured by password protection, according to Castellucci.\n\nAs such, he suggested that those who are using brainwallets consider WarpWallets, which are currently considered to be improved iterations of the idea. A warpwallet generator available from Keybase, for instance, allows users to never have to save or store their private keys anywhere, provided they pick ""a really good password"".\n\nWith WarpWallets, Castellucci said, a ""salt"", or random data used an input for hashing functions, is integrated into the equation. This means that if a user\'s salt was their email address, a potential thief would need to know both the salt and the password to compromise funds.\n\nStill, Castellucci advises those who use such wallets to use diceware to generate passwords, a process by which passwords are created by a pair of dice and a random number generator.\n\n""It seems to be really, really hard to keep people from choosing their dog\'s name and their birthday as a password. Scrypt can\'t save people who use \'P@ssw0rd\',"" he said. ""A lot of people seemed to think that a long passphrase was a secure passphrase, and I think I\'ve proven that\'s not necessarily true.""\n\nLost and found\n\nWhen asked how he plans to continue his work, Castellucci said he\'s still in the process of considering follow-up actions.\n\nSo far, he\'s considered adding support for other brainwallet-like tools to Brainflayer, including a mode that would scan with raw private keys. Still, he laments the stress that achieving any advance in bitcoin wallet security might bring.\n\n""I still dread the possibility of finding another large brainwallet,"" he said. ""Outside of cryptocurrency, if you found a bunch of money and weren\'t sure who it belonged to, you\'d turn it into the police and let it be their problem.""\n\nThis process doesn\'t work yet in the bitcoin ecosystem. As Castellucci noted, online forms of cash have no lost and founds, places where funds could be stored with a reliable third party until they could be claimed by their owner.\n\nStill, while he likes the idea, more questions remain:\n\n""Who would run such a thing? And what the legal implications would be? I am not sure.""\n\nView Castellucci\'s full DEF CON presentation here.\n\nHacker visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Rallo Contracting Company, Inc. to build a state-of-the-art Fortress One data center.\n\nAll this points to just one thing and that is that the Bitcoin blockchain-focused company will be wooing more and more people to join its growing firm with extensive plans, promotions and deals in days to come.', 'Even though Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are slowly taking off around the world, the major problem with them is that you can typically only for goods and services from a retailer that accepts Bitcoin.\n\nUntil now…\n\nZAZOO, a subsidiary of Net 1 UEPS Technologies, has just announced that it’s signed a deal with South African-based Bitcoin platform BitX to allow users to spend their hard-earned bitcoins anywhere they wish through the company’s VCpay technology.\n\nVCPay is a South African-developed virtual credit card app. Using it is simple: you simply install the app on your phone, and then you can use it to create legitimate credit card numbers with expiry dates and CSV numbers that will be accepted anywhere. In order to use the card number, you can either link it to a bank account to withdraw money on the fly or top up an amount into your VC Pay account.\n\nSystems like VCPay are especially useful if you’re worried about people skimming your card details in online transactions: you can create a card with exactly the balance you want to spend and then never use it or top it up again. Essentially it’s a one time use card that won’t be any good to anyone who steals the details later. You don’t even need a bank account to sign up for VCPay.\n\nAdvert\n\nWith the BitX partnership, you can transfer Bitcoins onto the card and then use them to make purchases in any currency.\n\n“This collaboration will enable BitX and VCpay users to now spend Bitcoins agnostically, anywhere online and anywhere in the world, without any changes to the existing acquiring or switching infrastructures. We believe that BitX is an ideal partner for our technology as it is a rising star in the crypto-currency field, and supported by astute investors such as Naspers,” said Philip Belamant, Managing Director of ZAZOO in a statement.\n\nBelamant further explained that by making BitX and VCpay inter-operable, it means that anyone who has Bitcoin will be able use a mobile virtual card completely offline and without the need to access a mobile phone network.\n\n“Customers can then use these MVCs to pay for goods and services online or at any merchant that accepts debit or credit card payments, or they can transfer funds to family or friends who do not own Bitcoin via standard remittance applications,” he said.\n\nBelamant says that this move potentially adds an extra layer of anonymity to Bitcoin payments.\n\n“Because VCpay is a tokenized payment, no card holder information is shared with the merchant,” Belamant told htxt.africa, “This is great because if the merchants database is ever compromised – or they decide they feel like selling your data – it will mean nothing to the third party into whose lap the data falls, unlike traditional plastic cards.”\n\nAdvert\n\nGiving a real-world example of how this could work, Belamant explained that a gamer will be able to sell in-game assets in exchange for Bitcoins and will then be able to generate a VCpay MVC to pay for his UBER ride.\n\nZAZOO is planning to roll out the functionality across the globe, but for now it is only available in Europe, Singapore, Philippines, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\n[Image – CC by 2.0/Martin Kalfatovic]', 'Prepaid and postpaid subscribers can now make their mobile payments through bitcoin company Zebpay, which has recently entered this market. Consumers can recharge their plans, mobile airtime, DTH, and data card using bitcoin.\n\nPrior to this, bitcoin company Zebpay has been concentrating on its wallet offering, allowing users to buy or sell using cryptocurrency. Mobile payments are now available for Android smartphones which have the bitcoin wallet app.\n\nBitcoin Company Ventures\n\nMobile plans that are covered by this payment service are Vodafone, AirtelBSE, Uninor, Tata Docomo, Reliance, BSNL and MTNL, and DTH of Tata Sky, Reliance, Dish and Sun TV. The bitcoin company is also working getting approval for its iPhone wallet app through the App Store.\n\nCurrently, we pay the companies in rupees after accepting bitcoin from the Zebpay app users,” said Saurabh Agrawal, co-founder of Zebpay, which is based in Ahmedabad. According to its website, the bitcoin company is the most popular place to buy cryptocurrency in India. Its cold wallets are secured using multisig verification and uses industry standard best practices.\n\nAside from its bitcoin wallet services, Zebpay also offers special deals to buy airtime and shopping vouchers to clients in India and the US. The wallet address is linked to the user’s mobile number, allowing one to send or receive bitcoins just like sending or receiving SMS.\n\nAs of this writing, Zebpay boasts of more than 100,000 downloads and a 4.3 star rating.

They\'ve shared their needs with us and we\'re building solutions to meet those needs. Our technology enables them to do their very important work.""\n\nBlind spot\n\nAlthough the wealth of successful prosecutions for bitcoin-related crimes highlight that digital currencies aren\'t above the law, it\'s an area that still requires highly specific investigative skills, which may be out of reach for smaller agencies.\n\nBesides Sabr.io, a number of bitcoin firms, including Chainalysis and London-based custodian Elliptic, are creating whitelabel \'blockchain explorers\' designed to bridge this knowledge gap.\n\nNot everyone is happy, however. Companies have come under scrutiny from bitcoin\'s pro-privacy factions for offering law enforcement the tools to monitor and \'unmask\' transactions.\n\nShould running tests on an open, peer-to-peer network such as bitcoin require consent? Others in the space say \'no\'. They see solutions like these as a crucial step towards legitimacy and interoperability for cryptocurrencies more broadly.\n\nBerger said:\n\n""While some have suggested regulatory solutions, we were proud to present a technology-based solution that will lessen the need for regulation.""\n\nSabr.io\'s website notes that the utility of blockchain can only achieve further growth within the bounds of the law.\n\n""I am excited about the future of bitcoin and am determined not to let it be hijacked by criminals.

08/14/2015,"['Last weekend the deadline to apply for a BitLicense came and went, and a slew of bitcoin startups went too—right out of New York State.\n\nThe BitLicense is New York’s regulatory badge of approval, required of all digital-currency businesses that are deemed “money transmitters” (companies that hold customer funds, most of them exchanges). And it has been highly controversial in bitcoin circles since it was first unveiled over year ago, after multiple revisions.\n\nBitcoin executives—even those who chose to apply for a license for their company—have gripes about the final set of rules, and are still hoping to see it change. This weekend, many of them decided to make a statement: rather than apply for the license, they left New York. For some with physical headquarters in the state, that meant literal moving trucks. For others it meant cutting off service to New York-based customers.\n\nTo leave New York entirely may seem like a drastic step, but much of the most fevered activity around trading of the digital currency is happening outside the U.S. anyway. The new defectors are all following ShapeShift, a startup led by outspoken bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees, which was the first to go, cutting off service to New York just days after the BitLicense came out.\n\nWhy are they upset?\n\nCritics of the BitLicense see limitations in the specific rules, such as the requirement of new licenses for every new service offered. But the application process, too, has left some companies wringing their hands.\n\nThe application costs $5,000, which alone does not necessarily seem excessive. But executives say that the paperwork was extensive and required legal help, which carries additional fees. Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of Coinsetter, tells Fortune his company spent nearly $50,000 to apply for the BitLicense. George Frost, chief legal officer at Bitstamp, told Coindesk it was more like $100,000 for his company. If either of those figures is remotely accurate, that cost would certainly be prohibitive for smaller companies.\n\n“You’d hope that the costs are outweighed by the value, but for some, maybe not,” says Lukasiewicz. He says that Coinsetter seriously considered not applying, but, “I definitely don’t need the legal risk.” Lukasiewicz is not a fan of the BitLicense, or of regulation in general for the space, but he says, “I don’t want to have to hide in New York. And I viewed it as something that could have marketing upside in terms of helping people feel safer using us.”\n\nThose who leave and those who stay\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list, but here are some of the companies that packed up and left New York: Bitfinex, BitQuick, BTCGuild, Eobot, Genesis Mining, GoCoin, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, Paxful, and Poloniex.\n\nAlmost all of them published statements about their reasons for refusing to apply, and most of them read similarly. “This particular piece of legislation is unnecessary and is an obstacle to free market innovation,” wrote Genesis Mining on its blog. Kraken, an exchange headquartered in San Francisco, said that the license, “comes at a price that exceeds the market opportunity of servicing New York residents. Therefore, we have no option but to withdraw our service from the state.”\n\nEven some digital currency companies that are not money-transmitters, and thus do not need to obtain a BitLicense, voiced their criticism of the regulations and support for companies that exited. Paul Puey, CEO of Airbitz, wrote, “Luckily at Airbitz, we aren’t affected… With all the companies announcing these restrictions today, it should remind the community of the importance to be, and to support, decentralization. Bitcoin was intended to give people true control and access to their money and every time we use a centralized service, we aren’t truly using Bitcoin.”\n\nBitcoin blogs like CoinFox and Coin Telegraph are calling this a “mass exodus” while New York Business Journal christens it “The Great Bitcoin Exodus.” But before the weight of these exits gets overstated, it is important to note that most of the hottest, best-funded bitcoin companies—for example, Coinbase, Circle, 21 Inc., and itBit—are staying. Of the companies that left New York this week, Bitfinex was the most significant and surprising.\n\nBitreserve, which is headquartered in South Carolina but has New York clients, is staying. CEO Anthony Watson, a former Nike CIO and alum of Fortune‘s 40 Under 40 list, tells Fortune that being regulated is a priority: “Bitreserve has an extensive and comprehensive licensing strategy for all 50 states in the U.S., including New York.” Coinsetter, which does much of its business in Canada thanks to acquiring Cavirtex last year, is staying. Gemini, a planned exchange from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who already run a bitcoin pricing index and have invested in a slew of bitcoin companies, is staying; the twins have made it clear they are in no hurry to launch their exchange until it is fully licensed. (Coinbase, a leading exchange that has investment from the NYSE, launched without a BitLicense.)\n\nIn total, 22 companies have applied for a BitLicense thus far. As for the blowback from the companies that refused, a spokesperson for the NYDFS told Fortune, “There are always going to be those who argue for little-to-no regulation, but we think that ultimately the BitLicense is going to a be a positive for the long-term health of this industry. If digital currency is going to gain wider adoption, strong consumer protections and oversight (to help ensure that customer money doesn’t fall into a black hole) will be critical.”\n\nWhat to expect next\n\nFor now, no one knows quite what level of action—how quickly or how severe—the NY Department of Financial Services will take against companies that continue to operate in New York without a BitLicense. That means it is possible we may see a bitcoin startup that did not apply nonetheless attempt to maintain service in the state.\n\nHaving a BitLicense may even end up being seen as a “nice to have,” but not crucial. Think of it as a building being LEED-certified, bearing the seal that shows it is eco-friendly. Lukasiewicz likes that analogy. But he believes that any company with customers in New York that didn’t apply is taking a big risk. After all, the industry watched closely the prosecution, in Manhattan, of Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht.\n\n“I do think the biggest story in bitcoin in the next year,” Lukasiewicz says, “will be watching the NYDFS and seeing what develops next.”\n\nThis story was updated to include a comment from the NY Department of Financial Services; it also originally stated, in error, that Xapo was one of the companies leaving New York.', '', 'Bitcoin has inspired yet another technology that has some in the investor world worried that it will be used for the one thing bitcoin is commonly associated with: criminal activity.\n\nThe worry is over something called smart contracts. These crypto-enabled contracts are capable of serving as official documents for financial trades, legal agreements, etc. Their big value proposition? They take out the middle man often associated with getting official documents from person A to person B.\n\nWhere the cryptocurrency comes into play is that under the agreements, parties can engage in these official documents online and pay for the terms outlined in the cryptography-enabled documents using, well, cryptocurrency — at least when the parties are really trying to keep the deal under wraps.\n\nThis technology was the subject of a new research paper from Cornell Tech cryptographer and professor Ari Juels, who wrote about how this technology could be used to support illegal activity and where the connection to bitcoin and cryptocurrency comes into play. The research — which also includes the work of Cornell professor Elaine Shi and University of Maryland researcher Ahmed Kosba — specifically pinpoints bitcoin at the start of the paper.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin remove the need for trusted third parties from basic monetary transactions and offer anonymous (more accurately, pseudonymous) transactions between individuals. While attractive to some, these features have a dark side. Bitcoin has stimulated the growth of ransomware, money laundering, and illicit commerce, as exemplified by the notorious Silk Road,” the researchers wrote.\n\nHmmm…ransomware, money laundering, and illicit commerce. Sounds like the topics that come up in just about every PYMNTS Bitcoin Tracker.\n\nSo why the big deal?\n\n“Criminal activity committed under the guise of anonymity has posed a major impediment to adoption for bitcoin. Yet there has been little discussion of criminal contracts in public forums on cryptocurrency,” the researchers concluded.\n\nWhere bitcoin’s technology also comes into the mix is through the blockchain, the decentralized ledger that moves money and cuts out the middle man (like a bank) when getting the funds transferred. Much like the technology of the smart contracts, the middle man (lawyers) are removed.\n\nThe researchers also explain that in their paper: “As bitcoin does for transactions, in a decentralized smart contract system, the consensus system enforces autonomous execution of contracts; no one entity or small set of entities can interfere with the execution of a contract. …Decentralized smart contracts offer several advantages over traditional cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.”\n\nMoreover, the researchers point to why decentralized contracts — like the smart contract’s technology entails — is a haven for criminals. And wouldn’t you guess: it’s got bitcoin-like characteristics written all over it.\n\n“As decentralized smart contract systems typically inherit the anonymity (pseudonymity) of bitcoin, they offer similar secrecy for criminal activities. Broadly speaking, therefore, there is a risk that the capabilities enabled by decentralized smart contract systems will enable new underground ecosystems and communities,” the research states.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning of the research — research that shows how a contract may be created to encourage a hacker to breach a site, and then pay in bitcoin. The contract is created in a professional manner, but it may be encouraging the wrong type of people to use it.\n\n“In some ways this is the perfect vehicle for criminal acts, because it’s meant to create trust in situations where otherwise it’s difficult to achieve,” Juels said.\n\nIt’s just another week in the bitcoin world, where it can’t seem to shake its association with criminal elements.\n\nBitcoin Tracker Week 86\n\nThe Good, The Bad — The Top Bitcoin Stories Of The Week\n\nBitcoins Takes Aim Into Illegal Gun Market\n\nKeeping in theme of the illegal activity associated with bitcoin, how about the case of the Michigan man accused of using bitcoin to both buy and sell illegal gun components.\n\nOn the Dark Web. As a result, Benjamin James Cance faces 20 years in prison alone for just shipping the guns since they were shipped internationally. He faces charges for shipping illegal arms and money laundering, among others.\n\nInflation? Not A Problem For Bitcoin, Says One Economist\n\nAt the Texas Bitcoin Conference, Economist Robert Murphy attempted to make his case about why inflation issues don’t impact the value of bitcoin. Some economists have argued that deflation is one reason why bitcoin can’t be a viable currency, but Murphy spent his time trying to debunk that theory.\n\n“Part of where this fear of deflation comes from is, historically, it’s associated with very bad economies. So, during the Great Depression of the ’30s, there were falling prices. And there are other periods where prices fell when things were bad, but I would argue that the causality was the other way around. Partly what was going on there was people were concerned because the economy was so terrible,” Murphy said. “And, so what do you do when you’re afraid? You don’t want to invest in companies and things like that. You rush to liquidity. You rush to hard money. That’s why you often see in periods of panic people will rush to the money, so you see prices of all other things quoted in money fall. So, it’s not that the falling prices caused the bad economy. It’s the other way around.”\n\nThe Batman Of The Bitcoin World\n\nThere’s a new type of criminal catcher in town, and while it’s not exactly a hero like the Dark Knight is to Gotham City, there are startups in the blockchain world that are trying to crack down on criminals faster than law enforcement can keep up with.\n\nSabr.io was just one of many companies that was highlighted as being a company that’s attempting to help investigators crack the code on bitcoin crime — and illegal bitcoin marketplaces.\n\n“Law enforcement has been and continues to be our partner in the development of this technology. They’ve shared their needs with us and we’re building solutions to meet those needs. Our technology enables them to do their very important work,” Sabr.io CEO David Berger said in an interview.\n\n“I am excited about the future of bitcoin and am determined not to let it be hijacked by criminals. I have no qualms about helping to put child pornographers, terrorists and arms dealers behind bars,” he added.\n\nBitcoin Ransom Sparks Fear Of Bombings\n\nYes, another bitcoin ransom. But this time, the consequences are rather grim.\n\nA case in the Netherlands shows that an unknown criminal has been placing small explosives in supermarket chains and demanding large amounts of bitcoin ransoms in order to avoid detonating the bombs. The first case began in May, but police were able to defuse the bomb. Weeks later, another was discovered.\n\nThe case continues for now as police keep getting notes that the criminal will not stop until the undisclosed bitcoin amount is paid.\n\nNSA Codebreaker Joins Ranks At Bitcoin Exchange\n\nWhile bitcoin is a little bit secretive itself, the bitcoin exchange itBit just secured a new member on its board of directors who knows a little something about security and technology. Ed Giorgio, a NSA veteran, will be joining the board to help direct its technology initiatives.\n\n“Jim brings over 20 years of investment experience developing and advising technology companies, and Ed’s expertise in cryptography and cybersecurity will help ensure that itBit’s bitcoin exchange and our next generation of blockchain-based products remain the safest and most secure in the industry,” said Chad Cascarilla, itBit’s CEO and co-founder.\n\nIs Bitcoin The Next Big Thing In Cross-Border Commerce?\n\nSome may wonder “why does bitcoin matter?” Well, in a recent interview, Xapo CEO Wences Casares made an argument that bitcoin — much like the invention of the Internet — is important to help people conduct cross-border commerce.\n\nAs more focus has been on getting Internet access to to the developing world, the CEO wants to make a case as to why breaking open access to an online payment ledger (the blockchain) could be a big move in helping money move around the world. And that could mean a lot for digital commerce, he suggests.\n\n“When there are problems with a currency like I saw growing up in Argentina, the poor get the worst end of that trade, right? The rich can move their assets somewhere, but the poor can’t. Bitcoin changes all of that. Now, anyone with a little bit of cash — all you need is a cellphone. Anyone with a cellphone can get bitcoin and participate in the digital economy. And have an alternative to the local currency they don’t trust. Both of those things are incredible,” Casares said in an interview.\n\nCasares is also the person who said that the value of a bitcoin would go between $500,000-$1 million dollars in April 2014. It’s trading today at just above $265.', 'It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in San Francisco’s Dolores Park and kids on gyroscopic single-wheeled skateboards seemed to float uphill. I sat next to the “Fuck the techies!” graffiti, waiting to score some weed. But my eyes weren’t on the park — they were on the skies. Because I was about to get a very special drone delivery.\n\nLike a lot of you, I saw a tantalizing video from a mysterious San Francisco company called Trees a couple of weeks ago. In it, an extremely delighted-looking person sits in Dolores Park while a Phantom drone delivers a lovely-looking box of cannabis items to him.\n\nHow, I wondered, could I be just like that person?\n\nI immediately went to the Trees website and started chatting with their rep. I asked if they delivered to my neighborhood, and was told that they didn’t do it quite yet — they’re still setting up their 333 exemption to FAA regulations on drones that prevent delivery for profit. But Marshall Hayner, Trees’ CEO, promised that if I showed up at Dolores Park around 3 PM on Saturday I’d “see some drones.” He refused to reveal more than that.\n\nSo of course I hiked over to Dolores a few days later, not entirely sure what to expect — but hoping against hope that it would all end with me smoking some sweet, sweet cannabis in the middle of a park while drones swooped around me like parrots.\n\nI was prepared for a lot of weird things to happen, but I wasn’t ready for the Bitcoin.\n\nWhen Hayner and his colleagues showed up, drone in hand, it became immediately clear that this wasn’t really about drones, or even cannabis really. It was about Bitcoin. Jackson Palmer, creator of the notorious Dogecoin, is working with Hayner on Trees. So is engineer Morgan Rockwell, inventor of the BitSwitch, a device that allows you to use Bitcoin to pay at vending machines and coin-operated devices like washing machines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three of them have been involved in Bitcoin startups for a while — but now they’re a little bit jaded. Said Jackson, whose Dogecoin attracted international attention, “There was a [Bitcoin] bubble and it’s over.”\n\nAdded Hayner, “Yeah there are a few seed rounds, but nobody is really putting money into it anymore.”\n\nWhat do frustrated Bitcoin entrepreneurs do when the bubble bursts? They try to find a really good reason to use Bitcoin — one that isn’t tied up in bullshit products beloved by VCs. And that’s where cannabis comes in. It’s the perfect product for a currency that, as Rockwell put it, “skips around the bank.” In the US, cannabis is legal in only a few states (including California, where I have a cannabis card, so this entire transaction was legal). But this creates a problem for any business that wants to deal with banks, which are centralized on a national level.\n\n“Cannabis and Bitcoin support each other,” Hayner said simply.\n\nSo how does this whole operation work? Well, it definitely starts with some seriously good cannabis, which Hayner has access to from years of running a collective that can sell it legally. But then there’s the question of how to do delivery in a way that stands out from all the other weed delivery places. That’s where drones come in. And finally, there’s the key ingredient: Bitcoin. Money of the future.\n\nThe drones will take money using the BitSwitch.\n\nIt can host a local version of the blockchain, the secure online ledger system that forms the backbone of Bitcoin, and instantly check Bitcoin payments against it. So you can literally poke a button in your app, send a few Satoshis (the smaller unit of Bitcoins) to Trees, and the BitSwitch processes your payment instantly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdeally, you’ve got that BitSwitch on your drone — and once your payment goes through, it drops the goods right into your lap. I say ideally because of course that assumes a lot of things — like Trees actually getting 333 exemption through their partner company Aerovision, which does drone photography at festivals and concerts. And, more pressingly last Saturday afternoon, assuming that Rockwell can actually get the drivers working on his laptop so that the whole system can run at all.\n\nIn the end, we spent a lot of time watching Rockwell fiddle with his software, while Hayner drove the drone for a while. If everything had gone according to plan, I would have gotten a box like this, above. Those purple jewel cases were packed with delicious, delicious buds. Top notch stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the showstopper was actually the Bitcoin, not the bud. And Hayner’s futuristic plans. “The ten year vision is an app for every part of this industry,” he said, puffing on a vape pen full of cannabis oil. “You’ve got apps for the grower to monitor nutrient levels, and it ties into everything.” Soon you have apps for harvesting, shipping, selling, and finally, of course Bitcoin point-of-sale devices in your delivery drones.\n\n“In the future all these apps can pull together a network, little by little,” Hayner said, gesturing vaguely at the drone, the box of pot he’d just given me, and perhaps at the park itself. It wasn’t clear. But the future never is.', 'Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

There was damage to a window and door frame but no-one was hurt.\n\nThe owners of the supermarket chain then received a letter - written on the Notepad computer program - demanding the ransom.\n\n""In the letter the offender requests a quantitiy of bitcoins, an electronic payment,"" said the Dutch police.\n\n""He writes that he will no sooner stop his activities until he receives the requested bitcoins.""\n\nThe day after the letter was received, an anonymous tip was submitted about another bomb. Police evacuated the store in question but weren\'t able to find a device.\n\nSince then, a letter containing a musical birthday card was sent to the supermarket chain containing a small amount of explosive powder and another threat.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that doesn’t have a central authority and is often used in transactions for illegal activities.\n\nWhile users are not identified by name, transactions can be linked to individuals and companies, as they are all recorded into a public ledger, which are viewable by everyone.\n\nHowever it is not difficult to maintain anonymity by using a different bitcoin address for each transaction.\n\nThere are also mixing services that allow users to trade the currency which links them to other coins with different transactions histories.', 'Bitcoin runs on a blockchain, a decentralised and public ledger where every transaction made on the network is permanently registered. By offering processing power towards this, users are rewarded with bitcoin creating a run to assemble ever more sophisticated and powerful equipment to mine new bitcoin.\n\nAlthough many think that startups like Coinbase, Blockchain, or BitPay are some of the most important companies in the bitcoin mining industry, in fact where the most important bitcoin companies reside.\n\nThe miners form the core backbone of bitcoin, ensuring the digital currency’s integrity and decentralization. This decentralization of he bitcoin industry has huge benefits, but also comes with new risks: Right now, if just the top three organizations joined forces they would control 51% of the network — giving them the power to rewrite the blockchain as they see fit. And if this happens, it can ruin bitcoin.\n\nSome individuals have their own mining machines to mine alone while others join open mining pools where they combine their efforts to improve their chances to get newly issued bitcoin. However, larger companies are leading the mining efforts. According to Business Insider and data collected from Blocktrail the 5 companies leading the Industry listed below:\n\nAntPool — Bitmain was launched in Q1 2013, and co-founder Jihan Wu is the CEO. It boasts that its technology accounts for 56% of global bitcoin miners. Bitmain comes first with a total hash rate of 17.82%. DiscusFish/P2Pool — officially known as F2Pool, this Chinese pool is also known as DiscusFish due to its logo — a discus fish. It is operated by Wang Chun and Mao Shihang. A spokesperson told Business Insider that the pool owns no hardware itself; 100% of its hash power comes from users. DiscusFish gets second place with a total hash rate of 16.49%. BitFury — BitFury is the best-funded mining hardware company in the business, raising $20 million (£12.8 million) in July 2015. It was, CoinDesk notes, its third round in two years, and it has now raised $60 million (38.4 million) in total. BitFury controls about 16.4% of the total hash rate. BTC China Pool — a relative newcomer to the scene, the BTCChina Pool is one of the biggest players around despite only launching at the end of 2014. It was founded in 2011, and is currently led by Bobby Lee, who became CEO after purchasing the exchange in 2013. BTC China Pool comes 4th with a total hash rate of 13.74%. BW Pool — BW Pool is another Chinese pool. It has alm ost no publicity in the English-speaking world, despite its size. It made a rare public statement in July 2015, when it co-signed a Reddit post in favour of an increase in block size — an ongoing technical question the bitcoin community is debating. BW Pool gets the fifth place with a total hash rate of 7.68%.\n\nThese are the Top 5 companies leading the bitcoin mining Industry. Several more are still on the queue but only these five along secure about 72.13% of the total network hash rate which can be a little bit scary. Fortunately, the network participants all try to keep it totally decentralized in an attempt to prevent the 51% attack.\n\nSource\n\nImage: 1, 2\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Founded by Julian Mautner, Tim Rehder, and Andreas Lehrbaum, the companies hope to work around capital controls in the country to get businesses running again in the country.\n\nEssentially the team is building a cross-border payments service for the Greek market. They are focusing on small and mid-size businesses. The team is supporting voucher payments backed by bitcoin as well as access to point of sale terminals and ATMs. Essentially they are rebuilding financial transactions using bitcoin as the backing medium.\n\n“Cubits is in this for the long run, this is their priority and main focus,” said Rehder.\n\nThe company currently has 15,000 wallets and 500,000 monthly transactions.\n\n“With Greece’s myriad of financial problems at a record high, economic relationships are strained by the current credit controls as businesses grapple to seek permission in order to pay suppliers, and individuals are limited to withdrawals of EUR 60 per day,” said Rehder. “As the only operational bitcoin exchange in Greece, BtcGreece allows Greeks to purchase bitcoin and remit defined payments abroad. Cubits’ arrival in the Greek market will provide the professional solution to the problems at hand.”\n\nGreece’s problems probably won’t be completely solved by a bit of bitcoin but it’s been an interesting ride. Spartanroute is attempting these same moves and individuals in Greece are working toward similar solutions. It will be interesting to see who thrives – and who survives.\n\nFeatured Image: AFP PHOTO / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS/Getty Images', 'This is a guest post by Chris Grundy, a Berlin-based Bitcoin enthusiast who works at Bitbond.\n\nDespite Germany’s recent negative press over the Greek bailout, Berlin remains one of the world’s greatest cities for Bitcoin lovers. Whether it’s the plethora of innovative bitcoin startups springing up all over the city, the widespread adoption of the cryptocurrency along Berlin’s high streets, or the vast amount of investment flooding into the German capital, Berlin’s relationship with Bitcoin will be instrumental in shaping its future.\n\nBerlin startups have been enjoying an unprecedented level of investment. Indeed, “Die Welt” reported that Berlin overtook London in terms of Venture Capital Investment in 2014.\n\nAccording to this report, the German capital enjoyed $2.2 billion in investment compared to London’s $1.5 billion, highlighting Berlin’s increasing suitability for promising startups to gain the funding they need to change the face of Bitcoin.\n\nRecent political developments in Westminster might further add to Berlin’s appeal, as UK Prime Minister David Cameron “would like to see a ban on certain applications that allow users to send end-to-end encrypted messages to each other over the internet.” With catastrophic regulation potentially imminent in London, and New York’s BitLicence scaring off more and more Bitcoin companies, Berlin has a great opportunity to establish itself as the Bitcoin epicenter.\n\nBerlin’s Bitcoin startups cover a wide range of specialities ranging from the use of blockchain to protect creative ownership online, to global P2P lending, to bitcoin mining supercomputers. Companies like ascribe.io, Bitbond, SatoshiPay and Coynoare using bitcoin technology to find game-changing solutions to traditional problems, while BitcoinBrothers and All4btc are improving bitcoins availability and usability on a global scale.\n\nDrawing its philosophical roots from Muhammad Yunus’s Grameen Bank, Bitbondenables people from around the world to access business funding through the use of Bitcoin technology. With 800,000 EUR in funding, its P2P lending and investment model cuts out the banks, allowing investors to fund promising businesses on the other side of the globe at no cost. The need for bankless investing and lending is thrown into sharp relief in light of the 2 billion adults lacking access to banks, as recently reported by CNBC. Disintermediation allows access to working capital in the world’s financially underserved region, making lending and borrowing globally accessible. Recently, another Berlin-based startup, ascribe.io, has been garnering a lot of media attention, along with $2 million USD in seed funding from investors like Earlybird, Digital Currency Group and Freelands Ventures. CEO and Co-founder, Bruce Pon, describes ascribe as “a service for creators to protect their ideas and define how they want their ideas to spread.” With this inventive use of blockchain technology, creators can register, transfer and track their valuable digital creations, allowing them to discover where their work is being used.\n\nSince the funding round, ascribe has been enjoying a growth rate of 10% per week. Its team of 14 is working toward allowing marketplaces to be built on top of their platform.\n\nAlso working on innovative blockchain solutions in Berlin are Satoshipay, a micropayment service for publishers, and Coyno, a user-friendly blockchain bookkeeper. Both came through the Axel Springer Plug & Play Accelerator earlier this year.\n\nLike ascribe, Satoshipay’s goal is to help monetize content for its creators. Its prototype, which recently won second prize at the Coinbase BitHack, focuses on micropayments that allow content publishers to charge fractions of a cent. Founded by Meinhard Benn in 2014, the Berlin bitcoin startup envisions a world where content creators can monetise their work using nanopayments without scaring away consumers with cumbersome fees or subscriptions.\n\nCoyno, on the other hand, aims to overcome the implicit tax reporting and bookkeeping difficulties inherent in bitcoin transactions in personal and professional settings. As co-founder Erasmus Hagen says, Coyno provides “a full and secure SaaS Bitcoin bookkeeping solution. Coyno offers easy-to-use wallet analytics and automatic bookkeeping, which enables private Bitcoin users to stay in control of their Bitcoin holdings.”\n\nBitcoin mining startup BitcoinBrothers, founded in 2013 by the Welle siblings, is building better, faster machines to make bitcoin mining cost-effective again. The Berlin-based startup offers mining services using its MSEM bitcoin mining supercomputers at over 6 petahash per second. BitcoinBrothers represents a fascinating new perspective on the scalability of one of Bitcoin’s most controversial topics.\n\nWhile Greece’s former Minister of Finance Yanis Varoufakis has condemned Germany for its “absolutely impossible, totally non-viable and toxic” economic plan for Greece, Berlin-based All4BTC is allowing ordinary Greeks a way out of their fiduciary disaster. Specifically, All4BTC is a personal shopping service, that opens up every online store on the internet to bitcoin. For Greeks who are finding it increasingly difficult to gain access to their savings, All4BTC offers an alternative. Backed by the bitcoin incubator BitcoinsBerlin, the young startup has benefitted from the euro’s recent volatility, as an ever-increasing number of people in eastern and southern Europe turn to bitcoin when they find banks inaccessible.\n\nBerlin’s attractiveness goes beyond the startup scene, government regulations and investment portfolios however. The Federal Association of Bitcoin, with its headquarters in the German capital, represents and fights for the Bitcoin community and Bitcoin businesses in Germany. Beyond that, Bitcoin businesses’ entrepreneurial spirit is merely an expression of the creative influence of the city. As Jason Fell’s insightful remark makes clear: “Berlin’s 3.5 million residents are creating a bright, new history for their city.” Berlin is itself a startup, and its citizens love bitcoin. The truth of this statement can be tasted in the beers of Room 77, heard in the EpicenterBitcoin podcasts, and seen in the eyes of the Bitcoin Meetupmembers.', ""Akihiro Shiba is an attorney-at-law qualified in Japan, working at Nishimura & Asahi's Tokyo office, with expertise in financial regulations and transactions and provides advice on virtual currencies. In this article, he examines what the recent Tokyo District Court ruling means for the status of bitcoin in Japan.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed by an individual against the bankruptcy trustee for Mt Gox, formerly the most widely used bitcoin exchange in the world, the Tokyo District Court handed down a judgment on 5th August, 2015, holding that bitcoins are not subject to ownership.\n\nThis is probably the first judicial decision in Japan that provides an analysis of the legal nature of bitcoins and the status of a bitcoin depositor in insolvency proceedings.\n\nSix things you should know about the judgment\n\nIt is a district court judgment, without binding effect on anyone other than the parties involved, and can still be appealed. We cannot conclude at this stage that this judgment represents the established view under Japanese law.\n\nIt is an analysis under Japanese law and is basically not applicable in any other country.\n\nThis judgment was in favor of Mt Gox’s bankruptcy trustee, so the plaintiff’s claim for preferential recovery was denied. The judgment will not cause any change in the treatment of Mt Gox creditors.\n\nThere should be further consideration of how to fully protect customers’ bitcoins from an exchange’s insolvency.\n\nUnder Japanese law, the lack of “ownability” of bitcoins does not necessarily mean they are not afforded legal protection.\n\nUnder Japanese law, the lack of “ownability” might be a positive feature of bitcoins as a medium of exchange.\n\nThe arguments made in the case\n\nIn this lawsuit, the plaintiff claimed delivery of approximately 459 bitcoins against Mt Gox, arguing that:\n\nBitcoins can be subject to ownership under the Civil Code of Japan.\n\nThe bitcoins stored in the bitcoin addresses for which Mt Gox held or managed the private key should be regarded as being occupied by Mt Gox but co-owned by all the users, including the plaintiff.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff could demand the return of the bitcoins corresponding to its co-ownership interest outside of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe bankruptcy trustee for Mt Gox disputed the claim, refuting the plaintiff’s arguments, including (1) above.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of the trustee, arguing that bitcoins cannot be subject to ownership for the following reasons:\n\na) According to Article 85 of the Civil Code of Japan (which states, “In this Act, ‘thing’ means a corporeal thing.”), an object of ownership must occupy a portion of space such as a liquid, gas, or solid, in contrast with rights (including claims and copyrights) and natural forces (like electricity, heat, and light). In this regard, it is clear that bitcoins do not occupy a portion of space.\n\nb) Furthermore, an object of ownership must be subject to exclusive controllability. In this regard, those who manage a bitcoin address cannot be regarded as controlling the balance of bitcoins in the address exclusively.\n\nThe court’s view on what can be subject to ownership is substantially identical to the prevailing view of Japanese civil law scholars. Therefore, I believe that most Japanese lawyers would likely support the conclusion and reasoning in (a) above. (On the other hand, since bitcoins were held not to satisfy requirement (a), I believe that there was no need to make the debatable argument in (b) above.)\n\nAlthough I agree with the above, it cannot be concluded at this stage that this judgment represents the established view on the legal status of bitcoins in Japan as it is only a district court judgment, without binding effect on anyone other than the parties involved, and can still be appealed.\n\nFurthermore, this judgment only provides an analysis under Japanese law, and there are a variety of rules from country to country regarding what can be subject to ownership or title. Therefore, the court’s view is basically not applicable in any other country.\n\nImpact on Mt Gox creditors\n\nThe position of Mt Gox’s bankruptcy trustee on the status of the bitcoin depositors seems to have been as follows:\n\nThey have a contractual right to demand the return of deposited bitcoins, rather than ownership of them.\n\nThus, they would be treated as bankruptcy creditors to whom the assets of Mt Gox will be distributed, as with cash depositors or any other creditors, if they filed their claims before the deadline of noon of July 29, 2015 (JST).\n\nAlthough this position was challenged by the plaintiff, claiming ownership rather than a contractual right, the trustee’s position in (1) above was upheld by the court; accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim for preferential recovery was denied. Therefore, the judgment will not cause any change in the treatment of Mt Gox creditors.\n\nNo protection of customers’ bitcoins from insolvency?\n\nSome people may think that, based on the court’s view, bitcoins held in a customer’s account with an exchange will not be fully protected if the exchange becomes insolvent. This is not accurate.\n\nThe court’s view on the treatment of bitcoin depositors in Mt Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings would not apply to other cases if the facts in those cases differ from those established in the Mt Gox judgement.\n\nFor example, the treatment of such bitcoins may have been different if the private key for the bitcoin address was stored on the exchange’s server but was still controlled and managed by the customer. In any case, there should be further consideration of how to fully protect customers’ bitcoins from an exchange’s insolvency.\n\nNo legal protection from offences?\n\nSome people may assume that if bitcoins cannot be owned, bitcoins cannot be legally protected from offenses at all. This is simply not true, however, at least under Japanese law.\n\nFor example, Article 709 of the Civil Code of Japan imposes tort liability for damages on a person who has intentionally or negligently infringed “any right or legally protected interest” of another person. I believe that this provision would apply if someone stole your bitcoins.\n\nSimilarly, some criminal law provisions prohibit individuals from obtaining, or causing another person to obtain, “an unlawful economic gain” through the methods specified by those provisions.\n\nTradable without ownership?\n\nSome people may also think that if bitcoins cannot be owned, they cannot be bought or sold validly, nor can they be effectively used as a payment method. This is also incorrect, at least under Japanese law.\n\nIf you enter into an agreement by which one party agrees to send a certain amount of bitcoins from his/her bitcoin address to another specific address, it can be a valid and enforceable contract under the principle of freedom of contract, at least under Japanese law.\n\nThis is somewhat similar to an electricity supply agreement where the supplier agrees to supply (or sell) electricity to the other party, even though electricity cannot be subject to ownership according to the prevailing theory.\n\nActually, under Japanese law, the lack of “ownability” might be a positive feature of bitcoins as a medium of exchange.\n\nIf there were ownership in bitcoins, when you received bitcoins from another person, you would be exposed to the risk of someone demanding that you return the bitcoins to them, arguing that they are the owner instead of you – possible reasons for this could be, for example, if the bitcoins were stolen from them or if the agreement under which they sold the bitcoins was nullified.\n\nThe lack of “ownability” frees bitcoins from those risks.\n\nBitcoin image via manaemedia / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

He advises companies about bitcoin-related regulatory law and represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings. Here, he discusses how US law applies to non-US cryptocurrency companies.\n\nThe blockchain is borderless, but nations are not. Because of this, one of the well-known challenges of running a successful cryptocurrency business is navigating divergent legal systems.\n\nFor non-US companies, however, this is complicated even further by the fact that the United States often enforces its laws beyond its own borders. That’s because US enforcement authorities take an expansive view of their jurisdiction, sometimes prosecuting those with only very tangential links to the US.\n\nApplying US law\n\nSo exactly how does US law apply outside of its physical borders?\n\nThe first and most important thing to know is that, as a general matter, any company that does business in the United States is likely to be subject to US law, even if the company isn’t located here. So incorporating in Finland and locating servers and employees in Helsinki won’t eliminate the effect of US law for a company that mostly serves US customers.\n\nThat means that non-US bitcoin exchanges that allow US-based persons to trade on their platforms generally need to be licensed money transmitters under US law, just as do cloud-based wallet systems that allow transactions on US soil. Similarly, foreign entities that make crowdsales to US-based persons are likely subject to US securities laws (to the extent that anyone can tell whether those laws apply).\n\nOf course, companies whose employees, bank accounts, and servers are all located outside the United States have less at stake if the United States attempts to apply its law to them, for the simple reason that it’s more difficult for US enforcement agencies to seize funds or computers overseas. But those companies are not immune, as police agencies around the globe regularly work together, and often cooperate to arrest and extradite individuals who have been charged with offenses in other countries.\n\nContact\n\nHow much contact with the United States does a company need for US laws to apply to it? That can be a fact-intensive question, but a good shorthand is that if a web-based company has any users who are located in the US, there’s a good chance that a judge would agree that they’re subject to US law, at least with respect to the company’s interactions with those US-based persons.\n\n“For non-US companies who want or expect to be successful, some early strategic thinking can avoid great expense and potential criminal exposure later on.”\n\nWhat, then, if a company avoids US customers altogether? This is a surer route to avoiding US law, but still not bulletproof. Federal prosecutors sometimes assert jurisdiction based on hooks like the use of a US bank, or an allegation that a company conspired with a US person.\n\nFor example, the US terrorist financing statute makes it a crime to participate in terrorist financing anywhere in the world, as long as the financing is “directed toward” an attack against the United States.\n\nFor US citizens working abroad, there are also additional concerns. Statutes proscribing money laundering, terrorist financing, and foreign corruption all expressly apply to Americans overseas, even when no other connection to the United States exists.\n\nFor non-US companies that are concerned that US law might apply to them, the primary issue is usually whether the company has either avoided or met the requirements of US money transmitter laws. But a good compliance plan will also account for a number of other areas of law, including money laundering, consumer protection, privacy, and commodities laws.\n\nFor many small companies affected by these issues, these are largely theoretical concerns. Enforcement—both civil and criminal—is always least likely against small enterprises. But the inverse is also true: the more successful the business, the more attention it will get from enforcement agencies.\n\nSo for non-US companies who want or expect to be successful, some early strategic thinking with a competent lawyer can avoid great expense and potential criminal exposure later on.\n\nUS law image via Shutterstock\n\nThis is not legal advice, and is not intended to establish an attorney-client relationship.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

08/15/2015,"['Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.\n\nThis week\'s news coverage was slightly more varied than last week\'s, which emphasized the long-awaited arrest of Mark Karpeles, CEO of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.\n\nThe respite from the crime rhetoric was brief if non-existent, however. Serious but arguably not any less bizarre, was the story that police in the Netherlands were on the hunt for a serial bomber, who was planting explosive devices in various supermarket stores.\n\nThe connection to bitcoin, although somewhat loose – the perpetrator demanded a ransom in the digital currency – still served to capture the media\'s attention, and in turn, contributed to the technology\'s ongoing association with criminal activity.\n\nElsewhere, with regulation always a hot topic, media outlets devoted time to covering the slew of bitcoin companies that had ceased operations in New York as a result of the passage of the BitLicense, its state-specific licensing regime for the industry.\n\n\'Mass Exodus\'\n\nThough the BitLicense may have imposed new requirements on the industry, it has, at least for now, earned bitcoin startups the sympathy of some reporters in the media.\n\nNew York Business Journal\'s Michael del Castillo, for example, wrote a piece about the BitLicense\'s impact on the New York bitcoin scene.\n\nThe piece, titled ""The \'Bitcoin Exodus\' has totally changed New York\'s bitcoin ecosystem,"" emphasized the negative effects of the law, including the number of firms that have so far announced they will cease to do business in the state.\n\nDel Castillo wrote:\n\n""From the beginning of the process that led to the creation of the BitLicense, the regulation has been controversial. Benjamin Lawsky, the former New York Financial Services superintendent hosted hearings to learn about bitcoin ... but bitcoin\'s early adopters saw it as a watering down of the anonymity they like about bitcoin in the first place.""\n\nDel Castillo then gave a run-down of some of the companies in the space that had decided to apply for a license – the NYDFS told CoinDesk it had received 22 applications to date – noting the application processes\' cost both in monetary and non-monetary terms.\n\nBut, it\'s not just bitcoin companies speaking out about the BitLicense, said del Castillo. ""This past weekend, Lukasiewicz [Coinsetter\'s CEO] said he had two customers close accounts as a direct result of the regulation.""\n\nCited in the piece, the CEO added that ""a lot of people who use bitcoin do it because of distrust of the banks ... and they view this as the thing they hate seeping into what they thought was their savior"".\n\nCriminal adoption\n\nPublic opinion of bitcoin may still be black or white, but it may soon be getting darker.\n\nWriting for MIT Technology Review, Tom Simonite looked at the digital currency\'s young history noting that its early adopters were mostly criminals.\n\nWhile this may be nothing new, Simonite presented a novel theory that as bitcoin technology advances, so will criminal activity. The next point of attack, Simonite said, is smart contracts, which he describes as ""small computer programs that can do things like execute financial trades or notarise documents in a legal agreement"".\n\nThe piece mostly concentrated on the less positive aspects of bitcoin, but the author did note that some companies thought smart contracts had the potential to bring efficiency to financial markets.\n\nDespite this, Ari Juels, a cryptographer and professor at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech, was cited as saying that he believes they will also be useful to criminals.\n\nJuels said:\n\n""In some ways this is the perfect vehicle for criminal acts, because it\'s meant to create trust in situations where otherwise it\'s difficult to achieve.""\n\nHe continued: ""It was a bit of a surprise to me that these types of crimes in the physical world could be enabled by a digital system.""\n\nNicolas Christin, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University, agreed that there is potential for smart contracts to be embraced by criminals:\n\n""It will not be surprising .... Fringe businesses tend to be the first adopters of new technologies, because they don\'t have anything to lose.""\n\nPerhaps more positively, Christin told Simonite that the scale of criminal activity made possible by bitcoin today, and perhaps by smart contracts in the future, is small in comparison to more traditional, cash-based physical crimes.\n\nInterestingly, Gavin Wood, chief technology officer at Ethereum is cited saying that businesses with legitimate purposes are already planning to make use of his project\'s smart contract technology.\n\nAlthough optimistic about Ethereum\'s potential, Wood acknowledged that the decentralised app network would likely be used in illicit ways, although this is what, according to the piece, makes the technology interesting.\n\nCommenting on Wood\'s assertion\'s, Simonite said:\n\n""Just as file sharing found widespread unauthorised use and forced changes in the entertainment and tech industries, illicit activity enabled by Ethereum could change the world.""\n\nSmall business boost\n\nRefreshingly, bitcoin got a mention this week in The Charlotte Observer – a local newspaper serving one of North Carolina\'s largest metropolitan areas.\n\nThe piece, titled ""It\'s Your Business: Get to Know Bitcoin"", contributed more positive rhetoric to the news coverage.\n\nSeemingly targeted at small business owners, the article began by highlighting the importance of staying up to date with emerging technologies such as bitcoin.\n\nIt said:\n\n""One of the best things about being a small business owner, and also one of the worst, is that the ground beneath us is always shifting. Take for example, all the buzz around bitcoin, the worldwide payment system that some are calling a new kind of money.""\n\nThe author mentioned an upcoming bitcoin expo and cited Daniel Spuller, one of the event\'s co-founders.\n\nCommenting on why consumers should trust the digital currency, Spuller said:\n\n""It took me a good three months to really wrap my head around it, because it was still in the very early stages. And we\'re still in the early stages in the grand scheme of things. I always tell the consumer; they have to do their due diligence. They have to research it.""\n\n""Sure there are criminals who use it. But there are criminals who use the $5 bill every day. It\'s just a different form. So when people tell me bitcoin is used by criminals, I say so is the $100 bill, so is the Japanese yen,"" he added.\n\nFuse; New York ;Crime scene; North Carolina images via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If bitcoin isn\'t a game changer, it\'s at least one hell of an expansion pack.\n\nThe cryptocurrency craze has catalyzed a swift period of evolution for online contracts, transactions, and investments. At every step of the way, economists and academics have been peering out from the periphery attempting to make sense of it all. What we\'re looking at is a brave new world for online economies as well as a brand-new arena for research and analysis.\n\nFor example: Two professors from Cornell, Ari Juels and Elaine Shi, along with University of Maryland researcher Ahmed Kosba released a paper this past week detailing the possible breadth of innovation bitcoin offers to some of its most invested stakeholders: criminals. We\'re learning that, as with most technological breakthroughs, progress has a dark side.\n\nMIT Technology Review\'s Tom Simonite covered the three authors\' concerns in a piece over at that site earlier this week:\n\n""A new bitcoin-inspired technology that some investors believe will be much more useful and powerful may be set to unlock a new wave of criminal innovation. That technology is known as smart contracts — small computer programs that can do things like execute financial trades or notarize documents in a legal agreement. Intended to take the place of third-party human administrators such as lawyers, which are required in many deals and agreements, they can verify information and hold or use funds using similar cryptography to that which underpins bitcoin.""\n\nWhat does that all mean? Juels, Shi, and Kosba demonstrate that these types of contracts could allow for easier planning and heightened anonymity for conspirators of criminal acts.\n\n""One example is a contract offering a cryptocurrency reward for hacking a particular website. Ethereum’s programming language makes it possible for the contract to control the promised funds. It will release them only to someone who provides proof of having carried out the job, in the form of a cryptographically verifiable string added to the defaced site. Contracts with a similar design could be used to commission many kinds of crime, say the researchers. Most provocatively, they outline a version designed to arrange the assassination of a public figure. A person wishing to claim the bounty would have to send information such as the time and place of the killing in advance. The contract would pay out after verifying that those details had appeared in several trusted news sources, such as news wires.""\n\nWhat we\'re seeing is the potential for digital technology to enable real-world crime by turning criminal acts into attainable bounties. In a way, smart contracts could be made to resemble video game achievements. Accomplish ""X"" task in ""Y"" way to receive your reward.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of limiting aspects to the smart contract technology that make it impractical for the typical lowlife who lacks keen programming skills. We\'re not going to see all criminal activity automatically hop online overnight. Cryptocurrency innovations will continue to be net positives for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut, as mentioned, progress almost always has a dark side. Innovation creates many varying byproducts to be exploited by those with the wrong intentions and proper knowhow. It\'ll be fascinating looking forward to keep an eye on where else the cryptocurrency craze takes us.\n\nRead more at MIT Technology Review\n\nBelow, bitcoin expert Wences Casares extols cryptocurrency as a broad social experiment while advocating for some basic regulations to make sure it\'s not exploited by those with malintent.\n\nImage credit: norwayblue / Getty iStock', 'Today, there are lots of startups working with digital currency and the number of such companies continues to grow. However, the more important for the bitcoin ecosystem are cryptocurrency miners, organizations or individuals who are the playing the key part in ensuring the integrity of digital currency.\n\nBitcoin is built on the blockchain technology, a decentralised public ledger that records every transaction realized on the network. The process of verifying transactions and creating blocks of transactions that can be added to the blockchain is called mining. It is used to introduce more bitcoins into the system.\n\nThe more computers join the network the more difficult it gets to mine new bitcoins. In fact, the process is getting more challenging as the rate of mining is limited.\n\nThe process of mining new bitcoins is decentralized. Although decentralization has its advantages, it poses certain risks as well. If an organization or an individual obtains control of more than half of the network’s mining power, it can corrupt the blockchain.\n\nWhile some individuals prefer to mine bitcoins alone, others opt to join the group of miners, known as pools, where they can improve results by combining their resources.\n\nAccording to data provided by the bitcoin analysis firm Blocktrail, the majority of the network is controlled by 10 mining pools.\n\nOver the last month, China-based company AntPool ranked the first in terms of bitcoin mining, accounting for 17.82%. The company, which claims to be the globe’s biggest cloud miner, is operated by hardware firm Bitmain, opened in 2013.\n\nDiscusFish/P2Pool was recorded as the second largest bitcoin miner with a share of 16.49%. Officially called F2Pool, the pool, which is also known as DiscusFish, is run by bitcoin enthusiasts Wang Chun and Mao Shihang. According to Business Insider, 100% of the pool’s hash power comes from its users. Last month, the company generated the largest cryptocurrency transaction ever, following an attack targeted at the network.\n\nThe company is followed by BitFury, which controlled 16.4% of the network during the last month. In July, the company raised $20 million, thus becoming the best-funded mining hardware firm. Instead of running a public pool, BitFury owns private mines located in Iceland, Finland and the Republic of Georgia. The company’s head Valery Vavilov claims BitFury is not a mining firm, but a technology one with a focus on digital currency.\n\nBTC China Pool was registered as the fourth biggest mining company, with its share totaling 13.74%. Although launched only in late 2014, the firm turned into one of the largest mining pool. This is attributed to the fact that BTC China is the biggest exchange in the country.\n\nChina-based pool, BW Pool gained control of 7.68% of the network over the past month. Despite its size, the company rarely makes official statements and even has no publicity in English-speaking countries.\n\nMeantime, North American pool Eligius accounted for 4.83% of the network. The company was opened in 2011 by a Catholic Luke Dashjr, who has earlier written religious messages onto the blockchain, CryptoCoinsNews wrote.\n\nKnCMiner’s share of the mining pool stood at 4.27%. In February 2015, the Swedish company raised $15 million in a funding round led by Accel Partners. KnCMiner owns data centers in Sweden and is also planning to expand in Finland and Iceland.\n\nThe world’s oldest mining pool Slush accounted for just 4.08% of the overall network. Opened in 2010, the pool belongs to SatoshiLabs, which is also an operator of other bitcoin projects.\n\n21 Inc was recorded as a ninth largest mining pool, representing a share of 3.79%. In March, the company raised $116 million from a range of investors, including Andreessen Horowitz. 21 Inc is not a public pool, as it uses its own private hardware.\n\nGHash.io, which in 2014 obtained control of 51% of the entire network, now holds a share of just 1.99%. The company’s CIO Jeffrey Smith, also runs a bitcoin exchange called Cex.io.\n\nBesides the 10 leading pools, the network is controlled by such companies as BitClub Network , 8baochi, BitMinter, Kano CKPool and P2Pool.org. Meanwhile, the unknown mining pools accounted for 4,5% of the total network.', 'When asked why bitcoin hasn\'t taken off as an electronic, online cash, it\'s become conventional wisdom to blame ease of use as the predominant issue. When compared to other payment methods, most say, digital currency simply isn\'t as user-friendly.\n\nThis is true to an extent. As a payment method, bitcoin could be more user-friendly, and the industry should work to improve basic features of major services. It should be easier for everyday consumers to send the desired amounts without overspending and for default wallet features to be more intuitive.\n\nBut, to say that this is the biggest issue the industry faces is inaccurate. At the end of the day, it doesn\'t matter how easy something is to use if no one understands why they would use it at all.\n\nOn this paradox, I recently participated in a panel hosted by ZapChain (a bitcoin social network) focused broadly on ""branding bitcoin"" in the media. The goal of the talk was for myself, my former colleague Daniel Cawrey, Inc\'s Ben Parr and The Wall Street Journal\'s Paul Vigna to discuss the gap between the media\'s interest in the technology and consumer adoption.\n\nOne user asked how bitcoin can be easier for the less tech-savvy, and I rifled off an answer. Bitcoin, I said, has a ""segway problem"", a comparison that has been made, but perhaps not with the intent for this analogy to be constructive.\n\nWhat\'s important to note is that the segway is and was broadly understood to be faster and easier than walking, and was much-hyped for it in the media.\n\nA 2001 Salon article should be read by the industry with particular caution, as it gushes about how many leading minds, include Apple\'s Steve Jobs believed the segway could be ""bigger than the PC"" while enthusiasts gushed about how it could ""replace walking"".\n\nIt\'s obvious today that we don\'t live in a world of segways. Ultimately, many consumers never saw the benefit in actually getting on a segway in the first place or investing the money to acquire one – even though they were aware of and could see the advantages.\n\nBitcoin is at a similar impasse.\n\nAt this point, it\'s also safe to say the intrinsic benefits of bitcoin as a payment method are broadly understood. Whole industries have heard the message that bitcoin is at least advertising itself as a cheaper, faster way to send money, while allowing expanded privacy for consumers in transactions with online merchants.\n\nMarc Hochstein, editor-in-chief of American Banker, hammered this point home in his opening address at last month\'s Digital Currencies + the Blockchain conference. In his talk, he spoke broadly about how digital currencies hold the promise to restore consumer rights.\n\n""What if I told you the pseudonymity of bitcoin was not a fear to be managed, but a gift to be protected?"" he said. ""I believe that the crypto community is doing important R&D for a cashless future.""\n\nThe awareness is palpable. The greater challenge, I would argue, is getting those who have heard the message to act on it.\n\nIn short, why segway when you can walk?\n\nEase of use\n\nNew technologies are often unrefined, and they come with high barriers to usability. But, it\'s difficult to say that the industry has not made significant headway on ease of use.\n\nThere\'s a compelling argument that major US bitcoin-buying services are already pretty user-friendly, despite the kinks. In fact, it\'s hard to see exactly how, at least in the US, obtaining bitcoin by purchasing it could be much easier for those with the right tools.\n\nBitcoin-based financial services startups such as ChangeTip, Coinbase and Circle already enable consumers to open an account, attach a credit card or bank account and begin buying and sending bitcoin. This works both ways – it\'s just as easy to receive and sell bitcoin, whole services enable this without requiring any action from merchants.\n\nAsk yourself, how could these buying services be dramatically improved? Maybe they can and will, but why not emphasize what they\'ve already achieved? The challenge again, is why use these services in the first place.\n\nFor example, I recently hired a freelance artist for design work on a friend\'s website. At first, she was skeptical about accepting bitcoin, favoring PayPal. I asked her to try out Coinbase, and told her I\'d walk her through it. I didn\'t need to.\n\nIn her own recollection signing up and getting paid was ""pretty seamless/painless"".\n\nThe process was less cumbersome than sending a check. We didn\'t need stamps, envelopes or a pen. We didn\'t need to wait days.\n\nNot to say we didn\'t wait at all or that there were no fees on the buying and selling of bitcoin (one can argue about the true costs of bitcoin mining), but still, it\'s very rare that you hear about the everyday ways bitcoin can be easier or at least feel easier to those involved.\n\nAs the saying goes, ""perception is nine-tenths of the law"".\n\nIssue of onboarding\n\nHowever, it\'s not easy for consumers to acquire this new form of digital cash, today – they need a credit card or debit card to do so.\n\nOutside of the US, this situation is admittedly different. For all the talk about bitcoin reaching the unbanked, it\'s hard to foresee this happening in the near term, given that these consumers currently need financial services to gain access to the system (a problem companies like Abra and 21.co seem to be working on).\n\nThe biggest roadblock to this conversation may be that solving this issue doesn\'t fit easily into a business model. If the Internet subsidized the dissemination of information for free largely with advertising, bitcoin hasn\'t found a similar solution to do what it does – making money free – at least without the seniorage that comes from the network in the form of newly minted bitcoins.\n\nStill, whatever it is, bitcoin works today and it\'s useful, just maybe not for the kinds of things we\'re accustomed to doing already.\n\nThis subject was recently discussed by Richard Gendal Brown in a blog post that made the case that, while bitcoin as a blockchain-based network solves few problems for banks, this doesn\'t mean it can\'t be useful.\n\n""Bitcoin is probably worse than existing solutions for all the things most people and firms care about but vastly better for one single use-case (open access to value transfer) that could be very useful for some people,"" he writes, adding:\n\n""If this is true, we should expect to see adoption of bitcoin come from the margins, solving marginal problems for marginal users.""\n\nWho are these marginal users? And how do they begin using bitcoin? That answer is less clear.\n\nRightly so, some startups are beginning to emphasize that the next wave of bitcoin users will acquire bitcoin by earning it – a novel insight that solves onboarding issues, even if it\'s less clear who pays the cost of acquiring these new users.\n\nBut, more broadly, it seems at least a change of conversation is needed – the industry is so caught up in being what\'s next, it\'s forgetting to emphasize what\'s happening right now.\n\nAs the segway proves, no theoretical or technical debate, no matter how elegantly solved, will make up for the miscue.\n\nConfused man image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The bad guy is transferring a huge amount of money, something like $1 billion. He has a hand-held device and clicks the button. We see a progress bar. The operation takes only a few seconds and then there is a ding. Done! Wow, impressive.\n\nSurely, this is the way rich, powerful, well-connected people do it.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nActually, this is the most impossible thing that happens in the movie. It is more impossible than holding one’s breath for 3 minutes, more impossible than hanging onto the side of an airplane as it takes off and lands, and more impossible than riding a motorcycle at 120 miles an hour around curvy Moroccan roads and not crashing.\n\nIt can’t be done—not with any existing service. Viewers hardly question that it should be possible to move money that quickly. Sadly, it is not. Our money transmission technologies in real life are like the 1950s.\n\nThe only way to do what they did would be the use of a technology invented in 2009 but that is still in extremely limited use, for now: cryptocurrency like Bitcoin operating on a distributed ledger. Otherwise, you are going to have to wait several weekdays, pay high fees, or have a trusted (credit-based) relationship with some third-party provider.\n\nThere is currently no way, using national money, to move a billion dollars from one person to another instantly. You can’t do it with a million dollars. There are better and worse ways to move thousands of dollars, but they all cost money, all require a trust relationship, and all take time. And there is no way to do this peer to peer using even $1 (except, of course, physically handing you a piece of paper in person).\n\nNational Currencies Limit Transfer Choice\n\nConsider the most common way of moving money from me to you. It is ACH, which stands for Automated Clearing House. It moves a total of $40 trillion per year in 25 billion transactions, and is increasingly preferred over credit cards. It seems clean and, once you have verified accounts, works without a credit relationship.\n\nHowever, it is slow. It takes at least one day and as much as four days, not including weekends. If you push on Thursday, the funds might not be there until Tuesday. It’s also expensive: 1-3 percent, which doesn’t sound like much until you realize you can get a nice car for how much it costs to move $1 million.\n\nACH is the most advanced, most common, most direct, most reliable method. And it is still terrible. It’s closely related to wiring money—an ancient method that uses Western Union (founded 1851!) or Moneygram (the new name for Travelers Express founded in 1940). These are very expensive services, though they are very fast.\n\nPayPal is a mixed bag. If you have a balance or have it directly linked to your bank account, there are no fees, though there is a transaction limit of $10,000. If you are using a credit or debit card, the fees can be 3 percent. And the clearing time can be 3-4 business days, though if you have a balance in your account, the transfer is instant. This doesn’t really mean anything, though, because it takes 3-4 days to make the PayPal balance achieve liquidity outside of PayPal. If you are using it internationally, the fees go through the roof, regardless.\n\nOther services improve on this record. Google Wallet is one of the best. It’s been known to be fast when it is linked up to your bank account. But you can’t know for sure. It could take several days. And there are strict limits to the amount you can move. If you have more than $50,000 to send in a week, you are completely out of luck.\n\nIt is the same with Square Cash, except that this service absolutely requires a debit card hook up. It is mercifully free of fees, but you have to wait 30 days before your account is verified, and, until that time, you are limited to moving $1,000.\n\nThere is a fancy new application on Facebook that allows you to move limited amounts of money, and it is wonderful and exciting. Except: It can take three to four days before your money movies via instant messaging. And Facebook doesn’t permit credit cards, debit cards, or other third-party payment systems. SnapChat is experimenting with something similar.\n\nThere are many other services that are desperately trying to resolve the problem. Think of companies like Dwolla, which started in 2008 with such promise. But this company, just like PayPal and everyone else, bumped into a crazy system of regulations that forced compliance with every form of “know your customer” rules and navigating a highly regulated banking system with a money that is ultimately controlled by government and, therefore, moves digitally only according to its diktat.\n\nRisks of Anachronistic Systems\n\nAnother big flaw is that any one of these trusted third parties can reverse, freeze, or seize the transaction funds and there's nothing anyone can do to avoid this risk. For a billion dollar transfer, the risk of seizure, freezing, or reversal would be enormous and would last for months.\n\nIt’s not a surprise that innovation is difficult under these conditions. We can get ever fancier interfaces, ever more accessibility, ever friendlier ways of going about things. All of this is great.\n\nBut, in the end, transferring money from one person to the next bumps into the same problems: trust, fees, waiting times, dollar limits and grave problems with international transfers. Each problem has a slightly different source. But they all add up to the weird reality that doing what would seem completely normal in 2015—moving money instantly from here to there—is still exceedingly difficult.\n\nHow much further are we going to get into the digital age before our monetary and payment systems catch up? There is a crying need. Everyone knows it. This is why so many people are excited about Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin blows up the current system through several critically new innovations. It combines a money and payment system into one single process, bypassing national monies altogether. It also bypasses the banking system completely through a ledger system that is open source and monitored through software. It also requires no trust, credit, or identity verification. If you have an Internet connection, and you hold some amounts of the currency, you can move that property from you to anyone else in the world without asking anyone’s permission.\n\nThe time for transaction processing is almost instant; the transaction clearing time can be several minutes. Compare that clearing time to 1-3 days for equity markets, 3-5 business days for a check or wire transfer, and 60-90 days for a credit card transaction.\n\nThe costs associated with moving cryptocurrency are negligible. For example, in December 2014, there was an $81 million transaction that cost just $0.40 to conduct. That compares to the $2.4 million or so this same transaction would cost using conventional payments systems and national monies.\n\nThis is a huge benefit of Bitcoin but only one feature of a larger innovation. Cryptocurrency completely rethinks the way we bundle, title, move and verify all kinds of information. The potential applications for this technology are awesome to consider. It’s not just about money, though that would be significant enough. The spillovers affected titling, securities and all forms of contracts.\n\nThe headlines over Bitcoin today are all about the fallout from the failure of one firm, Mt. Gox, an early mover in the space that mishandled its business. It’s just another in a long series of blows Bitcoin has endured in the 6 years of its existence. And yet, when you look at it today, you see an innovation that has been tested, survived, and thrived.\n\nBitcoin is Mission Impossible—an innovation that finally moves money into the 21st century—coming true.\n\nJeffrey A. Tucker is a distinguished fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education."", 'Abine, a Boston based firm which calls itself the “online privacy company” is offering a bitcoin payment service called Bitcoin Anywhere. The Bitcoin Anywhere service enables users to make online payments on any online portal that accepts MasterCard credit cards.\n\nThe Bitcoin Anywhere service works though Blur “Masked Card”. These Blur Masked Cards will be connected to the individual user’s Coinbase bitcoin wallet. All Payments made through the Masked Card will be deducted from the connected wallet’s bitcoin balance.\n\nTrue to its name, Abine’s Blur Masked Cards have the cardholder’s identity masked, making online transactions close to anonymous. It never reveals the actual real name or address of the Masked Card owner. In order to prevent misuse and avoid any hidden charges, Masked Cards have a built-in limit which can be set. These Blur Masked Cards can be created on-the-fly and it can be used only once for online transactions.\n\nGiven that almost all online merchants accept MasterCard, these Blur Masked Cards can be used anywhere. Payments made through Bitcoin Anywhere service will be processed just like any other credit or debit card payments. The bitcoin debit cards issued by other exchanges and wallet providers requires the user to transfer a required amount of bitcoins into the card’s account and it will get deducted when used at a POS terminal, ATM or for online transactions. However, the users will have to refill the same card. But in case of Bitcoin Anywhere, a new Blur Masked Card has to be generated before each transaction and it is limited only for online use.\n\nAbine also offers password and document management solution along with Masked Card features with Blur. All these features are available with the premium version which is priced at $39 per year.\n\nREAD MORE: Bitcoin vs. Credit Cards: Can They Co-Exist?', 'Looking to stock up on some gift cards?

I drink my java at 4:30 in the morning while my writing is at its best.\n\nThis is my daily ritual as I am also a Bitcoin and fintech journalist and graphic artist. I write articles every day about the magic virtual money flying across cyberspace. I’ve taken a keen interest in putting words and visuals together, into the digital currency we all love.\n\n[tweet_box design=”default”]Bitcoin journalism and its fellow publications are bringing forth a new era of freelance writing and entrepreneurship.[/tweet_box]\n\nI think Bitcoin journalism and its fellow publications are bringing forth a new era of freelance writing and entrepreneurship. I work in a decentralized and incentivized office setting. There is a virtual online meeting and office area. Our group settings occupy places like Slack, Trello, and Google Hangouts. This is where writers, editors and publishers congregate to discuss news and opinion. The people I work with are from all over the globe.\n\nIt is nice to be able to have contact with people from all across the world and discuss financial tech and cryptocurrency, how it is changing their world from their locale. This means that, just like Bitcoin, its writers, editors and journalists are up 24/7 ready to tell you the news. Writers and editors meet and trade tips on a daily basis just like traders on the Bitcoin markets. This includes artists and graphic makers producing the coolest visuals around. I can’t speak for the entire tribe of Bitcoin journalists, but I can tell you one thing about me: I love to tell readers the latest news. Bitcoin is my passion.\n\nOur news is different\n\nNews today on typical mainstream publications are quite boring. There really isn’t anything new, even when it comes to politics. As for cryptocurrency, news and financial tech there is new news every single day. Like new unique startups and exciting companies using technologies and the distributed ledger to create brand spanking new information. You know, things that journalists like myself get very excited about.\n\nGuess what? We are reporters that love to share this news with you, because we have the same passions as you do. We are writers that love Bitcoin, decentralized markets, mesh networks and everything in between. We are storytellers that love hearing how the financial tech industry is a billion-dollar growing environment.\n\nIn my life I am approached by family members and friends who don’t understand what I do. I am a reporter, I tell them and I write about financial tech and Bitcoin. A lot of people don’t know what Bitcoin is yet, but do understand the concepts of fintech.\n\nI have found recently that providing explanations about financial tech first helps ease the discussion when talking about Bitcoin. Telling people about their phone and how they bank with it, and certain apps they use. Then the almighty discussion of digital currency, which to me IS fintech. Family members are astounded that I get paid in digital currency to write about virtual money and related technology.\n\nThey say “so you write about Bitcoin everyday?” and the answer is: Yes. To this day, every Satoshi I get for writing about a ‘new economy’ makes me extremely happy. It should make you happy too, as we ALL are building this economic ecosystem.\n\nI write about Bitcoin every single day. There’s not a moment that goes by where it’s not on my mind. If you think you’re checking the price ticker too much, try stepping into our shoes. The thing is: we journalists and writers love Bitcoin just as much as you do.\n\nIt’s not our fault that Mt. Gox went under, or that the price dipped $50 yesterday. Just as it’s no our fault that a great amount of Bitcoin businesses left New York in the month of August. But I sure love to tell you these things. I like to tell you the good things surrounding Bitcoin too, like the various charities, artists, and its surrounding innovators.\n\nEvery single day something new is happening and changing this landscape. New peer-to-peer applications are being created for everyone to use. Everyone is beginning to learn that open source is indeed better, and decentralized is the way to go. Journalists like myself are telling you news that even we have never heard before, about technologies and software just being born. This is the most amazing thing about my job, listening to the Beatles’ “Paperback Writer” and writing about newly created tech.\n\nBitcoin publications and its journalistic differences are pretty cool in my opinion.\n\nWe operate with the tools we talk about and live by them. I live and pay my bills with Bitcoin and support a family. I operate in a virtual environment with awesome people from all around the globe in a decentralized manner.\n\nNo one is really a boss, we act according to our roles and act as various incentivized nodes.

08/16/2015,"['In an interview at The Internet Engineering Task Force 93, former CIA employee and NSA contractor Edward Snowden spoke about privacy and security. Interestingly, Snowden focused his talk on Bitcoin and its flaws and weaknesses.\n\nSnowden began by briefly introducing the 51% attack concept, and stated that the Bitcoin network could be vulnerable to attacks and manipulation if “a pool has over 50% of the computing power to demonstrate adequate proof of work to add entries to the blockchain ledger.”\n\nSnowden commented,\n\n“Obviously, Bitcoin by itself is flawed. The protocol has a lot of weaknesses and transaction sides and a lot of weaknesses that structurally make it vulnerable to people who are trying to own 50 percent of the network and so on and so forth.”\n\nHe continued and said, “Focusing too much on bitcoin, I think is a mistake. The real solution is again, how do we get to a point where you don’t have to have a direct link between your identity all of the time? You have personas. You have tokens that authenticate each person and when you want to be able to interact with people as your persona in your true name, you can do so.”\n\nImplementation of Proof of Work\n\nDespite his concern for the digital currency, Snowden believes the concept of tokenization and proof of work could be implemented to create “some very interesting things,” which “people can basically pay for access other than direct transfers of currency that originated with an association to their true name.”\n\nSnowden suggested a similar concept of Tor, where bitcoin transactions are “tumbled” and changed once it is sent, like DASH’s Darksend. Darksend mixes a pool of transactions and its addresses randomly, making the transactions completely anonymous and untraceable.\n\nThe anonymity of DASH allows users to have multiple “persona” – “a common persona, an anonymous persona, a shared persona” to send transactions that cannot be tracked by the NSA or any government agencies.\n\nSnowden explained, “A lot of these are difficult problems particularly when we talk about the metadata context, the signalling context. And there are actually some really bad proposals, I think, and this is in no offense to anybody who works on these particular problem spaces, but again, it gets back to the middlebox space.”', 'E-coin is looking to position itself as the most useful and comfortable tool for spending bitcoin anywhere in the world with the rollout of their cypto debit cards. The startup introduced an innovative way for Bitcoin enthusiasts to easily and securely convert crypto into fiat currency and spend funds through the global Visa infrastructure.\n\nAnyone that holds bitcoin knows that one of the challenges we face today are the low number of options to spend bitcoin offline. And one way to tackle this concern, as proposed by e-coin, is by merging the Bitcoin infrastructure with the existing financial climate. In essence, they are taking an already widely accepted form of payment, debit cards, and combining it with Bitcoin to create a new hybrid cryptocurrency debit card.\n\nHybrid cryptocurrency debit cards\n\nCurrently, the company supports three different fiat currencies in addition to bitcoin. These currencies include USD, GBP and EUR. The EUR and GBP denominated debit cards are also independent of banks since they function on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhatsmore, the cards are protected from unauthorized access of funds through BitGo’s multi-sig security. This means that no one (including e-coin themselves) can access an account without the appropriate number of keys issued to a user. The collaboration between e-coin and BitGo gives users a quick way to get a debit card in which funds are protected with some of the highest security in the industry, all while keeping their balance insured.\n\nAnd because these are Visa cards, they can essentially be used at tens of millions of ATMs and merchants worldwide.\n\nAssociated fees\n\nAnd as you may expect, there are some fees for using this hybrid cryptocurrency debit card. On top of a $2.50 ATM transaction fee, there is a $1 monthly maintenance fee, and a bitcoin withdrawal fee of 2%.\n\nThe daily ATM withdrawal limit is set at $US400 per 24-hour period, which can be raised to $US2,000 if a user verifies their identity. Before verification, cardholders are also limited to loading their card with no more that $US2,500, and cannot withdraw more than $US1,000 from ATMs. The limits are removed entirely for verified accounts.\n\nGetting an e-coin card currently costs $US17, and they are shipping now. Unless you live in the United States. Regulations in the United States will not allow the company to ship cards directly to a US address at this time. The cards work as normal in the US, but getting them shipped will take some creativity.', 'Marketplaces on the dark web frequently processed more bitcoin transactions than BitPay last year, new research has found.\n\nIn a paper released this week, Kyle Soska and Nicolas Christin from Carnegie Mellon University revealed that even by conservative estimates the daily sales volume of six large-scale dark markets reached up to $650,000 in 2014.\n\nThe bitcoin merchant processor\'s self-reported annual total, $158.8m, would produce a daily average of around $435,000.\n\nThe report reads:\n\n""In the short four years since the development of the original Silk Road, total volumes have reached up to $650,000 daily (averaged over 30-day windows) and are generally stable around $300,000–$500,000 a day, far exceeding what had been previously reported.""\n\nPrevious studies have relied on the total number of listings on each site, however Christin and Soska estimated sales volume using sellers\' feedback scores, with each review counting as one product sold.\n\nThis was important, they say, as popular items could have numerous feedback scores that could even build up to over $1m in volume.\n\nThe chosen few\n\nThe researchers, who spent over two years scraping and analysing data from more than 35 different sites, also found a large discrepancy between their sellers.\n\nA very small fraction – the elite – generated a significant profit. By contrast, the majority of sellers (70%) would never sell more than $1,000-worth of items.\n\n""In fact, 35 sellers were observed selling over $1,000,000 worth of product and the top 1% most successful vendors were responsible for 51.5% of all the volume transacted.""\n\nThis has parallels with BitPay\'s data, too. Rather than many smaller merchants receiving bitcoin payments, Tim Swanson, a visiting research fellow at SKBI in Singapore, suspects there are a select few retailers that account for the majority of its transaction volume, in line with the 80/20 rule.\n\nIn the firm\'s most recent report, broken up by industry, gift card retailers accounted for 9% of its transaction volume. As there are so few gift-card-for-bitcoin services around, Swanson said, the lion\'s share of activity in this sector was likely to come from just one or two of its 60,000 retailers, most likely Gyft and e-Gifter – the biggest on the market.\n\nIf this logic follows for the rest of the sections on BitPay\'s chart, then it paints a view not of industries, but companies each taking up a share of its volume.\n\nThis appears to be supported by the number of small merchants, listed here, that have chosen to drop bitcoin as a payment option following poor sales.\n\nMixers, gamblers, spammers\n\nSwanson came out with his best guess at the flow of money through the bitcoin ecosystem in April. What it showed was that merchant sales – illicit or otherwise – make up only a slice of transactions.\n\nIn actuality, bitcoin transaction volume that takes place \'on-chain\' is dominated by a whole host of other services. The network is a test bed for many things – it costs very little to spam the network with tiny \'dust\' transactions, for example.\n\nThe popularity of gambling sites such as Satoshi Dice, which at one point accounted for 50% of transactions on the network, continue. ""In terms of on-chain transactions we know gambling transactions as a whole are likely the largest component of transaction volume,"" Swanson said.\n\nThe same goes for bitcoin mixing services – of which there are at least seven in popular use.

VCpay is a mobile virtual card technology which allows people to create virtual credit cards that can be used to make online payments.\n\nZazoo’s VCpay will enable its users to pay using cryptocurrencies over a conventional online or in-app payment gateways. In order to develop VCpay, the company has entered into an exclusive partnership with BitX, a bitcoin exchange and payments platform headquartered in Singapore. According to Zazoo, the company’s deal with BitX allows VCpay to overcome interoperability challenges in the financial system.\n\nThese VCpay mobile virtual cards set up on cell phones are capable of working even when the device has no data or cellular connection. VCpay enables users to create virtual credit cards with valid credit card number, CSV and expiry dates. In order to make payments with these cards, the VCpay has to be either connected to a bank account or BitX bitcoin wallet. Those who wants to use bitcoin for making payments can deposit bitcoin into their BitX wallet linked to VCpay. Once transaction is made, the balance will be deducted from the user’s linked bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe MVC technology (mobile virtual card technology) used in VCpay offers an additional layer of security compared to conventional cards, and it makes use of international payment structures to execute transactions. Bitcoin enthusiasts and others interested using virtual credit cards can expect VCpay to hit the market soon. VCpay will be initially available for customers in Europe, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Indonesia, Singapore and Philippines before it goes global.\n\nBy collaborating with BitX and introducing cryptocurrency option in VCpay, Zazoo has positioned itself as one of the next big things to hit the fintech space. VCpay offers a way for people to spend cryptocurrency on regular payment channels.', 'The mobile business is booming in recent years, and many companies are trying their hand at creating addictive mobile games. Developing such games takes time, money, and effort, leading to a few possible solutions to monetize these games. Most developers opt for in-game advertising in between levels, or while browsing the menus. But it seems like that business model is no longer sufficient.\n\nAlso read: mHITs Explores Bitcoin with New Mobile Service\n\nMobile Games ads not Adding up, Bitcoin MicroTransactions Could Help\n\nMonetizing any type of content in the online or mobile industry is not an easy task. Even though most people consume all types of content on their mobile devices these days, that doesn’t mean there will be more ad clicks or impressions on a daily basis. In fact, quite a few people get annoyed with these “ad breaks” while playing mobile games.\n\nEven popular companies such as Tencent, whose core business revolves around smartphone games, noticed a stagnation in sales as of late. Charging a small or premium price for a mobile game in exchange for having no advertisements sounds like a great idea, yet there are only so many people willing to pay for games these days.\n\n\n\nThat has nothing to do with Tencent itself, mind you, as the company is known for creating great and addictive mobile games. There is a whole ocean of mobile games available these days, most of which are free of charge, and chances are a similar experience to a paid game can be found at no cost.\n\nDespite this stagnation, Tencent is far from losing money. Second-quarter revenue increased by 19% compared to 2014, and the company’s net income increased by 25% in 12 months. The major factor responsible for this continued growth are the increasing number of video spots and ads in their WeChat application.\n\n\n\nWhile it is good to see a company such as Tencent diversify its earnings, it doesn’t solve the core problem mobile game developers are facing. Getting money out of a project that cost lots of man hours, blood, sweat, and tears is an issue of growing concern. This is where Bitcoin microtransactions could play a pivotal role.\n\nBy allowing in-game microtransactions, game developers are opening up an unlimited revenue stream for their project. However, accepting traditional payment methods such as Paypal, credit, and debit cards, means they will pay a hefty transaction fee for every payment. Bitcoin micropayments, on the other hand, charge minimal transaction fees and are more mobile friendly than any of its traditional counterparts.\n\nMonetizing Mobile Games Content With Bitcoin Micropayments\n\nCreating a Bitcoin-only in-game payment system would not be a smart business strategy for any developer. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are still far from achieving mainstream adoption, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for alternative in-game payment options that come at no additional cost.\n\nBitcoin is suffering from a bit of a hoarding problem, as individual users and business keep their Bitcoins In their wallets in the hopes of a price increase in the near future. Yet, at the same time, Bitcoin holders are more likely to spend a large amount of money on things they need or are passionate about. Mobile gaming could prove to be an interesting ally in that regard, both for Bitcoin and virtual currency in general.\n\nWould you spend Bitcoin on in-game purchases, and why (not)? Do you see a different business model to integrate Bitcoin into mobile gaming? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nSource: Techcrunch\n\nImages courtesy of Tencent, Shutterstock\n\nOriginally posted on: Bitcoin to Monetize Mobile Games Industry Soon?', 'Litecoin, a peer-to-peer currency and open-source global payment network, announced it will be halving on Tuesday, Aug. 25, marking what the Litecoin Association calls a milestone in the cryptocurrency’s 4-year history. The association has produced a video that describes the halving’s significance to Litecoin.\n\nAfter the halving, Litecoin will reward miners 25 coins rather than 50 new coins per block for solving blocks, Litecoin explained in a video. “The halving process doesn’t just happen once,” the video explained. This process happens every four years for both Litecoin and Bitcoin, as stated in their respective codes.\n\nVideo Explains Halving\n\nAs inflation slows, there are fewer coins for the market and everyone’s price rises, the video notes. Acknowledging there has been a price decline prior to the halving, the video notes the most likely reason is that people expect the price to rise. “We should also point out cryptocurrency has come a long way since 2012 when bitcoin underwent its first halving,” the video notes.\n\nAnother part of the equation is the miners, who invest in specialized equipment to mine the coins and must make a profit. Because their mining income will fall by 50 percent, they shut off a lot of their equipment unless the price rises to the point where it makes sense to continue.\n\nMiners face two options. One is the price rises and miners continue to operate. If the price doesn’t rise, the miners will no longer be able to operate. If this occurs, the network hash rate will drop as mining declines, resulting in a less distributed network. If the network hash rate drops low enough, the mining difficulty will automatically adjust itself. Those miners who stopped mining could be able to resume.\n\n“After all is said and done, the price will settle higher than it was” leading up to the halving, the video notes.\n\nPricing Concerns Overstated?\n\nThe Litecoin Association acknowledged in a release that there are concerns about the halving’s effect on Litecoin’s pricing, but noted that the price is not the currency’s paramount goal. Instead, the goal is to allow for the ability to send remittances within minutes, to store legal information digitally (eliminating fear of document shredding), and to provide self banking, all in a decentralized manner.\n\nTo be able to accomplish these tasks are so momentous that it has attracted the attention of governments and trillion dollar industries! This is why we do what we do as an industry,\n\nthe association said.\n\nLitecoin came into existence on Oct. 7, 2011, with the processing of its genesis block. Developer Charlie Lee mined three blocks to test the network, and Litecoin launched on Oct. 13, 2011, via Bitcoin Talk.org.\n\nAlso read: What just happened to Litecoin and bitcoin?\n\nAssociation Touts Litecoin’s Success\n\nWhile not the first altcoin, Litecoin has been the most successful, based on its adoption and acceptance within crypto communities, outside businesses and industries, and regional, state and governments, the association claimed.\n\nMeanwhile, Litecoin activity grows daily among miners, traders, developers, merchants, exchanges and the public at large. It is listed on most crypto currency exchanges while businesses are beginning to accept and hold it as a form of payment. Such businesses include REMAX London, Cheapair.com, BTC Trip and eGifter.\n\n“Beyond community involvement, Litecoin has one of the strongest and most secure networks on Earth,” the associated noted.\n\nLitecoin Progress Continues\n\nLitecoin surpassed the 1 terahash milestone in October 2014. This milestone was first achieved by bitcoin and only achieved by cryptocurrencies with specialized mining equipment known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). This milestone ensures the strength and security of the network as a payment method.\n\nWe at the Litecoin Association are both proud and humbled that we can play our small part in the crypto currency ecosystem and industry. The halving is a significant milestone for Litecoin, and with the support of the multiple communities, one step closer to defining the future for the world.\n\nLitecoin’s price was 0.01527150 BTC as of Aug. 16, according to Coinmarketcap.com. Its market capitalization was 637,322 BTC, volume was 13,546 BTC and available supply was 41,732,760 LTC.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Las empresas españolas Chip Chap y Bitchain, ambas operadoras de bitcoins y plataformas bancarias de conexión de moneda tradicional con las criptomonedas, se unieron para crear la mayor red de cajeros automáticos de compra y venta de bitcoins en el mundo.\n\nLas dos entidades firmaron un acuerdo de asociación y que los convirtió en uno de los más fuertes dentro de este sector en auge de las bitcoins.\n\nLos términos de este convenio hacen que la catalana Bitchain, especializada en la implantación internacional de Cajeros de Bitcoin, adquiera un 30% de la empresa valenciana Chip Chap, líder en sistemas de pago con criptomonedas.

08/17/2015,"['Two of bitcoin\'s best-known developers have \'forked\' the software in a controversial attempt to resolve its scalability crisis.\n\nThe client, Bitcoin XT, was dreamt up earlier this year as a way to \'opt out\' of bitcoin\'s current 1MB block size limit – which has proved a divisive issue as the digital currency grows.\n\nCurrently, the network handles between three and seven transactions per second. However, blocks on the network are beginning to fill up. Reaching bitcoin\'s so-called \'capacity cliff\' – depending on who you ask – could create a competitive market for transaction fees or destroy the robustness of the network completely.\n\nIncreasing bitcoin\'s block size – a \'quick fix\' for the issue – carries its own long-term implications for the network, which some argue would make the network more centralised and, thus, less trusted.\n\nGavin Andresen, who handed over the reins as bitcoin lead developer to Wladimir Van der Laan last year, is behind XT\'s code, with ex-Google employee Mike Hearn reviewing and adding bug fixes. As of Saturday, it is now subject to public scrutiny as the final part of the testing process.\n\nGovernance model\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Hearn said the project had come about as a result of long-standing frustrations with the consensus-driven governance of Bitcoin Core, which he said has ignored any changes that trigger disagreement – even among those who do not contribute to its code.\n\n""This model falls apart the moment even small differences of opinion and vision appear, as it allows anyone – including people who hardly contribute – to block any change.""\n\nBitcoin XT will use the ""traditional"" open source model, Hearn said, in which the code ultimately reflects the decisions of its maintainer. Unlike Bitcoin Core, it won\'t run on consensus, but can be forked and modified by others.\n\n""This takes a little bit of work, but not much – it\'s similar to creating a political party. Convincing people to run it is like convincing people to vote for you,"" he added.\n\nTechnically speaking, anyone can run XT. However its new rules, which include other patches that didn\'t make it into Core, such as updates on double-spending and protection against DDoS attacks, will only be triggered by miners doing so – 75% of miners, to be exact.\n\nHearn explained:\n\n""By mining with Bitcoin XT you will produce blocks with a new version number. This indicates to the rest of the network that you support larger blocks. When 75% of the blocks are new-version blocks, a decision has been reached to start building larger blocks that will be rejected by Bitcoin Core nodes.""\n\nIf XT doesn\'t receive enough of these \'votes\' then nothing will change. It\'s up to Hearn to convince other stakeholders, including exchanges, payment processors and wallet developers to join its bigger blocks – at press time it had 6.9%.\n\n""At the moment, we think it\'s plausible we can get majority. But it will likely be a lot of work,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nThe 75% majority\n\nOthers are more cautious about XT achieving the majority it needs. Speaking to CoinDesk, fellow Core developer Peter Todd said that while it was possible for the 75% threshold to be achieved, he warned the standard 95% threshold for soft-forks was chosen for good safety engineering reasons.\n\n""For technical reasons 75% is really low and has a high risk of leading to huge reorganisations of the blockchain; miners would be taking a big risk by adopting that code,"" he said, adding that the team behind the software was ""unproven"" and ""inexperienced"".\n\nIf Bitcoin XT succeeds, it seems like a risky strategy to be left on the wrong side of the fork. For one thing, any new coins mined on the \'losing side\' would be unsellable. Hearn isn\'t too worried about this, citing the fact that miners have rejoined the majority within hours in the past.\n\nHowever Pieter Wuille, another Bitcoin Core developer, told CoinDesk this \'losing\' and \'winning\' fork was a big concern:\n\n""People not being able to send coins from one \'side\' of the fork to another, and all coins that existed before the fork being able to be spent twice (once on every side of the fork) [is] the very thing that bitcoin was designed to prevent.""\n\n""Maybe it works and maybe it doesn\'t, but I do think that it is a grave risk for centralisation of influence over the network, even if it works,"" he added.\n\nAction and inaction\n\nThe blocksize debate has overshadowed development for many months now. It\'s proved the most divisive issue among bitcoin\'s core developers – and the stalemate between those demanding bigger blocks and those seeking other scalability workarounds, Todd included, shows no sign of abating.\n\nJeff Garzik, who made a proposal, BIP 102, for a 2MB block as an emergency \'fallback\' if consensus is not reached, recently put it: ""There is no perfect answer? as with most modern policy changes, any action –\xad including inaction – generates winners and losers.""\n\nUnderstandably, XT has garnered its fair share of detractors – not just for its aims, but its methods, too.\n\nA message purporting to be from Satoshi Nakamoto – whose email account was rumoured to have been compromised last year – appeared on the bitcoin dev mailing list Saturday to denounce the ""dangerous"" project. It read:\n\n""If two developers can fork bitcoin and succeed in redefining what \'bitcoin\' is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare bitcoin a failed project. Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.""\n\nWhether or not it came from the real bitcoin creator, the message that the project violates the \'original vision\' of bitcoin is shared by others.\n\nDiscussion of XT was recently banned on the most popular bitcoin subreddit, r/bitcoin, with moderator \'Theymos\' claiming that as a fork of Bitcoin Core, XT should be classed as an \'altcoin\' or a \'forkcoin\', similar to litecoin.\n\nWuille said: ""I think that people are free to fork the software and make changes. Not all users have the same demands, and software diversity is good. However, we\'re not talking about switching software, but about changing the rules of the network.""\n\n""I consider proposing software that intentionally changes the consensus rules while controversy exists about it, and marketing this as a safe choice for people in the network to run to be disingenuous and dangerous.""\n\nTodd told CoinDesk: ""Well, keep in mind there is no debate among the experts in the community about the big picture: blockchains don\'t (yet) scale. Even Gavin admits any block size increase is just \'kicking the can down the road\'.""\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Since January, the 28-year-old freelance computer programmer from Luxembourg has been on a trip around the world using only bitcoin.\n\nMost store clerks, bartenders and tour operators he’s encountered have never heard of the virtual currency. But that is what Weis intended. He is targeting ordinary people rather than tech geeks who already understand it.\n\n“Bitcoin is the most exciting global socioeconomic experiment right now,” Weis said. “I really believe in it.”\n\nAs proof of his devotion to the six-year-old currency, Weis converted all his money into bitcoin and cut up his credit card. He carries the two halves in a clear plastic bag for anyone who doubts his seriousness.\n\nOften three or four people gather to listen as he — usually — convinces someone to accept it as payment. Then he pulls out a selfie stick. In the 14 countries Weis has visited so far, he has snapped dozens of photos with first-time bitcoin users holding up their smartphones to show off their first transaction. That includes this reporter.\n\nBitcoin was invented as an alternative to government-run monetary systems, and allows users to make payments instantly and anonymously, even across borders, with no need for a bank or other third party. It can be used to buy goods and services, traded for traditional currency on a bitcoin exchange, or stored in a virtual “wallet.”\n\nThe virtual currency is controlled by an international network of computers, rather than a central bank or government. Its underlying technology is the blockchain, a sort of public ledger of each bitcoin transaction. Thousands of specialized computers worldwide verify transactions using a computer code that — in theory — is unbreakable. That transparency and cryptographic proof are bitcoin’s appeal for users who distrust banks or government-backed currencies — or would like to keep their transactions out of sight.\n\nTo use bitcoin, you need to first download a bitcoin wallet app to your smartphone. Then you can buy bitcoins online through an exchange, or in person through a local seller. Websites such as spendbitcoins.com show where you can spend bitcoin in your area.\n\nIts potential advantages for frequent travelers are obvious: paying by bitcoin is instantaneous, with no need to exchange currency in each country or pay foreign transaction fees.\n\nWeis intends to visit 21 countries by the end of the year to symbolize the 21 million bitcoins that can ever come into use, as designed by the currency’s mysterious founder, who is known only by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The name is widely believed to be fake.\n\nWeis sticks to three rules: He must use bitcoin whenever possible to pay for food, accommodations and travel. He can never use a debit or credit card. And he may use limited amounts of local currency, but only if he obtains it by exchanging bitcoin for physical money with local people found via a special website, localbitcoins.com.\n\nSo far he has visited much of Europe, plus Turkey, Israel and Ukraine. To book his travel, Weis uses travel companies that accept the digital currency. Expedia.com customers can use it to pay for hotel bookings, while CheapAir takes it for hotels and flights.\n\nAfter a free historical tour of the Israeli port city Jaffa, Weis had offered to tip his tour guide in bitcoin. To do so, he had her download a bitcoin wallet app to her smartphone, then used his own phone to scan the wallet’s QR code. Within seconds the guide possessed the bitcoin equivalent of 30 shekels. Finally, Weis pulled up a map of Tel Aviv on Coinmap.org to show her all the nearby stores, restaurants and services where she could spend it.\n\nIn other countries, Weis has used the virtual currency to pay for scuba diving lessons, paragliding and bungee jumping. Weis’ experiences in each country vary widely depending on bitcoin adoption rates and awareness. Sometimes he has a limited choice of stores, restaurants and activities, and he can’t always persuade merchants to take a chance on a new currency.\n\nFor a few days in Varna, Bulgaria, Weis’ only meal was the complimentary hotel breakfast. Budapest and Berlin had the most places that took bitcoin. In Turkey in May, Weis celebrated “Bitcoin Pizza Day” — the anniversary of the first real-world transaction using bitcoin in 2010 — two days late because it took him that long to find a pizzeria he could convince to accept it.\n\nDespite his enthusiasm for bitcoin, Weis does not encourage others to go to the same extremes. As with any digital technology, bitcoin wallets are susceptible to hacking or file corruption. But unlike bank-issued cards, bitcoins aren’t overseen by an authority that can help in those situations.\n\nThe currency is highly volatile: At one point in 2013, the price per bitcoin soared to more than $1,200 and crashed 70 percent a month later. Days after he started his trip, Weis thought he would have to cut it short by two months when the price dropped to $180. He’d budgeted for a year with bitcoin selling for at least $250. It now trades around $255 on the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nLast week, Weis flew to Hong Kong to begin the Asian leg of his journey. He will go to South America later in the fall. He hopes to learn more about how bitcoin is used differently depending on economic factors, he said. In the Philippines, for instance, personal remittances make up 10 percent of the GDP. Bitcoin makes it cheaper to transfer money, because there’s little to no fee.\n\nMeanwhile, in Venezuela and Argentina, bitcoin adoption has been fueled by high inflation and capital controls. At least 65 percent of Latin Americans do not have bank accounts, but many do have smartphones, which give them easy and cheap access to bitcoin, according to Sebastian Serrano, founder of BitPagos, Argentina’s biggest bitcoin company.\n\nWeis’ last stop will be Berlin, where his trip began and where he’s thinking about creating a software startup to make using bitcoin “easier and safer for the average person.” He says he would like to get paid in bitcoin and plans to keep his savings in the digital currency as well.\n\nSaid Weis: “Now that I know it’s possible to live off bitcoin in 14 countries, why go back to the boring old system?”', ""South Africa's first Bitcoin academy has opened its doors for organisations and individuals wanting to learn more about Bitcoin and the Blockchain. The new learning academy is also the first of its kind in Africa.\n\nThe academy is located at the Bandwidth Barn in Woodstock, Cape Town and was founded by Sonya Kuhnel.\n\nKuhnel previously started a Bitcoin payment company and is now turning her attention to training others in Bitcoin technologies.\n\n“When I first started in the bitcoin space, I encountered significant resistance towards digital currencies from individuals and businesses in South Africa,” says Kuhnel. “The level of understanding of bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain, proved to be a real challenge and I realised I would have to first educate the market place before there would be any significant uptake of the digital currency and the cutting-edge technology behind it.”\n\nThe academy currently offers three courses, each aimed at different users, ranging from beginners looking for an introduction to Bitcoin to developers wanting to build products around the Blockchain.\n\nKuhnel is also the founder of Bitcoin events which held its first Bitcoin Africa conference in Cape Town earlier this year. The second Bitcoin Africa conference will be held in Johannesburg in March 2016. – IOL"", 'Former NSA contractor and alleged information leak Edward Snowden recently shared his thoughts on the cryptocurrency bitcoin and its flaws. Although he pointed out the disadvantages of the network, he also had some positive remarks as well.\n\nFor one, Snowden mentioned that “the protocol has a lot of weaknesses and transaction sides and a lot of weaknesses that structurally make it vulnerable to people who are trying to own 50 percent of the network and so on and so forth.”\n\nSnowden Comments on Bitcoin\n\n“But when we think about the basic principles behind it, there are some very interesting things that particularly when we start to combine them with that idea like before of tokenization, of concepts like proof of work,” he added.\n\nOf course Snowden also put some focus on the issue of privacy, as bitcoin transactions are practically anonymous. After all, the verification takes place through the network of computers solving complex algorithms to update the blockchain or distributed public ledger.\n\nSnowden mentioned that focusing on the cryptocurrency itself could be a mistake, as he discussed methods in which true privacy can be enabled. “You have tokens that authenticate each person and when you want to be able to interact with people as your persona in your true name, you can do so. When you want to be able to switch to a persona – a common persona, an anonymous persona, a shared persona, you can do that. When you want to move to pseudonymous persona, you can do that,” he explained.\n\nHe added that it would be possible to wash user data from bitcoin in a way to provide a level of anonymity not currently seen, explaining that there may be a way to implement a process with multiple steps as used with the Tor browser.', 'With the sound of New York traffic raging noisily in the background, former pro-baseball player John Paul Farmer tells me he’s intent on finding new ways in which technology can make a difference to people’s lives. Lucky for him, he has the weight of Microsoft behind him.\n\nFarmer, an ex-shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers, joined the tech giant last year, having spent four years working as a senior advisor for innovation at the White House.\n\nJoining a large company wasn’t really on his agenda – he considered joining a startup or even setting up his own company – but this all changed after he met with Microsoft’s general counsel Brad Smith and corporate vice president Dan’l Lewin.\n\n“Dan’l and Brad had this vision for how Microsoft – obviously a gigantic global company with billions of users – could engage in a really local way on civic issues. So, how could we use technology to address social problems?” he explained.\n\nFarmer said it struck him as a really important mission, especially for such a big company with a colossal reach.\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more I really came to believe that they had the right approach in mind.”\n\nHe became the company’s director of technology and civic innovation, and now heads up a team of 10 people in New York.\n\nBlockchain and societal improvement\n\nFarmer doesn\'t have much time for bitcoin, the currency. “I find that to be the least interesting part of what bitcoin and the blockchain can do,” he explained.\n\nHe concedes cryptocurrency must be given some praise for bringing blockchain tech into the limelight, but he doesn’t spend much time thinking about that particular application of the technology.\n\n“I actually spend most of my time thinking about what it means when you can have an identity that can be controlled and shared in a granular way, when you have titles and deeds that can be stored and shared easily and without middlemen.”\n\nFarmer said, while blockchain technology has the potential to make a real difference in the developing world – helping the unbanked become banked for the first time – his interests lie closer to home.\n\nHe explained that, recently, he heard 25% of African-Americans – around 10 million people – don’t have a government-issued identification card.\n\n“That is amazing, and there are states here that require you to show your identification card in order to vote. So the ability for these technologies to empower and enfranchise the disenfranchised here in the US and in the UK and in other developed countries, I think is also really really powerful.”\n\nConnecting sectors\n\nFarmer and his team work with a wide variety of sectors, including governments, academics, startups, for-profits, nonprofits and simply “anyone who wants to solve problems”.\n\nHe described the team’s work as being threefold: to participate, partner and produce.\n\nFirstly, they utilise their presence in New York, making sure they’re involved in and aware of the goings-on in the community so they can identify ongoing issues and work on solutions.\n\nIn terms of developing partnerships to work on these solutions, Farmer said his team has been reaching out to other organisations, groups and individuals that are working on “interesting applications of technology”. Microsoft seeks to work with these people to bring their ideas to fruition.\n\nFarmer has been in talks with the team over at MIT Media Labs’ Digital Currency Initiative, which is headed by his former White House colleague Brian Forde. For the time being, they\'re still just engaging in early talks, but Farmer believes it\'s “highly likely” the two groups will work together on projects.\n\nHe’s keen not to rushing into anything, taking his time to make sure his team forms partnerships with the right groups and projects within the blockchain space.\n\n“Obviously there are a lot of people doing a lot of things to do with the blockchain, but we’re trying to find the ones where there\'s a good fit and it makes sense, both for them and for us,” he explained.\n\nIn terms of what the team is producing, it’s very much still in the R&D stage when it comes to solutions based on blockchain technology. But any promising ideas will be trialled both within the company and within communities.\n\n“We produce prototypes of what could exist and then we share those with the community externally, but also internally to the various product groups of Microsoft, to help those product groups imagine what could happen and what could really benefit end users,"" Farmer said.\n\nProgress\n\nRegardless of how much, or little, progress Farmer’s team has made in the blockchain space, he knows his counterparts on other teams within Microsoft have made some real headway.\n\n“They\'re all further along than we are in terms of how they are using blockchain and how they\'re thinking about integrating it. But our mission as a team within the company is very different. We\'re specifically focused on how to use it for social good,” he added.\n\nThe company director said he’s been highly impressed by the innovation that has taken place in the blockchain arena so far and the calibre of people involved.\n\nThere are people in the space that he knows from the traditional finance world (Farmer previously held roles at Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse) as well as highly accomplished academics, developers and ""hardcore technologists"".\n\n“It\'s not one-sided, it\'s not just one-dimensional, it actually bringing together people with a variety of perspectives and experiences, and that\'s going to drive us all forward that much faster,” he concluded.\n\nMicrosoft image via pio3 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This came in response to an inquiry from a company which issues digital proofs of custody through the bitcoin blockchain to transfer ownership of gold, silver, and the like.\n\nPrior to this ruling, companies that use blockchain to transfer precious metal ownership simply fell under the category of a dealer in precious metals, precious stones, or jewels. Now, FinCEN has clarified that they are also money transmitters, which means that the regulations in both these industries apply.\n\nBlockchain and Gold\n\nOne of the frequently used applications of blockchain is to track ownership, as entries in this distributed public ledger cannot be easily tampered with. In the past year, several startups have taken advantage of this feature to make it easier for clients to buy or sell gold and other precious metals.\n\n“The Company does not fall under the e-currencies or e-precious metals trading exemption from money transmission because, when the Company issues a freely transferable digital certificate of ownership to buyers, it is allowing the unrestricted transfer of value from a customer’s commodity position to the position of another customer or a third-party, and it is no longer limiting itself to the type of transmission of funds that is a fundamental element of the actual transaction necessary to execute the contract for the purchase or sale of the currency or the other commodity,” FinCEN noted in a letter.\n\nWith that, these businesses will be subject to anti-money laundering (AML) checks and will be required to assess the risk of money laundering arising out of non-exempt transactions. Aside from that, the blockchain company is subject to record-keeping, reporting, transaction monitoring requirements. FinCEN emphasized that the fact that the transactions are recorded on the blockchain does not absolve the companies from being money transmitters.', 'Nathaniel Popper, a business reporter at The New York Times – and author of critically acclaimed Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money fell into the digital currency by chance.\n\nIt was Spring 2013, Popper said, and both he and The Times watched on as bitcoin was taking off, trying to figure out whether it was worthy of coverage or just a passing fad.\n\nThe answer to their question became apparent after the Winklevoss brothers – Internet entrepreneurs better known for their lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and now the masterminds of upcoming bitcoin exchange Gemini – approached the newspaper to discuss the cryptocurrency and eagerly opened up about their private bitcoin stash (at the time worth approximately $11m).\n\n""I liked the fact that we could sort of talk about it in concrete terms, through some people that actually owned [bitcoin]. It was people sort of putting their reputation on the line a bit, nobody with any name or reputation had been really willing to do that before,"" said Popper.\n\nThe response to the article, he added, was completely unexpected, in a positive way. Popper attributed part of its success to the Winkevoss\' public profiles, but also highlighted people\'s increasing interest in this new idea of money, ""independent from any other currency"".\n\nBitcoin skepticism\n\nAlthough Popper inadvertently became one of The Times’ main bitcoin reporters, he said he was, and still is to an extent, largely skeptical about the digital currency.\n\n""I similarly found it pretty fascinating, although I was very skeptical that it would survive,"" he said, adding ""if people lose confidence in it, it dies.""\n\nInitially, Popper resisted proposals from book agents, telling them he didn\'t believe bitcoin was a long-term phenomenon and didn\'t warrant a book nor the effort required to write it.\n\nHe was, however, eventually compelled to write Digital Gold due to a confluence of factors.\n\n""One was that I just continued talking with sort of serious people who were taking this [bitcoin] seriously and talking about the fact that there was something really interesting and new in the technology and the network.""\n\nThen, Popper met Charlie Shrem – approximately two weeks before the former CEO of BitInstant and Bitcoin Foundation board member was arrested – and engaged in a ""very vibrant conversation"" with him and Nic Cary, co-founder of wallet provider Blockchain.\n\nSeeing how passionate they both were about bitcoin struck a chord with Popper, who finally decided to pursue the book, which he said was never meant to be about the technology, but rather a story of bitcoin and the people behind it.\n\nA social movement\n\nPopper sees bitcoin as a social movement.\n\n""The technology might be interesting but if people hadn\'t adopted it and been willing to spend money on it, it would not matter,"" he said, adding ""and so, it\'s only when you understand why people adopt it that you understand what it is"".\n\nWith questions continually emerging about bitcoin\'s quest to achieve mass consumer adoption, Popper signalled that its failure to do so was ""pretty simple"":\n\n“There’s nothing for an ordinary person to use [bitcoin] for right now ... in a place like Argentina where there is value in bitcoin, it does something right now, better than the alternative.”\n\nIn places like China, Popper added, it is more of a speculative gambling game, but still a step up from the existing online lotteries. Elsewhere, in the US, he said bitcoin had mostly been used in online gambling and drug purchases.\n\n“It needs to be better at something for people to want to use it and that includes the whole experience of, not just the actual transaction, but getting money in and out.”\n\nLike others before him, Popper noted that finding bitcoin\'s killer app is what would lead to the digital currency\'s adoption.\n\n“Bitcoin needs to find those things that it does better than the alternative, it can’t just be equal to … it has to be much better. I think it’s still very much looking for that or to create a new use.”\n\nBitcoin in the media\n\nBitcoin has been misrepresented by the mainstream media in the past, with journalists sometimes including inaccuracies in their definition of the currency and its underlying technology.\n\nPopper explained how as a journalist, you often have to describe something quickly. ""It\'s not the way a bitcoin person would want to have it described ... there is a lot of misrepresentation ... I mean it is an incredibly complicated technology.""\n\nHowever, Popper said, that the media\'s understanding is changing.\n\n“I think a lot of the media does kind of get it generally right now … I do think some of the things bitcoin fans think are misrepresentations in the media are sometimes just bitcoin fans being overly sensitive about some short-hand way of describing something.”\n\nThis change, Popper said, could potentially be attributed to journalists taking bitcoin more seriously.\n\nEarly on, bitcoin probably seemed like a joke, added Popper. “I took it pretty lightly as well. Now people take it more seriously and so they are trying to understand what it is and how it actually works.”\n\nBitcoin on Wall Street\n\nAs the media is becoming increasingly well-versed in bitcoin and blockchain technology, so is traditional finance.\n\nBankers, Popper believes, must have gone through the same kind of process as him, slowly realising the blockchain’s potential in the wider financial market.\n\nBlythe Masters – widely credited with creating the credit default swap – for example, joined Digital Asset Holdings as CEO.\n\n“She particularly got peoples’ attention because she is not just any Wall Street executive, she was one of the ten best known bankers of the last 20 years.”\n\nBeyond this, Popper also alluded to the increasing interest of traditional finance institutions on blockchain technology.\n\n“I’ve been amazed since the book came out and dealing with bankers and financial folks just how they are more interested in this than I even grasped.”\n\nPopper thinks traditional finance will continue to focus on blockchain tech. “It may not be on the bitcoin blockchain … a lot of these guys, what they want is to find a way to do this without using the bitcoin blockchain, but I think that’s where some of the most intense work is going on these days.”\n\nIs adoption by Wall Street necessary to legitimise bitcoin? Popper doesn’t think so.\n\n“I think that bitcoin was doing pretty well at growing slowly … I think that’s how a good technology [succeeds], it doesn’t bite off more than it can chew ... I think it will probably continue developing at that pace. That being said, now that these [Wall Street] guys are involved, it will increase the pace of development.”\n\nNew York Times image via Erika Cross / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Here, in the first of a three-part series, he discusses how banks dealt with the emergence of the Internet and how blockchain technology is causing these institutions a whole new headache.\n\nA recent flurry of media reports and surveys have touted that some banking and financial services sector players are undertaking interesting projects with blockchains and decentralized ledgers in particular. But this burst of activity is hardly enough to prematurely claim victory on behalf of the few banks who have publicized such initiatives.\n\nIt is naive to assume that the blockchain will make the most impact where it is to be adopted early. Rather, it will make the most impact where change is hardest to achieve, and that might take a little longer, realistically.\n\nThe blockchain and its derivative technologies are one of the biggest opportunities for reengineering financial services. It’s a looming tsunami, and the big question is whether the banks will fail to reinvent themselves as they did with the Internet, or if they will dare to induce a self-inflicted shake-up and embrace the future.\n\nBased on the early activity that I’m seeing, it appears that the banks are taking a narrow minded view of the opportunity being presented to them. Not unlike how they tackled the Internet in 1995.\n\nIf you’re a CEO or senior executive at a big bank or large financial institution, you will remember the advent of the Internet and its subsequent entry into the world of finance. That was around 1994-1997. Having been there too, and involved with some banks in an advisory capacity, I remember well that the banking sector didn’t take the Internet too seriously for at least the first three-to-four years of its commercialization. For example, when it came to Internet payments, banks didn’t want to touch them initially under the pretext that they “weren’t safe”.\n\nThen, a handful of Internet-only banks and online brokerage startups were created, and banks followed by offering online banking, buying the brokerage companies, and much later rushed to develop smartphone apps for their customers.\n\nSlow progress\n\nEven when the banking sector took the Internet seriously, they did so very slowly, and without much innovation and without rocking the boat. When I look at my online banking today, the features are mostly about convenience, but I can’t do too much beyond the basics. My foreign exchange account doesn’t link to my banking card, I can’t exchange money online, and can’t initiate a wire transfer unless I visit the bank or have a fancy business account.\n\nIf I was a millennial today, I wouldn’t think twice about not using a traditional bank because most of the services I am attracted to are offered by alternative financial services companies, primarily due to innovative FinTech startups that sprung up in the past decade.\n\nHere’s a typical millennial’s “financial stack”. In fact, a mere $2.3bn has funded the production of 126 FinTech companies in the past few years only. That certainly pales in comparison to the $200bn globally spent each year on IT by the banking sector, a high figure backed by the fact that the financial services industry consistently outspends other industries on technology. But we would be hard pressed to see real innovation coming out of that huge spending, because the bulk of those budgets are for keeping the lights on and infrastructure running.\n\nIndeed, many banks have established so-called innovation and research centers with multi-million dollar budgets. But that’s not enough. These supposedly act as research laboratories with a mandate to run pilots and experiments. But are they really innovating at the pace of external innovation or are they being gatekeepers to the real innovation that’s happening outside banks?\n\nIn reality, few of these centers are real innovators. They are still bound by the bank’s current and legacy business models. It is puzzling that your business units couldn’t innovate on their own. Why not issue innovation mandates everywhere, not just in the “innovation center”?\n\nAnd that’s all before bitcoin in the mix yet.\n\nEnter bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchains, distributed ledgers and more technical jargon.\n\nHello bitcoin, another banking headache\n\nBitcoin is the “Internet of money” after all, so that should have gotten a banker’s attention from day one. Then we have the blockchain, the infrastructure behind bitcoin and other decentralization technologies. Well, let’s say it’s like a new type of database that has the potential to wreak havoc for your IT departments. It sounds like a perfect discussion between a CEO and their CIO.\n\nI have said this before many times. The novel field is not bitcoin and it’s not just blockchain. It’s the intersection of cryptography technology with software engineering. We could call it CryptoTech for a lack of a better word.\n\nCryptoTech is not a unidirectional phenomenon. It’s multi-dimensional, therefore it will have different bifurcations. It has multiple identities. And it’s more than just about bitcoin or blockchains. It is simultaneously:\n\nCurrency with wings, and no borders\n\nSoftware Technology with a new development architecture paradigm\n\nAccounting Ledger that is distributed and decentralized\n\nConsensus Clearing network that acts as a “trust layer” that can validate business logic, not just transactions\n\nReal-Time Messaging System that’s built-in, therefore it’s very fast\n\nGlobal Online Community with special network effects\n\nTransactions Engine that can verify transactions and approval levels\n\nComputing Infrastructure that is global and similar to a cloud-based one\n\nReengineering Catalyst that enables innovation and new processes focused on enabling decentralization\n\nThe larger the organization, the more it needs to address all of these pieces, because it will be touched by each one of them, sooner or later.\n\nSo, in addition to focusing on the decentralized ledger properties of the blockchain, the banking sector needs to take a more holistic approach to determining what blockchain technologies (including bitcoin) can do for them.\n\nLook out for part two in this series, coming soon.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Startup Management, an edited version has been reposted here with permission.\n\nBank image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles. As such, the opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nFor more details on how you can submit an opinion or analysis article, view our Editorial Collaboration Guide or email news@coindesk.com."", 'Donald Trump yesterday unveiled his policy paper on immigration reform, including how he would convince Mexico to pay for a border wall. But technology is likely to have made his first bullet point irrelevant by the time he would take office.\n\nTrump writes that “Mexico continues to make billions on not only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States back to Mexico ($22 billion in 2013 alone)… Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages.”\n\nBefore continuing, it’s worth noting that Trump is incorrectly quoting the source to which he links (Fox News Latino). The $22 billion figure is for all remittances from the U.S. to Mexico in 2013, not only those involving illegal immigrants.\n\nBut my issue here isn’t bad math. It’s the idea that Trump thinks he’d be able to use remittances as a major cudgel in 2017 (which is when the next president would be sworn in). While most of these payments today are made via traditional wire transfers, more and more of them are being made via bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nNot only are such exchanges cheaper than traditional wire transfers, but they are faster and would be virtually impossible for the U.S. government to block (given that Bitcoin transfers don’t include identifying information that could be matched against federal identification databases). There is even a service that lets people in the U.S. send Bitcoin to ATMs in Mexico, where the intended recipient can withdraw their money in pesos.\n\nAs smartphone penetration increases in Mexico and cryptocurrency technology advances, it’s a trend that should only accelerate (particularly if the U.S. government tries to stop wire transfers).\n\nDonald Trump already overstated the amount of remittances from illegal immigrants in the U.S. to Mexico, but completely ignored how wire transfers are becoming a smaller part of the process. He’s going to have to hope his other plans — including fees hikes on NAFTA worker visas from Mexico — convince the Mexican government to pony up, because remittance blockades would be less restrictive than the theoretical border wall.', 'The ongoing debate about the role of governments in regulating digital currencies isn’t going away anytime soon. While the dustup over New York’s BitLicense program continues, another front has opened up in California where a member of the state assembly has introduced a bill to regulate California’s digital currencies businesses.\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based Coin Center and the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) each have lobbied hard against the New York Department of Financial Services attempts to regulate New York businesses with its controversial BitLicense program.\n\nBut with the proposed California law, the two organizations have taken two separate forks in the advocacy road, with Coin Center supporting the California legislation and EFF adamantly opposed.\n\nCoin Center supports while EFF opposes proposed California law\n\nCoin Center is now supporting the proposed California legislation, saying it is the best possible compromise under the circumstances and would prevent a worse law – the current money transmission law – from being the default in regulating bitcoin.\n\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, told Bitcoin Magazinethe proposed California law is a “model for sound regulation in this sector,” not as flawed as the New York BitLicense regulations, and is much better than the status quo.\n\n“A Bitcoin company that actually holds all of the private keys for some user is acting just like a bank or a money transmitter. It’s very difficult to convince politicians that between two companies with very similar risk profiles, one that holds peoples bitcoins and one that holds their fiat, the Bitcoin business should get special treatment,” he said.\n\n“[T]he losses suffered by customers of Mt. Gox and other failed exchanges provide all the rationale they need to treat bitcoin custodians exactly as they would treat the legacy industry,” Van Valkenburgh said. “So what we’re left with, the sensible strategy, is to make sure that non-custodial and highly innovative uses of the technology, like multi-sig, sidechains, the lightning network, are exempted.”\n\nThe proposed law would require digital currencies businesses to obtain a license from the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO).\n\n“Everybody — even Coin Center — acknowledges that this bill has serious flaws,” EFF Activism Director Rainey Reitman told Bitcoin Magazine. “But the biggest problems aren’t for large, established Bitcoin companies like those backing Coin Center. Many of those aren’t affected by this bill, either because they already qualify for a license exception or they have the resources to overcome the regulatory hurdles.”\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe proposed legislation has passed through the California Assembly (although the vote was split), and through the Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee, and is due to be voted on in the California Senate in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, Coin Center will work to educate people on how the law will work.\n\n“Coin Center has been transparent from the start when it comes to bill AB 1326,” Van Valkenburgh said. “While the bill began its life unfriendly to Bitcoin and blockchain innovation, it has evolved into a model for sound regulation in this sector, even if it can still be improved.”\n\nEFF will be fighting the proposed bill through its online activism campaign.\n\nReitman noted the possible repercussions of this law.\n\n“I don’t think this will stop in California. If this bill passes, I suspect it will be replicated in future states, with potentially worse provisions. That’s why this battle is so important,” she said. “Our mission is clear and we will continue to work on behalf of Bitcoin startups, innovators, and users of future virtual currency technologies that may never exist if this law is passed. EFF has to argue for the wider public interest.”']"
08/18/2015,"['Bitcoin has had many impressive achievements within its fist six and a half years, but with the help of historyofbitcoin.org to find some key dates of events, here are the Top 10 Moments in Bitcoin history. Some were good, some were bad, some were ugly, but all were memorable … so memorable that many have even transcended the Bitcoin space and reached the mainstream’s consciousness. So let’s take a walk down Bitcoin’s Memory Lane, shall we?\n\nThe creation of Bitcoin\n\nSuch a “technological tour de force as Microsoft founder Bill Gates once said about Bitcoin, is not easily brought to life by even the smartest among us. There are small pieces to the Bitcoin puzzle that led up to the Genesis Block in 2009 that created this historic event.\n\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto is the most mysterious part of Bitcoin’s early history, as he has only been found is some email messages to people like Hall Finney and Mike Hearn (certainly not be Newsweek). Bitcoin development was rumored to have begun in 2007, but real progress is seen in August of 2008, when Neal Kin, Vladimir Oksman, and Charles Bry file an application for an encryption patent application.\n\nAlthough some aspects are similar to the Bitcoin product to come, no direct connection to Bitcoin or Nakamoto is made. This would not be terribly relevant if the domain bitcoin.org was not registered three days later, anonymously.\n\nOn Halloween, October 31, 2008, the official white paper for the design of Bitcoin was published on metzdowd.com. The eight-page outline shows how the Byzantine General’s Theory, previously unsolved for decades, and issues with double spending have been solved by this new Bitcoin invention. Andreas Antonopoulos touts it as the best such research paper he’s ever read, revealing how Bitcoin is not just a currency, but a new technology destined to change the world. Block 0 is mined on January 3, 2009, and Bitcoin is officially invented.\n\nBitcoin’s first transaction\n\nNine days later, the first ever transaction in Bitcoin is made between founder Satoshi Nakamoto and cryptographer Hal Finney. This founding father of Bitcoin actually created the first proof of work system even before Bitcoin came to be. Sadly, not long after this historic moment, he was diagnosed with ALS, which would claim his life almost exactly five years later in 2014, at the age of 58.\n\nThe first Bitcoin currency exchange is created\n\nAnd no, it wasn’t Mt. Gox, which would turn out to be the largest Bitcoin exchange in history, but not the first. The first was called the Bitcoin Market, and was created just over a year after Bitcoin was born, on February 6, 2010 by “dwdollar."" The beginning of a real-world market value for the digital currency has begun.\n\nThe Pizza Purchase\n\nThe first retail purchase on May 22, 2010 is probably the most famous story in Bitcoin history. Jacksonville, Florida Bitcoin “miner” Laszlo Hanyecz pays 10,000 Bitcoins that he mined himself for two pizzas. At the time, Bitcoin did technically have an exchange rate of a few cents, but who knew that? The purchase price for the pizza was approximately U$25. Selling 10,000 units of unknown computer code for two real pizzas seemed like a great deal at the time.\n\n“It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Mr. Hanyecz told the New York Times recently.\n\nThe year of 2010 sees many first for Bitcoin, including the first escrow transaction (October 16), the first mobile transaction (December 8) and the first time Bitcoin’s total value exceeded US$1 million on November 6, with each bitcoin trading for approx. US$0.50. Bitcoin is now a real currency.\n\nSilk Road Opens Its Doors\n\nThe Silk Road chapter in Bitcoin history begins in 2011 with the “Dark Web” release of the infamous Silk Road website. Known as the “eBay for drugs,” everything from contract killers to story writers is allegedly marketed here to those who frequent the Internet’s underbelly.\n\nThe largest marketplace for Bitcoin use due to its pseudonymous nature, hundreds of millions of dollars of illegal items, services, and bitcoin are traded over its almost 3 year existence. Creator by Ross Ulbricht, Ulbricht operated online under the handle “Dread Pirate Roberts,” but claims he was not in control of the site for most of its lifespan.\n\nIn October of 2013, the U.S. authorities shut down Silk Road with the arrest of Ulbricht, and in June of 2015, Ulbricbht is given life in prison for multiple offenses while forfeiting US$183 million. The evolution of the site’s history, along with its founder, is chronicled in Alex Winter’s “Deep Web” documentary, released shortly after Ulbricht is sentenced in New York.\n\nBitPay Launches in May, 2011\n\nThe largest merchant services provider in Bitcoin history began in the spring of 2011, offering new services like the first smartphone wallet. BitPay signed many of Bitcoin’s largest partnerships, including WordPress, Newegg, and the St. Petersburg College Football Bowl, thus creating “The Bitcoin Bowl”. Of the over 100k merchants who use bitcoin, over 60,000 work with BitPay, worldwide.\n\nBitcoin “To the Moon” in late-2013\n\nBitcoin’s momentum builds in USD value over the first four years, but suddenly rises from US$125 in September of 2013 to over US$1,100 at the end of November, 2013. This is due to many factors, including the introduction of China exchanges and miners to the ecosystem, and the questionable price management and dealings of the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange at the time, Mt. Gox. Market capitalization value goes from US$1.5 Billion to US$13.5 Billion from October 1 to November 30, 2013, according to coinmarketcap.com\n\nMt. Gox & Bitcoin Price Collapse\n\nOpened under its original owner Jed McCaleb on July 17, 2010, word on the street of Mt. Gox’s instability, mismanagement of funds, and lack of security culminate in the collapse in February of 2014. Lack of consumer confidence in the exchange begins to erode the price from its peak in November. At the time of the collapse, over 850,000 bitcoins are reported by owner Mark Karpeles to have been stolen, attracting Japanese authorities to investigate. Karpeles is arrested in the summer of 2015 in relation to the findings of the investigation.\n\nThe largest exchange collapse in Bitcoin history attracts mainstream media news\n\nWorldwide, destroying bitcoin market confidence as the price plummets throughout 2014. The USD price reaches a 16-month low in January of 2015 before resuming its habitual upward movement once again. This is yet another example of the forecast of Bitcoin’s demise, only to be proven wrong over 100 times, to date.\n\nMicrosoft accepts Bitcoin\n\nIt was formally announced on December 11, 2014 that the world’s largest computer retailer, Microsoft, is accepting bitcoin as a form of payment, in association with BitPay, their payment processor.

The company has just reached its 2 million user mark last year and has since doubled the amount of clients it serves.\n\n“This is really exciting as it points to a positive trend in bitcoin adoption,” the bitcoin wallet company noted.\n\nBitcoin Wallet User Growth\n\nThe bitcoin industry has encountered more than a few roadblocks in the past year, starting from the continuous tumble in prices and the hacking incidents here and there. Nonetheless, these challenges have been unable to stop Blockchain.info from hitting its targets and expanding its user base.\n\nThere have been several competitors in the bitcoin wallet sector yet Blockchain.info has also managed to retain majority of the accounts opened and even outpace its rivals. Coinbase, which is another popular bitcoin wallet provider, currently has around 3.8 million users.\n\nApart from its bitcoin wallet service, Blockchain.info also provides a well-known blockchain explorer, as well as charts on various areas of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The company has been able to secure $3.8 million in funding in October last year and has been backed by top-tier investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Wicklow Capital, and Sir Richard Branson, helping it counter the slowdown in innovation and solve technical issues in the software.\n\nThe company was able to gain strong popularity after it was selected among several bitcoin companies to join UK Prime Minister David Cameron in a trade mission to Asia. Keep in mind that the UK government has been supportive of cryptocurrency developments, after issuing a call to information about digital currencies and garnering several responses from esteemed experts and large institutions.\n\nBlockchain.info continues to maintain the simplicity of its interface, which makes it easy for new entrants to the bitcoin industry to understand how the market works.

Contention at the time also revolved around the fact that the disgruntled bitcoin miners were requesting that their refunds be paid out in bitcoin.\n\nHashFast was granted Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June last year.

Or two. Why? Because like most of us, I’m confused about (and don’t yet trust) this digital currency.\n\nAt the same time, I think it is smart and will have a myriad of applications in the future.\n\nEnlarge Here are some common questions and answers about Bitcoin, a purely digital currency.\n\nHere are some common questions and answers about this purely digital currency.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and it was implemented as an open source code in January 2009. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks. Managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Nobody owns or controls bitcoin. Switzerland has the franc, Italy has lira, the U.S has dollars, and the “land of the Internet” has bitcoin.\n\nHow does one acquire bitcoins?\n\nIn order to acquire bitcoins, users must first create a “bitcoin wallet,” which is a long sequence of letters and numbers to store their personal bitcoins. To get more bitcoins, users can buy them on an open exchange, buy them from other people, or accept them for goods or services. If you are in the market for some bitcoins, visit bitcoin.org.\n\nWhat are the advantages of using bitcoin?\n\nThere are no processing fees associated with using bitcoin, and there is an immediacy that is attractive. Bitcoins can be transferred between any two people anywhere in the world, anonymously, with the speed of an email exchange.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of using bitcoin?\n\nThere are two main disadvantages: security and volatility. Bitcoin is not regulated by the government, which means there is absolutely no oversight and no protection against fraud. This is the main reason that bitcoin transactions have been associated with criminal activities. Additionally, bitcoin is not a stable currency. Unlike the dollar, bitcoin is not influenced by exports or imports, gross domestic product, or the stock exchange. It lacks the historical track record of other commodities (like gold) that can guide its valuation. The value of bitcoin fluctuates wildly based on a variety of factors including: number of bitcoin transactions, widespread acceptance, understanding of e-money and what the market seems willing to pay.\n\nSo, there is no regulation on bitcoin at all? Not really, but it is headed that way. According to Lloyds.com, to date, over 60 countries have officially issued some form of regulatory guidance or regulation related to bitcoin. And in the U.S., it is being pursued (so far) in three states. A legislative bill that would cover bitcoin and digital currency-related business activities has advanced in the North Carolina senate, New York state’s Department of Financial granted its first official business license for bitcoin exchange, itBit, in early May, and the New Jersey legislature is attempting to push through a bill that would regulate digital currencies and offer tax breaks for companies that exchange bitcoins. Stay tuned. Would I use/recommend bitcoin? I think bitcoin is worth watching. Do I use it in my personal life or in my business? No. Will I use it both personally and professionally in the future? Most likely. An Internet-based currency is a smart and sustainable idea, it just doesn’t have the proper regulations in place yet. Smaller businesses that deliver goods or services over the Internet to clients all over the world are currently getting pounded by credit card and PayPal processing fees. If a regulated bitcoin emerged, this would be the most effective currency for online transactions. If you are curious about it, try it in your personal life (Overstock.com, Reddit and others started accepting bitcoin in 2013). But I recommend you don’t make any professional decisions or currency acceptance changes just yet. Hold steady and let’s see what happens.

The law enforcement agency is investigating whether GAW violated securities law through the sales of its Hashlet mining products as well as the sales of the cryptocurrency paycoin.\n\nThe SEC is also investigating whether the company operated a Ponzi scheme.\n\nAccording to the filing, Carlos Garza – the brother of GAW CEO Josh Garza who was primarily involved in the sales of mining products and paycoin to investors – appeared to give testimony on 12th August but refused to answer questions.\n\nInvestigators want to question him, the filing states, because of his knowledge of the company\'s inner workings and the process by which it sold Hashlets and paycoins. Garza was sent an initial query letter on 30th July.\n\nThe filing notes:\n\n""The Commission subpoenaed Garza to testify on Wednesday, August 12, 2015. Garza appeared for testimony but refused to answer any questions. Garza also failed to produce any documents requested in the subpoena, including a document he had earlier represented that he would produce.""\n\nA court transcript shows that Garza told the SEC during testimony that he did not understand securities law and was afraid to respond to queries at the time without a lawyer present. Garza also refused to answer basic questions about himself, according to the text.\n\nThe SEC asked Judge Richard Stearns to require Garza to either show cause for why he can\'t comply with the subpoena, or provide the mandated testimony and provide ""all non-privileged documents in his possession, custody or control responsive to the Commission’s subpoena"" by 4th September.\n\nThe court granted the SEC its request on 17th August.\n\nGAW CEO Josh Garza did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDetails into investigation\n\nThe initial filing offers direct details of the agency\'s investigation into GAW Miners and its CEO Garza, which focuses on both issues related to Hashlets as well as paycoin. The company\'s mining service was scuttled earlier this year and at the time of press paycoin was trading at $0.025 cents.\n\nGAW is also embroiled in several civil legal challenges, including a dispute with a Mississippi electric utility that ended last week with a default judgment after the company failed to appear in court.\n\nOf note is the investigation\'s inquiry into whether GAW Miners\' mining service was a Ponzi scheme, as investigators are looking into whether the company sold ""far more Hashlets worth of computing power than the company actually had in its computing centers"".\n\nThe filing states:\n\n""In particular, the Commission is investigating whether GAW Miners may have sold far more computing power than it owned and dedicated to virtual currency mining, and therefore, whether the company may have owed investors a return that was larger than any actual return it was making on its mining operations.""\n\n""If GAW Miners did not have actual mining operations, that allowed it to earn the daily mining payout that it owed to Hashlet investors, then the payouts that investors received could only have been a gradual repayment over time, as \'returns,\' the money that they and others had invested,"" the filing continues. ""As a result, some investors’ funds may have been used to make payments to other investors.""\n\nThe SEC is understood to be one of several US agencies investigating GAW.

One global bank CIO is championing the technology as a key innovation that could be as disruptive as the Internet was 20 years ago. Now he’s exhorting other financial institutions to follow suit.\n\nOliver Bussmann, CIO of Switzerland’s UBS: \'Blockchain, as the digital ledger, will heavily impact the way we do business in the financial services industry.\'\n\nOliver Bussmann, CIO of Switzerland’s UBS, says that Bitcoin\'s blockchain technology, a decentralized digital ledger that verifies transactions between parties, can process trades, bonds and others in record time, ultimately improving the client experience. That untapped potential is a big reason why UBS is building innovation labs to test cryptocurrencies, among other digital technologies, for future use at UBS.\n\n""Blockchain, as the digital ledger, will heavily impact the way we do business in the financial services industry,"" Bussmann told CIO.com. He expects a trusted blockchain solution could emerge as soon as the middle of 2016.\n\nBlockchain makes cryptocurrency legit for financial services\n\nBitcoin and its ilk have been shunned by banking executives because they lack the backing of a centralized bank and have been used to conduct illegal transactions, such as buying and selling drugs and weapons online. Yet banks such as UBS, Bank of New York Mellon and the Bank of England have warmed to cryptocurrencies as renowned technology experts have championed the blockchain for its potential to shake up the financial services sector.\n\n[ Related: Will Bitcoin become a legitimate currency for large companies? ]\n\nEntrepreneur-turned-venture-capitalist Marc Andreessen, who cemented his status as a digital disruptor by co-creating the early Mosaic Web browser, called Bitcoin a ""fundamental breakthrough in computer science"" because the blockchain helps establish trust between unrelated parties over the Internet.\n\nBussmann agrees. Banks have over the last two decades reduced settlement of stocks, bonds and other assets, which involves communications and vetting from multiple parties, from five to two days. That time lag between transaction and settlement time courts financial risk, Bussmann says. For example, someone who has purchased a stock for $100 could see its value fall to $90 by the time the settlement clears a few days later (due to a profit warning or some other negative news that causes traders to turn bearish on the stock), costing the buyer $10 in value depreciation. But financial services firms using a blockchain to facilitate trades could complete transactions in record time, because the technology serves as an unimpeachable authority that doesn’t require vetting between multiple parties. With blockchain, the $100 stock trade would close at $100 and the buyer wouldn’t lose money.\n\n""The ability to do those changes within minutes or seconds instead of waiting two days for an execution… is a big change,” he says. “If you can’t trade an asset for two days, and now you can do that, that minimizes your exposure in the marketplace. I would not underestimate that.”\n\n[Related: \'Dark\' Coins Rising]\n\nDespite Bussmann’s bullishness on blockchain, the technology remains in its infancy, as the financial services industry is just beginning to explore the blockchain\'s potential. BNY Mellon, for example, says it is testing blockchain internally to see whether it can be used to motivate workers to complete tasks. To cultivate the industry\'s interest in the technology, Bussmann says UBS has launched innovation labs in London, Zurich and Singapore, where startups are attempting to build a blockchain solution that is secure, scalable, efficient and trustworthy. The company last week also announced ""Future of Finance Competition,"" which includes a series of “immersion workshops” designed to encourage startups to develop their ideas for blockchain or other technologies that can advance global banking.\n\nHis efforts to develop the mass-market blockchain have received the support of CEO Sergio Ermotti and the company’s board of directors. “Sponsorship from the CEO is very important because it opens a lot of doors,” he says. “We spent a long time with the executive board talking about the blockchain last year.”\n\nBlockchain needs industry collaboration to drive transactions\n\nSponsorship by the CEO and board are all well in good, but the bank will have work with other banks and financial services entities to settle on a proper solution. ""The banking industry, together with entrepreneurs and other institutions like stock exchanges and clearing houses will have to find a way to identify a good solution,"" he says. ""You need counterparties to see if it\'s working."" If someone establishes that, financial transaction volume swill shift toward the blockchain, he says.\n\nWhile Bussmann\'s enthusiasm for the blockchain is clear, the work was possible only after he showed progress in two other key areas since he joined UBS in 2013 from German software giant SAP, which under his tech leadership was among the first high-tech companies to roll out iPads for corporate use. He had to improve operational excellence by simplifying the bank\'s infrastructure, reducing reliance on servers and some applications. He also invested in transforming the business, including building mobile applications and improving online business processes for bank employees and customers. He says he’s had to ""earn the right to spend time on innovation.""\n\n""As an IT leader you have to prove that you have your house in order and that you have the foundation in place and that track record of delivery,"" he says.', ""Chip Chap, the “e-money converter” app, released a new version that supports worldwide bitcoin purchases via credit card.\n\nThe beta app allows users to purchase bitcoin using the 3-D Secure protocol for Visa and MasterCard credit card transactions.

However, that didn’t stop this woman from funding her female-focused educational project in Afghanistan. Instead of fiat currency and traditional remittance services, she used Bitcoin and became an example that inspired Nicolas Cary, co-founder of Blockchain.info.\n\nThis was just another obstacle that Fereshteh Forough had to overcome. Her family was forced to leave Afghanistan, a country massacred by years of conflicts and violence, before Fereshteh was born. They moved to Iran, but then returned to their motherland after the collapse of the Taliban regime in 2002.\n\nThe journey back left Fereshteh in shock. “On the way home, from the Iran border to Herat the road was unpaved and very difficult to drive on. We got close to the city when it was getting dark. I could barely see any lights. Instead, old lanterns hung outside of shops and only a few places had electricity for the night,” she wrote back in March in an article published by the Digital Currency Council.\n\n[tweet_box design=”default”]Cryptocurrency is an equalizer, much like the early days of the Internet.[/tweet_box]\n\nA few years later, she enrolled at Herat University in Afghanistan, earning a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Then she moved to Germany to get a master’s degree in Information Technology at the Technical University of Berlin. After all this, she realized Afghanistan was different.\n\n“That old bumpy unpaved road that I traveled on from Iran to Herat when I was a teenager became totally paved and secure. People could travel a few hours to get to the border. Colorful light bulbs were outside of every shop. More importantly, the Internet was now in my home and on my phone.”\n\nKnowledge is empowering\n\nStill, the country wasn’t as evolved as Fereshteh would like and she particularly felt the challenges of being a woman working in technology. It was hard to find a job, become a teacher, move to a new city to look for better opportunities or start her own business in a place where 85 percent of women have no formal education and are illiterate.\n\n“Based on my own experiences of seeing this need to create an environment where Afghan women can succeed in technology, I founded Code To Inspire,” a Herat-based not-for-profit organization that teaches Afghan women how to code. Fereshteh wanted to set up a programing lab and develop an educational program that not only helped women become digitally literate, but also taught them how to become successful online freelancers. The plan was brilliant in theory, but Fereshteh had to find a smart way to make it work.\n\nObviously, funds are necessary when setting up a not-for-profit organization. And although people and institutions are willing to help and donate, it’s the organization’s responsibility to manage and move the money. But because Fereshteh was born in Iran as a refugee, she didn’t have a proof of existence. And we all know that no traditional money transfer service will help you without identification.\n\nAt one point, Fereshteh needed to move funding to the volunteers that were trying to help her set up Code To Inspire, but most companies refused to work with her or charged up to 50 percent in fees to move the organization’s money.\n\nSo she turned to Bitcoin. The result was a hassle-free transaction process that changed the way this organization works. The money was received by the volunteers and all the information regarding the transactions was saved by the blockchain.\n\n“I was the co founder of Digital Citizen Fund (former Women’s Annex Foundation). We were using the Bitlanders (former Film Annex) platform to reward our content providers from Afghanistan for their blogging activities. We used to pay them in US dollars, but we faced many challenges when sending money to Afghanistan,” Fereshteh told 99Bitcoins.\n\n“The majority of our users were girls in high schools, so they weren’t old enough to have a bank account. Also, other Afghan users who were eligible to have a bank account just didn’t have it, as the majority of transactions in Afghanistan are cash-based. PayPal is not supported in Afghanistan. Using Western Union was not convenient for us and for the people who were getting paid due to the high fees. Using wire transactions also was time-consuming and costly. Therefore we used to send a bucket of money to my friend in Afghanistan and she payed each worker in cash. But due to safety reasons, we started to think about another payment alternative. On February 2014 we discovered Bitcoin. Later on we decided to send Bitcoin to our users in Afghanistan, which were mainly female students.”\n\n“She really did inspire something incredible. (…) She moved her entire operation into Bitcoin,” Nicolas Cary said recently during a TEDX talk in London. “I think about it [Bitcoin] as an invitation to participate in a more equal world, as the most inclusive way for us to participate together in a new type of financial order.”\n\nFereshteh definitely agrees. Besides teaching her students about coding, she also shares knowledge about digital currencies like Bitcoin. “We believe cryptocurrencies are an amazing and empowering tool for people who are living in societies that are mainly unbanked and can be used to make women and girls financial independent,” she wrote back in March 2015.\n\nCryptocurrency is “an educational and empowering tool”\n\nTalking to 99Bitcoins, she confirmed her views on cryptocurrency. “I think having a technology that enables people to interact with each other without a mediator is great. It’s not only time-saving, but we also get to save a huge amount of money that would otherwise have to be wasted on fees. Besides, Bitcoin’s bockchain keeps the public record of all the transactions on the network and this creates transparency and can prevent corruption by any companies that try to manipulate their record keeping.”\n\nAnd Fereshteh is not the only one backing digital money. Her students also support the use of Bitcoin. She believes using cryptocurrency is not only about accessing financial freedom. According to the digital expert, BTC “is definitely an educational and empowering tool for people in underdeveloped countries like Afghanistan and specifically for women who have been struggling to be included in global economy and to be financially independent.”\n\n“It really helps everyone, but definitely helps girls whom due to safety, security, traditional and cultural reason have been holding back. One of our main goals at the foundation I recently founded, Code to Inspire, is helping Afghan women find jobs online and helping them get paid online. Therefore, they don’t have to be concerned about going to a physical location to do their jobs. They can make money by being online. I think cryptocurrency is one of the suitable options for them considering the challenges they have in Afghanistan.”\n\nFereshteh and Code To Inspire are currently raising funds to support the project on Indiegogo, while also accepting donations via the project’s website. The well-known Bitcoin company and transaction processing platform BitFury is one of the foundation’s main donors.\n\nBitFury’s CEO Valery Vavilov is a true believer in Fereshteh’s work. “The technology industry is highly innovative and global. In order to continue this progress and evolution, diversity of experiences, expertise and opinions is vital. We need to encourage all participants and contributors of the tech community. BitFury is happy to help and give smart and determined young women who code to inspire the opportunity to pursue their dreams,” Vavilov told 99Bitcoins.\n\nCode To Inspire and the work of people like Fereshteh confirm something we already knew: that technology can be used to change lives. And Bitcoin is included in this new batch of revolutionary solutions. Cryptocurrency is an equalizer, much like the early days of the Internet, Fereshteh says. “People were hesitating to use it because they didn’t have enough knowledge about it. Adoption will take time. It depends on where you live and if the infrastructure of your country is ready. I think Afghanistan will definitely need more effort, resources and time to fully implement cryptocurrency,” she recognizes.\n\nStill, Fereshteh hopes there is a day when “everyone around the world has the equal opportunity to be part of the global economy without considering geographical barriers, either with cryptocurrency or other similar technology.”']"
08/19/2015,"['Mike Hearn is one of the primary engineers behind bitcoin, the digital currency that aims to remake our financial system. Or at least he used to be. Over the weekend, Hearn told the world that he and a group of other coders were forking the bitcoin project, creating an alternate version of the software that underpins the digital currency.\n\n“I feel sad that it’s come to this, but there is no other way,” Hearn wrote in an email to others working on the project. “The Bitcoin Core project has drifted so far from the principles myself and many others feel are important that a fork is the only way to fix things.”\n\nBitcoin, you see, runs on open source software, software that’s freely available to the world at large, software that anyone can not only use but change. A fork is the ultimate change, where someone makes a copy of the code and creates an entirely separate version of the project. This is quite common in the world of open source software—a world that now drives so much of the technology we use every day. Open source code is built on consensus, and sometimes, if coders feel a consensus can’t be reached, they fork.\n\nThe dispute could ultimately decide whether bitcoin succeeds or fails—especially if the project remains permanently split.\n\nHearn’s fork could significantly change the direction of bitcoin. Known as Bitcoin XT, the fork is backed by another notable bitcoin engineer, Gavin Andresen, previously lead maintainer of the bitcoin project, and basically, it aims to modify the bitcoin software so that it can rapidly handle a much larger number of online transactions. This could be essential as bitcoin expands to an ever larger number of people and organizations—and as its underlying tech moves into stock trading and other financial markets. But other coders on the original bitcoin project, a.k.a. Bitcoin Core, believe there are better ways of accommodating more transactions. The dispute may ultimately decide whether the project succeeds or fails—especially if all this ends with no real consensus and the bitcoin project remains permanently split, the sum of the parts not quite as powerful as the whole.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin XT provides an unusually clear window onto the world of open source, an extreme example that demonstrates why, despite or even because of the current strife, this idea is so effective—why it’s so quickly changing the way our world works. Bitcoin XT exposes the extremely social—extremely democratic—underpinnings of the open source idea, an approach that makes open source so much more powerful than technology controlled by any one person or organization.\n\nThe Power of Consensus\n\nA fork may seem like a divisive thing. And, at times, it is. But it can also provide a way of building consensus, a way of forcing the broader community to get behind one idea or another. Ultimately, that’s what open source is all about: building things with as many minds as possible. Yes, that old saw so often holds true. “Two minds are better one.” But that’s not all. If more people are building and using a project, it evolves faster. It’s capable of more. A bitcoin used by many people is more powerful than a bitcoin used by few.\n\nSure, some people fork a project just because they want to tinker with the code or create something entirely new. But it’s also a way of resolving disputes within an existing community of coders. The majority may stay with the original project. It may move to the fork. Or it might force the two projects to resolve their differences and recombine. The fork forces an implicit vote on the ideas at hand. Witness io.js, a fork of the popular node.js project. It brought detente to a community split by disagreement.\n\n“A fork can be a market mechanism,” says Jim Zemlin, the director of the Linux Foundation, the not-for-profit that oversees the Linux open source operating system and many other important open source projects. “It’s a forcing function to reach consensus.” Bitcoin XT is a prime example—though it goes even further than the norm.\n\nThe difference is that bitcoin isn’t just a piece of software code. It’s a piece of software code that runs a worldwide network of otherwise independent machines. Working in concert, these machines drive the bitcoin digital currency. They provide a way of storing money, sending it, and receiving it. So, in forking the core bitcoin code, Hearn and Andresen are also moving to fork the bitcoin network. And that’s where things get interesting.\n\nBasically, Hearn and Andresen want to increase the size of the “blocks” that identify transactions on the network. Right now, the blocks are one megabyte in size; they want to raise this to eight megabytes. If you increase the block size, you can increase the number of transactions the network can process each second. Some think there are better options than raising the block size—“many people think this path is fraught with too many security vulnerabilities,” says longtime bitcoin coder Eric Lombrozo—but Hearn and Andresen disagree.\n\nBut they haven’t increased the block size just yet. They’ve said they will implement the increase only if 75 percent of the machines on the network adopt their fork. They haven’t just arranged for an implicit vote. They’ve established a very direct referendum. It’s open source in the extreme.\n\nThe Genius of the Blockchain\n\nThe particulars of this dispute may seem trivial. But the nature of bitcoin also ensures that those involved in the project will take all this deeply seriously. After all, money is at stake: the machines on the network store and even generate money. If the 75 percent majority is reached, the other 25 percent may even have good reason to adopt the change too. Otherwise, the value of their money—and their infrastructure—will change.\n\n“In that way, it’s quite different from other projects because there’s that common economic interest,” says Angel Leon, a developer who works on the bitcoin software. “The genius of the blockchain consensus doesn’t just protect the blockchain from malicious attacks. It also ensures a democratic process in the evolution of the protocol.”\n\nCertainly, the majority may choose the wrong path. They may choose the option that brings the system crashing down. The crowds aren’t always wise. “If the community is sharply and bitterly divided it could spell disaster if something does go wrong and people refuse to cooperate out of spite,” Lombrozo says. But in the world of open source, the democratic majority is often guided by individuals—individuals with more talent and skill and wherewithal than the rest.\n\nThe Linux operating system—the granddaddy of open source software, the code that runs everything from Google to Facebook to Twitter—is very much a democracy. But the project is still led by its creator, Linus Torvalds. People tend to follow what he says. He has the track record. “This is a social activity,” says one senior advisor to the Linux Foundation. “Everyone agrees that they can trust Linus.” In the bitcoin world, there are other leaders.\n\nThe Absent Leader\n\nMany people will put their trust in Hearn and Andresen. Hearn is an ex-Googler with a long history on the project. Andresen is one of the earliest bitcoin coders. He served as lead maintainer for a time. And he’s still bitcoin’s official chief scientist, according to the Bitcoin Foundation, the not-for-profit that oversees the project, at least on some level. But the community will also look to another: Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of the project.\n\nBoth sides say that they are acting in the true spirit of the project, that they are doing what Satoshi would have done.\n\nThe trouble is that no one knows who Satoshi is. And he has disappeared from the project. Certainly, his presence is still felt. His original bitcoin proposal remains. But he can’t say what he really wants.\n\nAt the moment, both sides of the argument say that they are acting in the true spirit of the project, that they are doing what Satoshi would have done. “Satoshi was very clear about what he wanted. My article quotes him to prove this,” Hearn tells WIRED. Meanwhile, someone pretending to be Satoshi has popped up to say the opposite. “The developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth,” he wrote in an online post.\n\nIn a way, this faux Satoshi nicely demonstrates the open source idea. Leaders can guide the people. But ultimately, it’s the people who decide. Separate from what any one individual does or says, the majority will rule. That’s the power of open source. As the faux Satoshi put it: “Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto. Nearly everyone has to agree on a change.”', 'One thousand bitcoin ATMs are to be installed in Greece to help firms overcome the restrictions imposed by capital controls, according to reports.\n\n\n\nThe CoinTelegraph website reported that Bitcoin service provider and exchange Cubits has partnered with Greek bitcoin exchange BTCGreece to install the units to help small and medium sized businesses move money.\n\n\n\n“We are creating the ecosystem of bitcoin and blockchain solutions in the Greek market.” Thanos Marinos, the found of the only Greece-based bitcoin exchange BTCGreece, told CoinTelegraph. “That will include the rollout of 1,000 ATMs and solutions for the e-commerce and tourism industry.”\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of July, Marinos told Reuters that New customers depositing at least 50 euros with BTCGreece rose by 400 percent to ""a few thousand"" between May and June.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is a web-based digital currency invented six years ago that floats freely and is not backed by a government or central bank. Its value has been highly volatile.', 'NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Bitcoin may be a more attractive investment vehicle than you think.\n\nTraditionally, most people have approached bitcoin as a digital currency. Although that is one of its principal uses -- and arguably the most mainstream -- it is far from its only application.\n\nDespite its speculative nature, bitcoin is emerging as a viable alternative asset class for institutional and retail investors alike. It has an enormous amount of investment potential and is unlike any investment product in the world today.\n\nOn the fence on bitcoin? Here are three arguments that may push you to the investing side.\n\nGame-Changing Technology\n\nInvesting in bitcoins offers exposure to a global technology used by thousands of companies across dozens of sectors worldwide, and the ecosystem is only growing.\n\nAt the heart of bitcoin is the blockchain, a technology that renders bitcoin a truly innovative product. The blockchain is a trustless, decentralized, public ledger of all transactions in the network whereby any transaction is verified within 10 minutes. Compare this to the lengthy verification times of credit card transactions or domestic and international wires. Further, the blockchain stands as immediate, incontestable proof of all transactions and creates a permanent, immutable database.\n\nBlockchain\'s applications have the potential to stretch far beyond bitcoin, and companies and individuals are already leveraging the technology to modernize key products and services across a variety of industries. Remittances, payment processing, personal banking, auditing, secure data transmission, information hashing, securities settlement/clearing and traditional financial trading are just a handful of examples of its possible applications.\n\nSome of the largest financial institutions in the world have already taken note.\n\nIn April, UBS (UBS) announced plans to launch a technology lab in London to explore the potential uses of blockchain technology in financial services. Citigroup (C) is said to be testing three blockchains and a cryptocurrency called ""Citicoin.""\n\nSpain\'s Santander (SAN) coauthored a report this year that estimated the technology could reduce banks\' infrastructure costs by $15 billion to $20 billion per year by 2022. Both Barclays (BCS) and Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ) are reportedly experimenting with it as well.', 'UPDATE (20th August 17:56 BST): Comment added from Zane Tackett, BitFinex\'s director of community and product development.\n\nBitcoin\'s price fell 14% in a period of just 30 minutes following a \'flash crash\' on exchange Bitfinex yesterday night.\n\nThe CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index had been holding steady between $250 and $255, but dropped to a low of $214.36 just before midnight (UTC). In the same period, the Bitfinex price sunk 29% to $179.35.\n\nBitfinex, which claims to be the most liquid exchange in the world, told CoinDesk the \'flash crash\' was triggered when several leveraged positions were forcibly closed in close proximity to each other, adding:\n\n""The surprisingly small amount of liquidity on the book below $225 made it possible for the market to spike lower before recovering to prevailing prices on other exchanges.""\n\nAlongside a regular buy/sell orderbook, Bitfinex offers margin trading, meaning users can borrow funds from the platform\'s lenders – known as \'peer liquidity providers\' – at a rate of interest to trade bitcoin. These users place \'long\' or \'short\' bets on whether bitcoin\'s price will rise or fall.\n\nWhen the price shifts suddenly, as it did yesterday, \'long\' users who have borrowed funds may see their account equity drop to zero – at which point Bitfinex will automatically liquidate their positions.\n\nThis can exacerbate price movement, as these positions add to sell-side pressure on an already crashing market.\n\nCircuit breakers\n\nThere are ways to mitigate against such drastic movements – some traditional exchanges put a 10% limit on price movements from the previous day\'s close for example.\n\nZane Tackett, BitFinex\'s director of community and product development, told CoinDesk the exchange does have such \'circuit breakers\' in place for orders that will move the market beyond a certain percentage, however they were not triggered as it wasn\'t any singular order that caused the \'flash crash\'.\n\nHe said:\n\n""We are still examining the conditions surrounding the price action to ferret out any deliberate price manipulation, but so far we see nothing more than supply exceeding demand and, of course, areas for improvement in our price stability mechanisms.""\n\nIn an interview with members of the \'Whale Club\', Bitfinex\'s Phil Potter indicated the platform had experienced a number of technical difficulties, including a lag in its live engine that updates positions.\n\nMargin trading\n\nWhile a familiar part of most markets, margin trading is a relatively recent phenomenon in bitcoin, with two exchanges adding it in the last two months alone.\n\nTimo Schlaefer, CEO of derivatives trading platform Crypto Facilities, told CoinDesk margin trading on spot exchanges destabilises the price and has lead to ""numerous"" flash crashes over the years. Last August, instances on Bitfinex and BTC-e were blamed for a 10% price decline.\n\n""You need to make a decision if you want to be a robust spot exchange (ie no margin trading) or something else, but you cannot be both,"" he said, adding:\n\n""This is bad for bitcoin as it shows that the market is still immature and unreliable and there seems to have been little progress in that regard over the last year or so.""\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees. A bitcoin market maker who wished to remain anonymous said flash crashes are not unique to markets with margin trading.\n\n""You can do margin trading without it actually being offered by the platform itself, nothing prevents you going and borrowing money to fuel a gambling habit.""\n\nHe claimed the ""gambling mentality"" in the bitcoin space, with traders happy to put a lot of money on the line with lot of leverage, exacerbated price moves. Meanwhile, the current uncertainty and ""public bickering"" over the Bitcoin XT fork is bound to affect the price negatively, he added.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Bitcoin XT: What Is It and Why Was It Released?\n\nBitcoin was built on the sort of open-source ethos that has driven generations of geeks. But the same principles it celebrates—a decentralized network of contributors, a transparent code base—are allowing competitors to flourish. The bitcoin faithful aren’t so sure that’s a good thing. Anthem Vault\'s Anthem Blanchard, Forrester\'s James McQuivey, and Bloomberg\'s Olga Kharif speak on ""Bloomberg West."" (Source: Bloomberg)', ""William Mougayar is a Toronto-based angel investor and four-time entrepreneur who advises startups on strategy and marketing. In the first of this three-part series, he discussed how banks dealt with the emergence of the Internet and how blockchain technology is causing these institutions a whole new headache. In part two, Mougayar looked at why banks should start embracing blockchain technology. Here, in part three, he explores the steps banks should take to make sure they lead the blockchain-banking revolution.\n\nWhat should banks do?\n\nDon’t just do pilots that automate old processes. Rather, launch major reengineering efforts across all processes and ask the important question: What could Crypto-Tech enable now if we reinvented it?\n\nHere is a list of potential actions:\n\n1. Hire or promote a leader\n\nHire or promote a real leader from within, and give them the title of “Blockchain Czar”. That person should have experience in banking operations and know about reengineering business processes via technology implementations. Tough to find that person? Find them. Let them be your spokesperson in the marketplace, not an analyst in your research department or someone in charge of innovation.\n\nThat person will be responsible for removing obstacles within your organization, education, best practices, and project managing the various implementations. This job is a tough one, but it involves finding and obliterating old processes, instead of blindly automating what you are currently doing.\n\n2. Mine cryptocurrency\n\nHow about getting your feet wet with some mining action? Buy a few extra computers and mine bitcoin or other currencies so you can learn what it’s like be in the cryptocurrency waters. Here’s why Banks and Brokerages Should be Mining the Blockchain.\n\n3. Train staff\n\nSend the top 10% of your IT staff to courses on cryptocurrency platforms, tools and technology. Let them learn the bitcoin blockchain and its various overlay technologies, Ethereum’s contract languages, and many other ready-to-use crypto technologies.\n\n4. Don't invest\n\nDon’t invest in blockchain startups. Become one (if you can). Investing is not a spectator’s sport. You need to get involved, and not just watch. If an investment allows you to participate in the actual outcome of the technology solution, that’s one thing. But if your investment is so-called for learning purposes, you’re wasting that money.\n\nInvest in direct learning and by doing stuff, and not by watching others. Operating like a technology startup is very different from operating inside a bank. Yes it is about culture, and a bank doesn’t have a startup culture, nor does the word innovation mean the same thing to a nimble startup that is hungry and ambitious, as compared to what it means to an overhead-laden bank.\n\n5. Buy a bitcoin exchange\n\nImmediately. The good thing about the proliferation of bitcoin exchanges around the world, (and there are at least 50 viable ones) is that there is one for each large bank out there. The merging of bitcoin trading inside banks is inevitable. Most of these exchanges have already developed the basic technology, but the biggest pain has been how new users fund and connect their wallets with their banking accounts.\n\nIf you merge online banking with bitcoin trading, you automatically eliminate the friction that currently exists for onboarding new users. OK, you’re afraid, I can tell. So, why not limit bitcoin conversions to $1,000 or something like that. Bitcoin to fiat conversions should be real-time.\n\nYou know how to handle customer relationships. The bitcoin exchanges have technical capabilities, but their CRM and customer support are not great. One of the big banks will blink first and buy one of the fledgling bitcoin exchanges and delight their existing customers. Why not you?\n\n6. Re-invent trading and capital markets\n\nRemove the delays and intermediaries. Delays means more costs. Real-time levels off inefficiencies. Remove the steps that are not need during the settlement and clearing stages.\n\n7. Offer remittance services\n\nOffer free (or really cheap) cross-border remittances services. Abolish wire transfer fees. That’s a tough one, and I’m sure you’re not going to do it. But if you used the bitcoin network instead of SWIFT, I can guarantee your transfer costs will decrease by orders of magnitude.\n\n8. Create a cryptocurrency task force\n\nYou like task forces and committees. Create an internal cryptocurrency task force with members from each functional group, and let them have weekly meetings to share initiatives, projects, and learnings. Even better, get them all on a Slack group and invite anyone in the bank to participate in it.\n\nA strategic roadmap\n\nMost banking executives probably don’t even have a bitcoin account, nor have used a bitcoin wallet; yet they are in charge of their organization’s future when the future is staring them in the face with the word “blockchain” in it. This isn’t unlike the early Internet and email days, when corporate executives were laggard users and had their secretary print their email for them.\n\nIt is so important to get a first hand feel with a bitcoin account in order to experience the flexibility, speed and innovations that are built-in. For example, you can send money to anyone in the world by just knowing their email address or bitcoin address, without a banking relationship, and without going anywhere physical. That’s pretty awesome in itself. You can convert from fiat to bitcoin and vice-versa, including wiring money to a fiat account for free.\n\nIt is absolute freedom in terms of money movements, and it happens almost instantly and at the peer-to-peer level. Granted you can’t pay bills, and can’t easily use bitcoin at the cash register, but these aren’t show stoppers for now.\n\nWhen every asset has a blockchain linkage, it puts it at par with bits that travel at Internet speeds. And that comes with a built-in trust layer that transports the transaction’s history and validation with itself. That’s a powerful capability (also called smart property), and it will free financial assets and instruments from the latency and inertia of legacy clearing and settlement processes and usher in efficiencies, speeds and innovations.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s about financial services, not the blockchain. The blockchain is just an enabler.\n\nIf you can disrupt your business successfully, then you can also disrupt your competitors, but if you just focus on protecting your business, you’re really living in the status quo. Internal disruption is always more benign than an external one, especially if it is done pro-actively and on your own terms. It’s better to shoot yourself in the foot, rather than having someone else shoot you in the head.\n\nBut the road to disruption is paved with some casualties. Because the blockchain is a value disruptor, it will change the role of existing intermediaries. Some will get replaced, others will see their powers, influence and usage diminished. In the trading space, some of the current intermediaries at risk include SWIFT, CCP, FIX and the DTCC.\n\nThe first blinker\n\nSo, who will blink first? That first blink means buying a bitcoin exchange and totally incorporating its wallet into online banking. I know some libertarians will say that’s not what bitcoin was about. Bitcoin is about freedom to be your own bank. They are right, and with the passage of time and further sophistication, that might be possible. But in the meantime, you are the Bank, and you have a chance to keep that customer relationship going.\n\nThis revolution isn’t happening at Money 20/20, Finovate or Sibos. It’s happening elsewhere. It’s happening at the grass root levels in meetups, in stealth startups, accelerators and Github repositories.\n\n“The blockchain is not perfect, but it is that perfect catalyst for business process changes, and this type of opportunity doesn’t present itself that often.”\n\nAnd user-initiated blockchain apps are coming. They will look like SaaS apps that users can launch without anyone’s permission. Wow, that’s a lot of change. If you’re a banking executive, maybe I’ve got more of your attention, now.\n\nThe banks have an opportunity to re-engineer themselves. They missed doing that when the Internet came along. It’s not about bitcoin. It’s about exposing openness, decentralization, and speed. Consumers and business users want that.\n\nThe meaning of trust and transactions changes with the blockchain. Every centralized and manual process is up for grabs due to what the blockchain enables: self-enforcement of trust and smarter transactions with longer end-points.\n\nThe blockchain has a diverse stack, and I hope that a bank can touch it at many levels.\n\nBitcoin isn’t easy to use, blockchains are difficult to program, most merchants aren’t accepting cryptocurrency, and it does sound risky to rely on computers and mathematics to govern a currency, but so what?\n\nIf you don’t take bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrency seriously, I can predict that bitcoin will be to banks what the iPhone was to BlackBerry. Yes, it was not perfect when it came out, and didn’t have a keyboard, didn’t have apps, and wasn’t “secure” for corporates, but so what?\n\nThe blockchain is not perfect, but it is that perfect catalyst for business process changes, and this type of opportunity doesn’t present itself that often. The last time it came was with the Internet. Let’s hope the banks see this as a big opportunity for change, not just a small one.\n\nThe possibilities that are enabled by the blockchain have a transformational impact, once you put them together.\n\nYou can go slow and be left behind, or you can go deep and leapfrog. It is a case of experimentation, but also of determination.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Startup Management, an edited version has been reposted here with permission.\n\nRoadmap and bitcoin images via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Previously, CoinTerra, Butterfly Labs, and HashFast have also faced similar legal battles.\n\nThe SEC alleges millions of dollars in possible fraudulent sales by GAW Miners—the case could also expand to criminal charges.\n\nCarlos Garza, the brother of Josh Garza, the founder and CEO of GAW Miners, appeared before SEC lawyers in Boston last week for 90 minutes of questioning. During that period, Carlos Garza, a former GAW Miners salesman, not only refused to answer almost every question, but he provided the same answer, nearly verbatim each time:\n\nI’m very scared. I don't understand, these type of questions, this type of law at all. I want to help, but l'd have to have an attorney present. I can’t afford one at this time, but if I were to get appointed counsel, or retain counsel, then I’d absolutely come back and help.\n\nNow, Garza must either invoke some reason why he should not respond to the subpoena, such as invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, or answer their questions. Garza seemingly willfully ignored the questions by Kathleen Shields, an SEC lawyer, including the notification that the SEC does not provide counsel, nor does the government do so in civil matters.\n\nIn January 2015, Ars reported on the opening of the SEC investigation into Josh Garza and GAW Miners.\n\nIn early 2014, GAW Miners was first introduced to the Bitcoin public and first came about re-selling Bitcoin mining rigs. Later, the company shifted to cloud-based mining (Hashlets), and in early 2015, introduced its own altcoin, dubbed “Paycoin.” GAW also tried its hand at its own cloud-based wallet service (Paybase), and its own online discussion board (HashTalk).\n\nFor several months, there has been active speculation amongst the Bitcoin community that GAW may be a scam, or at least could be engaged in illegal behavior. There have been threads both on BitcoinTalk and reddit with titles like “GAW Miners - Liars, Frauds - A brief recap of what we know.”\n\nThe SEC notes in other court filings that GAW Miners took in $10 million from the sales of Hashlets alone.\n\nIn a statement, the SEC wrote:\n\n…[the SEC] is investigating whether GAW Miners, LLC, and various individuals and entities acting in association with it, have violated the anti-fraud or other provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with GAW Miners' sale of shares in the profits to be derived from its purported bitcoin mining operations and its sales of rights relating to a new type of virtual currency that it created. The SEC's application alleges that Garza was a salesman for GAW Miners, and was knowledgeable about GAW Miners' potential misrepresentations to individuals who purchased shares in GAW Miners' alleged mining operations, and rights in its new virtual currency. The SEC also alleges that Garza has knowledge that may be relevant to locating the bitcoin and other virtual currency that GAW Miners received as payment.\n\nNeither of the Garza brothers responded to Ars’ request for comment.\n\nJoe Mordica, the company’s former chief technology officer, who left the company in January 2015, declined to comment."", 'The Commonwealth Virtual Currencies Working Group will meet for the first time next week to discuss the management of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin.\n\nThe specialist group, formed by the Commonwealth – a voluntary association of 53 independent countries, almost all of which were formerly under British rule – is made up of members from the Commonwealth Secretariat, Australia, Barbados, Kenya, Nigeria, Singapore, Tonga and the UK.\n\nAlong with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, intergovernmental organisation Interpol and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), members at the event held in London will explore the risks associated with virtual currencies, the existing legal frameworks, regulatory responses and potential benefits of use in developing countries.\n\nA spokesperson for the Commonwealth Secretariat commented on the purpose of the meeting, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""Recognising both the associated benefits and risks, the group will meet to design technical guidance for member states on potential regulatory and legislative measures to effectively respond to virtual currencies.""\n\nShe continued: ""The meeting will also be an opportunity to hear from a range of experts about the latest developments in the sector.

The answer … head up news items with interesting people saying interesting things on camera. Keep it simple, but keep it interesting.\n\nInteresting people with interesting things to say makes good television!\n\nThe Worldwide Television Revolution is arising from the worldwide availability of smart phones, ultra-bandwidth connections to the Internet at rapidly decreasing cost and streaming technology that is faster, better and cheaper than anything that has preceded it.\n\nToday, it is possible to own and operate a worldwide television station that can compete with major broadcasting news networks for a tiny fraction of the cost of old over-the-air broadcasting stations. Additionally, a worldwide television station located in the US, where freedom of speech is guaranteed and protected, can conduct interviews and broadcast in any part of the world via the Internet, even where the press is controlled and restricted by local governments.\n\nTraditional local market television stations today are capitalized in the millions of dollars, even hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Company buys and sells precious metals on its own account. The Company holds precious metals in custody for buyers that purchase this service, opening a digital wallet for the Customer and issuing a digital proof of custody that can be linked to the Customer’s wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. The buyers can then trade or exchange its precious metals holdings at the Company by any means it could trade or exchange bitcoin, via the rails of the blockchain ledger.\n\nWhile not all digital currency companies are classified as money transmitters, those that do should ensure compliance to avoid penalties and fees. FinCEN’s ruling primarily addresses the circumstances of one company, but FinCEN does not publish these rulings often, the last prior publication was on October 27 of last year.\n\n“the facts and circumstances, issues, and analyses that appear in an administrative letter ruling are of general interest to financial institutions then the letter ruling is published on our website,” FinCEN states in its documentation.\n\n- FinCEN\n\nThe definition of a money transmission services is key to understanding this ruling, and FinCEN defines the term qualifiers as; the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and; the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means.\n\nThe definition is clear, companies offering brokerage services between buyers and sellers are often classified as money transmitters. However, FinCEN has some exceptions, “When a broker or dealer in currency or other commodities accepts and transmits funds solely for the purpose of effecting a bona fide purchase or sale of currency or other commodities for or with a customer, such person is not engaged as a business in the transfer of funds, and is not acting as a money transmitter as that term is defined in our regulations”\n\nIn such circumstances, the transmission of funds is a fundamental element of the actual transaction necessary to execute the contract for the purchase or sale of the currency or the other commodity. The transmission of funds is not a separate and discrete service provided in addition to the underlying transaction. It is a “necessary and integral part of the transaction.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway is that digital currencies are not an exception to existing money transmission rules. On March 18, 2013, FinCEN issued specific guidance on their regulations covering transactions in ""virtual"" currencies where they specifically addressed decentralized digital currencies like bitcoin.\n\nIn early 2013, FinCEN recognized ""convertible virtual currency"" as having an equivalent value to fiat currency, or acts as a substitute for fiat currency. Therefore, digital currency service providers must follow the same rules that fiat currency service providers do. The regulation does not differentiate between “real currencies” and “convertible virtual currencies.”\n\nWhile digital currency transmitters are not exempt from FinCEN\'s rules, users are excluded, including some miners.\n\n- FinCEN\n\nHowever, if miners sell their bitcoins for cash or other currencies, they will be classified as money transmitters. “A person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter.”\n\nThis ruling has put a lot of miners in an uncomfortable situation, but to date none have been fined or arrested over any violations.\n\nStartups complying with the regulation must “assess the money laundering risk involved in its non-exempt transactions, and implement an anti-money laundering program to mitigate such risk.” This usually requires a full-time compliance officer in-house.\n\nThere are also requirements for ensuring accurate record keeping, reporting, and transaction monitoring under FinCEN regulations. For example, if an excess of $10,000 is received the company is obligated to file a suspicious activity report.\n\nFor those companies that already offer services that fall under the regulation, FinCEN provides an 180-day window to register, after which time fines will be levied.\n\nApplications for a money transmitter license must be done on the state level, with each issuing their own money transmitter licenses, with their own application requirements.\n\nThere are various fees when applying for a money transmitter license, such as the initial application fee and an investigative fee. Some states charges only one fee whereas others break it down into two or more. Missouri\'s fees are among the cheapest, only charging $100 for the license, whereas Colorado\'s fees are among the highest, where fees can reach up to $7,500.\n\nThe cumulative fees for operating as a money transmitter in all 53 states and territories of the USA amount to approximately $200,000, according to research conducted by Ashley Grimes, of Grimes Law PLLC.\n\nCoinbase is currently in the process of applying for Money Transmitter Licenses in various states. According to their site they are half way there, licensed in 23 of the 53 US states and territories.\n\nTo qualify as a money transmitter, a business must meet various requirements, which are set by each state, such as having minimum capitalization of $50,000 to $1 million, with bonding, background checks on the executive staff, proof of holdings equal to 100% of consumer funds in “permissible investments,” regular reports, annual renewal filings, hiring a full-time compliance officer, and full audits on request.\n\nFailure to comply with the federal money transmitter licensing rules will result in fines, both civil and criminal. A “willful lack of compliance” is a federal crime that could result in up to 5 years of jail time.\n\n- FinCEN\n\nThe most recent enforcement of a related FinCEN ruling in the cryptocurrency space was in May, against Ripple Labs. The company, along with its wholly-owned subsidiary, XRP II, LLC, was fined $700,000 USD.\n\nAccording to FinCEN, Ripple had “willfully violated several requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by acting as a money services business (MSB) and selling its virtual currency, known as XRP, without registering with FinCEN, and by failing to implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program designed to protect its products from use by money launderers or terrorist financiers.”\n\nWith this week\'s ruling, FinCEN put this particular company on an equal footing with non- blockchain digital asset transfer companies, such as BitGold. This 2004 startup is a fully\xad compliant Canadian corporation that allows for transmission of Gold\xadbacked tokens over the internet.\n\nAny companies with similar services would be wise to pay attention to the content of the latest FinCEN ruling, and ensure compliance. Companies wishing to verify their status can seek their own FinCEN ruling by sending a letter to them describing the company\'s activities with accuracy and completeness. FinCEN will make a determination based on the representations in the letter.\n\nFurthermore, FinCEN repeatedly states in all their rulings and publications that whether a person is a money transmitter is “a matter of facts and circumstances.” All of FinCEN\'s interpretive guidance should be used with caution.']"
08/20/2015,"[""Bitcoin XT, the intentional fork that has been shaking up the bitcoin price, includes code branded as a hardcoded “blacklist” by critics. The code specifically targets Tor exit nodes, justifying the approach as protection against denial of service attacks. The code may also reveal the location of a Bitcoin XT node running through the Tor privacy network.\n\nIPs revealed?\n\nIn a post to the Bitcoin core mailing list, a researcher by the name of 'F L' points out a 'commit' to the Bitcoin XT source code, with over a thousand lines, including a hard list of IP addresses that are loaded by default into clients. The code also asks a server for an updated list of IP addresses that it could disconnect from, upon the boot of the client. This, according to Peter Todd, could leak the Tor Bitcoin XT node's IP address.\n\nThe approach is one of prioritizing some IP addresses over others, in the case that a node is overwhelmed with traffic from many sources in what is commonly known as a distributed denial of service attack (DDOS). If the maximum amount of connections a Bitcoin node can support is reached, the client would begin disconnecting from Tor exits, in an attempt to stop a DDOS attack.\n\n\n\nThe description of the commit created by Mike Hearn, reads:\n\n“When a node reaches its max connection slots, it will attempt to find a peer with a lower priority than the one trying to connect and disconnect it, to stay below the max connection limit.”\n\n“For now, the only IP group is one that gives Tor exits a score of -10” giving the Tor exists the lowest priority score by default. Hearn adds. “This is to address DoS attacks that are being reported on the main network in which an attacker builds many connections via Tor to use up all the connection slots and jam the node for clearnet users.”\n\nWhile on the surface the solution seems reasonable, given the attack it attempts to neutralize, the approach has been criticized heavily by the Bitcoin core developers to the point of rejecting the code from being added to the Bitcoin core. The rejection came on a variety of grounds, including it being a centralized approach since it has a predefined list of IPs and asks a central server for an updated IPs list, a feature which could be abused.\n\nThe download of an updated list in particular could compromise the privacy and, thus the security of a Bitcoin XT node running through Tor. Todd writes that by default “the code does still download the Tor exit node list, revealing the true location of the [Bitcoin XT] node” adding that “this is contrary to the previous behavior of not revealing any IP information in that configuration.”\n\nIs Tor the biggest DDOS threat?\n\nAnother essential criticism has been regarding Tor as a source of DDOS attacks. “Script kiddies [unskilled attackers] routinely play around with botnets [hacked computer networks] with way more than 125 IP addresses,” explains Peter Todd, with 125 being a rough amount of the total connections a Bitcoin node can hold.\n\nIn other words, an attacker can arbitrarily bypass this Tor Exit node disconnection mechanism by leveraging other regularly used non-Tor “botnets.”\n\nGregory Maxwell, leader of the Blockstream's sidechains project, adds:\n\n“In my experience mitigating attacks on Wikimedia, attackers used Tor as a secondary recourse over other proxies. On IRC, the Bitcoin channels have been attacked by thousands of hosts at once with no Tor use at all.”\n\nMike Hearn originally justified the commit to the Bitcoin core as being a response to a Tor DDOS attack being unleashed on one of Gavin Andresen's Bitcoin nodes. According to Hearn, Andresen “found his node had run out of connection slots and his peers were almost all Tor exits, additionally, his node had stopped following the block chain.”\n\nHowever, to my knowledge no detail report has been released on this attack. This article will be updated once such a report surfaces. Meanwhile, the code is actively being discussed and scrutinized by members of the Bitcointalk.\n\nAccording to xtnodes and bitnodes, XT nodes currently make up 12.7% of the Bitcoin network."", 'The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank should be given a mandate to monitor threats bitcoin and digital currency systems pose to the broader financial system, a new report from a Suffolk University researcher argues.\n\nEntitled ""$=€=Bitcoin?"", the report speculates as to the potential dangers that the more widespread use of bitcoin as a digital money with no government backing, analyzing how circumstances arise where this threatens national and international economies.\n\nThe paper follows a February 2014 statement from Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, who said that the US central bank does not have the authority to regulate digital currencies. Further, the European Central Bank published a report last year that, while largely dismissive the technology, indicated the bank is monitoring developments.\n\nMore broadly, the report argues that the mandate is necessary given that the general population is not aware of central bank boundaries, meaning the central bank could ""bear responsibility"" for a systemic crash should it affect either or both markets.\n\nThe report reads:\n\n""Even if the central bank had no mandate to regulate virtual currencies, a failure of a widely-used virtual currency could imperil confidence in the central bank, which could adversely affect its ability to govern the more traditional money supply and payment systems.""\n\nThe author argues that the decentralized nature of bitcoin suggests government action will be necessary should any ""bad conduct"" materialize in the market.\n\n""The result is likely to be an increased need for ex-post intervention, and it would be preferable if the intervention plan were well thought-out, rather than a messy, ad hoc plan developed in the heat of a crisis,"" it continues.\n\nOverall, the author makes the plea for action to be taken to address how governments should respond in times of digital currency crises before they become more widely used as a store of value and payment method.\n\nElsewhere, the full paper explores the definitions of money, while providing detailed overviews of the history of bitcoin, the US dollar and euro, as well as the variations in responsibilities between entities such as the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank.\n\nNew shadow banking\n\nFor purposes of the report, the author argues that potential bitcoin crises are perhaps best considered as analogous those that have occurred in the shadow banking system, the network of non-bank financial intermediaries that provide services to traditional commercial banks.\n\nThe author argues this should hold true, even though in the bitcoin ecosystem, the blockchain effectively replaces traditional financial intermediaries like non-bank institutions.\n\nOf note, the author contends, is the absence of an intermediary should bitcoin face a crisis, something she argues could incentivize speculators to drive down its price. A lower price, the paper continues, would likely lead the digital currency to be a less attractive means of spending, damage that would perhaps not be limited to the alternative economy.\n\n""If the failed virtual currency had previously been widely used to affect everyday purchases, the resulting payment system failure could impact the normal flow of funds in a way that could retard broader economic growth,"" the paper said.\n\nFurthermore, it contends that the failure of a widely-used virtual currency could contract the available money supply, thereby slowing economic growth.\n\nHybrid system\n\nShould digital currencies be more widely adopted, the paper argues, financial institutions could be adversely affected by any extreme fluctuations in the price of digital currencies.\n\nIn this scenario, the paper suggests financial institutions could be caught in situations where they no longer have the funds to cover needed obligations.\n\n""In a panic, the financial institution would no longer be able to exchange the virtual currency for the fiat currencies needed to discharge the fiat currency-denominated obligations,"" it reads. ""Instead, the financial institution would either have to sell other assets, or borrow, to raise the necessary fiat currencies to discharge its fiat-currency denominated obligations.""\n\nThis situation could be compounded as institutions seek to sell assets that are depreciating to reduce their exposure and stem their shrinking balance sheet, which in turn, could limit their ability to borrow more funds.\n\nHowever, the paper does note that bitcoin swaps, such as those offered by CFTC-approved TeraExchange, could be used to allow financial institutions exposure to digital currency without the burden of owning the asset.\n\nInterbank exchange\n\nShould the blockchain take off as a way for institutions to settle obligations, the author implied that the collateral for repo agreements would be affected, which would again limit their ability to secure short-term funding.\n\nIn turn, the paper speculates on the effects of this development on the larger economy.\n\n""If a serious systemic crisis were to result, interbank lending would seize up entirely because of a general lack of confidence in financial institutions and their collateral – and if interbank lending seizes up, then the flow of credit to the economy at large will also seize,"" it reads.\n\nIf financial institutions face such a crisis, they would in turn need liquidity assistance, which would most likely come, ironically, in the form of a government intervention.\n\nFinancial crisis visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Ideally we would love to keep growing Harborly along with this new project, but a bitcoin service is not something you run at 50% capacity.”\n\nWhen asked if digital currency regulation played into the decision, Black said that “I\'ll admit that we underestimated the regulatory and financial burden of running a bitcoin retail service.”\n\nBlack went on to say that the regulatory landscape for digital currencies is ""shaping up"", noting that any startup should overestimate how much time and money it will be required to devote to compliance.\n\n“We were surprised again and again by the resources it took to effectively adhere to the compliance requirements laid out in the US and beyond,” he added.\n\nClosed sign image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It looks for all the world like realtor’s office — that is, until you spot the sign swaying in the wind: “Bitcoin Embassy.”\n\nThe idea of a brick-and-mortar embassy for a digital payment system most often associated with online drug markets might seems a little strange at first. After all, Bitcoin is a currency — an entire philosophy, really — founded on the notion of no central control. So having one building to preach the crypto-love to the masses seems a little disingenuous.\n\nEven stranger is the Embassy’s location. It seems like it should be in the heart of Silicon Valley; but instead, it’s in the nightlife district of Montreal, Canada.\n\nSo it was with an apprehensive mind — and a stomach full of poutine — that I pushed open the Bitcoin logo-emblazened doors. Francois Pouliot, the Embassy’s Communications Director (and the Embassy’s only paid employee) greeted me with a handshake and a Bitcoin tie-pin.\n\nThe public-facing side of the building is a cross between a doctor’s waiting room, and the merchandise store at a Guns & Roses reunion concert: everywhere you look, there’s Bitcoin t-shirts (‘Keep Calm and Carry Bitcoin’), Bitcoin bumper stickers, Bitcoin bookmarks.\n\nAt the front desk I met an intern, a student from the local university’s cryptocurrency club, surrounded by a tennis court’s-worth of flatscreens. He runs the Embassy’s most useful public function — namely, helping anyone who walks in off the street to buy and sell Bitcoin for cold hard cash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Embassy used to have a Bitcoin ATM to do the work, but that was out of action in a corner, thanks to overzealous provincial regulators. Instead, I handed money to the intern, who fiddled with a tablet for a few seconds before telling me my wallet was 0.089 Bitcoins heavier. It’s a little strange to think, but the easiest way to buy a digital currency is still with a $20 note featuring the Queen’s face.\n\nAlthough it’s only been open for 18 months, old mining rigs litter all three floors. Some are scattered out front, for the public to ooh and ahh over; the others get used as doorstops, or heaters if someone gets cold. As you’d probably expect, the Embassy mines Bitcoin — not on the scale of a professional operation, but enough that the entire building is heated as a byproduct of the number-crunching. (And given that winter temperatures drop below -20F here, that’s saying something.)\n\nThe Embassy itself is split over its three floors. On the ground are a few small cubicles, with Bitcoiners firmly wired into their computers. The second floor looks like a luxury apartment — mostly because it is. The building was donated by Jean-Marc Jacobson, the founder of the Embassy and a local real estate developer. Although he doesn’t crash in the apartment any more, the room still has a bed, a kick-ass home theater system — and, of course, a five-foot-high Bitcoin logo on the wall. It’s still used for events, and occasionally burnt-out Bitcoiners in need of a nap will crash here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe top floor, however, looks and feels like an office (albeit one with dead power supplies and stacks of fans on every desk). It houses a variety of cryptocurrency startups, from alt-coin projects to people working on a certification for Bitcoin expertise.\n\nAt the moment, the Embassy’s purpose is split. A major focus is on educating the general public about Bitcoin, be that through distributing flyers, organizing Bitcoin giveaways, or Bitcoin 101 seminars. It also lobbies regulators, and tries to bring banking institutions up to speed on cryptocurrency.\n\nBut at heart, the Embassy is a hub for Bitcoiners and their projects. If you’ve got an idea to do with cryptocurrency, they’ll give you an office space, an internet connection, and more Bitcoin buttons than you know what to do with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Embassy’s COO, Mathieu Gagnon, describes the organization as “a cooperation of entrepreneurs, volunteers, industry members, who come together for one specific purpose.” Reading between the lines, you get a feeling for that purpose: helping Bitcoin take over the world.\n\nTo understand why someone donated a prime piece of real estate to a fledgling currency, or why the Embassy’s staff upped sticks and moved to Montreal to work there, you have to understand the philosophy that’s attached to Bitcoin.\n\nAt its most extreme, it’s a belief that Bitcoin can help arm the people to rise up against the oppression of the federal government; listening to the more reasonable folks at the Embassy, it’s the idea that Bitcoin lessens the power and necessity of central government and the banking system, by removing their control over money\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a way, that explains why Quebec is a logical place to house the first Bitcoin Embassy: skepticism of the federal government is deep-rooted here, thanks to a long history of anti-Canada separatism. And hey, if Quebec ever makes the jump away from the rest of the country, it could always use Bitcoin to replace those loonies and toonies.\n\nThat still leaves one important question, though: how did a building that’s half lobbying shop, half Bitcoin startup, come to be called an Embassy? The COO, Mathieu Gagnon, told me it was a decision born out of necessity:\n\nBitcoiners were persecuted by the banking system, and the Embassy provides a safe haven of sort. We were persecuted both in terms of mindset — everything thought that [Bitcoin] just wasn’t going to work — and practically. We were blacklisted: if you had any kind of Bitcoin business, it was impossible to open a bank account. Now, it’s no longer fashionable to bash Bitcoin, even in financial circles.\n\nThat said, the name has confused some people. Members of the public apparently walk in from time to time asking which country’s embassy it is. And the Embassy can be perplexing for the Bitcoin community sometimes, too. Bitcoin’s design as a decentralized system is one that doesn’t exactly encourage large, visible institutions. The community didn’t appoint the Embassy, so why should anyone listen to it?\n\nGagnon’s claim is that the community needs a visible, physical entity:\n\nRegulators need to talk to someone — let’s say, this bank wants to use Bitcoin, or this payment processor wants to use Bitcoin, they need to talk to some people. They could individually go on forums, or they could come to us, talk to us.\n\nAlthough the Embassy was Bitcoin’s first physical presence in the world — if you discount the fiddly Bitcoin ATMs — it’s far from the first formal Bitcoin organization. Probably the biggest, and certainly the most infamous, is the Bitcoin Foundation. Its role within the community has been heavily criticized. Damning financial statements from the Foundation have been leaked to the web, and it’s on the third Executive Director in six months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGagnon thinks that by not asking for money, and pushing for community involvement, the Embassy’s largely managed to avoid similar problems. Not having to pay rent — and not overseeing the downfall of Mt Gox — probably helps, too.\n\nWhen I talked to Gagnon and Pouliot, their fervent passion for cryptocurrency was obvious. It’s not just about libertarianism or the technological marvel of the blockchain that fuels Bitcoin’s anonymous system of authentication.\n\nGet Pouliot talking on Bitcoin’s economic underpinnings (he left his job as an economic analyst to come work at the Embassy), and you’ll get a full lecture, complete with whiteboard graphs, on the value of the currency. Gagnon exudes a quiet confidence in cryptocurrency’s legitimacy — it’s just a matter of when, not if, we all get our wages in Bitcoin. These guys are in it for the long haul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bitcoin Embassy — and the people inside — aren’t online drug dealers, and they’re not trying to spin Silicon Valley (or Quebec) off into another country just yet. It’s like any community of geeks, working on a project they believe in. The only difference is that they occasionally have to turn away lost tourists hoping to replace their passports.', '', ""Mining is the backbone of bitcoin.\n\nIt’s the process that creates new bitcoin: By contributing computing power to process transactions on the bitcoin network, “miners” are rewarded with a portion of the digital currency.\n\nThis payout makes the entire process — with the right equipment, incredibly lucrative, and has spawned a huge and surreal industry.\n\nYou can mine at home, and many people do. But companies dedicated to mining have also sprung up, some worth tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThese companies build huge data centres or “mines,” that consume vast amounts of power and perform insane computations on the hunt for digital gold.\n\nHere’s a look inside one.\n\nThese photos are from Genesis Mining, a cloud mining company. It lets customers mine using their 'cloud,' without having to buy specialised hardware. Genesis Mining It's technically possible to mine on just about any computer, but it's not profitable to do so unless you have the right kit. Many people do mine themselves, often joining large pools to improve their odds. But Genesis' model is another option. Genesis Mining The company had early mines in Bosnia and China, and most of its operations are currently based in Iceland. Genesis Mining The country boasts three very important qualities for mining: Cheap energy, good internet connections, and a cold climate. Genesis Mining Climate is incredibly important. Mining hardware generates a tremendous amount of heat and uses huge amounts of power. If you can save on cooling costs due to the natural temperature, it could mean the difference between losing money and making a profit. Genesis Mining Even so, Genesis' electricity consumption is very significant. CEO Marco Streng says energy companies 'offer us helicopter rides whenever we arrive,' and speculates they may be one of the biggest single users of power in the country. Genesis Mining Assuming you're getting a good deal on electricity -- and ignoring all other costs -- Streng says one bitcoin currently costs about $60 to mine. For reference, that one bitcoin is currently worth $235. Genesis Mining But when you factor in hardware, production costs, staffing etc., 'one is able to mine a Bitcoin for about 20% less than its current price.' Genesis Mining Streng says that 'cloud mining has a major trust issue.' Customers never actually see or own the mining hardware themselves -- putting them at risk of fraud. Genesis Mining Ponzi schemes can pop up, using later customers' money to pay earlier customers, while keeping most for themselves. 'They don't ever even own their own mining facilities, they just take pictures from other companies, photoshop them then pretend they are theirs.' Genesis Mining So what are the conditions like in the mine itself? In a speaking in a promotional video, chief technical office Stefan Schindler is candid: 'Working inside a bitcoin mine is absolutely terrible.' Genesis Mining Source. 'You're constantly surrounded by machines that are completely shouting at you all the time,' he explains. 'It's as if you were listening to jets starting and landing without stopping.' Heat is another factor -- parts of the facility reach 40 to 50 degrees celsius. Genesis Mining Here's a video of Genesis setting up a new Icelandic farm. The company has several dozen full-time employees, including electrical and internet specialists, and brings on extra labouring help when it establishes new facilities.

Some are mesmerized by the technology’s pseudonymous creator, while others simply like the idea of having a completely open payment network for the entire globe. Although it’s easy to become captivated by what Bitcoin has to offer, it is difficult for many individuals to fully understand the specific areas of daily life where Bitcoin may be useful.\n\nCoinbase has been one of the main drivers behind the adoption of Bitcoin in the mainstream, and CEO Brian Armstrong sees three areas where Bitcoin can be most useful right now. For Armstrong, disrupting traditional financial services, bringing digital financial services to people who don’t already have them, and enabling completely new Internet applications are the three areas where the cryptocurrency can be the most useful right now. The Coinbase CEO expanded on these thoughts in a recent episode of the a16z Podcast with Wall Street Journal ColumnistChristopher Mims.\n\nDisrupting Traditional Financial Services\n\nArmstrong’s first area of focus when discussing Bitcoin’s usefulness had to do with traditional financial services. Although many Bitcoin businesses have decided to focus on the developing world or industries that operate in a legal gray area, Armstrong also sees value in using Bitcoin to disrupt the financial services that people already use in the developed world:\n\n“One of them is . . . distributing traditional financial services and products. In [one] case, remittance. It might allow it to be faster or cheaper, right? Other examples of traditional financial products it might disrupt would be things like credit card payments where now those fees are less, or instead of going to get a loan at a bank, you might be able to get a peer-to-peer loan through something like BTCJam, which is a startup out there.”\n\nBringing Financial Services to the Developing World\n\nArmstrong’s second area of focus was the developing world where there is more than a bit of cell phone penetration but a lack of access to traditional bank accounts. The Coinbase CEO believes that Bitcoin can bring financial services to people in the developing world who otherwise would have no access to digital commerce:\n\n“The second major category in my mind would be developing world use cases where people don’t actually have financial services today. These are the unbanked of the world, and there’s something like two to three billion people in the world who have a cell phone but do not have a bank account or credit card. So, they’re living, essentially, with cash or they’re using some kind of primitive digital currency — like a lot of people actually send cell phone minutes or cell phone credit. They can SMS it to each other in the developing world.”\n\nArmstrong expanded on how something like cell phone minutes could be seen as a precursor to a digital currency such as Bitcoin:\n\n“There’s actually some places where you can go in the Philippines and buy dinner with cell phone minutes and things like that. You text it to the person across the counter, and so those are all early precursors of digital currency – types of digital currency that people are using there. We think that a whole generation of kids and people in the developing world will actually grow up, and their first ‘bank account’ will actually be a digital currency wallet on their cell phone.”\n\nEnabling New Internet Applications\n\nArmstrong’s third area of usefulness is perhaps the most interesting. With Bitcoin, certain Internet applications that did not make sense in the past are now possible:\n\n“The third one would be what I call brand new Internet applications that are uniquely enabled by Bitcoin. By that I mean it’s not disrupting the traditional financial services industry or something like that. It’s actually creating something [where] the only way it works is with Bitcoin. These are very small today, but I think in the future some of these will end up being multi-billion dollar companies and systems. Some of these are things like distributed crowdfunding, like the Lighthouse project is an example of that. There are prediction markets where you can use the wisdom of crowds to predict the outcome of certain events.”\n\nArmstrong also explained that many of these new applications made possible through Bitcoin usually have something to do with microtransactions:\n\n“A lot of them have to do with microtransactions, actually, which is something Bitcoin uniquely enables. So, there are things like tipping on the Internet with things like ChangeTip. These are examples of, kind of, very new use cases that are uniquely enabled by Bitcoin, which are not big yet but could actually grow — more of like a greenfields idea.”\n\nWhen you combine these three areas of usefulness for Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why so many people are bullish on the technology’s potential rate of adoption. As Armstrong alluded to later in the conversation, it is these sorts of use cases that attack pain points in people’s financial lives that will drive more adoption over the long term.\n\nPhoto TechCrunch / Flickr (CC)', 'Nigeria\'s Central Bank has reportedly called for bitcoin regulation in an attempt to stop money laundering and avoid international penalties.\n\nSpeaking at the second Anti Money Laundering/Combating Financial Terrorism Stakeholders Consultative Workshop held in Abuja – the country\'s capital – Dr Okwu Nnanna, deputy governor of financial system stability at Nigeria\'s Central Bank (CBN) said:\n\n""Virtual currency was dangerous because it was not a legal tender of any country hence it has a borderless nature without jurisdiction which makes it a channel for money laundering.""\n\nAccording to media reports, the event – organised by the Association of Certified Anti Money Laundering Specialist – also featured comments from Obot Akpan\'s, deputy director of Financial Policy and Regulation Department at CBN.\n\nAkpan added:\n\n""Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) has observed that virtual currency payment products and services (VCPPS) present opportunity for money laundering and other crime risk that must be identified and mitigated.

Berners-Lee tried to include micropayments in Web protocols, but the idea hasn’t been implemented so far.\n\n“In the late 1990s Berners-Lee tried to develop a micropayments system for the Web through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),” reported Walter Isaacson in his 2014 book “The Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution.” The idea was to devise a way to embed in a Web page the information needed to handle a small payment, which would allow different electronic wallet services to be created by banks or entrepreneurs. “It was never implemented, partly because of the changing complexity of banking regulations,” noted Isaacson.\n\nThe preparatory work of the Web Payments Interest Group and the forthcoming work of the Web Payments Working Group can be seen as gradual steps to implement Berners-Lee’s vision. However, it’s surprising that the official W3C documents produced to date make only incidental mentions of bitcoin, which is the only form of Internet money and “Internet native” payment system that exists, works, effectively implements one-click Internet payments, and is rapidly gaining recognition and partial acceptance from the financial system.\n\nIsaacson reports that Andreessen mentioned bitcoin as a good model for standard Internet payment systems. “If I had a time machine and could go back to 1993, one thing I’d do for sure would be to build in bitcoin or some similar form of cryptocurrency,” Andreessen said.\n\nA possible explanation for the more timid approach of the W3C is that the organization prefers to distance itself from the more controversial aspects of bitcoin, including the possibility of private and semi-anonymous transactions, and wait for “sanitized” versions of bitcoin.\n\nPhoto Southbank Centre / Flickr (CC)', 'During a presentation on digital currencies entitled “Old Money, New Money,” Andy Haldane, Chief Economist and the Executive Director of Monetary Analysis and Statistics of the Bank of England and his team stated that “Digital currencies are ‘harder money’ than a gold standard” because “sustained adoption [of bitcoin] would see ongoing deflation.”\n\nHaldane began by explaining the basics of bitcoin and its “advantages and disadvantages” as a peer to peer payment system. Haldane and his team described bitcoin in 4 main aspects:\n\nDistributed: greater resilience, no central control, a coordination problem Pseudonymous (and possibly anonymous) Push-only (no ‘direct debits’): payments are final and cannot be imposed Individually cheap, but socially expensive (but this could be fixed)\n\nHaldane continued to expound that bitcoin could disrupt the traditional financial industry, due to the world’s severely underbanked regions and the surge of increase in smart phone usages.\n\n2 million UK adults do not have bank accounts and 2.5 billion people in the world have no access to financial services, said Haldane. However, given the estimate that 80% of the world’s population will own a smartphone within 5 years, Haldane believes that many could turn toward digital currency to store their savings.\n\nDespite his positive comments and presentation on bitcoin, Haldane brought a closure to his talk by saying, “The least interesting thing about Bitcoin, and other distributed ledger systems, is that they are digital. Digital currencies are important for how they deploy the available technology in a new way.”\n\nPhoto Katie Chan / Wikimedia (CC)']"
08/21/2015,"['Bitcoin is divided. Some are calling it the currency’s ""constitutional crisis"", a debate that has split its community right down the middle.\n\nThe crux of the issue comes down to a single technical detail: the size of bitcoin’s blocks.\n\nThe question of scale in bitcoin is not a new one. But as transaction volumes are expected to increase in the years ahead, questions about the cryptocurrency’s future composition must, in the eyes of those who favor change, be answered sooner rather than later: who does it serve? How should it look? What makes it unique?\n\nAs the block size debate rages on, here\'s a primer on its broad strokes and why it matters.\n\nWhat are blocks?\n\nBlocks are batches of transactions which are confirmed and subsequently shared on bitcoin’s public ledger, the blockchain.\n\nIn the early days of the currency, these blocks could carry up to 36MB of transaction data apiece. However, in 2010, this was reduced to 1MB to reduce the threat of spam and potential denial-of-service attacks on the network.\n\nThis limit remains in place today, however as transactions increase bitcoin\'s blocks are filling up – edging further towards this 1MB line.\n\nData released by TradeBlock in June revealed the average block size had increased from around 125KB to 425KB since 2013, while the daily volume of bitcoin transactions had increased 2.5 times.\n\nIn turn, some blocks are already hitting this maximum. At the time of TradeBlock’s research, this was happening on average more than four times a day.\n\n""Meaning at least some otherwise-acceptable transactions are seeing delayed confirmations due to capacity issues on the network 3% of the time since the beginning of the year,"" it said.\n\nAnd while the 1MB hard limit remains in place, miners aren’t obliged to fill blocks all the way up. They are able to \'tailor\' mined blocks anywhere from 0 to 1MB, while the standard bitcoin client has a default setting of around 732KB.\n\nWith all these factors in the mix, bitcoin is estimated to reach its so-called ‘capacity cliff’ – where all blocks on the network are full – sometime next year.\n\nWhat\'s so bad about full blocks?\n\nSome fear that a backlog of transactions awaiting inclusion in a future blocks will clog up the bitcoin network should blocks become consistently full.\n\nIn this scenario, bitcoin nodes, which form the collective \'backbone\' that relays transactions across the network, will be overloaded with data and some transactions could be severely delayed or even rejected altogether.\n\nFor anyone using a small amount bitcoin to pay for a day-to-day purchase like a cup of coffee, this would mean a long, awkward wait at the counter – and a lukewarm latte.\n\nCoin Wallet, an unknown wallet company that previously flooded the network with many tiny transactions, in one of many recent bitcoin \'stress tests\', is planning another experiment in September.\n\nIf all goes to plan, it says the backlog of 0.00001 BTC transactions may take 30 days to clear, rendering other wallet software ""worthless"".\n\nWhy not make the blocks bigger?\n\nThat\'s the thinking behind Gavin Andresen\'s BIP101 \'bigger blocks\' proposal, first pitched in May and now being tested live as the Bitcoin XT client.\n\nThe former lead developer and current chief scientist for the Bitcoin Foundation is proposing raising the limit to 8MB, which will increase an additional 40% every two years until 2036 to accommodate future growth in CPU power, storage and bandwidth.\n\nOriginally, Andresen had sought a 20MB hard limit, however many Chinese miners, who now account for more than 50% of the network\'s hashing power, expressed concerns over such a drastic step change due to the country\'s limited bandwidth.\n\nOther proposals have been put to the Bitcoin Core team in the typical channels, for example Pieter Wuille\'s annual 17.7% block size increase and Jeff Garzik\'s 2MB ""emergency"" proposal. However, these proposals, like others, have not achieved broad support among Bitcoin Core developers and the debate, as a result, continues.\n\nBitcoin XT takes the debate one step further by attempting to supplant Bitcoin Core as the network\'s chief client. Developers Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen seek to persuade node operators and miners to support the client.\n\nAccording to XTnodes.com, as of the time of this writing, 868 nodes support the bigger blocks of XT, and three of the past 1,000 blocks were mined with support for Andresen\'s BIP-101.\n\nDue to the way bitcoin is currently governed, change cannot happen if an agreement cannot be reached. There is no \'benevolent dictator\' in Core that can override the rest of the team. For better or worse, consensus is king.\n\nWho\'s in favour?\n\nBesides Andresen, Hearn and a few other Core developers – who, tangentially, disagree with the ""drastic"" and ""dangerous"" methods of XT – bigger blocks in general have received support from a number of large bitcoin service providers.\n\nPretty much all of bitcoin\'s wallets are on board, including Coinbase, Blockchain.info and Xapo, with the exception of CoinKite and GreenAddress. For them, the continued cheap use of the blockchain is a necessity.\n\nExchanges outside of China have been rather quiet on the subject, while those inside the country, like the mining pools, have publicly backed a 8MB increase.\n\nWhen Genesis Mining — a large pool with farms across Asia, Europe, and the US — took a poll of its users in June, 87% agreed that an increase was a ""good idea"".\n\nHowever, the question of whether miners and pools will support that increase in the form of XT, a fork of Bitcoin Core, remains. It currently has 13.7% of bitcoin\'s nodes behind it.\n\nIn an interview in June, China\'s three largest pools – F2Pool, BTCChina Pool and Huobi Pool – indicated they would not switch to XT, but rather strive for consensus. They present more than 35% of the current hash rate.\n\nProblem solved, right?\n\nNot quite. As developer Peter Todd points out, blockchains – owing to their design – do not scale. Even Andresen, the mastermind behind the \'bigger blocks\' proposal as well as a driving force behind Bitcoin XT, concedes that raising the block size limit is akin to ""kick[ing] the can down the road"".\n\nOthers have expressed concern that raising the block size limit will mean fewer full nodes due to the increased data storage costs involved, which could dissuade users to operate full nodes and centralize the system around entities capable of handing bigger blocks. This, some opponents of bigger blocks say, would go against bitcoin\'s distributed, censorship-resistant nature.\n\nIBM UK\'s Richard Gendal Brown has attributed this way of thinking, in part, to the security engineering mindset – ""how can I break this?"" – a fear of technical failure that would put this decision off. On the flip side, those who see the larger problem as a more immediate danger are driven by a fear of practical failure that will drive away users.\n\nThose behind the block size increase see it as an immediate \'patch\' – imperfect, but necessary. Those who are against it see it an increase as just one option of many that should not be rushed into hastily.\n\nSo, what other options are there?\n\nEven simpler than tweaking a few lines of bitcoin’s code, is another block size solution: to leave the protocol as it is.\n\nRather than increasing capacity for new transactions, this school of thinking maintains that limiting block size in the short-term will create a self-regulating market for transaction fees. Put simply, if you’re willing to pay more, you get to the top of the pile. This, the thinking goes, will also increase miners\' incentive to process transactions, which will benefit the health of the network.\n\nPeter Todd, one of the Core developers in support of this short-term solution, says it will give the market ""an incentive to come up with real solutions to scaling bitcoin"".\n\nWhat are these other solutions? Well, they include various mechanisms that push the many tiny transactions on the bitcoin network – such as those from gambling sites and faucets – \'off-chain\'. One, known as the Lightning Network, is a kind of \'hub and spoke\' solution that lets two parties transact in private, then put their data back on the blockchain at an agreed time. However, even this will require a soft fork of the protocol to get it running.\n\nSidechains, spearheaded by $21m-backed startup Blockstream, has been mentioned in the context of the scalability discussion. However, some of the team behind the concept, which allow developers to experiment on separate chains \'pegged\' to the bitcoin blockchain, say this isn\'t entirely accurate.\n\nLuke Jr, one of several Core developers involved with Blockstream, recently comment on Reddit:\n\n""Sidechains aren\'t about scaling, they\'re about improving bitcoin\'s functionality. Some of those features may be useful to improve scaling – for example, the softforks needed for Lightning – but sidechains themselves don\'t do it.""\n\nAs it has unfolded, the block size debate has touched on many pain points for the currency as it seeks to grow. Bitcoin is many things to many people – anarchists, speculators, entrepreneurs – which, until now, hasn’t been much of a problem.\n\nHowever, as proposals and counterproposals emerge, the question of the currency\'s future remains. Will it compete with the likes of Visa as a cheap, fast payment channel? Or should it remain an ultra secure, premium – and scarce – store of value to which other services can be pegged?\n\nThough the bitcoin ecosystem is undergoing big changes, whether the underlying code itself is altered remains to be seen.\n\nBrick image and block image via Shutterstock\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article quoted Peter Todd as saying that blockchains, owing to their newness, have not been proved to scale.

However, bitcoin has had a tough week with its market price dropping over 10% after the Bitcoin XT fork debate resurfaced in greater intensity.\n\nYet, the Bitcoin ecosystem has responded with new ATMs moving to Greece en masse, and now the new Mike Tyson Lamassu unit opening in Las Vegas. The machine was covered in black and white promotional branding, emblazoned with Mike Tyson’s former fighting image and iconic facial tattoo imagery, as you can see below.\n\nKnockout fees\n\nAccording to Peter Klamka, CEO of Bitcoin Direct, the Mike Tyson ATM was installed on Tuesday and activated yesterday. The ATM’s exact location is within The LINQ Hotel & Casino’s Promenade, off the strip, on South Las Vegas Boulevard. It is a one-way Lamassu ATM, meaning it only takes money to convert into bitcoin and the fees are liable to score a knockout faster than Tyson is used to. It costs 10% over the current Bitstamp exchange rate price at the time of purchase to use.\n\nThe location while “off the strip” is centrally located behind the Mirage, Bellagio and Caesar’s Palace, and south of Wynn Las vegas across the street from Planet Hollywood.\n\nOddly, The LINQ does not accept bitcoin directly, so the placement could have been better, as there are a couple of bitcoin-friendly casinos in Las Vegas. The D and the Golden Gate Casino do accept bitcoin, but do not have a bitcoin ATM. Typically, a fee more in the 4-5% range is considered normal, but the rights to Tyson’s image and the location near high rollers at multiple top hotels may be inflating user prices, at least initially.', 'Mining hardware maker Bitmain has claimed its new bitcoin ASIC will be the most power-efficient chip available to the public.\n\nThe forthcoming BM1385, the Beijing company\'s fourth generation ASIC, will be capable of 32.5 GH/s.

Are you among them? Well, on a long enough timeline, you might one day be. Heck, you might even think you are Satoshi.\n\n1 – Nick Szabo – Blogger Skye Grey linked Nick Szabo to the Bitcoin white paper. Szabo is a long-time decentralized currency philosopher and even published a paper entitled “bit gold” which many consider a precursor to Bitcoin. This has nothing to do with the recently launched BitGold. Szabo has denied being Satoshi Nakamoto. Nathaniel Popper wrote in the New York Times that “the most convincing evidence pointed to a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent named Nick Szabo.”\n\n2 – Dorian Nakamoto – This Nakamoto is perhaps the best known mistaken Satoshi Nakamoto. In March 2014, Leah McGrath published an article in Newsweek doxxing Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, as Satoshi Nakamoto. Goodman used his name, as well as circumstantial evidence, as proof for his involvement in the Bitcoin project. Nakamoto worked as a systems engineer on defense projects and other projects. Nakamoto did identify as a libertarian, according to his daughter. Goodman claimed that Nakamoto said, “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.” Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department later confirmed this quote – their deputies had been present at the time. In a later interview, Dorian, alongside Andreas Antonopoulos, denied any connection to Bitcoin and claimed he had not heard of it until Leah’s article. Many bitcoiners pooled donations to compensate him for his inconvenience.\n\nAlso read: Dorian Nakamoto To File Lawsuit Against Newsweek\n\n3 – Hal Finney – Finney is in many ways a hero to the Bitcoin community. He was the first person to run a Bitcoin node after Satoshi Nakamoto. He busied himself by supplying bug reports and helping to make improvements. Individuals have suggested that Hal Finney is Satoshi Nakamoto. Forbes journalist Andy Greenberg uncovered that Finney lived a mere few blocks from Dorian Nakamoto’s home. Greenberg tasked a writing analysis consultancy to compare Finney’s writing with Nakamoto’s and they claimed it was the closest of any they had come across. Hal wrote in a well-known BitcoinTalk post:\n\nSpeaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I’d lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I’d run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That’s when everything went wrong. My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig’s disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.\n\nHal has been cryopreserved.\n\n4 – John Nash – Nash is believed by many Bitcoiners to have, at least, heavily influenced Bitcoin. Some even believe he is Satoshi Nakamoto. Nash is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, known mostly for his work in game theory, as well his personal struggle with paranoid schizophrenia. His life was brought to the big screen in 2001 Oscar-winning film “A Beautiful Mind,” starring Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, which portrayed John’s mental illness and the accomplishments which earned him the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics. He sometimes wrote about his distaste for Keynesian economics as many Bitcoiners do.\n\nAlso read: John Nash Dead At 86\n\n5 – Vili Lehdonvirta – The New Yorker suggested that Lehdonvirta, a Finnish economist, could be Satoshi Nakamoto. Lehdonvirta denied being the inventor of Bitcoin.\n\n6 – Michael Clear – The New Yorker also claimed Clear could be Satoshi Nakamoto. Clear, a graduate student in cryptography as Trinity College in Dublin, was named the top computer-science undergraduate at Trinity in 2008. He started working for Allied Irish Banks on their currency-trading software and co-authored an academic paper on peer-to-peer technology. He denied vehemently being Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n7 – Neal King and others – Fast Company’s Adam Penenberg suggested Neal King, Vladimir Oksam and Charles Bry as possible inventors of Bitcoin. The publication cited an encryption patent application filed by the three on August 15, 2008, a mere 72 hours before the bitcoin.org domain name was registered. The patent application described networking and encryption protocols comparable to Bitcoin. The phrase “computationally impractical to reverse” appeared in both the patent application and the Bitcoin white paper. Penenberg came to his conclusion by typing unique phrases which appeared in the Bitcoin white paper into Google to see where they had before appeared.\n\n8 – Shinichi Mochizuki – Ted Nelson suggested in 2013 that Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki as Satoshi. The Age claimed that Mochizuki denied this assertion.\n\n9 – The National Security Agency – A common hypothesis submitted by Bitcoiners posits the National Security Agency (NSA), or some other government alphabet agency, as Satoshi Nakamoto. Many disagree. Is it true?\n\n10 – Wei Dai – Dai, a cypherpunk and 1990s proponent of digital currency, has been said to be Satoshi Nakamoto. He came up with a so-called B-money proposal, which many see as a precursor idea to Bitcoin.\n\nSome believe an unknown group of people is responsible for Bitcoin. Academia has accepted that there is a chance the famed William Shakespeare was not one individual but rather a roundtable of writers and intellectuals who created the works associated with William Shakespeare. Many people have insinuated this is what they believe happened with Bitcoin: Satoshi Nakamoto is not one person, but a group of people. Then again, others think we are all Satoshi.\n\nFeatured images from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin has entered into a new phase of its existence. Prominent developers Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen have made changes to the alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT, designed to fork Bitcoin’s blockchain in order to allow for bigger blocks.\n\nBitcoin users and – in particular – miners are, therefore, faced with a choice. Will they support Bitcoin XT and vote for an 8 megabyte block-size limit – doubling every other year? Or will they stick to Bitcoin Core with 1 megabyte blocks, limiting the Bitcoin network to a maximum of seven transactions per second?\n\nOr at least that is the choice as it is often presented. In reality, the possibilities are not binary. At the time of publication of this article, two other Core developers have proposed three more Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) to increase the block-size limit, and an even wider spectrum of ideas has been suggested on the development mailing list, forums, chat rooms and other media. This article presents an – undoubtedly incomplete – overview of these ideas, categorized in six types of solutions.\n\nSolution 1: No Cap on Block Size\n\nA first option is a full removal of the block-size limit. Such a cap on the block size, after all, constricts the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network, which could become a barrier to adoption or utility at scale.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto originally implemented the block-size limit as a quick fix to avoid denial-of-service (D0S) attacks on the Bitcoin network. But since Bitcoin’s creator has gone silent, most of Bitcoin’s developers have come to believe that the block-size limit might actually serve more purposes than just the prevention of DoS attacks. The arguments to keep a block-size limit today are diverse, but can be divided into two main categories.\n\nFirst, a block-size limit might be needed to avoid centralization of the Bitcoin network, and, in particular, further centralization of mining. Perhaps most importantly, bigger blocks would take longer to propagate to other miners when first found. A longer propagation time should lead to a higher orphan rate, as more miners would be mining on older blocks, while newer blocks are still finding their way through the network. That would, in turn, incentivize miners to join larger miner pools, as they find blocks more often, and therefore don’t need to wait for the propagation of new blocks as often.\n\nSecond, facing a diminishing block reward, and barring radical alternative solutions, scarcity in the blocks might actually be needed to secure a long-term income for bitcoin miners. After all, miners effectively sell the space in blocks to fill them with transactions. But if the space in these blocks is not scarce, competing miners could always undercut other miner’s fees in a race to the bottom, until fees reach a near-zero level and miners earn close to nothing to reinvest in hashing power. The end result could be an insecure network.\n\nSolution 2: A Fixed Cap on Block Size\n\nThe simplest and current solution to solve this problem is the implementation of a fixed cap; a block-size limit set by Bitcoin’s core development team and embedded in the Bitcoin protocol. This fixed cap is currently still 1 megabyte, as set by Satoshi Nakamoto, but is slowly coming within reach as the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network continues to increase.\n\nIn order to prevent blocks from filling up, several other limits have been proposed. As a last-ditch effort before shifting his efforts to Bitcoin XT, Andresen suggested raising the block-size limit to 20 megabytes– although this was never formalized into a BIP. A conglomerate of Chinese mining pools later indicated that 20 megabytes might be problematic, as “the great firewall of China” could limit the propagation of Bitcoin blocks over the network, and instead proposed a compromise to 8 megabytes. And since consensus was still not reached, Core developer Jeff Garzik recently submitted BIP102 to double the maximum block size to 2 megabytes in order to buy time to come up with better solutions. Naturally, every other size could be picked as a possible limit as well, whether it’s 4 megabytes or 400 gigabytes, or even a decrease in size as Core developer Luke Dashjr suggested.\n\nA slight variation to this idea, as recently proposed by Core developer Sergio Lerner, is to hold onto the 1 megabyte limit, but speed up the block interval. If 1 megabyte blocks are found every five minutes instead of 10, that would allow for double the amount of transactions on the network while also decreasing confirmation times.\n\nSolution 3: A Growing Cap\n\nArguably the biggest problem with a fixed cap – any fixed cap – is that it is hard to change. A change of the block-size limit requires a hard fork, meaning all users need to make the switch in order to not be left behind on the old blockchain. This is no easy feat on a decentralized network, especially if different participants of that network vary in their preferences. Furthermore, since the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network is optimistically expected to keep rising, while the cost of bandwidth and hardware is optimistically expected to keep falling, it is broadly assumed that the block size should grow over time.\n\nThis is why Andresen proposed a growing block-size limit. Based on Moore’s Law and Nielsen’s Law, his first public suggestion was to automatically increase the limit by 50 percent per year, which he later readjusted to 41 percent per year – or 100 percent per two years. Combined with an initial bump to 8 megabytes (a number picked in accordance with Chinese mining pools), he formalized this proposal in BIP101. Since it was not adopted by the Bitcoin Core development team, Andresen has programmed BIP101 into Bitcoin XT, to be triggered once 75 percent of hashing power has expressed support.\n\nAnother Core developer, Pieter Wuille, thinks Andresen’s preferred growth rate is much too progressive. Based on research by Blockstream colleague Rusty Russell, Wuille believes average internet connection speed will not be able to keep up with Andresen’s proposal. Wuille has, therefore, proposed to increase the block size limit by 17.7 percent per year starting in 2017, which he formalized in BIP103.\n\nBut much like the fixed cap, any set growth rate can theoretically be picked. Perhaps Russell’s revised figures – he now suggests 30 percent yearly growth should be OK – will lead to another BIP in the near future?\n\nSolution 4: A Dynamic Cap\n\nRegardless of the preferred figures, a set growth rate has its own problems. Most importantly, it typically includes predictions about the future – and no one can reliably predict the future. The growth of Bitcoin usage has proved to be rather unpredictable over the past years, and historic technological improvement rates defined by Moore’s Law or Nielsen’s Law are in reality not laws at all – rather, trends.\n\nThis is why some suggest that Bitcoin might need a dynamic cap instead of a fixed cap or a cap based on a set growth rate. A dynamic block-size limit would, much like the mining difficulty, readjust itself automatically, based on a pre-defined rule set. And again, there have been multiple ideas on how to define this rule set.\n\nAnother of Andresen’s suggestions is to readjust the block-size limit on the basis of the size of recent blocks. This in itself can be done in multiple ways, and Andresen agreed to take the average size of the last 144 blocks (about a day’s worth), and double it to represent the new limit. If the blocks of the past day were an average of 1 megabyte in size, the limit would automatically be set on 2 megabytes.\n\nA similar proposal entailed to adjust the maximum block size once a certain threshold is reached. For instance, when a series of blocks would on average reach 90 percent capacity, the block size limit could automatically readjust upward. Or, if a series of blocks would not even reach 50 percent of the maximum allowed block size, the limit could automatically readjust downward.\n\nBut it’s also possible to use parameters not even directly related to the block size. The block-size limit could, for example, be linked to the total amount of fees in a block. Or it could be based on the mining difficulty, as proposed by Core developer Gregory Maxwell. As long as it’s an internal parameter, Bitcoin’s block size limit can be tied to it.\n\nSolution 5: A Cap Chosen Through Voting\n\nAlmost all interesting dynamic cap suggestions, however, seem to have one common weakness: The data that informs the new dynamic cap on the block-size limit can often be manipulated. For instance, miners could send transactions to themselves in order to fill up blocks or to increase fees.\n\nTherefore, a more transparent solution could be a direct vote, possibly on some kind of regular interval. This solution begs another question: Who gets to vote? An obvious option would be to allow all Bitcoin users a vote. But unfortunately, it’s not really possible to determine who Bitcoin’s users are, while it’s easy to game elections by posing as multiple entities.\n\nHowever, it is possible to vote with bitcoin. This could easily be done by setting up burn-addresses as voting booths. Anyone could partake in the elections, though it would cost money to do so, as the bitcoin used to vote would be lost forever. This way, the side of the debate that is prepared to spend most bitcoin on its desired solution wins. Elections would literally, and intentionally, be up for sale.\n\nIt’s also possible to organize a one-bitcoin-one-vote election without the need to burn bitcoin. As endorsed by Core developer Peter Todd, bitcoin holders could vote on the block size with the bitcoin they control, meaning the biggest stakeholders in the Bitcoin economy would have most of the influence on the block-size limit.\n\nAnd lastly, of course, there is the voting method that is already used to determine consensus within the Bitcoin network: hashing power. Hashing power currently gets to determine what the longest chain is, and it also could be used to vote on the block-size limit. This idea was formalized by Core developer Jeff Garzik in BIP100. BIP100 transfers the power to set the block-size limit from the Core development team to the Bitcoin miners by allowing miners to include a message into freshly mined blocks indicating they want to mine bigger – or smaller – blocks. If 90 percent of hashing power endorses either bigger or smaller blocks, the block-size limit will double or halve each 90 days.\n\nAs a possible downside of BIP100, miners – and especially large mining pools – would of course gain even more power over the network than what they have today. But at least it would be transparent.\n\nSolution 6: Extension Blocks\n\nA completely different solution is conceived by hashcash inventor and Blockstream CEO Adam Back. In what is perhaps the most advanced idea to date, Back proposed allowing so-called “extension blocks” on the Bitcoin network. In essence, extension blocks would be an opt-in solution. The 1 megabyte limit could remain intact, while users and miners who’d be willing to handle bigger blocks – say 10 megabytes in size – could run software to process these as well. This would introduce a new dimension to Bitcoin usage, as it would essentially create multiple blockchains with the same bitcoin – the 1 megabyte blockchain would simply be more secure than the 10 megabyte blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, it would still be possible to accept, store and spend bitcoin on the 10 megabyte blockchain, while running only a full node for the 1 megabyte blockchain – or even no full node at all. Users could, for instance, run a full node for the 1 megabyte blockchain on which they store the bulk of their money, while using an SPV wallet for the 10 megabyte blockchain for day-to-day payments. Bitcoin would, of course, be transferable from the 10 megabyte to the 1 megabyte blockchain, though the decreased security on the 10 megabyte blockchain would suggest to wait for some extra confirmations before trusting the payment on the 1 megabyte blockchain.\n\nBonus Solution: Flexible cap\n\nFinally, flexible caps deserve a mention. While not really a complete solution to the block-size issue as a whole – some type of limit still needs to be set somehow – flexible caps could relieve the Bitcoin network from a lot of stress. Separately proposed by mathematician Meni Rosenfeld and Core developer Gregory Maxwell, flexible caps don’t really have a hard limit on the maximum block size, but, instead, penalize miners for producing bigger blocks. As such, a sudden influx of new users, or a surge in transaction volume, would not lead to a severe backlog of transactions that could potentially crash the network. Instead, flexible caps would allow room for growth, while at the same time indicating the limit should be adjusted to improve network performance.\n\nThe Good News and the Bad News\n\nThe good news is that the block-size issue is being widely discussed by smart people coming up with inventive solutions. A number of new ideas have been proposed, while it’s also possible to combine different solutions into new proposals. A dynamic cap, for instance, could easily be combined with a voted cap. Or a flexible cap could be attached to a fixed cap. Or an extension block joined with set growth. It’s even possible to mix three or more solutions to construct a completely unique approach. And, who knows, maybe some genius mathematician or programmer will come up with an entirely novel long-term solution for the block-size issue.\n\nThe bad news, however, is that this long-term solution has probably not yet been conceived; every single possibility so far seems to effectively “kick the can down the road.” All sides of the debate acknowledge that Bitcoin will ultimately need additional scaling solutions built on top of the protocol layer, and possibly a revision of the funding structure to reward miners. Bitcoin is still an experimental work-in-progress, with no clear-cut solutions. In an often heated debate, that is the one thing practically everyone agrees upon.', 'An American has received a blackmail email demanding payment in bitcoin after user data from the extramarital affair platform Ashley Madison was leaked.\n\nThe email, provided to CoinDesk and dated 20th August, was sent by an entity calling itself “Team GrayFlay” and contained the individual’s name and personal address. The user was instructed to send a payment in bitcoin or face exposure.\n\nPublicly available search tools confirm that the customer\'s email address was used to register an account at Ashley Madison.\n\nEarlier this week, a hacker group operating under the name Impact Team released a trove of data containing account details for approximately 32 million users, including tens of thousands tied to government and corporate email accounts. A second release included the site’s source code as well as emails attributed to Noel Biderman, CEO of Avid Life Media, the company that owns Ashley Madison.\n\nThe message stated that the user had seven days after receipt of the email to pay the requested amount.\n\n“Unfortunately your data was leaked in the recent hacking of Ashley Madison and I now have your information. If you would like to prevent me from finding and sharing this information with your significant other send exactly 2.00000054 bitcoins (approx. Value $450 USD) to the following address…”\n\nThe message also contained a link to the CoinDesk bitcoin ATM map and bitcoin exchange market LocalBitcoins, suggesting that “if you need help locating a place to purchase BTC you can start here”.\n\n“If you are already divorced then I suggest you think about how this information may impact any ongoing court proceedings,” the message noted. “If you are no longer in a committed relationship then think about how this will affect your social standing amongst family and friends.”\n\nThe incident does not appear to be isolated. New Zealand tabloid site Stuff reports that an Auckland man received a message containing identical language, including a warning about the cost of legal representation during a divorce.\n\nIt is unclear at present how many more customers have received such messages, though given that the information is publicly available, more blackmail attempts are likely to occur.\n\nThe blackmail attempts come shortly after speculation in the media that Ashley Madison users face such risks.\n\nMany observers have criticized Avid Life Media for negligent security practices resulting in the data breach. The company has said that it is working with law enforcement and, according to a recent statement, would ""seek to hold the guilty parties accountable to the strictest measures of the law"".\n\nAvid Life Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBlackmail image via Shutterstock\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the second Impact Team leak contained ""millions"" of emails attributed to Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The company has plans to expand to other digital currencies and is seriously looking to carry Ethereum’s currency, ether.\n\n“We serve as the bridge between the traditional financial system and the bitcoin ecosystem, allowing developers to focus on what they do best: building great applications with a great user experience,” added Ripley.\n\n“Glidera also provides a revenue-sharing program for wallet providers and application developers, providing a continual stream of revenue instead of a one-time sign-up bonus from other services.”\n\nGlidera recently won best startup at the Inside Bitcoins convention in Chicago and was selected by Techstars Chicago, as one of the world’s premier startup accelerators.\n\nBitcoin developers can now begin using the Glidera development kit to build integrations into their applications.\n\nPhoto ulifunke.com / bitcoin.de', 'If you were hoping for a slightly more positive week in terms of bitcoin news, look away now and don\'t hold your breath!\n\nFollowing last week\'s doom and gloom, this week\'s news coverage leaves much to be desired for those seeking more uplifting trends.\n\nJournalists from outlets across the globe jumped at the chance to cover the bitcoin fork and the subsequent public debate that ensued.\n\nElsewhere, some reporters attempted to connect the dots between recent events and the digital currency\'s fluctuating value – mostly ignored by outlets.\n\n\'Forking Hell\'\n\nThe Economist covered the news about the bitcoin fork in a piece titled ""Forking Hell"", which began:\n\n""Federal Reserve deeply split. Renegade group of board members to create separate American dollar,"" continuing ""such a headline seems highly unlikely, but in this essence is what is happening in the land of bitcoin, a digital currency. ""\n\nThe article then noted how last week, two of bitcoin\'s developers had released an alternative version of the cryptocurrency\'s software. ""With no easy way to resolve feuds, some are warning that this \'fork\' could result in a full-blown schism,"" read the piece.\n\nIt continued:\n\n""The dispute is predictably arcane. The bone of contention is the size of a \'block\', the name given to the batches into which bitcoin transactions are assembled before they are processed. Satoshi Nakamoto, the crypto-buff who created the currency before disappearing from view in 2011, limited the block size to one megabyte.""\n\n""That is enough to handle about 300,000 transactions per day – suitable for a currency used mainly by geeks, as bitcoin once was, but nowhere near enough to satisfy the growth aspirations of its boosters. Conventional payment systems like Visa and MasterCard can process tens of thousands of payments per second if needed,"" it noted.\n\nThe piece then went on to note – quite rightly – that the debate about increasing the block size has long been a matter of contention among the crypto community. ""Overlapping cabals of \'core maintainers\' and \'main developers\' serve as de facto keepers of the currency, especially in Mr Nakamoto\'s continued absence,"" it said. \'Civil War\' Writing for The Guardian, Alex Hern began by alluding to the fact that bitcoin was facing a civil war. Exposing both sides of the debate, Hern noted that the ""fork"" was being supported by Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen, ""two of the most senior developers involved in the bitcoin project"". ""Both are involved in the Bitcoin Foundation, the non-profit group that oversees the currency\'s development: Hearn is the former chair of the foundation\'s law and policy committee, whilst Andresen is the chief scientist of the foundation,"" continued the author. Hern – who\'s written about bitcoin in the past – then went on to cite Hearn\'s post on the bitcoin developer mailing list in which he reasoned that a fork was the only way of solving the deadlock within the bitcoin community. Hearn was cited in the piece as saying: ""I feel sad that it\'s come to this, but there\'s no other way. The Bitcoin Core project has drifted so far from the principles myself and many others feel are important, that a fork is the only way to fix things."" In the meantime, the journalist noted the differences between Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core – the digital currency\'s previous version. ""The key difference ... is size of the blocks into which transactions get grouped every 10 minutes. Core supports a maximum block size of 1mb, which XT increases to 8mb. Hearn, and the other supporters of XT, argue that that increase is necessary if the currency is to continue growing."" Bloomberg\'s Olga Kharif and New York Business Journals\' Michael del Castillo also picked up on the news, respectively noting how bitcoin was having an identity crisis and how the digital currency was at a crossroads. \'Internet drama\' Kudos to Motherboard\'s Sarah Jeong for contributing a witty portrayal of bitcoin\'s struggles. ""So, how are things going with that whole bitcoin thing? Oh, not much, not much, there\'s a new bitcoin client that everyone\'s talking about, with some tweaks to the protocol. Also a major subreddit is censoring all discussions of the new client and Satoshi Nakamoto has apparently returned like an ancient god waking from his magic number, only to send out extremely unhelpful emails to public mailing lists."" Timothy B Lee at Vox, said Jeong, called it a “constitutional crisis"", which she believes was ""an awfully serious take on an Internet drama that more closely resembles a LiveJournal fan fiction community meltdown after everyone finds out that JK Rowling kills Dumbledore."" Similarly to her contemporaries, Jeong explained the heart of the problem, whilst also noting the connection with bitcoin\'s price crash earlier in the week. Keeping with her sarcastic, but effective rhetoric, she said: ""Oh, also, the price crashed almost a hundred dollars yesterday, probably because of the ongoing debate."" Jeong continued: ""Keep in mind that this whole flame-out is over a fairly technical \'fix\' to bitcoin, the kind of detail, where if this were any other piece of software, would make for a dull patch note to a mandatory update. People aren\'t angry because this change is a big deal, people are angry because all change is a big deal. If this is a \'constitutional crisis,\' it\'s only because thousands of little Scalias are losing it over the Constitution being interpreted for a time where people aren\'t riding horses and pooping in buckets."" \'Flash crash\' Jeong was right, the price did crash. As previously reported by CoinDesk, bitcoin\'s price decreased by 14% in just half an hour following a \'flash crash\' on Bitfinex. According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, the cryptocurrency\'s value had been relatively stable between $200 and $255 mark, but fell to $214.36 before midnight (UTC) Although that particular price drop was related to events within Bitfinex, it is fair to say that the digital currency\'s price has been in a downward trend for the last month or so. Whether this can be attributed to the very public forking debate or whether it is namely due to a confluence of factors remains to be seen. Perhaps what one can – and should – take away from this is the mainstream media\'s seeming disinterest in the cryptocurrency\'s price.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

With Ethereum’s high profile release of Frontier and subsequent trading of Ether, social media been aflutter tracking Ether market capitalization on CoinMarketCap.\n\n“Ripple, Nxt, Bytecoin, and PayCoin were much debated topics on how to list due to the amount of coins in existence prior to or at launch.” - Gliss, CoinMarketCap\n\nCoinTelegraph: Why did you start CoinMarketCap?\n\nGliss: When altcoin trading was becoming popular, I noticed that it was difficult to find information on key metrics such as the market cap and supply information. I started the site mainly as a pet project for personal use, but was glad to see that others in the community found it useful as well.\n\nCT: How do you decide to add an altcoin to the Index?\n\nG: A lot of altcoin submissions come through the request form linked on the bottom of the site and if they meet the basic criteria, they get added. The criteria is:\n\nMust be traded on a public exchange with an API\n\nMust have a non-zero volume so that a price can be determined\n\nI also try to proactively add coins that appear on the popular exchanges.\n\nCT: Do you feel comfortable with me calling it an index?\n\nG: Sure.\n\nCT: Ethercoin is ""backed"" by Ethereum (Ethers). Do you count both market caps in the total market cap?\n\nG: Yes, because Ethercoin is a separate blockchain with independent value. If Ethercoin\'s price were to diverge from Ethereum\'s (e.g. due to loss of faith or some malfunction), that event should be captured in the total market cap.\n\nCT: Can you explain the difference between the Available and Total Supply of the coin such as that of Ethereum’s Ether?\n\nG: As of yesterday [8/17], there\'s no difference.\n\nCT: Does Total Supply include provably destroyed coins? I\'m not sure its possible to prove the total number of coins that have been destroyed for a particular coin but there are some notable destructions (great melts?) such as the Proof of Burn by CounterParty (destroying BTC) and Dogeparty (destroying Dogecoin).\n\nG: It does not. If there exists a formal burn address, the amount burned is usually subtracted from the total supply dynamically.\n\nCT: When did you introduce “assets”?\n\nG: I believe it was September 2014 - a bit after the Nxt asset exchange APIs were available.\n\nCT: The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, The U.S. Government Accountability Office, The House Committee on Small Business (PDF), and even The U.S. Department of Treasury (PDF) have used CoinMarketCap as a reference in one form or another. Did any of these citations surprise you?\n\nG: Yes, and it\'s fascinating to watch how the governments are reacting to the innovations in the space.\n\nCT: One obvious feature anyone looking at the site would like to see is the ""Total Market Cap"" including and excluding Bitcoin as a graph over time. When will this be implemented?\n\nG: In terms of new feature development, getting an official API up and running is the priority right now. But with that in place, it should be relatively easy to add the highly requested total market cap graph as well as other interesting graphs.\n\nCT: What were some ""interesting"" entrants into CoinMarketCap? Gaw\'s PayCoin or even Ripple (not mineable) or block explorer failures perhaps?\n\nG: Ripple, Nxt, Bytecoin, and PayCoin were much debated topics on how to list due to the amount of coins in existence prior to or at launch.\n\n“About 40% of the coins ever added to the site are now ‘inactive’ due to failing to meet the basic criteria.”\n\nCT: Has CoinMarketCap ever permanently removed a coin from being listed on the site? If so is there a list of delisted coins? How about delisting an exchange?\n\nG: About 40% of the coins ever added to the site are now ""inactive"" due to failing to meet the basic criteria. In virtually all cases, the reason for delisting is because all exchanges have delisted the coin. There is not currently a list of these coins, but perhaps in the future. Exchanges get delisted when their API fails ceases to work for a significant period of time.\n\nCT: Have you seen Way Back Machine\'s earliest capture of CoinMarketCap?\n\nG: :)\n\nCT: If I\'m not mistaken, I thought you once captured the Bitcoin price via BitcoinAverage. Now I see you are doing your own calculations.\n\nG: That\'s correct. BitcoinAverage is a great resource, but there were a couple of times were BitcoinAverage\'s API glitched and reported highly inflated prices resulting in a ""fun"" data cleanup task. It\'s not good to be reliant on a single data source for such an important data point. Also, it seems that they don\'t include data from some of the lesser known exchanges.\n\nCT: What is something most people don\'t realize about CoinMarketCap?\n\nG: Perhaps how much work goes into maintaining the site. New coins are created every day, key information needs updating and/or to be validated, block explorers break or change, new exchanges need to be integrated, etc.\n\nCT: What will CoinMarketCap look like 6 months or a year from now?\n\nG: Hopefully the same, but with better functionality and a lot more mobile friendly.\n\nCT: The closest thing you have to a logo is on your Twitter profile. Will we see some branding in the future or will you be sticking with elegant simplicity?\n\nG: Anything is possible, although I believe one of the strong points of the site is the ""elegant simplicity.""\n\nCT: What are you surprised that I didn\'t ask you?\n\nG: Nothing, these are really good questions!\n\nCT: Where is the best place to keep informed about CoinMarketCap? Do you monitor your sub-Reddit? I don\'t see a link to it on your website.\n\nG: Twitter is probably the best place. I do monitor other places such as Reddit.\n\nCT: Is there anything else you would like to say to readers of CT?\n\nG: Just thanks to everyone who has given feedback, made a feature request, donated, or even created an altcoin/exchange.\n\n***\n\nAuthor Disclaimer: The author previously received payment by CoinMarketCap for advertising on another cryptocurrency media channel.

Posted by Felix Weis on Friday, May 22, 2015\n\nSince its invention in 2008 by a man using the alias “Satoshi Nakmoto”, bitcoin has gone mainstream and can be used to buy coffee, pay for online dating services, and can even be retrieved from an ATM. There are nearly 14 million bitcoins in circulation worldwide.\n\nThe virtual cash has had its ups and downs. At the peak of its value in November-December 2013, one bitcoin was worth more than $1,100.\n\n2014 wasn’t easy on bitcoin - it lost more than 50 percent of its value over the year. In January, the cryptocurrency was fetching $770 per unit.\n\nNow the ‘exchange rate’ has dropped dramatically since then, currently making $231 as of August 22, according to CoinDesk.\n\nBitcoin has gone mainstream in some places.

US customers can now purchase games, apps and other goodies, with digital currency added to their personal Microsoft accounts.\n\nHowever, not all ATMs are able to dispense hard cash in exchange for the anonymous crypto-currency and not all cafés allow bitcoin payments.', ""This article, written by Huobi founder and CEO Leon Li, and translated by Robert Kuhne, explores the current state of bitcoin in China – how is it being used and how is the government dealing with it? Li also offers some suggestions on the steps he thinks the Chinese authorities should take in regulating cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe past year has seen significantly less bitcoin price volatility than the previous year, which was marked by excessive price speculation and a spectacular bubble. Now we are in a time of more rational development, which provides a good opportunity to take a step back and analyze the current state of the bitcoin industry.\n\nThe concept of bitcoin and its development in China\n\nIn 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, which outlined the conceptual and technical details of a payment system that would allow individuals to send and receive payments without involving any intermediary financial institutions. This was the birth of bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin then gradually spread around the world and began receiving more attention. Bitcoin really caught fire in China in 2013. On 19th November 2013, bitcoin reached the all-time high price of 8,000 CNY on the Huobi exchange, which was a 20,000-fold increase in price from three years before. This extraordinary development brought an unprecedented level of public attention, but also deep concern from government regulators.\n\nOn 5th December 2013, the People's Bank of China and five other related government ministries issued an official notice titled Guarding Against the Risks of Bitcoin, which stated bitcoin may not be used as a currency.\n\nIn reaction to the news, the bitcoin price fell 35% in 40 minutes. In February 2014, the world's largest trading platform, MtGox, declared bankruptcy, which cast a shadow over the industry.\n\nFrom the middle of 2014, bitcoin prices continued in a long, downward trend. The price of one bitcoin as of 12th August 2015 was near the 1,700 CNY level.\n\nGlobal bitcoin industry development\n\nBecause bitcoin is a cutting-edge financial and Internet technology, almost all bitcoin companies are new startups. According to recent statistics, around 100 bitcoin companies have received angel round of investment, some 30 of which are located in Silicon Valley.\n\nChina has about 20 bitcoin companies of notable size with about 800,000 total users and constituting about 70% of global bitcoin trading volume (CNY trading platforms charge zero transaction fees while USD trading platforms do, so the CNY trading volume does appear to be greater than the underlying investment actually is).\n\nAs of July 2015, the bitcoin industry had received more than $800m of venture capital investment, over $400m of which went to Silicon Valley companies.\n\nThe bitcoin industry chain includes production (commonly known as 'mining'), trading, storage and applications.\n\nProduction: bitcoin mining\n\nChina has a strong competitive advantage in bitcoin mining; it currently accounts for at least 50% of the global bitcoin network mining power.\n\nBitcoin trading\n\nTrading is currently the most important financial application of bitcoin. Currently there are around 100 bitcoin trading platforms based in countries all around the world. The top ten bitcoin exchanges are based in the US, China, and Eastern Europe, and account for more than 90% of global trading volume.\n\nBTC/USD and BTC/CNY are the most traded currency pairs, while there are also exchanges for trading BTC for JPY, CAD, AUD, KRW, BRL, and other currencies.\n\nSince 2015, regulatory compliance has become a primary focus of BTC/USD exchanges. US-based exchanges Coinbase and itBit have received relevant business licenses from US authorities. In China, the relevant government departments have not yet enacted a license for digital currencies, so compliance has not been a major barrier.\n\nHuobi, OKCoin, and BTC China are the three major Chinese bitcoin exchanges, along with several smaller exchanges.\n\nBitcoin wallets: storage and transactions\n\nBitcoin is a complicated technology, and is therefore not very convenient for mainstream users. Thus numerous bitcoin wallet service providers have emerged, trying to enable mainstream users to send, receive and store bitcoin easily and securely.\n\nSome 3.6 million bitcoin wallets have been created with bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, while Coinbase has over 2.3 million users. Due to recent regulatory legitimacy that bitcoin has gained in the US, the growth potential of bitcoin wallets is significant.\n\nIn China, due to the lack of merchants accepting bitcoin payments and regulatory uncertainty, users largely prefer to keep their bitcoin funds on bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBitcoin applications: real-life use cases\n\nBehind trading, payments and international money transfers are the next most significant applications of bitcoin today. There are currently more than 100,000 businesses that accept bitcoin payments, including big companies such as Microsoft, Dell, Expedia, and Newegg.\n\nThe largest bitcoin payment processor company is BitPay, which has begun formal cooperation with PayPal.\n\nCircle is an example of a consumer-focused internet financial services company. But there is no doubt that now is still the very early stage of bitcoin application development; much more development must occur before mainstream adoption is possible.\n\nDirection of development\n\nThe PBOC's official notice, which is the only official policy document related to bitcoin, was issued more than a year and a half ago.\n\nSince that time, the bitcoin industry development trends have become more clear and government policies around the world have begun to take shape. Based on our experience and analysis, we have several proposals for bitcoin policy in China.\n\nThere are four possible directions for bitcoin development, and these are not mutually exclusive:\n\n1. Bitcoin as a global financial asset\n\nThis is the most significant function of bitcoin today.\n\n2. Bitcoin as a financial tool for improving money transfer\n\nCurrently, the global clearing and settlement system is very inefficient; long settlement times, high cost from fees and exchange rates, and high complexity.\n\nBitcoin can solve these problems, especially in the field of international remittances, where there are already several bitcoin companies challenging older, larger competitors.\n\n3. Bitcoin as a payment network\n\nBitcoin already works as a payment network today, but relative to competitors like PayPal and Visa, bitcoin is very small.\n\nIt is unclear whether bitcoin will ever become the world's leading payment system because of technical uncertainty about bitcoin's scalability.\n\nThere is also the possibility that existing payment companies (if they innovate) and bitcoin off-chain wallet companies like Circle and Coinbase may maintain the vast majority of global payments.\n\n4. Bitcoin as a non-financial tool\n\nBitcoin may develop beyond basic financial functions to encompass things like decentralized autonomous organizations, smart contracts, prediction markets, internet of things and so on.\n\nChina bitcoin policy recommendations\n\n1. Distinguish between bitcoin and blockchain technology\n\nThe former is a kind of financial asset and tool, while the latter is a new information technology that can be widely applied in many fields.\n\nLegislation in the financial sector should be limited in purpose to preventing systemic risks to the financial system and preventing financial crimes. Regulations must not be too strict, or else the global competitiveness of Chinese enterprises will be inhibited.\n\n2. Regulate within the existing laws\n\nLegislation should regulate bitcoin within the existing, mature financial regulatory system. Secure storage and transmission of digital assets are the core areas of consideration.\n\n3. Observe the actions of other law makers\n\nObserve and analyze the effects of US policy toward bitcoin before making any decisive policies in China. There is no urgency to establish a detailed bitcoin regulatory policy now, so waiting and learning from the US is a low risk strategy which will help form a better policy.\n\n4. Support research and innovation\n\nAcademic research and innovation of bitcoin technology should be given official encouragement and support. This technology has great potential for the future. MIT, IBM, NYSE, Citigroup and many other leading finance and technology institutions have already made considerable investments and achieved initial results.\n\nFor China to be at the forefront of international finance and academia, bitcoin technology must be supported with rational policies and become a high priority for research and development.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tsinghua Financial Review, a translated and edited version has been reposted here with permission.\n\nChinese flag and China statistics images via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Some see it as the salvation of the financial system, others as a new toy, appealing only to the technologically savvy.\n\nSay what you will, but so far, Bitcoin is a technological success. Minor glitches aside, the developer community that originally rallied to launch this project forward turned an immature, yet mind-opening computer protocol into a functioning monetary system, operated and used worldwide.\n\nThese developers’ personal investments have been enormous. It took incredible creativity and innovation to combine knowledge in software engineering and cryptography with a high political sense, game theory with international diplomacy and computer networking with coalition forming and mass persuasion.\n\nStrong leadership does in fact help forge consensus.\n\nAll of these skills are required to lead Bitcoin’s core development. As the stakes go up and the authority of early involved developers gets stretched thin, the big question is, “Can the Bitcoin community create new tools to reduce the burden of politics?”\n\nBitcoin, a decentralized monetary system, aims to be the new money for the Internet arena, eliminating lack of trust and reducing risks to the monetary system that are brought on by human involvement and decision making.\n\nBut even Bitcoin is a machine that is programmed by mere humans. Under the hood, politics can still be divisive when developers disagree on important code changes.\n\nTo qualify for entering the debate, one needs to invest themselves heavily and create the proposed fix; this tends to filter out all but the most opinionated developers. The reward is, of course, proving the other side wrong, and saving the day for millions of users. Oh, and those Bitcoins in your pocket, too.\n\nMaking A Decision\n\nSo how can such integral decisions be made in this new challenging environment containing so many different players?\n\nUntil the end of 2010, Bitcoin had a single voice: “Satoshi Nakamoto,” its mysterious and unidentified creator. The Bitcoin Protocol was embodied in Nakamoto’s software. The community involved was small and Nakamoto’s vision was revered as near prophecy.\n\nBy the end of 2010, Nakamoto disappeared, leaving a large vacuum in leadership. Since then, the Bitcoin community has been left with flesh and blood developers whose legitimacy is tested with every decision they make.\n\nThe debate is exacerbated by the huge financial stakes for participants and by a trust-no-one mentality — ironically, the same mentality that brought forth the need for the Bitcoin system.\n\nUnder the hood, politics can still be divisive when developers disagree on important code changes.\n\nUnlike other software projects, a small tweak in code will affect the entire ecosystem. For example, the current crisis deals with fixing unforeseen effects of an early change that attempted to fix “spam” transactions by introducing limits to the number of transactions.\n\nThere are billions of dollars at stake, so who has the authority and immense responsibility to take risks in such a situation?\n\nLearning From Other Software Projects\n\nIt has been proven over time that strong leadership does in fact help forge consensus. For example, Linus Torvalds, the inventor of Linux, has served as “benevolent dictator” for 24 years of continuous development.\n\nThe technological bets he took have propelled the once-hobbyist operating system into billions of smartphones and millions of servers. With a clear vision of scaling the project, Torvalds stepped in countless times, accepting or rejecting changes. As the original inventor, never bowing to political correctness, his authority was unchallenged.\n\nIf Torvalds didn’t like your code, tough luck. For years, Torvalds was, in a practical sense, the final guardian of Linux’s code. You could always create your own type of Linux (known as a fork) — a departure from the official Linux, which you would control — and include your code.\n\nThat would be considered a dramatic move, a competition to “mainstream Linux.” The tools to move code between the two versions were cumbersome, and code tended to diverge, forcing developers and users to make hard choices.\n\nTo handle the growing number of Linux types and the difficulty of managing them, Torvalds created Git, a decentralized repository of code, allowing people to interact and share code easily.\n\nBitcoin core developers, like neurosurgeons, won’t poke around unless absolutely necessary.\n\nBitcoin and Git have a main similarity, as they both deal with getting to a consensus: Bitcoin is the agreement on which transactions are considered valid; Git is about the agreement on what code changes should be included in the latest version, on top of which developers should work.\n\nGit has changed the politics of code development. You no longer need to beg for a central authority like Torvalds to accept your code change.\n\nWith Git, it’s trivial to post your own version, and it’s trivial for Torvalds to pull it into his code, if he or his lieutenants find it worthy. Every code change is essentially a little fork, but merges became much easier. With changes moving around freely, developers compete on the merits and usefulness of their version.\n\nWhat’s a useful version? How does a piece of code get merit? Those are still subjective questions that Git can’t solve. The authority behind an official version still underlines a struggle of power, but more voices can be heard, and forks are less dramatic.\n\nBy contrast, the consensus on the state of the Bitcoin ledger is mathematical, with rules on which Bitcoin participants agree. In practice, Bitcoin rules are set in the code of the official version.\n\nAlthough the Bitcoin world is not quite where the Linux world is today, perhaps there is a lesson to be learned from Linux’s success versus reinventing the wheel.\n\nWhere Things Differ\n\nThe truth is, Bitcoin can’t afford a code fork. Subtle differences between implementations can lead to several competing versions of the Bitcoin ledger, the main database of all Bitcoin transactions.\n\nSuch a schizophrenic beast wouldn’t survive, as users would receive Bitcoins spent on one ledger and unspent on another. That’s why Bitcoin core developers, like neurosurgeons, won’t poke around unless absolutely necessary. They have this unwritten contract with the Bitcoin community: keep the fundamental rules of Bitcoin, keep the system running, keep it scaling and build up the system that could contend with traditional finance.\n\nWhere To Go From Here\n\nThere’s no doubt that testing needs to be done and changes have to be put in the system, but this has to be done responsibly. Some developers choose to create new coins and test their code there, in an environment separate from Bitcoin. These are commonly known as Alt-coins and do not enjoy the same popularity as Bitcoin.\n\nAnother possible solution is being promoted by the team at Blockstream. The VC-funded company pushes for experiments to happen within the Bitcoin currency, but not as part of the main system. This introduces flexibility, allowing the core developers to innovate without compromising the currency.\n\nOpponents see it as a backdoor to coerce the Bitcoin protocol in a more government-friendly direction, taming the beast. Much like Git, these experiments, known as side-chains, separate the human consensus debate of what should be the authorized version from the underlying code-change mechanism.\n\nMeanwhile, they keep the one consensus that seems to unite Bitcoiners: Keep Bitcoin alive and strong!\n\nCan we really create a human-free consensus?\n\nAs the debates heat up, we’re reminded that consensus-building remains a difficult, human task. Previous attempts by the community have been extremely problematic, at best. VC-funded companies could play a larger role, but most would rather pretend that Bitcoin will be maintained by others.\n\nCompanies that step up to the job will have their work cut out for them, proving their value to the community while being deemed agenda-free.\n\nCan we really create a human-free consensus? Nakamoto left us with an experiment. The current value of the experiment is US$4 billion, and the Bitcoin community is following closely to see how this turns out.\n\nBitcoin may not need a “benevolent dictator,” but as the system reaches new scales, it will need strong leadership, along with new development tools to experiment in bold directions.\n\nFeatured Image: Russell Werges', ""CoinTelegraph spoke with E-coin founders Pavel Matveev and Dmitry Lazarichev about competition in the bitcoin debit card market, the importance of multi-sig security, and crowd investment with BnkToTheFuture.\n\nSince launching their first Bitcoin debit cards to the public in late January 2015, e-coin has been working to build out its platform and push Bitcoin adoption mainstream. In an effort to offer users a convenient way to spend bitcoin wherever Visa is accepted, the company is looking to strengthen its position as a major player in the cryptocurrency debit card market.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What is currently going on with e-coin?\n\nE-coin: We are currently shipping cards to 130+ countries, having 20K+ registered users and around 1.8K cards shipped. A month ago we started shipping cards denominated in EUR and GBP. Currently, we are working on our mobile app, virtual cards and preparing to issue cards with our own design. Also, those in the United States can expect us to start shipping there by the end of the year.\n\n“Everyone can order our bitcoin debit cards with no limitations, waiting lists, pre-orders etc.”\n\nCT: At what rate are you seeing new user growth?\n\nEC: We are seeing a 50% increase every month. Today, we ship 15-25 new cards every day.\n\nCT: Many people in the Bitcoin space have heard of the Xapo Bitcoin debit card. What is your competitive advantage over Xapo?\n\nEC: First of all, unlike Xapo we have successfully passed our Beta stage. Everyone can order our bitcoin debit cards with no limitations, waiting lists, pre-orders etc. Secondly, our cards are denominated in three different fiat currencies (and some more currencies are coming soon). Third, we care about our clients and we believe that great customer service is the key to win clients. We make every effort to answer support tickets in a very timely manner.\n\nThe great advantage of our solution compared to Xapo’s is that users can lock the bitcoin price in fiat currency (let’s say in case of rally on the market) by transferring funds into any of their cards, and later, if they want, they can transfer them back. Just to illustrate: let’s imagine you have 200 bitcoins in a Xapo account and a Xapo card (if you are super lucky), the price on the market is quickly going down and you want to convert it to fiat ASAP. You have 2 options:\n\ntransfer to exchange (add high fees to speed up transaction) and sell there; run to an ATM and use the Xapo card. If it works you will hit a US$400 withdrawal limit, so you won't be able to convert all the funds.\n\nWith our E-Card there is no such problem, just a couple of clicks.\n\nLast, but not least, is the verification process. You can start using E-Card without uploading any documents - it can even be anonymous (limit US$2,500). On the other hand, with Xapo everything starts with uploading your documents, verifying your phone number, etc.\n\n“We don’t use one big hot wallet with all user addresses in one place, instead every user has a fully-functional wallet.”\n\nCT: Let’s switch gears and talk about security. Why should customers feel secure using their bitcoin with e-coin?\n\nEC: We use multi-sig wallets provided by BitGo. Every user in our system has their own multi-sig wallet with 3 sets of keys: one is kept by BitGo, one by E-Coin and one more is used for disaster recovery. We don’t use one big hot wallet with all user addresses in one place (this is very common among Bitcoin exchanges), instead every user has a fully-functional wallet.\n\nIn addition, every wallet has velocity and limit policies in order to prevent suspicious activity. There is a good article written by Ben Davenport from BitGo describing how all 3 sets of keys work. Not to mention, we implement two-factor authentication for access control as well.\n\nCT: You recently implemented an affiliate program. Why was it important to create one? How has it been going?\n\nEC: It is an easier alternative to API, even to our “reseller” package. Existing customers can now refer their friends, followers or clients and earn bitcoins. Customers registering via referral links receive a 25% discount on the price of the card (with standard delivery), and the affiliate partner earns a commission on all their transactions forever. Unlike most affiliate programs out there, ours offers instant payouts, so the partner doesn’t have to wait for the end of the month or quarter to see the report and receive the payment. Bitcoin is sent to his/her wallet immediately after the referral’s card load transaction.\n\nIt is quite an important part of our marketing effort – nothing speaks better about a product than its existing users. And apart from individual existing customers, we are seeing a strong interest from bloggers, professional affiliate campaign partners, etc.\n\nThe program is running quite well. We see good numbers of new signups, and the proportion of customers referred by someone and ordering cards is much higher than in general.\n\nCT: There has been speculation of the company launching a crowd investment campaign. Is there truth to this? If so, when can we expect the launch?\n\nEC: Yes. We will launch our campaign on BnkToTheFuture.com within the first two weeks of September.\n\nCT: Why have you decided to go with BnkToTheFuture?\n\nEC: We see that investors there are quite aware of the Bitcoin industry. This means they can appreciate our solution easier.\n\nCT: How much equity is the company offering?\n\nEC: We are offering up to 10% company equity."", 'While the discussion about Bitcoin Core vs. Bitcoin XT carries on across the world, various mining pools have already implemented the block size changes proposed by Bitcoin XT. Judging from the latest BlockTrail API statistics, multiple “XT” blocks have been mined on the Bitcoin network, all of which are 8 MB in size. Is this a sign of things to come, or just a flash in the pan?\n\nAlso read: BitPay in Favor of Merging BIP 101 Into Bitcoin Core\n\nThe Curious Case of Bitcoin XT Blocks\n\n\n\nIt is no secret that the discussion on whether Bitcoin XT is an altcoin or a proper way forward for the Bitcoin ecosystem will carry on for quite some time. Even though the actual block size change goes in effect as of January 2016, coming to a proper consensus before that date would be a step in the right direction.\n\nWhat really makes this debate so interesting is that regular Bitcoin Core blocks, which are currently 1MB in size, can be mined on pools supporting the Bitcoin XT block size change. Similarly, Bitcoin XT blocks can be mined on mining pools that are running the Bitcoin Core daemon next to the Bitcoin XT client.\n\nOne of the things people seem to forget these days is that it is perfectly acceptable to support both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin XT at the same time. One client does not exclude the other, and both run on the exact same blockchain. However, as of January 2016, that situation might change, depending on which client will “win” the majority consensus vote.\n\nFor the time being, however, most major mining pools seem to be supporting both Bitcoin software clients, leading to interesting statistics as provided by BlockTrail. BTCChina Pool, for example, is running both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin XT clients, leading to block #370838 being 8MB in size, whereas block #370845 is a regular 1MB block.\n\nSpeaking of Bitcoin block #370838, the statistics provided by BlockTrail indicate that, even though this block has a Coinbase Size Vote of 8MB, it is not a BIP101 block. Furthermore, the 8MB size block only has 66 transactions stored inside, whereas the regular 1MB size block contained 1,760 transactions. These numbers do not represent anything though, but it was interesting to note how two blocks from the same pool of a different size can be affected.\n\nMajor Chinese Mining Pools in Favor of Bitcoin XT\n\n\n\nA large portion of the Bitcoin mining community — roughly 75% — has shown indications of being in favor of switching to Bitcoin XT and 8MB blocks as of January 2016. This would explain who the world’s largest mining pools are, all of which are located in China, are running both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin XT daemons simultaneously.\n\nOne notably absent pool on the list of Bitcoin XT supporters is DiscusFish / F2Pool. While browsing to the pool’s latest solved blocks, none of them has a Coinbase Size Vote of 8MB, which seems to indicate the pool is not running a Bitcoin XT daemon at this time. However, it could also mean they are just extremely unlucky in finding 8MB blocks.\n\nF2Pool is not the only pool not finding any 8MB blocks, however. BitFury’s pool, Ghash.io, Eligius and Kano CKPool do not seem to be running mining operations through the Bitcoin XT daemon at this point. Slush, one of the oldest Bitcoin mining pools in history, is actively finding BIP101 blocks, albeit they are not 8MB in size.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the mining situation evolves as the deadline for a majority consensus decision draws closer. Most mining pools seem to be in favor of switching, as is quite a large portion of the Bitcoin community. But that doesn’t mean that those who oppose BIP101 should not be heard.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on BIP101, and which client are you using right now?

We believe that creating a good mobile experience for the end-user concept is a key catalyst for adoption, that’s why we decided to release Android & iOS apps along with our platform, so developers and companies can test their ideas and instantly engage with their user base.\n\nWith the new platform, developers with little to no Bitcoin knowledge , can issue and manage digital assets for various uses, from financial industry (shares, bonds, stocks), records (certificates, copyrights, documentation) to ownership (event tickets, vouchers, gift cards).\n\nHow is blockchain technology used in Colu?\n\nThe underlying technology we are using is the new implementation of colored coins developed by Colu. We use this protocol in our Colu Engine that allows individual developers to issue and manage digital assets according to their needs and integrate them in their project. Our SDK/API allows easy integration with the platform for various of use cases and automatically handles all bitcoin-related issues in the backend. By using Bitcoin Blockchain we can manage to develop tools relatively fast with high level of trust and security. We focus on how to make blockchain technology trusted by defining the guidelines and rules surrounding digital assets.\n\nColu is currently in beta, what does this mean for anyone looking to give Colu a test run? When should we expect a full release?\n\nAt the moment, anyone can go to colu.co , check the Quick Asset Issuance and start issue their own digital assets and see them on the Block Explorer.\n\nYou can also download the Colu Bag app (available for iOS and Android) – mobile digital wallet that enables to store, send, receive and manage digital assets in one place. Soon, we will be out of beta and will enable customizing and managing features when it comes to issue your digital assets.\n\nHow do you see colored coins and blockchain technologies being used by consumers in the near future?\n\nBy creating a layer on top of Bitcoin, we can extend the functionality of digital currency. We already seeing new startup and ideas released in the last months that leverage those possibilities – we believe we are very close to a point those ideas break the “POC” stage into mainstream adoption. The fact that you can give your users a “seamless” experience for using digital asset without any complexity that Bitcoin sometimes enforces might be the catalyst for adoption. Our greatest challenge is to really nail the usability factor for this technology without compromising on security but we are confident that this technology has the potential to exceed Bitcoin’s user base.\n\nAnything you’d like to add specifically to say to the readers?\n\nWe welcome all developers to start experiment with the platform and issue relevant digital assets and services, customized to their needs.\n\nThank you, Moran, for your time!\n\nWhat do you think of Colu?

Most of these cloud mining companies have been struggling to make ends meet, which can be partially blamed on the low Bitcoin price. On the other hand, there have been quite a few cloud mining services who have turned out to be Ponzi schemes. It looks like Scrypt.cc has deliberately made some wrong moves to defraud customers in the past few days.\n\nAlso read: XScrypt Cloud Mining Provider Shows True Ponzi Colors?\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of Bitcoinist.\n\nScrypt.cc – Recovering From a Hack and Loss of 3,500 BTC\n\nMost people were not surprised when Scrypt.cc announced their platform got hacked a few months ago. Cloud mining companies attract a lot of attention from investors, but also from hackers and people with less than honorable intentions. With the platform keeping a large portion of funds in their hot wallet, it was only a matter of time until somebody tried to hack Scrypt.cc.\n\nPush came to shove in June of 2015 when the announcement was made regarding a breach of the Scrypt.cc hot wallet. Nearly 3,500 Bitcoins, nearly all of which belonged to the company itself. All in all, very little customer funds was missing, which came as a bit of a surprise. Then again, storing such a large amount of non-refundable funds in a wallet that is connected to the internet at all times, might not have been the smartest business decision.\n\nHowever, the Scrypt.cc customers were affected in a harsh way because of this stolen funds. Mining earnings were reduced by as much as 80% for an extended period, which would allow Scrypt.cc to recoup some of their losses as well. Rather than chalking up the hack as a loss, the cloud mining platform owners decided to take funds from paying customers to fill up their own pockets again.\n\nWith mining earnings reduced by such a large amount, most Scrypt.cc users started selling off their cloud mining power and recoup any amount of funds they could. Doing so led to a crash of the price per kh/s, nearly crashing the entire market. This was to be expected, of course, as there was no sign of improvement in terms of mining earnings.\n\nTo this very day, the mining earnings are still drastically reduced, to great chagrin of the Scrypt.cc users. But that is not the worst part, as it seems like the platform owners have taken matters into their own hands by draining customer balances in exchange for nearly worthless mining hashpower. Hardly any of the Scrypt.cc customers have noticed this up until now, even though the draining of Bitcoin balances started as early as a few days ago.\n\nTurning On Auto Invest Without Customer Consent\n\nEarlier this week, a few Scrypt.cc customers noticed nearly an entire day had gone by without receiving mining payouts. Such an event is quite odd, considering Scrypt.cc pays out a small amount of earnings every 10 minutes. Fortunately, the matter resolved itself the next business day, and payouts were trickling in again at a frequent pace.\n\nIt seems as if this change spelled the doom of Scrypt.cc as well. From that day forward, all customers account suddenly had “Auto Invest” enabled, without asking for the account owner’s consent to do so. Enabling this feature means that existing Scrypt.cc customers will buy additional mining hashpower at the cheapest possible price, and funds will be taken from their existing Bitcoin balance.\n\nThere has been no email communication or notice regarding this change, but we can confirm that multiple users have been affected by this issue. As a result, most users are left behind with nearly empty Bitcoin balances and find themselves owning a lot more [useless] hashpower than they did before.\n\nTo make matters even worse, there are no buy orders left on the Scrypt.cc order book right now. The average price per kh/s has bottomed out to 100 Satoshi and is expected to go even lower once users start liquidating their redundant hashpower. Sell orders are still being executed and are filed by unsuspecting buyers whose accounts are still set to “Auto Invest”.\n\nWithdrawals To Be Processed or Not?\n\nThe big question now is whether or not any outstanding withdrawals will be processed by Scrypt.cc. Most people will have little to no Bitcoins left to withdraw, but there will be quite a few people who still have outstanding withdrawals. According to Scrypt.cc policy, all withdrawals are processed manually and should be honored within 24 hours, and we will keep an eye on the situation as events unfold.\n\nAll signs point towards Scrypt.cc being the latest in a long list of cloud mining companies to turn into a massive Ponzi scheme. Ever since mining rewards were reduced by 80%, things were looking grim. The company has never managed to recover from this setback, and it looks like the end is very near for Scrypt.cc.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of Bitcoinist.\n\nAre you a Scrypt.cc customer, and if so, did you have any outstanding Bitcoin balance in your account?

People involved in the legal cannabis business have a lot of advantages if they use Bitcoin, and this conference explores those advantages. Similarly, the organizations dealing in Bitcoin and marijuana have something in common; for instance, both face rejection from banks, as banks think the companies are a source for money laundering.\n\nThus, cannabis and cryptocurrencies can help one another grow smoothly, provided there is some understanding among the stakeholders. The Crypto Cannabis Conference is a step forward towards the same goal, as the participants plan to discuss and debate the role Bitcoin can play in the larger interest of the cannabis industry. A number of cannabis sellers have started accepting Bitcoin payments, this helps both as buyers remain anonymous and the seller gets the business.\n\nConfirmed Participants\n\nRobert Stephan is the event founder & coordinator. He is Colorado’s Bitcoin Syndicate, has been working on crypto cannabis for more than two years, and is known for his support for crypto cannabis — as he aims to convert the entire legal cannabis industry to Bitcoin.\n\nCaleb Chen (Panelist)\n\nCaleb Chen is from Bitcoinist, is an industry veteran, and is currently enrolled for Msc in Digital Currency at University of Nicosia.

Since the enactment of Colorado Amendment 64 in November 2012, adults aged 21 or older can grow up to six cannabis plants (with no more than half being mature flowering plants) privately in a locked space. They can legally possess all cannabis from the plants they grow as long as it stays where it was grown as well as legally possess up to one ounce of cannabis while traveling.\n\nThe state allows consumption in a manner similar to alcohol, with equivalent offenses proscribed for driving; however, consumption in public remains illegal. Cannabis can be gifted as well, as the government allows it for any citizen 21 years of age or older. The amendment 64 has provision for licensing of cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities, testing facilities, and retail stores.\n\nThough visitors and tourists in Colorado can use and purchase marijuana, they cannot take it out of the state, and it is prohibited at Denver International Airport.\n\nWill you be attending the Crypto Cannabis Conference?

It has been proven yet again after an American received a blackmail email demanding ransom in bitcoin. The email was sent to an undisclosed American by somebody calling themselves as “Team GreyFlay” threatening to expose the person as a user of recently hacked extramarital affair platform Ashley Madison.\n\nThe blackmailers have demanded exactly 2.00000054 BTCs, to be payable within a week from the American victim. Otherwise, Team GreyFlay has threatened to find his information among Ashley Madison user data and share it with his spouse. The GreyFlay was also considerate enough to point out bitcoin ATMs and suggest LocalBitcoins.com where the victim can buy bitcoin to pay the ransom.\n\nAshley Madison, one of the well-known online dating and social networking service targeting users who are either married or in a committed relationship was hacked last month. The hackers had stolen all customer data including names, addresses, credit card information and other intimate details including sexual fantasies posted on the platform. They demanded Ashley Madison and another site EstablishedMen.com, both belonging to Canadian media group Avid Life Media Group to be shut down in exchange for not making the stolen data public.\n\nWhile both sites continued to be operational despite the threats, the hacker group under the name Impact Team made good on their earlier threat and released close to 10GB of customer data into the public domain.

08/23/2015,"['Bitcoin has been declared the “end of money as we know it” and as a currency for our times; decentralised, and created specifically for seamless exchange on the Internet. That is, it would be, if everyone knew exactly what it was and was actually prepared to use it.\n\nThe problem is, for most of the general public, Bitcoin still remains a mystery. In a recent survey of consumers carried about by analyst firm PWC, only 6% said that they were very familiar or extremely familiar with currencies like Bitcoin. 83% of those surveyed said they had little to no idea what Bitcoin was.\n\nContradicting this is the fact that there has been a great deal of publicity around Bitcoin which is reflected by people searching for the term. Google Trends for example, shows that searches for Bitcoin exceeded those for two other payment systems, Apple Pay and Google Wallet.\n\nGoogle Trends\n\nMost of this attention has come from well publicised stories of Bitcoin and its association with drug crime on the Internet or hacks of Bitcoin exchanges like Mt Gox, where hundreds of millions dollars worth of the currency was stolen.\n\nSo what is it exactly?\n\nBitcoin is first and foremost a currency like any other. One Bitcoin can be exchanged for almost every other type of currency, on any number of “exchanges”. At the moment, 1 Bitcoin is worth about US $230.\n\nOnce a Bitcoin is bought, it can be used to buy goods at a price in Bitcoins that is determined by the current exchange rate quoted on the various exchange markets. This is no different to using Australian dollars or Euros to buy things on the Internet priced in US dollars say.\n\nUsing Bitcoin to buy things is very much the same as using electronic payments from a bank. The merchant will have an account number that is used when sending the required number of Bitcoin.\n\nOnce sent, the merchant will confirm payment has been received and everything then proceeds just as if payment was made in any other currency.\n\nIf it is that simple, why does everyone get confused?\n\nThe trouble Bitcoin has had from the start is that it was an invention of computer science. Many of its attributes are based on the intricacies of the technology that makes it work and of interest only to specialists.\n\nFor it to replace current payment systems, Bitcoin had to be marketed as having distinct advantages over using credit cards or services like PayPal. The difficulty with this is that the advantages are subjective. And merchants, and the public as a whole, have had a hard time in seeing them. The advantages of Bitcoin have certainly not been enough to warrant using it in preference to credit cards.\n\nBut what about the “block chain”?\n\nAs the marketing around Bitcoin hasn’t fared too well in targeting it as a replacement for credit cards and electronic banking, people have instead started talking about the really confusing part of Bitcoin called the “block chain”.\n\nNeeding to explain how the block chain works has also been a real weakness in the marketing of Bitcoin. Very few people care how banks agree that a transaction has taken place. They only care that they can look at their bank account and see a withdrawal of a specific amount at a specific time. What magic happens behind the scenes to make that work is really of no consequence.\n\nPeople have focused on the technology because somehow it was put forward as being more clever than how banks do things at present. But they argued this without actually acknowledging that the current system operates incredibly well and is extremely efficient. The current banking system has been baked into society for thousands of years and despite some of its failings (high charges and service quality) has succeeded because, it just works.\n\nIt’s not that complicated\n\nWhilst the average member of the public is still puzzling over why they should care about Bitcoin, technologists and finance specialists will continue to argue about the relative merits, or otherwise, of the specific attributes of cryptocurrencies over our current payment systems. None of that is central however to understanding what Bitcoin is.\n\nAll that is really important to know is that Bitcoin is simply another form of money.', 'When it announced its blockchain innovation lab earlier this year, UBS caused a ripple of excitement and trepidation.\n\nIt was a watershed moment: one of the world’s wealthiest investment banks was putting its money, and public image, behind blockchain technology. Not only that, but it would be experimenting deep in the financial heart of London.\n\nThe narrative around bitcoin has shifted since the cryptocurrency first gained notoriety via illegal activities and anti-bank sentiment. The finance world is now racing to test it – and other blockchain technologies – out in startups, research projects and in-house R&D teams.\n\nAlex Batlin, the former engineer heading up the lab, told CoinDesk that while financial technologies like peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding platforms are on the rise, it\'s blockchain technology that could be the biggest threat or opportunity for banks like UBS.\n\n""In principle it\'s probably one of the biggest confluences of technology and business right now.""\n\nHis mission over the next year is to figure out how best to ""future proof"" the bank and find a way for shareholders to profit from these rapid changes.\n\nThe ROI problem\n\nBatlin describes the bank\'s innovation process as ""robust"", with business and technology departments engaging in a two-way conversation about potential threats and opportunities as they surface.\n\nTypically, UBS will be able to assess the return on investment (ROI) for a new idea before it makes a commitment to explore it further. However, as blockchain technology is so new, and changing rapidly, the bank’s usual strategy has gone out the window.\n\n""In this case to create the ROI, you have to spend so much money ... you need an ROI of an ROI,"" Batlin said.\n\nFor him, it\'s a chicken-and-egg situation – and one that UBS has a shot at cracking. It has assembled what he terms a ""small, agile team"" consisting of developers, business analysts and project managers inside Europe\'s biggest FinTech accelerator, Level39.\n\nIn \'back of the envelope\' style, these members will sit together to work out if a business model could be improved or redefined by blockchain technology – and if its benefits outweigh the potential costs.\n\nReally, the lab is a year-long experiment for UBS to reduce the unknowns around blockchain technology, of which there are many.\n\n""We believe it\'s the best combination of making sure we don’t spend too much but also getting the most out of our learnings from that,"" he said.\n\nBatlin says a lot of the team’s time is spent brainstorming and sketching out ideas in meeting rooms, coming up with whacky new business models and then testing them.\n\n""We conduct experiments, which are different to proof-of-concepts, as we don\'t have a concept yet. We’re just saying, here\'s a hypothesis, let\'s figure out could it work at all,"" he continued.\n\nMost of the projects UBS is building won\'t look anything like working solutions just yet.\n\n""The technology is so nascent, it\'s important to have the right set of expectations,"" he added.\n\nInteroperability\n\nBack in March 2014, UBS wrote at length about how banks could co-opt bitcoin for traditional functions. Its undesired \'quirks\' could be removed, while benefits could be absorbed to reduce duplication and bottlenecks in the current financial system, the report read.\n\nSince then, a wave of new companies – alongside some existing bitcoin firms – have announced custom ledger systems that adapt blockchain technology for the world’s financial institutions.\n\nAs the space is highly intermediated, Batlin admits there is potential for a system that can remove complexity from the market and reduce the costs of participation. However, with multiple blockchain systems vying for market share, he warned that companies could be replacing one problem with another – reduced interoperability.\n\n""If you are participating in over 100 blockchain networks, all you are doing is swapping one set of complicated technology for another.""\n\nRather than multiple closed systems, similar to MSN and AOL, for him, the real cost savings come with a common standard, like the Internet, which he describes as a ""multi-asset chain where I can trade securities, derivatives, cash all in the same platform"".\n\nWhile there are risks pegging financial services to one set of standards, there are precedents in recent history that support the idea that common standards can support this amount of risk, he said.\n\nThough banks are not famed for collaboration, reports indicate there is some cross-market cooperation or coordination happening already. Batlin agrees that this is crucial for the technology to flourish, and for banks to get the most from it:\n\n""This is a cross-market initiative. There is no point having a private road where you only drive in a circle on your own.""\n\nLondon calling\n\nThe UK – and London – are fast becoming a hub for companies at the intersection of finance and tech. The country accounted for 42% of Europe\'s FinTech investment last year, while the sector employs more than 135,000 people, many of which are in the capital.\n\nBesides its mature FinTech ecosystem, London was an attractive home for the Swiss bank\'s project due to the UK government\'s open-minded stance on cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nLevel39\'s hub in Canary Wharf is close to Innovate Finance, the FinTech trade association with strong ties to government, and the FCA is just across the road. The Bank of England is also known to be a regular visitor.\n\n""It\'s easy for people to come and meet here. You are not asking for people to come to UBS, you are asking for people to come to Level39,"" Batlin said. Alongside CIO Oliver Bussmann, he is a regular mentor to fledgling startups at Level39, including blockchain-based platform Tide Payments.\n\nWhile some startups and VCs in the ecosystem, including Index\'s Ophelia Brown, have berated banks for denying bitcoin startups bank accounts and quelling innovation in the process, Batlin sees it differently.\n\n""We have thousands of clients, globally, who depend on us to provide them with the advice, expertise and opportunities they need to protect and grow their wealth, so we naturally have to be a little more cautious and it would be irresponsible for us to take the risks they [startups] do.""\n\nBatlin went on to say that some problems could be too expensive for startups to solve.\n\n""A team of 12 can accomplish brilliant things, for sure. But some challenges require a level of resource to overcome, which the likes of UBS can contribute and become a valuable partner in this new world,"" he said, concluding:\n\n""I think the partnership between bigger companies and startups can work really well because we can complement each other.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Has the mainstream media become more informed and balanced in its coverage of bitcoin?\n\nDavid Seaman: I think so overall. The media will get excited about Bitcoin again when the price demands attention. It\'s not exciting or sexy at the moment. They want either a train wreck to report on or a rags to riches story for Bitcoin users.\n\nCT: What’s your take on the exodus of crypto-companies leaving New York after the BitLicense was introduced? What’s your opinion on Ben Lawsky’s alleged cronyism?\n\nDS: It’s good they\'re leaving. I can\'t believe what New York did. Had a bureaucrat who was really supposed to be there to regulate BIG BANKS instead serving subpoenas to all these start-up Bitcoin entrepreneurs in his state and making everyone fear what this legislation would look like, then the final legislation does come out and it completely sucks.\n\n“Getting different expensive licenses from all 50 states to add a ‘Bitcoin accepted’h ere jpg to your business site should be completely anathema to every player in crypto[.]”\n\nIf we allow one state government the insane Alice in Wonderland luxury of being able to charge licenses for what amounts to international open source software development and p2p grassroots money, that\'s a really scary precedent. Getting different expensive licenses from all 50 states to add a ""Bitcoin accepted"" here jpg to your business site should be completely anathema to every player in crypto, from indifferent day trader to startup to Coinbase.\n\nCT: The Bitcoin block size debate has divided the community. What side are you on? What’s your opinion on Bitcoin XT and will Bitcoin overcome this challenge?\n\nDS: I don\'t really have a side. If the math dictates we\'ll need larger blocksize soon, the community should accept that and plan for the future. What\'s really troubling is how this was handled. It was a PR debacle. Everything Bitcoin does these days is becoming a PR debacle. It shows a level of incompetence. Some claim there\'s some bad code in XT that lessens the user privacy potential of the Bitcoin protocol. Also a mod of /r/bitcoin, who also runs bitcointalk.org, took it upon himself to censor all discussion of XT from the Bitcoin subreddit. That doesn\'t sit well with people who came to crypto in the first place because they were sick of strangers telling them what to do and what they can post about on the Internet.\n\nCT: Will the next global financial crisis propel bitcoin and cryptcurrency into the mainstream?\n\nDS: Yes.\n\nCT: Why do you think bitcoin price is currently stagnant and stuck well below 300?\n\nDS: Wish I knew. I think there\'s a significant amount of downward pressure on the price daily, due to Bitcoin\'s algorithm and the coin mining schedule itself. Investors need to pick up a million dollars of coin per day for the price just to remain stable, so Bitcoin is stuck in that chicken and egg dilemma it\'s been in to varying degrees from day one.\n\n“If you bet on yourself and you\'re a good player, you now have a source of income. From your video game habit.”\n\nCT: Bitcoin and other crypto like Hyper are increasingly being used in gaming. What will gaming be like in 5, 10 years?\n\nDS: It’s going to be amazing. Really something. Microbetting on outcomes of online multiplayer games, Hyper and Bitcoin already have that actually; if you bet on yourself and you\'re a good player, you now have a source of income. From your video game habit. In 5 years a blackjack table winning in Macau will be instantly transmittable and interoperable with millions of crypto-accepting businesses throughout China and the rest of the world. Within minutes, the winnings from that table in Macau could be on a cocktail waitress\' smartphone in Vegas as a tip she received, it could be in a parking meter, or it could find itself back in the massive online gaming communities that will exist by then.\n\nSkip ahead ten years, these currencies that are still in use by then will have changed hands so many millions of times throughout so many countries that the notion of someone owning a ""full"" Bitcoin or Litecoin or Hyper might seem kind of unreal to your average person. Because people will be thinking in smaller denominations by then. The velocity of currency is going to be insane. Hyper\'s creator has told me he sees gaming currency as a ""rhizome."" There\'s going to be no beginning nor end, it will just be demand everywhere, these currencies will be the roots and pretty soon they\'re gonna start sucking up a lot of water.\n\n“The gaming network Hyper runs is now accessible to anyone who holds Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, or 40 other coins. This is how cryptoeconomies will grow: stop competing and just make everything interoperable.”\n\nCT: You’re a big believer in the importance of altcoins. How has the altcoin market changed since we last spoke and are there any coins you’re particularly excited about?\n\nDS: Erik Voorhees\' Shapeshift.io excites me, based in Switzerland outside the predatory grasp of provincial governments trying to grapple with how they should ""deal with the Bitcoin thing"" -- funny that\'s the default reaction to any potentially freeing innovation today: How do we slow this down? How do we license it? How do we keep the average person far away from it?\n\nAnyway, Shapeshift is great because when a coin like Hyper gets added to their system, as happened recently, it\'s now in a different ecosystem, a bigger network. The gaming network Hyper runs is now accessible to anyone who holds Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, or 40 other coins. This is how cryptoeconomies will grow: stop competing and just make everything interoperable.\n\nMarkets are 24/7/365 and mostly still unregulated so price discovery is happening. Let the users decide what these things are worth. And something like Shapeshift provides a way for all that to happen because I don\'t think your average user wants to spend all day on Bittrex watching charts. They heard about Litecoin in the news and they want some quickly. That\'s what Shapeshift solves, too.\n\nAs far as individual coins go, my tastes change so frequently due to how the market is evolving. Privacy is out, gaming is in. Old is sexy, and the developer matters. Generally speaking, I think Hyper and Litecoin are the two that will most impress anyone entering the alt market for the first time today. I see both being around in the market for a long time.\n\nCT: Financial crisis aside, what’s the best way to introduce people to cryptocurrencies?\n\nDS: Tipping someone on Twitter or Reddit using ChangeTip is a great way to be a nice human to someone, and incidentally might start that person\'s cryptocurrency ""Inception"" hahaha. Your tip could send them into a night of Googling about Bitcoin, eventually leading them to buy a coin or two on Coinbase. Speaking of which, Coinbase\'s retooled referral program is great. If you have a following of some kind, you can earn some extra coins quickly by spreading the word about Coinbase -- this obviously helps crypto awareness too. But it\'s nice to be paid for your efforts when one of your referrers buys a coin!\n\n“Netflix didn\'t need to roll out an ‘adoption guide’ for Blockbuster executives, and crypto doesn\'t need to worry about bank adoption anymore.”\n\nCT: What do you think about big banks like Citi researching and developing their own crypto coins? Where do you stand with regards to permissioned/permission-less ledgers?\n\nDS: The banks are idiots. Netflix didn\'t need to roll out an ""adoption guide"" for Blockbuster executives, and crypto doesn\'t need to worry about bank adoption anymore. They had their chance and laughed when crypto could have used the credibility boost. Now, to be a blockchain-less financial house soon won\'t make much sense to the world. And when millennials and whoever else start accepting Bitcoin as payment for wages and freelance labor, as is already happening in some circles... that\'s the day banks are really screwed.\n\nBecause when you\'re paid in bitcoin and your coffee shop and landlord gladly take the top cryptos -- that\'s THE DAY banks are really screwed. By then they will have a bit of a crypto thirst, too! We forget these currencies ARE deflationary. Satoshi was a noble guy, I think, but he didn\'t intend for himself or his users to be locked in eternal poverty. Sooner or later, the bum rush happens, and the banks still alive by then will surely ""get"" crypto at that point. But their opinion just won\'t matter all that much. I don\'t ask the post office how to format an email.\n\nCT: How has ChangeTip been treating you? Are you still a fan or do you have a new favorite app?\n\nDS: ChangeTip is great. Victoria has really done a lot to keep their company in touch with what the community wants, and as a result ChangeTip is becoming a very useful Swiss army knife.', 'Recognizing the need for advanced engineering to ensure privacy and protection of digital assets, the Stanford University School of Engineering in Stanford, Calif. will offer a new course on this subject in September.

The Bitcoin market is also struggling to cope with the selling pressure and has returned to its crucial support of $220.\n\nLitecoin is currently trading at $3.330 and is well within its medium term trading range.\n\nImage: https://www.tradingview.com/x/huLFXlKI/\n\nIn the previous Litecoin price technical analysis Sell on Rallies, we discussed how Litecoin remains weak and any rise in the valuation can be used to go short. That holds valid for even today.\n\nThe latest technical indicators are nowhere positive or indicate that a reversal may be around the corner, and hence, I remain bearish on the cryptocurrency.\n\nLitecoin Chart Structure – After crossing $3.500, bulls aimed for the higher end of the trading range (marked in the chart above) but were soon served with fresh selling pressure which pushed the price down to a low of $3.231. The support or the lower end of the trading range is near $3.000 while the resistance is close to $3.610.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence – The MACD has crashed to another low of -0.2078 while the Signal Line has hit -0.1507. The Histogram is depicting the bearishness with a value of -0.0571.\n\nMomentum – The Momentum indicator reflects no change in the sentiment with its relatively unchanged value of -0.6305.\n\nMoney Flow Index –The MFI is now at 36.8091.\n\nRelative Strength Index – The RSI value has once again dropped below the 40-mark to 38.2243 as Litecoin plummets.\n\nConclusion\n\nI continue to remain bearish on Litecoin tracking the technical indications derived from the daily LTC-USD price chart.\n\nIf the Litecoin market offers you a price rise, go short.

Prediction markets work on the idea that large groups of people are able to make much more accurate predictions than, small teams of experts. Augur enables participants in its prediction markets to now put their money where their mouth is.\n\nParticipants back their beliefs by placing wagers on the outcomes of diverse events, that range on everything from politics, the economy and even the environment itself. The funds are stored securely on Augur’s platform, and are accessible only to the owners of the funds. The decision on the outcome of events is made by the consensus of Reputation token holders.\n\nParticipants have the opportunity of purchasing Reputation tokens, and using those tokens to achieve consensus based on the outcome of events. The Reputation tokens are available for purchase from August 15th 2015 through to October 1st 2015, and come with graduated bonus schemes which start at 10% and taper off to zero at the end of the crowdsale.\n\nAugur has a team of seven professionals who have experience in different areas of software engineering, including block chain programming.\n\nCCN.LA interviewed the developers and following were their responses to our questions.\n\nWho are the people behind Augur?\n\nJack Peterson is a physicist, entrepreneur, and software developer. He is currently building Augur’s simulation engine and JavaScript API. Joey Krug took a leave of absence from Pomona College to focus full time on Augur. He conducted the first Bitcoin transaction via sound as well as the first Bitcoin transaction via iOS-Android Bluetooth LE. He is currently making Augur’s consensus implementation faster and more accurate.\n\nScott Leonard is a full-stack web developer. He received a degree in Computer Information Systems with an emphasis on Business Administration at Humboldt State University. With over twenty years experience working in the field — for large media and tech companies (including CBS Interactive and Silicon Graphics), non-profits and small, open-source projects — he has developed a holistic perspective on systems design and a critical eye for developing technologies. He’s been building Augur’s HTML5 web client.\n\nChris Calderon studied mathematics at Whittier College. As a member of the Augur project, his focus is on Augur’s Ethereum (Serpent) implementation. He believes Augur’s best use will be in developing countries, where it could be a cheap, accessible way for many people of limited means to better hedge against, well, anything.\n\nThere is also Jeremy Gardner, who is Augur’s Director of Operations; Tony Sakich, Director of Marketing and Peronet Despeignes who is the SpecialOps guy on the team.\n\nHave they been involved in any other projects in the cryptocurrency / block chain field?\n\nYes. Tony was a marketing manager at BitPay. Jack developed a Ripple gateway. Joey developed a bitcoin point-of-sale (PoS) system and founded the Pomona Bitcoin Club. Jeremy is the founder of the College Cryptocurrency Network and worked with Joey on the PoS system.\n\nAugur describes itself as a distributed oracle. Isn’t the likelihood of someone trading based on insider information still a risk?\n\nJoey Krug: So, there are two halves of Augur that are important to keep distinct. There’s the prediction market side (where people speculate on the outcomes of future events) and the oracle system side (where people report the outcome of a market which pays out people who predicted correctly). The insider information risk only pops up on the prediction side. Most people consider insider trading bad (and in many cases, it’s illegal), but it’s important to note that having insider information and speculating on it isn’t equivalent to insider trading as defined by the law. And in many cases, having insider information revealed is good for markets, because whoever is the insider and buys up a bunch of one outcome has then revealed something useful to the market. For instance, let’s say there’s a market on whether a certain drug trial will be viewed as clinically significant. If I’m a patient in that study, and I do well, and buy the “yes” outcome, that’s actually contributing useful information to that market.\n\nDo you see the Augur model completely disrupting more established methods such as opinion polling and surveys, or will it settle to become just one of the available alternatives?\n\nJeremy Gardner: Absolutely. Why try to reach a random sampling population when so many folks don’t have land lines and don’t pick up [their phone] for random numbers, nor want to talk to the (often inaccurate) pollsters? And who likes surveys? When people put their money where their mouth is, we derive real opinions, not just stated beliefs. If Augur gets popular, it will be the most powerful forecasting and crowd consensus tool in human history.\n\nAssuming that the crowdsale does take off, what other products and services can we expect to see from the Augur platform?\n\nJeremy Gardner: We will be adding support for more types of markets, (e.g. scalar, categorical, and multidimensional markets), huge UI improvements, blockchain.info style accounts, mobile versions of the site, sorting features, and more.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Users of Circle Inc., the Boston-based bitcoin startup, have been disputing with the company regarding payment verifications and banning of bank accounts. According to its users, Circle has started to hold payments for several days and ban accounts, in the tradition of Paypal.\n\nCircle states on its website that it “believes that sending and receiving money should be […] instant and free.” Ironically, the startup has made it incredibly difficult to send payments and is creating a centralized payment infrastructure on top of the bitcoin, which negates the decentralized benefit of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn accordance with Circle’s long list of policies that specifies the need for payment verifications and the banning of Circle accounts that engage in “illegal” purchases, the company has begun banning bank accounts and freezing payments for days for additional verification.\n\nOne merchant found out the hard way when one of her customers used a Circle wallet to purchase products on the merchant’s e-commerce store, Hairlosstalk. The website suggested its users to purchase bitcoin using Circle, because it allows users to connect their bank accounts and buy bitcoins with USD.\n\nOne user emailed Stacia, the owner of the Hairlosstalk, saying that banks had banned bitcoin purchases and therefore limited the user’s access to Circle. However, Stacia found that Circle banned the user’s bank accounts and credit cards and restricted the user from purchasing bitcoins.\n\nStacia said:\n\nClearly he thinks his bank and credit cards have banned Bitcoin, but what happened is that Circle banned his bank accounts and credit cards. I thought the entire point of Circle was instant wallet funding via credit cards? I feel pretty embarrassed right now to be honest. Circle recently raised over US$50 million in funding, with support from Goldman Sachs and IDG Capital Partners of China. The bitcoin wallet and exchange allows users to deposit dollars and bitcoins and send it to anyone around the world “for free.” However, recent events, user experiences and new policies suggest that Circle is shifting to a more traditional financial platform, more like a bank than a bitcoin exchange.\n\nIn a few months, Circle’s vision for its bitcoin platform went from “instant” to a few days and, quite possibly, a couple of weeks and months.\n\nUsers have begun to complain about Circle’s verification system and to leave the bitcoin platform for others. One user named Michael wrote on Uncrunched in February:\n\n”I created an account and tried to add my bank account and credit card to deposit money into the system (as Bitcoin). I had to give a lot of personal information. And I had to take a photo of my drivers license. I don’t have a huge problem with that since these kinds of services are a huge fraud magnet. But Circle said they needed time to review the information. and here’s the problem, they basically (kind of) shut down my account while they were doing that.”\n\nMore than 10 public complaints have been uploaded on Reddit since the funding in 2014. Many users complained saying “i linked my debit card, made a purchase, it gets cancelled. i wait two days to link my bank account, make a small 10$ purchase, still no bitcoins. isnt it supposed to be instant?” and “After waiting a few days for my free $10 promotion to appear, I contacted Circle support and was told they stopped honoring that promotion”\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

All bitcoin transactions are recorded in a ledger, in this case a decentralized one called Blockchain. The transactions happening over blockchain needs to be verified and miners are the ones who contribute the processing power for the algorithm to verify these transactions. In return miners receive rewards in the form of freshly minted bitcoin.\n\nAs the bitcoin network grows, the amount of processing power required to decrypt the information on blockchain and verify transactions also increases. Which in turn means, the miners contribution greater processing power will earn more. Bitcoin mining these days involve specialized hardware custom made for the application and these are called ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). Mining ASICs pack a lot of processing power and they consume a lot of power in return to churn it out. Many companies are currently involved in optimizing these ASICs with latest hardware architecture to create energy efficient and more powerful miners. Bitmain is one such company based out of Beijing, China.\n\nBitmain has recently introduced its latest mining ASIC labelled BM1385 which it claims to be the most power efficient publicly available chip till date. According to the company, Bitmain BM1385 is capable of churning out 32.5 GH/s. It also consumes 50 percent less energy while offering 45 percent greater hashrate than the company’s previous BM1384 28nm ASIC.\n\nThe upcoming Bitmain S7 Antminer models will also come equipped with the latest BM1385 chips. Antminers are generally sold to business clients, but these chips can be bought by consumers as well.\n\nCurrently there are very few mining ASICs available for consumers to purchase. The mining industry is also facing legal issues with regard to ASIC sales to consumers. Even for consumers, mining is not an attractive option anymore, as many companies have set up data centers and using industrial scale miners, which makes it hard for individual miners to even cover the costs involved in operating their mining rig.', 'De Telecommunicatiewet verplicht FD Mediagroep om bezoekers van haar websites te informeren over cookies en uw toestemming te vragen voor het gebruik van deze cookies.\n\nFD Mediagroep maakt gebruik van cookies om de website FD.nl goed te laten functioneren en het gebruik van de website te analyseren en te kunnen verbeteren.\n\nMet uw toestemming verzamelen FD Mediagroep en derde partijen via cookies informatie over uw bezoek aan FD.nl en uw persoonlijke interesses, onder meer om het nieuws voor u te personaliseren en advertenties aan te passen aan uw interesses.

Besides Stanford students, it will be open to professionals completing their graduate certificate in cyber security.\n\nComputer Science professor Dan Boneh, an expert in applied cryptography, will lead the course – which tackles security across the entire bitcoin ecosystem. In a release he said:\n\n""The technology behind bitcoin and other crypto currencies can be an indispensable tool for protecting information.""\n\nWhile the introductory webinar is free, tuition for the remainder of the sessions clocks in at $3,960 (a $600 discount for attendees from one of Stanford\'s member organisations). To complete the certificate, which requires four modules in total, will cost between $13,440 and $18,480.\n\nFounded in 1885, Stanford frequently ranks in the top five universities in the US, only 5.7% applicants who apply are accepted. While not the first, it is the most prestigious school to offer bitcoin tuition.', 'When it comes to bitcoin, it would be fair to say that the mainstream media does have a tendency to get things wrong.\n\nAlthough coverage has improved since the early days, as some journalists are beginning to take the digital currency and its underlying technology more seriously, mistakes continue to crop up.\n\nRanging from hugely inaccurate to outrageously funny, here are some of the biggest mainstream media fails to date.\n\n1. Hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nThe mainstream press has joined the pursuit to identify Satoshi Nakamoto, the person or group of people credited with creating bitcoin.\n\nBack in 2014, Newsweek thought it had found the real Satoshi – Dorian Nakamoto, an unassuming and unemployed engineer with apparently no background in cryptography.\n\nHe denied he was the real creator of bitcoin soon after the story was published. Despite this, Newsweek and author Leah McGrath did not issue an apology, instead they re-emphasised their assumptions in a statement, which noted ""the facts as reported point toward Mr Nakamoto\'s role in the founding of Bitcoin"".\n\nAt the time, Nakamoto and his lawyer publicly said they would like to sue the publication but required more funds to do. In an attempt to raise money, the duo created website called \'Newsweek Lied\', which featured a photo of Dorian Nakamoto holding a sign saying ""Newsweek\'s article hurt my family"".\n\nSpeaking to Ars Technica, Nakamoto\'s lawyer Ethan Kirschner said:\n\n""Goodman showed up at his house, scared his elderly mother, obtained his e-mail address by deception, and misquoted or invented quotes from both him and his brothers. They published his health, financial, and employment history recklessly. They need to account for what they did.""\n\nDoran is not the only person to have been named as bitcoin\'s mysterious creator (or creators) in the past.\n\nAt the end of 2013, blogger Skye Grey linked Nick Szabo to bitcoin\'s white paper using stylometric analysis – the study of linguistic style, usually used to attribute authorship to anonymous or disputed documents.\n\nHal Finney, a cryptography pioneer and the first person (aside from Satoshi) to use the bitcoin protocol has also been linked with Satoshi.\n\n2. Bitcoin CEO\n\nFollowing on from the general misunderstanding – or confusion – that bitcoin is a company and not a peer-to-peer decentralised network, last March saw the emergence of reports which ran a headline noting Bitcoin\'s CEO had tragically died in a suspected suicide. The victim, was in fact Autumn Radtke, the CEO of in-game currency trading platform First Meta.\n\nHowever, Radtke was not the first \'Bitcoin CEO\' to be mentioned in the media. Steve Beauregard, CEO of bitcoin payment processor GoCoin was also mistakenly dubbed bitcoin CEO by a journalist from the Santa Monica Mirror.\n\nMore recently, Yahoo News referred to Mark Karpeles, the CEO of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, as ""Bitcoin CEO"".\n\n3. Bitcoin bowl no more\n\n""The Bitcoin Bowl is no more"" began an article by CBS Sports earlier this year, before continuing to note that ""bitcoin was dropping out of its sponsorship deal with the bowl in St. Petersburg Florida after only one year"".\n\nBitcoin, however, cannot pull out from any kind of social engagement as it is not an entity, nor is it – as many would have you believe – a company.\n\nThe article was alluding to the fact that bitcoin payment processor BitPay had agreed to drop its sponsorship deal for the college football play-off.\n\n4. Bitcoin is dead\n\nIf the headlines are to be believed, bitcoin has died a few times during its relatively short history.\n\nAlways a controversial topic, journalists have, rather prematurely, predicted the digital currency\'s death on various occasions – with some accounts reading like true bitcoin obituaries.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has undeniably had its ups and downs but the media has perhaps focused too heavily on its volatility.\n\nWhether it\'s down to the media\'s misunderstanding or the speed at which news is relayed nowadays, it is fair to say that some mistakes have provided hours of entertainment among the crypto community, whilst others have angered bitcoin enthusiasts, who have always jumped to the digital currency\'s defence.\n\nFail, mystery man, CEO, man storing money and tombstone images via Shutterstock.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk\'s founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The loss represented an increase over the roughly $4m loss incurred over the same period in 2014.\n\nThe change seems to have been driven largely by rise in non-operational costs, which rose from $205,000 to $791,000. In interview, however, CEO Charles Allen suggested that he views the report as a validation of BTCS\' recent market strategy shift.\n\nAllen stated that he views BTCS\' pivot from e-commerce to transaction processing services as a success that will continue to benefit investors, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""We had 2,000% revenue growth. We went from $45,000 in revenue to $145,000 in revenue [quarter over quarter]. We\'re seeing tremendous growth on the transaction verification services side.""\n\nIn particular, Allen cited the fact that BTCS is now spending $109 on average to mine 1 BTC, worth roughly $220 at press time. He indicated he expects this cost to lower as BTCS nears opening new North Carolina-based mining facilities.\n\nOther numbers showed similar improvements as operational losses narrowed between the two periods. The company reported $3.8m in operational losses for the first half of 2015, compared to $4.2m the year prior.\n\nBTCS further recorded a second quarter net loss of about $1.25m, a drop by half compared to the second quarter of 2014 when it posted a second quarter net loss of $2.59m. Second quarter expenditures for 2015 were $2.05m compared to $2.66m the year before.\n\nIn a note, however, BTCS indicated that it ""expects to incur losses into the foreseeable future"". As of 30th June, the company had roughly $300,000 in cash on the books, as well as $46,100 in digital currency.\n\nAt press time, BTCS stock was trading at $0.13 a share.\n\nAdditional reporting by Stan Higgins.\n\nStock trading image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Since June 12, domestic market bubbles have burst, forcing massive action to counter it by the People’s Bank of China, which is majority-owned by the Chinese Government.\n\nLast month, when the primary Shanghai Index fell over 8%, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by almost 2%. This level of market manipulation has previous been only reserved for the American market and now Kim DotCom is throwing gasoline into the fire, tweeting:\n\nIs the China bubble ready to pop? A significant global stock market correction is imminent? Get some #Bitcoin. Just in case. Thank me later. — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 24, 2015\n\nDotCom’s previous fortune telling has had mixed results. During the beginning of the “Grexit” crisis several weeks ago, he said the “markets will crash.” Since he used the word “markets,” implying more than one, which usually includes the New York Stock Exchange, he can at best get partial credit for the corresponding fall in China.\n\nHe also recommended buying gold at the time, though the price of the precious metal has not taken off either. This doesn’t mean it is not good advice, but no short-term results have been seen due to the “Grexit”.\n\nMassive correction\n\nKimDotCom is used to being in the limelight, after creating online supersite Megaupload in 2005, the streaming service for copyrighted material without authorization. The site was shut down in 2012, but DotCom was able to secure a court decision preventing the U.S. government from seizing his private property in association with the site’s closure.\n\nEconomic issues in Greece did not create a cascade effect of economic turmoil worldwide, but it did produce a boom in the bitcoin market, whether directly or indirectly. Prices approached 2015-highs on July 12, as values reached well over US$300.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors persist that as many as two dozen financial markets are heading for a massive “correction” now or in the near future, as early as next month, including the New York Stock Exchange.

It may very well be the primary reason Bitcoin has not reached mainstream acceptance in well over 6 years of existence. Now, Coinbase looks to change this with a new test service that will make buying a bitcoin as easy as buying a latte at your local Starbucks.\n\nFinally put your bitcoins on your debit or credit card\n\nA Reddit user revealed that they received and email from Coinbase highlighting an exciting new pilot program for pre-selected Coinbase users. The test program will be for those in the United Kingdom or Spain only, at least initially. Presumably, if all goes well, it will expand to the United States and other nations. Part of the email reads:\n\n""We\'re excited to announce support for purchasing bitcoin with a credit or debit card. When purchasing with a credit or debit card, you\'ll receive your bitcoin instantly. To start, we\'ll be gradually rolling out credit and debit card purchase support to users in the UK and Spain.""\n\nThis news follows a recent accolade where Coinbase was listed over the weekend by the New York Times amongst the world’s 50 hottest new startups. In the article “50 Companies That May Be the Next Start-Up Unicorns,” research company CB Insights has developed an algorithm that can detect the next “Unicorn” or billion dollar business startup. The algorithm includes factors like the amount of financing raised, employee turnover and social media mentions.\n\nCoinbase, which opened its services in 2012 and its first North American exchange earlier this year, currently has over 3.8 million bitcoin wallets on its books and over 2.4 million registered users.', 'An upcoming Korean Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that tracks the price of Bitcoin has been announced by asset management firm Korea Investment Management, a subsidiary of Korea Investment Holdings Co (KIH). Started in 2002, KIH has more than $21B USD under management.\n\nETFs track an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange.\n\nThe new ETF will track the price of bitcoin as it trades on Korbit, the largest of South Korea’s bitcoin exchanges, and will be traded on the sole securities exchange operator in South Korea, Korea Exchange (KRX). Investors can trade in the KRX securities markets through a trading account at one of many security companies with KRX membership.\n\n- NASDAQ\n\nIn 2012 the very first regulated bitcoin fund launched. An ETF simply named “the Bitcoin Fund,” which is traded exclusively on the Hedge Fund Marketplace platform, Exante. The fund achieved the biggest single investment vehicle gain in world history, with a 4,847% return, when Bitcoin\'s price spiked at the end of 2013. EXANTE is under the jurisdiction of the European regulator MiFID.\n\nIn July 2013, the Winklevoss twins filed their application for an ETF in the US. “The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of Bitcoins, as measured by the Winklevoss IndexSM (""Winkdex®""), less the Trust\'s expenses.”\n\n“The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and are expected to be traded under the ticker symbol ""COIN"" on the NASDAQ.” - NASDAQ\n\nThe twins have been patiently waiting for regulators to approve the fund ever since, and are keeping active with their bitcoin price index, the Winkdex, and launching their own Exchange on Wall Street, Gemini.\n\nThe island of Jersey saw it’s first fund in 2014, the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment fund (GABI). “Jersey aspires to be the leader in the digital currency revolution by playing a crucial role in the bitcoin ecosystem regulation,” states the company site. GABI is regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.\n\nEarlier this year an ETF from Barry Silbert called the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) began trading in the US. The security is trading on OTC Markets\' top marketplace, OTCQX, under the trading symbol GBTC. BIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCC).\n\nIn their latest quarterly report, BIT reported a market value of $35,575,920 USD, owning 135,677 bitcoins. 48 thousand of these bitcoins were famously picked up when Silbert won them at an auction in Dec 2014. The bitcoins were seized during the Silk Road investigation, then auctioned off by the US Marshal\'s Service.\n\nThere are also efforts to launch full Bitcoin ETFs on the horizon. In Europe, the City of London based bitcoin exchange Coinfloor announced plans to launch a bitcoin ETF last year, and is already billing itself as “the world\'s most liquid Pound Sterling to Bitcoin order book.”\n\nAside from ETFs, bitcoin Exchange Traded Notes (ETN) are also available for investors looking to gain exposure to the digital currency. While both bitcoin ETFs and ETNs are designed to track the prices of bitcoin, an ETN is more like a bond.\n\nAn ETN is a senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt security issued by an underwriting bank. Similar to other debt securities, ETNs have a maturity date and are backed only by the credit of the issuer. If an ETN’s issuer were to receive a credit downgrade, shares of the ETN would likely experience a downturn, unrelated to the price of bitcoin that it is tracking.\n\nThe first ETN made public for bitcoin is the Bitcoin Tracker One, a bitcoin note launched in May this year, available in 179 countries. The note is managed by Sweden based XBT Provider, a public Limited Liability Company traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Bitcoin Tracker One is available on the NASDAQ/OMX in Stockholm under the ticker COINXBT.\n\nThere is a key advantage to purchasing bitcoin tracking ETFs and ETNs. The underlying asset, bitcoin, is largely traded on unregulated exchanges. If a Bitcoin ETF trades on a major exchange, investors could simply buy shares of the ETF at any brokerage. Regulation also allows for institutional investors to gain access to bitcoin markets, as they are largely precluded from trading unregulated securities.\n\nA clear downside is the the fees. To invest in the BIT, for example, investors pay premium prices for free trading shares, as well as an annual two percent administration and safekeeping fee.\n\n“That charge is steeper than most ETFs”, said Eric Mustin, vice president of ETF Trading Solutions at WallachBeth Capital.\n\n- Mustin\n\nThe annual fee for the SPDR Gold Shares ETF is only 0.4%. However, Grayscale representative Barry Silbert justified that the annual fee is comparative to the 1 percent charge most bitcoin platforms and exchanges levy.\n\n- Barry Silbert\n\nWhile it is often said that bitcoin is a volatile and risky investment, there are many more volatile ETFs available. In a recent Bloomberg article two ETFs are referenced; the Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF (GREK) and the Deutsche X-Trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR). After the recent collapse of Chinese stocks and the Greek crisis, both funds\' volatility more than tripled in a relative short amount of time.\n\n- Bloomberg', 'Australian Bitcoin exchange igot Pty. Ltd. has ceased trading with users, reporting they are unable to obtain withdrawals from the site and that the company is not responding to support tickets.\n\nAs of the time of writing, igot has ceased all public communications for over one week and have not responded to users or to correspondence from this publication; there are also complaints going back months with users reporting ongoing issues with the company.\n\nAllegedly founded in 2013, igot offered a Bitcoin exchange service covering some 40 different countries, including the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin, remittance services, futures trading and merchant services; outside of the basic buy/sell exchange service, it’s unclear whether the company actually signed up merchants and provided futures trading, despite advertising those services as being available.\n\nBackground on the company is a bit all over the place: it is referred to as an Australia company, and the company is registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC/ABN: 600 161 233) in Melbourne in June 2014, some 12 months after it claimed to have been founded.\n\n\n\nThe contact address the company provides in Australia is P.O BOX 628, Oaklands Park, South Australia, a middle class suburb of Adelaide, with “offices” (we use the phrase lightly) listed in Ljubljana, Slovenia; Kowloon, Hong Kong; Singapore and Bangalore, India.\n\nResearch by SiliconANGLE of the addresses provided by the company reveal they are all virtual offices, except one, and therefore not legitimate offices for the company. List as follows:\n\nSingapore: 51 Goldhill Plaza is the address of 3E Accounting- Business services, which along with company registration and accounting services, also provide virtual office space\n\nHong Kong: Suite 1101, 11/F, Supreme House, 2A, Hart Avenue, TST, Kowloon is the registered address of KRSNA Group, which offers local business registration and a registered address in Hong Kong for that purpose\n\nSlovenia: for Parmova ulica 53, 1000 Ljubljana we were unable to ascertain that it was an address for a company that offers either a registered address or virtual office as we don’t speak Slovenian, but a search of Google finds that there are hundreds of companies registered at the same address, meaning that it’s odds on a front address\n\nThe Indian connection\n\nTracing the roots of igot leads us to India, and the only possible office that may be legitimate, the Bangalore Office at 2nd floor, 3rd Cross, 4th Main, Chamrajpet, Bangalore, which is listed as belonging to one Indian registered company called I Got Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd.; of note I Got Tech Solutions and igot also use the same registered Indian company number U72900KA2012PTC061947, confirming that they are one in the same company (despite the obvious igot being an abbreviation of I Got Tech).\n\nAs we’re unable to obtain the ownership documents for igot in Australia we can’t 100 percent confirm, but it’s highly likely that igot is simply a front for I Got Tech Solutions.\n\nSo what does I Got Tech Solutions do? Well according to their LinkedIn page they offer search engine optimization (SEO) services, and on other pages are simply listed as providing “IT services.”\n\nRick Day and the “team”\n\nHaving traced the origins of the company structure, next stop was to take a look at Founder and Chief Executive Officer Rick Day and his so-called team as listed on the igot website (see picture).\n\nThe first thing you learn about Day is that he does give the odd interview, having appeared on YouTube podcasts, in news publications and blogs, but where it gets interesting: prior to igot Day doesn’t appear to exist, and indeed outside of his Bitcoin activities he doesn’t even appear to exist on social media.\n\nigot’s LinkedIn page makes no mention of him, and none of his interviews mention his past either; it’s as if the name Rick Day might be made up and that’s what we think is a strong possibility, or alternatively somewhere along the line he’s legally changed his name; in a video interview with Follow The Coin it’s clear that not only is Day Indian by ancestry, he’s Indian by birth based on his accent, and there are not a lot of Indian kids born “Rick Day” in India (to be precise, there are none) let alone among those of Indian heritage outside the country.\n\nThe rest of the alleged “team” at igot (Day has claimed the company employs 12 people) are shown as eight photographs on the igot about page; outside of the picture of Day we were able to identify three other people shown via reverse image search; Vadym Karpenko and Igor Silchin, Chief Executive Officer and Project Manager respectively for an Eastern European web development firm called Gera-IT, and Nhial Majok, a Senior Storage Administrator – TSM at IBM Australia.\n\nWe can’t be sure what relationship these three have with Day and igot, but there are some hints: Karpenko and Silchin’s firm lists on their project page that they are working on a Bitcoin exchange platform, although it appears more likely that the company had been outsourced to provide the IT for the igot setup versus being direct employees.\n\nMajok lists in his bio that he is “deeply interested in cryptocurrencies as they relate to the third world countries,” and could potentially be the Australian link in the potential igot scam.\n\nThere are no names listed for the other photos listed on the igot’s site, although there are two names listed on their LinkedIn page: Amit Taneja who claimed to be the Director – Business Development and lives in Adelaide, and Karun Abhinav Raja, who claims to be working for the company in a digital marketing role out of Dubai.\n\nThe scam allegations\n\nScam allegations, culminating in the businesses closing, go back to the beginning of 2015, where Cryptocoin Talk notes Reddit users are having troubles with withdrawals from the company.\n\nBusiness though seemed to continue for igot, with fresh reports in March on Bitcointalk from a user, again, having problems with obtaining withdrawals from the company.\n\nIn May, another user on Bitcointalk suggests that the company is either an outright scam or has run out of money after failing to withdraw $60,000 from the exchange.\n\nThe problems and complaints continued to increase through to the end of July when one site, The Mirkle, out and out calls the site a scam and lists multiple users who have been ripped off; founder Rick Day responds to the allegations with an interview at Coindesk denying that igot was scamming users, but disturbingly added that they were having problems with fraudulent transactions and that the service had been subject to a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS).\n\nBy mid-August the wheels were falling off, with multiple users at Reddit all reporting the same issue: a complete inability to withdraw funds from the exchange; u/Darkzen67 sums it up well August 23rd when he presents evidence of trying to withdraw funds from the service for over one month, with no reply on support tickets.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction of this article, igot literally ceased communicating publicly August 19th on their Twitter account and earlier on their Facebook account, and attempts to contact the site by SiliconANGLE have gone unanswered.\n\nWhere to now\n\nWhile we can’t with 100 percent certainty say that igot has ceased trading permanently versus temporarily (that they’re not currently processing business nor responding to customers is proven), if it If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck, and in this application of the duck test, igot is the duck.\n\nGiven the number of complaints about and figures mentioned we’d give igot baby Mt Gox status: probably somewhere around the $1 million mark (give or take) missing at this stage, but that figure could increase rapidly given igot also claimed to be the biggest Bitcoin exchange servicing the United Arab Eremites and India as well.\n\nOur recommendation to all affected igot users is to report the company to authorities, but particularly those in Australia: police, state-based consumer affairs departments, the ACCC and ASIC because the company ostensibly undertook business in Australia and hence is covered by Australian law, which unlike some of the more exotic places these scams take place, provides adequate legal protections and recourse in the event of these things occurring.\n\nImage via igot']"

According to an explanation Hearn posted on Medium , they released XT because “the decision-making process in Bitcoin Core has broken.” The real crisis, as this suggests, is less about Bitcoin’s code than about the power structure that governs it.\n\nThe dispute centers on a fast-approaching computational bottleneck. The blockchain is composed, as you might guess, of “blocks,” each consisting of a list of recent bitcoin transactions, time-stamped and verified by one of the network’s “miners”—computers that secure a block’s inclusion on the chain by solving a computational puzzle called a proof of work . The first computer to win this computational race “mines” a reward of twenty-five bitcoins, and then competition recommences for the next block.\n\nAccording to a Bitcoin Foundation post by Andresen, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, imposed a maximum block size of one megabyte in 2010, in response to some denial-of-service attacks.* This cap effectively restricts the number of bitcoin transactions to about seven per second, since it takes a certain number of characters to record a given transaction, and only so many fit in a megabyte. (Visa, by contrast, routinely handles thousands of transactions per second, and claims a capacity of more than twenty-four thousand transactions per second.) Hearn anticipates that Bitcoin transaction volumes will blow past the seven-per-second limit by 2017, at the latest, creating backlogs, settlement delays, and perhaps even mass outages. The primary goal of Bitcoin XT, then, is to increase the size limit of each block to eight megabytes.\n\nPrior to the release, a block-size debate had been blazing for months on Bitcoin forums. Opponents of an increase argued, for instance, that mining larger blocks would require more computing power, thereby discouraging small operators in favor of the massive mining farms that have gradually concentrated the network into fewer and fewer hands. It was widely feared, as well, that a serious disagreement among the core developers might further destabilize public faith in Bitcoin. Those in favor of an increase contended that “forking”—creating a competing version of a program in response to diverging aims—is the very essence of open-source software development.\n\nSuch decisions stand to affect millions of participants in the bitcoin economy, but ultimately lie with a very few people. Theoretically, any user of an open-source program is free to create, adopt, or reject any alterations he pleases; in practice, software shared on networks or between users requires painstaking standardization. This means relying on decision-makers with “commit access,” who have the right to amend a software project directly, on their own. This status represents a high level of developer control, and of user trust.\n\nAndresen told me that, to his recollection, when Nakamoto withdrew from the project (and from public view), in 2011, only he, Nakamoto, and possibly one other person had commit access to Bitcoin’s software. Andresen eventually granted this level of access to four additional developers, for a total of five “core devs.” In April, 2014, Andresen decided to devote more of his time to other projects, and named one of the core devs, Wladimir van der Laan, to succeed him as lead developer. Even today, only van der Laan and Andresen can grant commit access to other developers of Bitcoin Core.\n\n“Right now,” Andresen added, “just Mike and I have commit access to Bitcoin XT.”\n\nThe publication of XT threw the Bitcoin forums into turmoil, with partisans duking it out in what has amounted to an old-fashioned flame war. Some of the public debate was constructive, though. Roger Ver, a Bitcoin investor and evangelist famously nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus,” tweeted , “If you run a full node, and support bigger blocks so more people around the world can use bitcoin, install XT today.” Nick Szabo, a respected cryptography expert whom some believe to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto (whose identity and location remain mysterious), publicly stated his opposition to XT, tweeting , “A rapid block-size increase is a huge security risk: a reckless act to be performing on a $4 billion system.”\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of XT has been Gregory Maxwell, one of Bitcoin’s five core developers. Aside from the many other enhancements he has made to Bitcoin Core, Maxwell is a developer of “sidechains,” a clever proposal for scaling Bitcoin by processing transactions partly off the main blockchain. But he and fellow core dev Pieter Wuille have faced criticism, during the recent debate, over an apparent conflict of interest: both are co-founders of Blockstream, a startup venture, capitalized to the tune of twenty-one million dollars in a recent seed round, that is experimenting with a number of scaling options, including sidechains. Should any of Blockstream’s proprietary innovations become essential to Bitcoin, the company could make a fortune. On Reddit, a user with the handle yumein observed as much, suggesting, in imperfect English, that preventing the move to a larger block size might one day force Bitcoin users to adopt Blockstream. “Nothing against Blockstream,” he wrote, but, “might be a big reason why this gentlemens stand against bigger blocksize, isn’t it?”\n\nAdam Back, another co-founder of Blockstream and a pioneering cryptographer in his own right, maintains that his company only wants what is best for the system as a whole. “We really want and need Bitcoin to function well, in terms of its security and scale and safety,” he told me. I asked Back, who strongly opposes XT, why he thought that Andresen and Hearn had released their software independently of the other core devs. “I’m a little confused about why that is,” he replied, adding that he had spoken with Andresen and met with Hearn for several hours in the weeks before XT was published. “I think the tech community was expecting and hoping that Gavin would work within this process . . . and see which [proposal] is accepted.”\n\n“Why did that not happen?” I asked.\n\n“You would have to ask Gavin that,” he said, laughing a little ruefully.', 'Not to be outdone by Stanford, MIT Media Lab has announced its own course to inspire the ""next generation"" of bitcoin talent.\n\nThanks to a partnership between its Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) and Media Lab Entrepreneurship Program, MIT will join other universities, including Stanford, putting bitcoin into the classroom.\n\nThe Massachusetts university has been a hive of extra-curricular bitcoin activity with contests and events including the MIT Bitcoin Project\'s $500,000 giveaway in the currency – $100 for every student on campus.\n\nArriving next semester, the course is open to all students at MIT and those cross-registered from institutions around the Boston area.\n\nDavid Shrier, a lecturer at the Media Lab and one of the brains behind the programme, said the course will study topics ranging from e-commerce to market systems.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Our course will provide students with a broad perspective on what’s going on, where success and failure has struck, and what the future looks like from various angles.""\n\nIt will be lead by serial entrepreneur and famed computer scientist Alex \'Sandy\' Pentland alongside DCI director Brian Forde – an ex-White House advisor hoping to ""mainstream"" blockchain technology.\n\nMIT Media Lab, which now supports several bitcoin core developers, will also be offering a ""highly technical"" course around coding the blockchain, Shrier said.\n\nImage via f11photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In turn, those looking to employ short-term services simply receive a link and connect a wallet.\n\nCreated by former Quasar Ventures senior business analyst Demian Brener; engineer Esteban Ordano; and Manuel Araoz, the developer behind decentralized verification project Proof of Existence, the three founders are currently based in Argentina.\n\nUnsurprisingly given its high bitcoin adoption rates, it\'s in this region where Brener believes Faradam could have the biggest impact, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""What we\'re now doing is focusing mainly on use cases where people have bitcoin like international freelancers, and they charge their clients in bitcoin. In Argentina, we don\'t have a PayPal, it\'s really hard to charge for freelance services from the US.""\n\nWhile a novel use case for micropayments, the technology underlying the service is not new, having been created by Brener for Streamium, his decentralized video streaming project launched in May.\n\nBrener explained that Faradam was inspired by Streamium users, who saw that the ability to charge for services rather than content would be broadly useful. He indicated he now sees that project as a proof of concept for what could be a variety of more commercial use cases.\n\n""The value of what we did lies not in the livestream video, but the metered payment infrastructure,"" he continued. ""This lets you charge in real time for on-demand services.""\n\nBrener went on to suggest Faradam will focus on bitcoin users in ""niche markets"", before adding other payment methods depending on the product\'s use.\n\nFaradam charges 1% for all payment sessions facilitated on the service, a contrast to Streamium\'s free, open-source model. The company does not currently plan to enter an incubator.\n\nDesign influence\n\nBrener indicated that Faradam was also inspired by Streamium\'s design, specifically the need for it to streamline the interface for novice bitcoin users.\n\n""We know it\'s a complicated concept, payment channels and bitcoin, so we worked really, really hard on doing the site very simple so people could grasp it and understand it as soon as possible,"" Brener said.\n\nTo break down the design to simple elements, Brener talked with Streamium users, including online teachers and professional psychologists, who had sought to leverage its metered video payments as a way to earn income.\n\n""We finished the Faradam project a week ago, and we shared it with our champions, our early adopters, freelancers, teachers and consultants who use it with their clients,"" he continued. ""Today it\'s a simple product to use and you can grasp it right away.""\n\nBuilt as a web application, Brener said Faradam can be used in conjunction with popular communication apps such as Skype or Slack.\n\n""It\'s independent of how you provide the service, you don\'t depend on a webcam or live streaming application,"" he said. ""You turn the switch on and money starts flowing right away.""\n\nFreelancer image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While he said the technologies have the potential to be disruptive, he was quick to note they could also have undesirable consequences if left unchecked.\n\nGandhi said:\n\n""Digital currencies and crowdfunding have the potential to support criminal, anti-social activities like money laundering, terrorist funding and tax evasion. While we do not have any reported instances of crowdfunding in this respect, cryptocurrencies have been widely suspected to finance criminal activities. We have to be carefully and critically watching these developments.”\n\nAcknowledging that the technology can assist financial inclusion, Gandhi went on to say that cryptocurrency can help alleviate transaction settlement concerns.\n\nIndia’s government disclosed last year that the RBI was exploring digital currencies. Back in December 2013, the bank issued a warning on the subject and stated it was beginning to investigate the technology.\n\nAdditional comments\n\nIn separate comments, deputy governor Subhash Sheoratan Mundra, reports India’s The Economic Times, suggested that global coordination among regulators is needed to address the volatility and crime-related risks of digital currencies.\n\n""These are the kinds of global innovations and by very nature and design.....it will be something which would need a global coordination rather than a framework which can be location specific,” Mundra said, according to the source.\n\nThese comments come days after RBI governor Raghuram Rajam remarked on the central bank’s policy toward digital currencies.\n\nSpeaking at an event hosted by State Bank of India, Rajam said that more investigation is necessary before the central bank decides to take any action, according to a report by The Financial Express.\n\n""We have to examine and I would say we shouldn\'t intervene strongly until we understand it better,"" he said.

To address these security issues, Stanford has decided to study topics such as altcoins, Bitcoin transactions, consensus protocols, cryptocurrency, elliptical curves, hash functions, mining strategies and incentives, proposed Bitcoin regulations, and Zerocoin and zerocash, in its ‘CS251 – Crypto Currencies: Bitcoin and Friend’ course. So that students and other participants have fair understanding, the organizers are also holding a free webinar on Tuesday, Aug. 25, 2015, from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe university claims that this new course will allow students to examine principles of computer systems security, including attack protection and prevention. Efforts have been made to make the course interdisciplinary by combining computer science and application so that students get vital skills needed for today’s cyber workforce. The course is ideal for information security managers, web developers, computer network architects and professionals working in computer occupations.\n\nParticipants can take courses for graduate credit and a grade as well as receive a B (3.0) or better in each course. Tuition fee has been kept $13,440 – $18,480 (12-14 units). However, there is a provision for reduced fee for SCPD member companies and United States Armed forces. More information can be obtained visiting the official web page of the university. Though the average time period to complete the certificate is 1-2 years, students must not take more than three years to complete the certificate.\n\nThe new course will be available from September 21, 2015 for Stanford students as well as professionals completing their graduate certificates in cyber security. Dan Boneh, Computer Science professor, and an expert in applied cryptography will lead the course and teach students how to tackle security across the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Dan Boneh believes that the technology behind Bitcoin and other crypto currencies can be an indispensable tool for protecting information.\n\nAt the End of the Course Students Will Learn:\n\nBasic theory and practice of cryptographic techniques\n\nDigital forensics for identifying potential threats\n\nLegal issues in computer security\n\nPrivacy policy business implications\n\nDesigns for network perimeter defenses\n\nTesting methods for possible system penetrations.\n\nStanford: A Pro-Bitcoin Campus\n\nStanford campus is not new to Bitcoin, as it was perhaps the first university that promoted and offered a course to young entrepreneurs that required them to build a Bitcoin crowdfunding system. In 2013, Stanford came up with the idea under the guidance of Balaji S. Srinivasan and Vijay S. Pande. Rather than teaching the business skills of entrepreneurship, the course — titled “Startup Engineering” — taught the technical skills needed to build an online business, such as web development, market research, and development environments.\n\nEarlier this year the Stanford professor David Mazières came up with the idea of a faster, more flexible, and more secure alternative of Bitcoin. He claimed that his technology could make digital payments and other transactions cheaper, safer, and easier for national and international transactions. Additionally, the university also has the Stanford Bitcoin Group, headed by Balaji Srinivasan, who holds a B.S., M.S., and PhD in Electrical Engineering and an M.S. in Chemical Engineering from Stanford, and is the Co-Founder and CTO of Counsyl.\n\nWould you consider completing a Bitcoin-related certificate? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nImage source: Wikipedia\n\nOriginally posted on: Stanford University Offers Bitcoin Course to Students', 'It has been little over a week since Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen included Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 101 (BIP 101) into the alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT. BIP 101 is designed to create a hard fork in the blockchain to allow for blocks of up to 8 megabytes, doubling every two years.\n\nDespite a major uproar on forums, chat rooms and in the media, not to mention a significant drop in bitcoin’s exchange rate, support among miners is minimal. Bitcoin XT will need 75 percent of newly mined Bitcoin blocks to trigger a maximum block-size increase, but only some 1 percent of new blocks so far included such a message – all mined by Slush Pool.\n\nMoreover, it seems unlikely that the 75 percent threshold will be reached any time soon. A significant chunk of mining pools has taken a fierce stand against Bitcoin XT, while others are very hesitant to make such a switch.\n\nFurthermore, a rapidly growing amount of hash power is now publicly backing BIP 100, the proposal by Jeff Garzik that grants miners the right to vote the block-size limit up or down. Both F2Pool and BTCChina, as well as several smaller pools, have come out in support of BIP 100 in the past few days.\n\nBelow is an overview of all known mining pools that had at least 1 percent ofhashing power on the Bitcoin network over the past week, and their stance on the block-size issue.\n\nF2Pool (~21%): BIP 100 / 8MB\n\nThe mining pool that is perhaps most outspoken against Bitcoin XT is also the one representing the largest amount of hashing power on the Bitcoin network: 21 percent. Instead of BIP 101, F2Pool currently supports BIP 100, which, of course, makes it the biggest mining pool to do so.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, F2Pool administrator Wang Chun explained that the Chinese mining pool is open to other suggestions on raising the block size as well. Chun does maintain, however, that consensus among the Core development team is a requirement, and made it abundantly clear that switching to Bitcoin XT is not an option at all.\n\n“We do support big blocks if it is implemented in Bitcoin Core. But we believe the whole ‘Bitcoin’ XT thing is manipulation,” Chun said. “While the question whether and how to increase the block-size limit is a technical one, the Bitcoin Core and ‘Bitcoin’ XT issue is political. By introducing ‘Bitcoin’ XT, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn are splitting the community. Totalitarianism and dictators cannot co-exist with the free and open-source software spirit.”\n\nChun’s opposition wasn’t subtle.\n\n“Boycott ‘Bitcoin’ XT. Bitcoin Core forever. Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn should resign,” he said.\n\nEarlier this year, F2Pool agreed on a block-size limit increase to 8 megabytes, in accordance with other Chinese mining pools. This did not, however, include a doubling of the block-size limit every other year, as implemented in BIP 101 and Bitcoin XT.\n\nAntPool (~18%): 8MB\n\nAntPool, the second-largest ming pool on the Bitcoin network with 18 percent of hashing power, is also part of the conglomerate of Chinese mining pools that proposed a raise of the block-size limit to 8 megabytes in June of this year. Additionally, AntPool includes a message in support for an 8 megabyte limit in their blocks. As opposed to messages that trigger a switch in Bitcoin XT, however, the message merely broadcasts an opinion. Whether the message should be interpreted as support for BIP 101, which apart from a bump to 8 megabytes is also set to double the limit every two years, is not entirely clear.\n\nAntPool does seem a bit more willing to potentially make a switch to Bitcoin XT in the future, compared to most other mining pools. Somewhat confusingly, CEO of AntPool’s mother company Bitmain, Jihan Wu, tweeted that AntPool is willing to make a switch to Bitcoin XT if “a majority” has switched. It is unclear, however, exactly what majority Wu was referring to.\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph in June, AntPool indicated support for bigger blocks as well, although the pool also voiced concern about a contentious hard fork:\n\n“We like the idea of increasing the maximum block size, but if Bitcoin XT is too contentious, we also don’t want the community to be divided. Doubling the block size every two years may be too arbitrary, we’d like to see the block size grow according to the real needs of the network.”\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to AntPool, but received no response at time of publication.\n\nBitFury (~14%): BIP 100\n\nUpdate: As of August 26, 2015, Bitfury has begun voting for BIP 100.\n\nBitFury is the biggest non-Chinese mining pool on the Bitcoin network, with 14 percent of hashing power. While the pool supports an increase of the block-size limit as well, it is currently not prepared to run Bitcoin XT and vote for bigger blocks. Despite a conservative approach, however, BitFury does not completely exclude the possibility of switching to Bitcoin XT at some point in the future – but only after careful analysis and consideration.\n\nBitFury CEO Valery Vavilov told Bitcoin Magazine: “The Bitcoin Blockchain is not an amateur project anymore – it is becoming a platform for the Global Economy of Things. Changing the base rules can affect a lot of things, thus, any changes should be done very carefully, gradually, and with tests.”\n\nHe added: “The proposed transition to the alternative client raises some concerns about its security: It is well known that key parts of the default Bitcoin Core client were thoroughly checked and sometimes formally verified, which cannot be said about alternative clients – including Bitcoin XT.”\n\nBTCChina (~13%): BIP 100 / 8MB\n\nBTCChina is part of the conglomerate of Chinese mining pools that proposed a raise of the block-size limit to 8 megabytes in June of this year as well. Since today, moreover, BTCChina has started to sign their blocks in support of BIP 100.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, BTCChina’s Mikael Wang made it clear that his mining pool is not prepared to make a switch to Bitcoin XT. The Chinese pool that contributes 13 percent of hashing power to the network maintains that a consensus should be found among Bitcoin Core developers on how and when to raise the block-size limit.\n\n“We will not support Bitcoin XT,” Wang said. “What the Bitcoin community needs now is stability and growth, and we will not do anything to jeopardize this further.”\n\nBW Pool (~7%): 8MB\n\nBW Pool has not mined any blocks in support of a hard fork switch to BIP 101. The Chinese mining pool that controls 7 percent of all hashing power on the Bitcoin network does, however, include messages in support of 8 megabytes in their blocks. Additionally, BW Pool was also part of the conglomerate of Chinese mining pools that agreed to an 8-megabyte maximum block-size limit in June of this year.\n\nWhether BW Pool’s support for an increase to 8-megabyte blocks includes support for a doubling every other year, as programmed into BIP 101, remains unclear.\n\nBitcoin Magazine has not been able to reach BW Pool for comment.\n\nEligius (~5%)\n\nU.S.-based Eligius, accounting for 5 percent of hashing power on the Bitcoin network, is another fierce opponent of Bitcoin XT and has no plans to make a switch. Much like F2Pool, Eligius’ owner who goes by the pseudonym “wizkid057” does not even consider Bitcoin XT a Bitcoin implementation – rather an altcoin.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, wizkid057 said, “I see no reason to mine yet another altcoin: ‘Bitcoin XT’ is not Bitcoin.”\n\nWizkid057 does agree that the block-size limit should be raised at some point, somehow, but said he prefers a careful approach, and contends that such a step should be taken only when widespread consensus is reached.\n\n“Something should – and will – be done about the block-size limit eventually, but based on real-world data,” Wizkid057 said. “It is definitely not a dire thing to try to force people into today. When a technically sound solution gets at least the most basic of consensus from users, developers, experts, miners and services, then I’ll consider moving in that direction. At this time I see nothing that fits the bill.”\n\nKnCMiner (~5%): BIP 101\n\nSweden-based KnCMiner – controlling 5 percent of hashing power – is in favor of raising the block-size limit, and endorses BIP 101 in particular. Through a lettersigned by seven of Bitcoin’s leading companies – including KnCMiner – CEO Sam Cole has expressed his support for the implementation of bigger blocks on the Bitcoin network. The letter did not explicitly state that this would entail running Bitcoin XT, but it did indicate that KnCMiner will run software in support of bigger blocks by December of this year.\n\nEarlier this year, expressing his support for bigger blocks, Cole told CoinTelegraph: “We would like to see millions of people using bitcoin. To do that we need transaction fees that everyone can afford and is willing to pay. Putting it simply, that means many more paying transactions in each block, not less paying a higher fee.”\n\nHe added: “If bitcoin transactions end up costing the same as regular transfers then most of the world won’t see any advantages at all. Add to the fact that MasterCard’s main argument against bitcoin is the seven transactions per second limit … The sooner we fix it the better.”\n\nKnCMiner has so far not mined any blocks that would trigger a raise of the block-size limit in Bitcoin XT.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to KnCMiner, but received no response at time of publication.\n\nSlush (~5%): optional\n\nThe only mining pool that has come out in support of Bitcoin XT so far is Slush Pool, controlling 5 percent of hashing power. While the Czech-based mining pool does not automatically sign new blocks in support of a block-size increase, it does allow its users to choose to do so individually. Currently, some 10 percent of hashing power on Slush is devoted to mining blocks in support of Bitcoin XT, and these numbers are slowly growing. Additionally, Slush is working to inform miners connected to its pool on the pro’s and cons of Bitcoin XT.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Slush Pool operator Marek “slush” Palatinus said: “At this moment we’re preparing some online materials and articles to explain for our users what exactly BIP 101 is and why they should vote for or vote against this proposal.”\n\nHe added: “The hash-rate is rising, and I expect more to come after we publish our articles on the topic. I see there’s lot of misunderstanding and fears about a hard fork, but I’m sure Bitcoin will resolve it smoothly in any way – even if we’ll continue with 1 megabyte blocks or switch to BIP 101 on the first day of 2016.”\n\n21 Inc. (~4%): 8MB\n\n21 Inc, which controls 4 percent of hashing power on the Bitcoin network, has not been mining blocks in favor of a hard fork switch to Bitcoin XT. However, the American mining pool that received a record investment for the Bitcoin industry worth $116 million earlier this year, has been mining blocks supporting an increase to 8 megabytes. Whether this includes support for a yearly growing block size as included in BIP 101 remains unclear.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to 21 Inc., but received no response at time of publication.\n\nTelco 214 (~2%)\n\nBitcoin Magazine has not been able to reach Telco 2014, which controls 2 percent of hashing power on the Bitcoin network. The mining pool has not been mining blocks in favor of a block-size increase.\n\nGhash.IO (~2%)\n\nAt time of publication, Bitcoin Magazine has not received a response from Ghash.IO, which also controls 2 percent of hashing power on the Bitcoin network. The mining pool has not been mining blocks in favor of a block-size increase.\n\nPhoto Tristan Schmurr / Flickr (CC)', ""In the early 90’s Nick Szabo, coined the term “smart contract.” The computer scientist and legal scholar explained the basic idea of a contract using a vending machine as an example, “anybody with coins can participate in an exchange with the vendor. The lockbox and other security mechanisms protect the stored coins and contents from attackers, sufficiently to allow profitable deployment of vending machines in a wide variety of areas.”\n\n- Nick Szabo\n\nSmart contracts are a major part of cryptocurrencies, and there are many companies developing their own interpretations of how they can be implemented. Ethereum is one such company and recently raised just over $18M USD, in a sale of it’s own cryptocurrency, Ether.\n\nWhen Stephan Tual, Ethereum CCO and Ursium Founder, was asked for a simple explanation of Ethereum, he stated “it's a really, really big computer made of many computers around the world that check each other's results. Anyone can run programs on it, paying only for what they use.”\n\nEthereum’s decentralized platform also runs smart contracts, “without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference,” states Ethereum’s site.\n\n- Ethereum\n\nA group of graduate students and faculty members at Cornell University and the University of Maryland have also taken an interest in smart contracts, particularly Ethereum’s interpretation. The group consists of Ahmed Kosba, Andrew Miller, Elaine Shi, Zikai Wen and Charalampos Papamanthou.\n\nIn a recently published paper, Hawk: The Blockchain Model of Cryptography and Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts, the group highlights that current smart contract platforms built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain lack privacy. “All transactions, including flow of money between pseudonyms and amount transacted, are exposed in the clear on the blockchain.”\n\nThe group designed Hawk in response to this issue, claiming in the paper that their software could potentially be superior to Ethereum. “We present Hawk , a decentralized smart contract system that does not store financial transactions in the clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view.”\n\nThe Hawk software is yet to be released, but proposes both a private contract and public contract, allowing the users to choose who can access the information. “Our work preserves the most important aspects of transparency; in particular it is efficiently and publicly verifiable that the balance of all coins are conserved. It is also possible to engineer the cryptography to make other properties publicly auditable too if needed. In general, it is well known that cryptography allows one to achieve privacy and transparency simultaneously.”\n\n- Hawk\n\nAri Juels, Professor at Cornell Tech, worked with two members of the Hawk software project, Ahmed Kosba and Elaine Shi, on another recently released paper, The Ring of Gyges: Using Smart Contracts for Crime. “Ours is among the first academic treatment of smart contracts in distributed cryptocurrencies. It is worth emphasizing our belief that smart contracts in distributed cryptocurrencies have numerous promising, legitimate applications, such as a spectrum of new over-the-counter (OTC) financial instruments. Banning smart contracts would be neither sensible nor, in all likelihood, possible. The urgent open question raised by our work is thus how to create safeguards against the most dangerous abuses while supporting the many powerful, beneficial applications of smart contracts in distributed cryptocurrencies.”\n\n- The Ring of Gyges\n\nIn the paper the trio propose ways in which criminals can utilise platforms such as Ethereum for illicit use, in what they call Criminal Smart Contracts (CSCs). “Our proposed contract PublicLeaks and its private variant can be efficiently implemented in Serpent, the Ethereum scripting language and are thus imminent possibilities. Similarly, KeyTheft would require only modest, already envisioned opcode support for SNARKs; our experiments have shown that zk-SNARKs for this contract are well within reach. Calling-card CSCs will be possible given a sufficiently rich data-feed ecosystem. Many more CSCs are no doubt possible.”\n\nThe proposed anonymity of Hawk, paired with potential CSCs, could enable the growth of the criminal ecosystem. However, the positives of smart contracts certainly cannot be ignored. “Our results illuminate the scope of possible abuses in next-generation cryptocurrencies. They highlight the urgency of creating policy and technical safeguards and thereby realizing the great promise of smart contracts for beneficial goals.”\n\n- The Ring of Gyges"", ""Ripple has never been a favorite in Bitcoin circles, although it has grabbed the attention of banks and remittance powerhouse Western Union.\n\nRipple Labs CTO Stefan Thomas cleared some misconceptions about the remittance system—which has been criticized for requiring a verified ID as well as for having a centralized system—in an interview with Epicenter Bitcoin. He explained how the protocol works, why the goal is for a more decentralized protocol, and how the company aims to disrupt the outdated banking system.\n\n‘We will decentralize’\n\nThomas explained that the original idea behind Ripple was to counter the centralized exchanges that dominated the Bitcoin ecosystem. “We didn't like that exchanges were controlled by one company,” he said.\n\nOn the other hand, most people think of Ripple as a centralized institution. Thomas agreed with that. “That criticism is totally valid. I don't mind that criticism,” he said.\n\nThough Thomas believes it will look different in the future, saying:\n\n“One day we will decentralize. We will add more validators as soon as there are enough good ones out there that we can recommend.”\n\nHe added that they've kept their word in the past. While people thought that the company would remain closed source, they ultimately open sourced as they said they would. “We don't mind being hated in the mean time,” he said.\n\nCentralization concerns\n\nThe hosts mentioned a recent study by Bitcoin developer Peter Todd that highlighted areas of concern with the protocol. Host Brian Fabian Crain asked whether the method of consensus and the “default” list of validators lead to centralization.\n\nThomas explained that node operators have many decisions to make. “It depends on what you're trying to optimize for. Do you favor centralization or decentralization? They other thing that will influence your decisions is who you're trading with—what they decide—because you want to continue interacting with them,” he explained.\n\n“With list of validators, it will end up with whatever people prefer. So even if we screw up and Ripple doesn't have what they want, they'll move to a network that does,” Thomas said. He also pointed out that they're working on algorithms that will help nodes select their own list of nodes, instead of relying on a default list.\n\n“You have to think about what you're trying to get besides decentralization,” he said. “You want to be on a network that is secure, that gives you access, that you have confidence of its continuity. You always have to come back to what you are trying to get out of decentralization.”\n\n“And this is why people hate you on Reddit my friend,” host Sébastien Couture quipped.\n\nRipple's future\n\nAs far as the long-term future of cryptocurrencies, Thomas hopes to see increased interoperability. “One thing that we'll try to work towards is to tie those together with our network so that it becomes more of this global cryptocurrency, as opposed to different networks competing with each other.”\n\nRipple is attempting to do that in the near-term by working with the W3C payments group—including several banks, Walmart, Google—which aims to standardize and simplifying Web payments. Thomas said that he hoped they would have more news after the summit.\n\nTo wrap up the podcast, Crain asked if Thomas thought Ripple the company was misunderstood.\n\n“Haters gonna hate,” Thomas replied.\n\nAbout Epicenter Bitcoin\n\nEpicenter Bitcoin is a podcast about the technologies, projects & startups driving decentralization and the global cryptocurrency revolution.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 6.4%, the S&P 500 dropped 4%, and the Nasdaq lost 8.5% raising fears that a fresh tech bubble has burst. The drops followed already-heavy falls last week.”\n\nThe most affected stocks in America were Facebook, losing 14% at one point and Apple going 11% under, though they recovered back into positive numbers soon after.\n\nHere's a summery of the events from The Guardian.\n\nChina’s benchmark Shanghai Composite index at one point pushed its losses to 41% effectively wiping all gains made since June, 2015.\n\nVarious Saudi Arabian indexes and stocks also saw falls of close to 10%. According to UK's Business Insider:\n\n“The falls across the region come after oil prices slid to new lows during trade Friday, with New York's light sweet crude plunging to US$40.04 per barrel, the lowest level since March 2009.”\n\n‘08 all over again?\n\nThe crash and volatility comes stunningly close to the 7 year prediction cycle brought to notoriety by Armstrong Economics, which seems to accurately predict market instability and crashes. The last “Shemitah” was in 2008, right around the birth of Bitcoin and the last financial crisis.\n\nThe general explanation for this phenomena is that deep within the Jewish tradition there’s a cultural habit of settling debts every 7 years. The expectation that debts are to be paid every 7 years could create a decentralized consensus, a social mechanism, where you might as well go along with convention rather then try to swim against the current.\n\nSome, of course, are predicting the worst and given how many nation states and massive markets are crashing or defaulting (Greece, Puerto Rico, China etc.), they have a point.\n\nHere is some political analysis of this world market's volatility by independent media organization We Are Change.\n\nWhat ever the case may be, one thing is for certain. Stock market crashes can result in some hilarious photographs."", ""After nearly a year of working on the technology, Eris Industries’ main product, its application layer for distributed ledger and blockchain apps, has entered beta. In a company statement, Eris Industries CEO, Casey Kuhlman explained, “Eris sits at a layer in the stack between a blockchain client and the operating system. In other words, eris is an application platform”\n\n- Casey Kuhlman, Eris Industries CEO\n\nThe firm has reworked the majority of the technology stack, in order to make the process of developing distributed applications easier for engineers wishing to to do so. “Eris is free software that allows anyone to build their own secure, low-cost, run-anywhere data infrastructure using blockchain and smart contract technology,” states the platform documentation.\n\nThe company has discontinued efforts to develop it’s own permissioned blockchain, a ledger that is controlled by an organization or group of individuals. The company originally developed its blockchain based on code from Ethereum, a ‘Blockchain 2.0’ cryptocurrency platform that was created with greater smart contract functionality than bitcoin.\n\n- Kuhlman\n\nTendermint is a cryptocurrency consensus network developed by Cornell computer science graduate, and former Yelp engineer, Jae Kwon. Unlike Bitcoin’s consensus protocol, which uses Proof-of-Work and requires large amounts of energy, Tendermint claims to be able to solve the famed Byzantine General problem, but without the large cost. Eris is “actively supporting the Tendermint open source project where our permissioned smart contract network efforts have continued,“ Kuhlman explained.\n\nThe company also stated that it’s command line tool, EPM, is being replaced. “EPM as a tool became overly bloated and unweidly with three different blockchain designs compiled into the binary and other challenges.”\n\n- Kuhlman\n\nAlong with EPM, the distributed application server, Decerver, has “more or less been tabled.” Kuhlman said that, “the idea behind the design was to provide a single server that was able to be plugged into various distributed protocol backends. While the goal was laudable, the implementation was awful.”\n\nAmongst the reworking, the company confirmed its commitment to Docker, an open source software packaging solution. Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries. Kuhlman explained, “While some folks have mixed feelings about docker, and while there are still edge cases, it empowers a significant advancement for application developers due to its ‘build once, run the exact same anywhere’ design structure.”\n\nThe discontinuation of the companies blockchain development allows the firm to focus on its core platform, and a successful beta. Eris will focus on being the application layer working between blockchain protocols and the operating systems of a user, allowing people to easily build distributed apps. Kulman described the firm's technology platform as “blockchain agnostic.”\n\nNow that the Eris platform is entering beta, the technology is ready for businesses use, and the firm is increasing its efforts to drive adoption. The company is spending more time reaching out to financial institutions and businesses, as well increasing the technology's documentation. These efforts also include creating Eris meet ups around the world and looking for communication managers to foster interest among tech circles in major cities, including New York, Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Mumbai, and Nairobi.\n\nEris Industries first entered the public spotlight in June of 2014, when Olivier Janssens gave the firm second place in a contest he created. The challenge was to find a technology that could replace the Bitcoin Foundation with a decentralized alternative. Eris won $10,000 USD for their efforts, only a month after the platforms development had started. The three men behind the project, Casey Kuhlman, Dennis McKinnon and Preston Byrne, spent the next several months establishing the company, and officially launched Eris Industries in Dec 2014.\n\nThe company went on to secure seed funding, of an undisclosed amount, raised from European investment and advisory firm Anthemis Group. Yann Ranchere, Anthemis Group Partner, became an Eris Industries board member as part of the deal. In a post on his blog, Ranchere claimed that distributed digital infrastructure could be the next big thing for web development.\n\n- Yann Ranchere, Eris Industries Non Executive Director\n\nSmart contracts, including those being developed on the Eris platform, could have many applications among various industries. According to the banking giant Santander, smart contracts will “lead to a wide variety of potential uses in securities, syndicated lending, trade finance, swaps, derivatives or wherever counterparty risk arises.”\n\nThe bank's report on blockchain technology also noted that distributed ledgers could save the banking industry between $15B and $20B USD a year by 2020.\n\nEverLedger is one of the few firms who have been using Eris Industries’ platform, building an anti-fraud service for diamonds and luxury goods. The firm uses the eris application layer to interact with Bitcoin’s blockchain, entering a diamond's unique characteristics into a bitcoin transactions. Using the service, firms can later identify any stolen or fraudulent stones.\n\nThe anti-fraud focused company is currently working with several diamond houses in London, and other major cities, as well working with law enforcement agencies. EverLedger is also working with the British multinational bank Barclays, having graduated from a startup accelerator program the bank helped run.\n\nOther firms building products with the Eris’ platform include freelancing marketplace Microwork, providing a platform for decentralized autonomous organisations, and peer-to-peer open source identity and reputation database 2way.io.\n\nEris Industries is one of the companies leading the nascent blockchain 2.0 space, and the even more obscure private, or permissioned, blockchain technology space. While some companies have thought about developing on top of the bitcoin blockchain, utilizing its consensus system, many have sought to avoid potential drawbacks, including the cost of transaction processing, reliance on a native currency, and comparatively slow transactions.\n\nBy using permissioned blockchains, many large institutions hope to utilize the advantages of blockchain technologies without having to reply on anonymous actors around the globe to validate transactions.\n\nEris Industries is far from the only company pursuing what they regard as a huge opportunity to reinvent how data is stored and transfer. Ripple Labs, creators and developers of the Ripple protocol, were one of the first startups to explore the idea, when they started in 2012.\n\nAlthough not originally interested in institutional use cases, the Ripple Labs began signing partnerships with banks in 2014. Fidor Bank, a German bank with a reputation for innovative financial services, was the first to start using the technology in May of 2014, allowing customers to send and receive any currency for free.\n\nSince then Ripple Labs has signed on numerous banks, including three of Australia’s ‘Big Four,’ who have been testing the protocol by settling payments between the banks and their respective subsidiaries.\n\nMost recently, the global network for low-value bank-to-bank payments, Earthport, announced a new real-time payment service built on top of the Ripple protocol. It is the first public service using the technology and will enable Earthport’s customer, who are all small to large financial institutions, to begin using the using the technology without having to integrate it. The financial institution originally announced the partnership with Ripple Labs back in December of 2014.\n\nThere are also a number of smaller firms building technologies for permissioned ledgers, mostly focusing on the settlement between large banks. HyperLedger, a distributed ledger platform focusing on institutional settlement that was acquired by Digital Asset Holding (DAH) in June. DAH is a financial services company created by Chairman of Santander Consumer USA, and former head of global commodities at Goldman Sachs, Blythe Master. The HyperLedger’s technology will be used by DAH to develop new platforms for banks.\n\nOther firms that are developing similar technologies based off of Ethereum are London-based Clearmatics, South Africa-based BoardRoom, and New York-based Consensys. There are also many firms building on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Symbiont is a blockchain-based platform for financial markets founded by co-creators of the CounterParty protocol. The firm holds that for the time being, Bitcoin’s blockchain is the most tested and trusted, and thus the most secure. However, they are also developing private blockchain technologies citing many of the reasons being put forward by Eris Industries and others.""]"
08/26/2015,"['Support for BIP 100, the market-led scalability fix from core developer Jeff Garzik, is growing as more miners pick sides in bitcoin\'s block size debate.\n\nData from BlockTrail indicates the percentage of blocks mined in support of BIP 100 has quadrupled to 22% following the backing of bitcoin\'s biggest mining pool DiscusFish / F2Pool on Monday night.\n\nMiners have the ability to voice their preference for which proposal they support, be it BIP 100 or an 8MB increase, when they \'tag\' each block they mine. Unlike votes for controversial bitcoin client XT, these tags will not trigger a hard fork of the software.\n\nGarzik\'s proposal, first published in June, calls for a ""free-market-based approach"" to bitcoin\'s scalability. Unlike solutions that impose a set cap on the size of bitcoin blocks that increases over time, each block will be dynamic – its capacity agreed by consensus in the mining community.\n\nThis, Garzik says, is a less risky way to test bigger blocks incrementally – and one that will allow miners to adjust to any potential issues in real-time.\n\nThe \'tags\' come following the announcement of a two-day bitcoin scalability workshop for the currency\'s key engineers and academics in Montreal next month. It is rumoured to be the first time bitcoin\'s top developers will meet all together in person. Another, to be held in Hong Kong, is pencilled in for later this year to cater for the vast mining community located in China.\n\nCurrent statistics\n\nCurrently, DiscusFish / F2Pool, Kano CKPool and Bit Club network, which accounts for around 1.4% of the current hashrate, are supporting BIP 100. Yet, as the statistic above show, miners presenting over half of bitcoin\'s hashpower have not yet wavered from the current 1MB default. Some may yet specify their preference, others may not.\n\nOf all the proposed changes, an 8MB increase has the biggest share of bitcoin\'s hashrate (25.5%), with support from KnCMiner, Antpool, 21 Inc and BW Pool. Meanwhile, Gavin Andresen\'s XT fork – which has been branded ""dangerous"" by some core developers – lags behind with 1%, despite 14.6% of nodes showing support.\n\nAdditionally, Slush.io, the only mining pools having voted for XT so far, appears to have \'switched off\' its vote in its most recent blocks.\n\nTally image via Shutterstock, pool distribution charts via BlockTrail\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

These companies have worked closely with large merchants, such as Overstock and Microsoft, to enable Bitcoin payments in a user-friendly manner; however, these centralized solutions for processing payments also have their downfalls.\n\nAlso Read: Coinbase CEO Armstrong Had ‘Front Row Seat’ for Online Payment Inefficiencies at Airbnb\n\nThe Key Service Offered by Bitcoin Payment Processors\n\nThe key service offered by Bitpay, Coinbase, Bitnet, Snapcard, and others is that they allow merchants to instantly convert any Bitcoin payment into their local currency (usually via a bank deposit). While merchants understand the benefits of accepting Bitcoin payments, such as the lack of chargebacks, most of them are not ready to deal with the price volatility associated with the bitcoin commodity. For this reason, the services offered by these companies are vital to Bitcoin’s growth as a payment network.\n\nThe Problem with Bitcoin Payment Processors\n\nOf course, the main issue with these payment processors is that they can decide to terminate a merchant’s account for any reason they wish. More importantly, they can also be coerced into not working with certain types of merchants on the Internet and in the real world by various government agencies. For example, there is a reason that Bitpay’s e-commerce solution is not integrated into any darknet marketplace. This creates a serious issue for Bitcoin merchants who like using the decentralized payment system but are not ready to deal with the volatility of the bitcoin token.\n\nSmart Hedging Contracts as the Solution\n\nThe good news is that there may be a solution in the works that could solve this pain point for the less-savory Bitcoin merchants in the world. There are multiple platforms in the works, such as Reggie Middleton’s Veritaseum, which allow users to hedge their bitcoin to any other real-world asset via a smart contract. This means that merchants will be able to accept and hold bitcoin (within a smart contract) without having to worry about price volatility. They could hold that bitcoin with the value attached to US dollars, euros, gold, or any other widely-traded asset.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Smart Hedging Contracts\n\nWhile this all sounds good in theory, the reality is that there is not currently a liquid market for this kind of trading to occur. There is not much activity on Veritaseum, although Reggie Middleton has plans for creating that liquidity via large financial institutions. On the other hand, decentralized prediction markets, such as Augur and Truthcoin, could also play a role here.\n\nAs a side note, smart hedging contracts are also what make Abra possible as an app for cash transmissions between any two parties in the world; it’s essentially supposed to be Uber for worldwide money transfers. The platform will eventually take advantage of smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to lock user funds to the US dollar for a period of three days. It’s clear that these sorts of hedging platforms can create powerful new use cases for Bitcoin, and this will definitely be one of the key areas of the Bitcoin industry to watch over the next few years.\n\nFeatured image via Franklin Heijnen.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

This of course, may sound incomprehensible for people who have all sorts of electronic payments at their disposal. However, before finding out about Bitcoin, receiving our money was the number one obstacle in expanding our business.”\n\n- Persianshoes\n\nThe United States imposed sanctions against Iran, following the Iranian Revolution of 1979. They were further expanded in 1995 to include firms dealing with the Iranian government. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 1696 in 2006, and imposed sanctions after Iran refused to suspend its uranium enrichment program.\n\n- U.S. Department of State\n\nThis embargo saw Iran’s economy take a nose dive. Responsibility was attributed to the sanctions, and also the Iranian Government\'s response. A black market economy arose, buying and selling foreign currency. In 2011, when a new wave of sanctions on Iran’s Central Bank drove down the value of the Iranian Rial (IRR). The following year Iran’s government implemented a three-tiered exchange rate in a populist effort to stabilize the cost of staple imports while raising the price of luxury products.\n\nThese developments encouraged further black-market speculation, and businesses suffered as the Rial plummeted. According to United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), one US dollar on the black market sold for 13,350 Iranian Rial (IRR) in Dec 2011, which had jumped to 40,000 by Jan 2013.\n\nUANI is a non-partisan, non-profit advocacy organization based out of the United States that seeks ""to prevent Iran from fulfilling its ambition to become a regional super-power possessing nuclear weapons."" Along with other advocacy campaigns, the organization endeavors to pressure companies to stop doing business with Iran. This is in an effort to halt the Iranian government\'s nuclear program and its alleged development of nuclear weapons. UANI successfully launched a campaign in Feb 2012, demanding that SWIFT cut all financial ties with Iran.\n\nInternational sanctions also prevent foreign credit and debit card providers from providing services in the country.

Hosseini went on to explain. “one feature of bitcoin is the fact that the value of bitcoins is determined by supply and demand in the market and not by the influence of one or a few exchanges. In our platform, users can sell and buy bitcoins based on their own price assessments, and in doing so we are providing a safe and stable environment. We trust that this will lead to the transparency of cryptocurrency prices in Iran.”', ""China's currency devaluation two weeks ago, combined with the country's less than expected growth rates, sent the world stock markets tumbling.

Besides the month-long slide in the Chinese markets, the Dow plummeted from approximately 16,459 on August 21st to 15,446 on the 24th.\n\nWhen the going gets tough, investors have historically flocked toward assets that are considered safer, including cash, gold, and treasury bills. Often times, the asset of choice is gold because it is considered the greatest store of value. However, some think that Bitcoin might one day trump gold as a means of protecting against volatility.\n\nTim Draper, founding partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital fund, believes that bitcoin might one day be the preeminent store of value for investors.\n\n“When bitcoin is mature, I expect people to run to bitcoin the way they do to gold when the market gets scary,” Draper said in an email to Bitcoin Magazine.“Currently, there is not enough usage to make people feel comfortable investing in Bitcoin when they come out of the market. I expect that to change.”\n\nDraper suggests that currently, bitcoin is far too speculative an investment for it to be a store of value. According to Investopedia, a store of value means, “any form of commodity, asset, or money that has value and can be stored and retrieved over time. As long as a currency is relatively stable in its value, money (such as a dollar bill) is the most common and efficient store of value found in an economy.”\n\nFundamentally, the reason people run to cash when the stock market falls is because they view the small inflation to be a small loss in comparison to what could happen in the stock market. Even more, they run to gold because, as Investopedia says, “they can be counted on to retain some value in almost any scenario, especially in those cases where the store of value has a finite supply (like gold).”\n\nFor bitcoin to be considered an efficient store of value, the price of it would need to start rising and stay relatively consistent rather than having significant volatility. Draper explained that the bitcoin ecosystem isn’t in a place, yet, for this to happen.\n\n“There will be pressure on Bitcoin pricing as there is supply to sell as miners get more bitcoin, and less demand to buy as the use cases evolve,” Draper explained. In essence, miners need to sell their bitcoin more to pay for electricity than hoarders and users need to buy. This results in a drop in the price.\n\n“I expect this phenomenon to turn around in about 6 months as use cases become apparent,” Draper went on to say.\n\nDue to the understood finite supply of bitcoin—there will only ever be 21 million coins released—as usage increases and the supply stays relatively constant, the only place for the price to go is up. As the price goes up, investors will potentially see bitcoin as a functioning store of value, which will perpetuate its value.\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and journalist covering finance and bitcoin. He runs a weekly newsletter all about bitcoin and digital currency called Crypto Brief.\n\nPhoto Disney | ABC Television Group / Flickr (CC)', 'Tech giants including Microsoft and IBM have been supporting Bitcoin startups, conferences, accelerators and developers in India. The efforts of these companies are beginning to pay off, as India has seen a gradual increase in the number of developers and freelancers in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n“There is lot of interest from freelancers in India who suddenly are now getting bitcoins from U.S.-based companies, and then they scramble to understand what is bitcoin,” Indian Bitcoin startup Blockonomics founder Shiva Sitamraju told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThe increase of Indian freelancers’ and developers’ involvement with Bitcoin startups and organizations has created an efficient environment for local people to buy and purchase bitcoins instantly.\n\n“From publicly available sources that display data transparently, like LocalBitcoins and Coinsecure, we see about $4 million-$5 million USD moving in bitcoin in India every month. Apart from that, the forums see few 100 BTC being traded as well,” India’s prominent Coinsecure founder Benson Samuel explained.\n\nBarriers Toward Adoption\n\nIndians are skeptical toward new technologies. It took years for the Internet and smartphones to take off in the country, and it may take even longer for bitcoin to reach mainstream adoption in India.\n\nBut, Sitamraju told Bitcoin Magazine, once bitcoin is adopted by a substantial part of the Indian population, it could really explode across the country, especially in rural and underbanked regions.\n\n“Indians are slow technology adopters, and we are far behind China/U.S. in bitcoin adoption. … [O]nce the early adopters/risk [takers] adopt it and enough user-centric applications [sprout]… this stuff really explodes in India. Indians are second-biggest users of blockchain.info, and today, we are seeing growing merchant adoption,” said Sitamraju.\n\nSome of the Indian population’s skepticism towards bitcoin may be due to the Indian government’s tight regulations and restriction for the finance/banking sector. Currently, fewer than 35.5% of households in India maintain bank accounts, and less than 20 percent of the Indian population owns credit cards or debit cards.\n\n“More education and good press coverage is necessary. India has a tightly regulated finance/banking sector and so people/government is a bit weary of new financial instruments,” explained Sitamraju. “It is important to stress than bitcoin is not evil. Tipping people [in] bitcoin so that they can themselves experience the power of the technology is an easy way. Also if major Internet merchants here accept bitcoin it would be a major driving force, as e-commerce companies like Flipkart, Amazon are now booming in India.”\n\nBitcoin’s Potential\n\nThe number of Internet users has been growing at an annual rate of 32 percent, as the cost of smartphones with 3G and 4G data plans and Wi-Fi access have decreased substantially over the last two years. Today, India has more than 300 million Internet users, and the majority are mobile users.\n\nBecause of widespread smartphone penetration in India, many users have begun using mobile bitcoin applications such as Blockchain.info and Coinsecure. To continue to this trend, extraordinary bitcoin startups such as Blockonomics emerged over the last few months, to ease the use of bitcoin for the Indian population.\n\nBlockonomics is a simplified wallet watcher that allows users to track transactions and balance of many public bitcoin addresses at one place. Through Blockonomics, users can receive instant notifications and quick overview of pending and confirmed transactions in their wallets.\n\nHowever, “We are not planning a wallet service, as we believe that the major strength of bitcoin is decentralization and that people should retain control of their own coins,” Sitamraju told Bitcoin Magazine. “We are planning to be a one-stop destination for managing crypto finances having advanced graphs/analytics and eventually becoming the Mint.com of bitcoin.”\n\nStartups such as Blockonomics in HackCoin or bitcoin accelerators recently have been focused on creating Bitcoin applications that could provide users with advanced analytics and data about Bitcoin.\n\nPhoto via Coinsecure', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article.\n\nExclusive: $30M Patrick Byrne deal bridges gap between bitcoin technology and Wall Street\n\n– Reporter, New York Business Journal By Michael del Castillo Reporter, New York Business Journal Aug 26, 2015, 5:09pm EDT\n\nUpdated Aug 26, 2015, 5:51pm EDT\n\n– Reporter, New York Business Journal By Michael del Castillo Reporter, New York Business Journal Aug 26, 2015, 5:09pm EDT\n\nUpdated Aug 26, 2015, 5:51pm EDT""]"
08/27/2015,"['The Bitcoin community is quite literally at a fork in the road, riven by an acrimonious debate between two potential paths forward.\n\nThe division could result in two conflicting versions of the Bitcoin software running at the same time – a dangerous possibility.\n\nGiven these events, it is instructive to look back at the last time there was a major fork in the Bitcoin software, in early 2013.\n\nThat event – and the furious race to fix the problems – is described in Nathaniel Popper’s history of Bitcoin, ""Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money .""\n\nGavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, was in his den in Massachusetts after dinner on March 11, 2013 when he saw some online chatter about disagreement between the computers that were helping to run the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe computers were, in effect, putting together a list of all the recent Bitcoin transactions – what was referred to in Bitcoin lingo as a block.\n\nEvery 10 minutes or so, a block compiled by one computer was picked – almost at random – to become the official record of what had happened on the Bitcoin network since the last block was chosen.\n\nThe computer that generated the chosen block also received 25 new Bitcoins, which was why the process was known as mining.\n\nWhen Gavin checked in, the computers on the network were divided on what block they were trying to mine—was it the 225,430th block since Bitcoin began back in 2009, or the 225,431st?\n\nIt sounded like an arcane technical disagreement, but Gavin quickly realized that this was what had long been known as the biggest potential danger to the Bitcoin network: a “hard fork,” a term coined to describe a situation where one group of computers on the network went off in one direction, agreeing about which computer had mined each block, while another group of computers on the network moved in another direction, agreeing on a different set of winners for each block.\n\nThis was disastrous because it meant that there was disagreement about who owned which Bitcoins.\n\nOn this evening in March, there had been a split only on the last few blocks—not the whole blockchain history—but if it wasn’t fixed, there would essentially be two conflicting Bitcoin networks, which would likely result in no one trusting either of them, or Bitcoin itself.\n\n“this seems bad,” a user on the Bitcoin chat channel wrote a few minutes after the problem first appeared.\n\n“‘seems’ is putting it lightly,” another shot back.\n\n“We have a full fork,” one of the most respected developers, a Belgian programmer named Pieter Wuille, pronounced a few beats later on the chat channel. The price of Bitcoin dropped from $49 back to $45 in a half hour, erasing all the previous week’s gains.\n\nMark Karpeles, the owner of the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, joined the discussion a half hour later and quickly stopped processing all transactions at Mt. Gox; a few minutes after that, Erik Voorhees said his gambling company, SatoshiDice, was doing the same as long as the fork persisted.\n\nBy the time Gavin entered the conversation, it was clear that the problem was not the result of any sort of malice. Instead, computers that had downloaded a recent update to the Bitcoin software, version 0.8, were accepting blocks— and awarding new Bitcoins to miners—that were not considered legitimate by the old software, version 0.7, and the computers still running it.\n\nThe solution to this was clear: everyone on the network had to agree to move en masse to one of the two versions and adopt the blockchain accepted by that software. But there were no rules for deciding which version to pick—and once a version was chosen, no one knew how long it would take for all the computers, or nodes to get on board.\n\nAfter racing through the possibilities, Gavin concluded that the most fundamental rule of Bitcoin was the democratic principle that the blockchain with the most support was the official one. In this case, the version created by the new software, 0.8, had a lot more computing power behind it.\n\nThat was, in no small part, because the most sophisticated miners had been among the first to update their software – especially the so-called mining pools, which allowed lots of people to combine their computing resources with each person getting a proportional fraction of the total winnings.\n\nGavin thought that if these mining pools had the most power, everyone else needed to update to join them. In addition to having more power, the miners on the new software had newly generated coins with the software that they would be unlikely to want to give up.\n\nBut Gavin quickly faced resistance from almost everyone else involved in the conversation; most participants believed that only the large miners would be responsive enough to change their software, back to the old version, to get everyone into agreement. Somewhat surprisingly, the operators of the biggest mining pools quickly agreed that they would revert to the old software, version 0.7.\n\nThe operator of the prominent pool BTC Guild said that just switching his pool alone would get a majority of the computing power back on the earlier software. Doing this would mean losing the Bitcoins that had been mined since version 0.8 came out. But the losses would be much greater if the entire Bitcoin network lost the confidence of users.\n\n“There is no way the 0.8 chain can continue in this situation,” the operator of BTC Guild, who went by the screen name Eleuthria, said.\n\nThe developers on the chat channel thanked him, recognizing that he was sacrificing for the greater good. When he finally had moved his computers over to the new software, about an hour later, Eleuthria took stock of his own costs.\n\n“It could’ve been worse if I hadn’t been able to start moving back to 0.7 quickly.” But, he wrote, “this fork cost me 150–200 BTC”—over $5,000 at the time.\n\nFor the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, the price had fallen to $37, some 20 percent, within a few hours, and some online reports struck an ominous note.\n\n“This is a dark day for Bitcoin. Implications for the exchange rate will likely be huge,” a site called The Bitcoin Trader announced.\n\nThe incident had indeed revealed the sort of unanticipated problems that frequently occur in decentralized networks, which rely on lots of different members, with all their vagaries, acting independently.\n\n\n\nBut almost as soon as Eleuthria had fully switched his servers over to version 0.7 the price began recovering, and within hours people were talking about how the event had actually demonstrated some of Bitcoin’s greatest strengths.\n\nThe network had not had to rely on some central authority to wake up to the problem and come up with a solution. Everyone online had been able to respond in real time, as was supposed to happen with open source software, and the users had settled on a response after a debate that tapped the knowledge of all of them—even when it meant going against the recommendation of the lead developer, Gavin.\n\nMeanwhile, the incentives that Satoshi Nakamoto had built into the network had again worked as intended, encouraging people to look out for the common good over short-term personal gain.\n\nFrom Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money by Nathaniel Popper. Copyright © 2015 by Nathaniel Popper. Reprinted courtesy of Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers.', 'Just after sunrise on August 1st, Tokyo police stormed into a sleek two-story townhouse on a quiet residential street in Japan\'s capital and arrested Mark Karpeles, the 30-year-old head of Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange in the world. By the time they led the doughy, pale Frenchman away, the police could barely make their way through the throngs of reporters closing in outside.\n\nRelated 4chan\'s Overlord Reveals Why He Walked Away His website made him an unlikely teenage celebrity — then it spun out of control\n\nJust three months earlier, when I met Karpeles here, the scene was considerably calmer. He was baking apple quiche, a recipe passed down from his grandmother. Scruffy and chipper, his dark hair pulled back in a loose ponytail, he wore baggy green pants and a flour-dusted black T-shirt with the words \'This Isn\'t Even My Final Form.\' System of a Down played from his radio. Apples and bread crumbs covered the living-room table he otherwise used for his model train set.\n\nKarpeles was the accidental emperor of bitcoin, a hapless geek who, as much to his own surprise as others\', became the most powerful lord of digital cash. During his reign, bitcoin, the leading form of virtual currency, rose in value from approximately a quarter to more than $1,200. The Wall Street Journal estimated that at one point Mt. Gox was processing 80 percent of all bitcoin transactions in the world. At its peak, the company traded more than $4 million a month. Tyler Winklevoss — one of the famed twins who sued Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of Facebook for a $65 million settlement and is among the bullish investors in digital money — says Mt. Gox was ""the most important and prominent property in bitcoin.""\n\nBut in February 2014, it was discovered that a half-billion dollars worth of bitcoins simply vanished from Karpeles\' exchange, leaving customers around the world unable to withdraw their funds. It\'s the largest online heist in history. (Estimates vary on the exact amount. Many have reported $450 million; Karpeles says it could be as high as $650 million.) Some — including even those who worked closely with Karpeles — suspected it was an inside job. ""We had an ongoing joke: \'Take pizza to Mark when he\'s in jail,\' "" Ashley Barr, the first employee at Mt. Gox, tells me. ""We always assumed that was where he\'d end up.""\n\nRelated PHOTOS: Inside the Wild Lifestyle of the Hackers Who Pulled Off History\'s Greatest Cybercrime\n\nThe Japanese police arrested Karpeles for allegedly padding his digital accounts with $1 million worth of fake bitcoins and fleecing another $8.9 million from Mt. Gox customer deposits. He\'s still being investigated for what, if any, role he had in the disappearance of the half-billion in bitcoins.\n\nKarpeles, over several months of interviews, denied culpability. ""A lot of people seem to think that someone at Mt. Gox was evil,"" he says. ""I know that I didn\'t steal anything. I mean, if I had, like, $650 million in bitcoin, or even a fraction of this, I wouldn\'t be here.""\n\nKarpeles never expected to be at the center of a financial revolution. Growing up in Burgundy and Paris, the melancholic only child of a single mother (he never knew his father), Karpeles escaped into the world on the other side of his computer screen. His mother, Anne, a science teacher and amateur coder, wrote a musical keyboard for him to play on his Sinclair computer. ""I created small game programs for him, and he liked it,"" his mother e-mailed me in French. ""A lot.""\n\nBy 10, Karpeles had started teaching himself to code by taking apart his grandmother\'s alarm system. While other kids dreamed of being rock stars or athletes, Karpeles dreamed of finding fame through coding. ""I wanted the software I write to be useful enough for everyone to want to use it,"" he says.\n\nAt a young age, he was sent to a Catholic boarding school in the Champagne valley. But, socially awkward and geeky, he was bullied by his classmates and ostracized at school. ""It was not so easy to adapt,"" he tells me one afternoon, as he browses manga in a Tokyo bookshop. Karpeles spent his days devouring Japanese comics and scribbling code in a notebook, since he didn\'t have access to a PC.\n\nAfter finishing middle school, he put his skills into practice when he moved to Paris with his mother, and began, in his early teens, hacking into shopping sites so he could get anything he wanted for free. (When I ask how he did it, he smiles and says, ""It\'s probably not a good idea for me to tell you."") Karpeles savored his newfound power. Stealing Gameboys and mobile phones for his classmates, he learned, was a way to make friends. ""A lot of people respected me for that,"" he recalls. ""I did feel more important, in a way. If I need something, I press a button and I get it.""\n\nRelated The Fall of Internet Crime Kingpin Ross Ulbricht It was the eBay of vice, an online hub of guns, drugs and crime. But its alleged founder soon learned that you can\'t rule the underworld without spilling some blood\n\nKarpeles\' scam ran for two years, so long that his initial fear of getting caught faded. ""After a while, you see nothing happening, so you forget about it,"" he says. Forget about it, that is, until the police showed up and carted the teenager off to jail. As a minor, he got away with only probation, but the experience marked the beginning of years of adolescent turmoil. To his mother\'s despair, he ran away and attempted to live on the streets of Paris for a week. Through his teens and early twenties, he sank into a suicidal depression; at his lowest point, he made a noose out of a computer cable (""It was the only thing I had around,"" he tells me with a shrug), though he never brought himself to use it.\n\nIn 2009, he moved to Japan, a country he\'d been fascinated by since getting hooked on anime as a boy. Despite being a gaijin, or foreigner, he felt at home for the first time in his life, quickly learning the language and launching his own Web hosting company. He was first introduced to bitcoin when a customer in Peru told Karpeles he was having trouble getting a credit card and asked if he could pay with bitcoins instead.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by a mysterious coder (or group of coders) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto as a radical new payment system: decentralized, unregulated and, for the most part, anony-mous. Though it has real value (with a current exchange rate of around $250), bitcoin exists electronically. There\'s no paper, no coins, no bank to charge transaction fees or government to control the flow. Intrigued, Karpeles became an early adopter of the currency. He found purpose and community among bitcoin faithful such as Jed McCaleb, a young American who\'d recently launched his own bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox.\n\nAriel Zambelich\n\nMt. Gox was originally a site McCaleb had made for people to exchange Magic cards (thus the name — Magic: the Gathering Online Exchange, or Mt. Gox for short). But by July 2010, he\'d devoted it to bitcoin instead, setting it up as the currency\'s first online brokerage: processing purchases and holding customers\' money. By taking a small commission on trades, Mt. Gox was set to bring in $100,000 its first year, Karpeles says. But there were setbacks, like when a hacker stole $45,000 worth of virtual currency. By March 2011, McCaleb wanted out.\n\nAccording to Karpeles, McCaleb, who he\'d become familiar with online, asked him if he\'d want to take over Mt. Gox. All he asked for in return was a 50-50 split of the profits for the first six months, and a 12 percent stake in the future. ""I basically got it for free,"" Karpeles recalls. (McCaleb declined to comment.) At the time, with only about 1,000 people using the exchange, Karpeles hardly expected to get more than ramen money. But he figured it would be ""a new adventure.""\n\nIt didn\'t take long for Karpeles\' new adventure to take an unexpected turn. On June 6th, 2011, just three months after he took over Mt. Gox, Sens. Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder and Drug Enforcement Agency administrator Michele Leonhart, urging them to shut down Silk Road, an online black market predominantly used for drugs. It wasn\'t just the site that was a concern, but the new economy making it possible. ""The only method of payment for these illegal purchases is an untraceable peer-to-peer currency known as bitcoins,"" the senators wrote.\n\nHoping to stay out of the fray, Karpeles wrote to the DEA, offering to comply with any investigation. ""Ultimately, we are pursuing a goal of accepted legitimacy, both for bitcoin and our exchange,"" he wrote. To protect against drug dealers laundering money on the site, Mt. Gox began to track suspicious transactions, especially anyone moving large sums. All the news about Silk Road, however, proved good for business. With growing exposure, the price of bitcoin hit a new peak of $30. In less than two months, according to Karpeles, Mt. Gox had grown from 1,000 customers to 65,000.\n\nBut Karpeles\' burgeoning empire would soon take a massive hit. On June 18th, someone claimed to have hacked into the Mt. Gox computers and was putting its files up for sale. Customers began to notice bitcoins mysteriously disappearing from their accounts. Karpeles took to Twitter and Reddit to reassure the nervous bitcoiners that, in fact, the problems affected only a handful of users. ""Trust me,"" he wrote, ""if we had a problem in Mt. Gox and it was actively exploited, we\'d have way more than a dozen compromised accounts.""\n\nYet the next night, Karpeles awoke to an urgent call. The price of bitcoin was crashing. Around 2 a.m., he discovered a hacker was cashing out thousands of bitcoins, and thus plummeting the price from $17 per bitcoin to less than a penny. ""Someone\'s cashing out the motherlode on mtgox!"" one person posted on the forums. Karpeles quickly moved $7 million in bitcoins on the site to another server and temporarily shut down Mt. Gox before more damage could be done.\n\nThese were just the first of many warning signs Karpeles seemed to ignore. Behind the scenes, people were growing concerned over his role in the nascent bitcoin economy. Chief among them was Roger Ver, the so-called ""Bitcoin Jesus"" who was also living in Tokyo at the time. A wiry libertarian from Silicon Valley, Ver had renounced his U.S. citizenship after getting arrested for flipping fireworks on eBay and serving 10 months in prison. Ver, who made millions selling computer hardware online, saw bitcoin as a way to subvert the government he\'d grown to despise.\n\n""A real clear milestone is when governments no longer control money,"" Ver tells me one night at a Tokyo steakhouse, one of the many in town that accept bitcoins. ""If the world\'s using bitcoin,"" he believes, ""governments won\'t be able to fund wars through inflation like they do today.""\n\nVer bought up what\'s now worth millions in bitcoins, and he committed himself to spreading the word — after moving to Japan, he was the first to lend a hand to Mt. Gox in the wake of the hacking attack, desperate to keep the currency viable and attractive. But he grew dismayed over what he saw as Karpeles\' strange sense of remove. ""He has no work ethic,"" says Ver, who had to deal with panicked customers during the crisis while Karpeles went home. (Karpeles says he left because he ""couldn\'t work on the code with everyone around."")\n\nStill, the company, and currency, survived the early hacks and continued to boom. Karpeles expanded to dozens of employees and moved to Google\'s former office building in Tokyo. Despite his tendency to be, as his mother puts it, ""withdrawn,"" it seemed to some that the success was going to his head. ""I had to talk him out of buying a Lamborghini,"" says co-worker Barr. ""I always felt Mark was trying to prove something — like, from childhood he was told he wouldn\'t amount to much. One time at his computer he said, \'I wish my old teachers could see me now.\' He wanted to be the head of something big.""\n\nFor Mt. Gox, one of the biggest breaks came from the ""Winklevi."" The twins had been vacationing on the Spanish island of Ibiza when they heard about bitcoin. The two had just begun spending their Facebook settlement by investing in various startups, and they were looking for the next big thing.\n\n""Bitcoin and digital currency is just this thing that was always going to happen,"" Tyler Winklevoss says. The Winklevi bet big, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on bitcoin. And there was only one place to buy it in bulk, they realized: this company run by an elusive Frenchman in Tokyo, Mt. Gox. Still, the Winklevi were aware of the risks of getting involved with the exchange. ""It\'s like, you see houses built on the side of a hill and they don\'t have insurance,"" Tyler says, ""then a mudslide comes along and the houses get destroyed.""\n\nBy 2013, Karpeles felt like he was achieving his lifelong dream of reaching computers around the world. But while he was enjoying his newfound wealth, the feds suspected his hands might be getting dirty in something nefarious: running Silk Road. In April 2012, investigators were able to identify Silk Road bitcoins being laundered on Mt. Gox. And by that summer, the lead investigator, Jared Der-Yeghiayan, had zeroed in on ""a good target,"" as he later put it: Karpeles.\n\nIn an affidavit, Der-Yeghiayan stated there was ""probable cause"" that the e-mail accounts of Karpeles — whom he described as ""a self-proclaimed computer hacker"" — would contain evidence on a conspiracy to sell drugs online and run a money-laundering business.\n\nOn May 9th, investigators filed a separate affidavit to seize $2 million from Karpeles\' U.S. bank accounts for allegedly operating an illegal money-transfer business. By doing this, Karpeles\' U.S. business would effectively be shut down. (In a bizarre twist, the investigator who filed the affidavit was later revealed to be Shaun Bridges, one of two Silk Road investigators who broke bad while tracking the site\'s elusive founder, known as Dread Pirate Roberts. Bridges, a Secret Service agent, had moved $820,000 in stolen bitcoins on Mt. Gox, and some speculate that he ordered the seizure in an attempt to erase traces of his own misdeeds.)\n\nWith the feds squeezing Karpeles, Mizuho Bank, the firm in Japan that handled all the international transfers and withdrawals for Mt. Gox, refused to process any more withdrawals from the site. When Mt. Gox customers began complaining that it was taking longer and longer to withdraw money, Karpeles would stall and reply that there was a ""backlog"" of orders. Meanwhile, the feds cracked the Silk Road case. In October 2013, authorities arrested Ross Ulbricht, a 29-year-old Texan, for running Silk Road. (This past May, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison.)\n\nBy early 2014, concerns were mounting over Mt. Gox, which ""started to look like a roach motel,"" according to Tyler Winklevoss, who, along with his brother, got out unscathed. But others wouldn\'t be so fortunate. On February 7th, 2014, Mt. Gox announced it was suspending all withdrawals. The decision sent bitcoin value dropping more than eight percent and created panic online.\n\nThe crash showed the power of Mt. Gox – and just how vulnerable the currency was to the company\'s troubles. ""It was the only exchange,"" says prominent bitcoin investor Barry Silbert, ""but it was one of the worst-run businesses."" After two long weeks without any new information, customers logged on to Mt. Gox on February 24th to find the most nightmarish thing of all: a blank page. Their worst fears were confirmed when a note appeared on the site. A ""decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being,"" it read.\n\nJIJI Press/Getty\n\nAccording to Karpeles, the problem stemmed from what\'s called a ""transaction malleability,"" a software flaw that allowed people on the outside to manipulate the bitcoin transactions and steal money from the exchange. At first, he tells me, he had no idea how much bitcoin was missing, but the deeper he dug, the worse it became: By his estimate, $650 million in bitcoins were gone. ""It really felt unreal,"" he recalls late one night in a subterranean Tokyo bar. ""I don\'t know how to describe that. When you get a hospital operation without any anesthetic, it hurts at first, but at some point the pain reaches a point where you don\'t feel anything anymore.""\n\nHigh above the anime billboards and lights of Tokyo, Karpeles hid inside his apartment, terrified. Protesters had flown in from around the world to camp outside his office. Reporters loomed outside his home. He got death threats. ""We need an organization to search and torture and kill Mark Karpeles,"" read one anonymous post on a bitcoin message board. ""I didn\'t feel safe for my life,"" he tells me.\n\nOn February 28th, 2014, Karpeles filed for bankruptcy and held a press conference in Tokyo. As he stood before the cameras in his ill-fitting gray suit, his mind raced. ""There were weaknesses in the system,"" he stammered. ""I\'m truly sorry to have caused inconvenience."" He says he wanted to say more, that he was sorry for what happened, how ""devastated"" he felt. But instead he just bowed awkwardly in apology as the cameras flashed. ""I tried to speak,"" he tells me, ""but I didn\'t feel any words come out.""\n\nAs Mt. Gox\'s collapse made headlines, it wasn\'t just the future of bitcoin cast into doubt, but Karpeles\' role in the debacle. Suspicions rose that March when the company announced it had found 200,000 bitcoins in a forgotten digital wallet — the equivalent of forgetting $125 million in gold you left under a mattress.\n\n""This isn\'t something you could accidentally misplace,"" says Jay Edelson, an attorney representing the 600,000 North American Mt. Gox customers in a class-action suit. Investigators hope to recover the missing bitcoins, a difficult task in an age when someone can hide half a billion dollars on a thumb-drive. ""Someone has hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin that has not been returned,"" says Edelson, ""and it is out there in the universe.""\n\nFor the true believers of digital currency, the fall of Mt. Gox and Karpeles\' arrest mark the end of bitcoin\'s Wild West. With major banks such as Goldman Sachs now investing millions in virtual currency exchanges, bullish investors are betting that bitcoin will become ""the future of money,"" as Cameron Winklevoss says. He, along with his brother, is set to launch a Wall Street-friendly exchange called Gemini.\n\nIn the meantime, police are still trying to find Mt. Gox\'s missing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins and determine what went wrong. Some blame incompetence. Nicolas Christin, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, examined several leaked Mt. Gox databases and found evidence of bugs, missing records and internal accounting that was ""a horrible mess,"" he tells me. In the bankruptcy filing, Karpeles acknowledged that he had been aware of vulnerabilities since 2011, leading others to believe he had, at best, overlooked years of leaking funds.\n\nOthers insist this was an elaborate theft. In January, after a six-month investigation into Mt. Gox, the Japanese police concluded the heist was at least a ""partial inside job."" Many people, including the lawyers filing the class-action suit, are pointing to Karpeles himself. ""Mt. Gox was run by Mark,"" says Edelson. ""He had control of all the code, all the transactions, and he kept everybody out of the process. All signs point to him as the person who did this.""\n\nKarpeles, as of this writing, is still being questioned by Japanese investigators and has not yet been charged with any crimes. He has admitted to reporters that he did create fake bitcoins, but only as ""a test"" for new software, not with the intent of making himself rich. He has also said he will ""of course deny"" any charges that may come. So what does he say really happened at Mt. Gox? When I last saw Karpeles at his townhouse in May, he told me he suspected that perhaps someone within the company was the victim of a phishing attack, which allowed an outside hacker access to the Mt. Gox database. ""I don\'t know if there was inside help or not,"" he says. ""I still believe it\'s very likely someone from the outside coordinated the operation.""\n\nThroughout my time with Karpeles in Tokyo, he maintained his innocence with such calm that I was left with two possible conclusions. He\'s either the greatest criminal mastermind of the digital age or an overeager chump who got in way over his head, and, perhaps, resorted to the most desperate means to get out. But whether he\'s found guilty or innocent, he\'s not done dreaming yet. He hopes to take the lessons he\'s learned at Mt. Gox and create a more secure form of digital cash: ""I still want to be on every computer in the world.""', 'Bitcoin penetrated American academia for the first time in 2014, as top-ranked US universities New York University and Duke University offered their inaugural cryptocurrency courses that year. Since then, Bitcoin courses at US colleges and universities is a new trend.\n\nNYU and Duke were each ranked in the top 10 in relevant categories in the US News and World Report. NYU’s first course was called The Law and Business of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies. The Duke course was called Innovation, Disruption and Cryptoventures, with a research emphasis on potential businesses that use the block chain.\n\nPrinceton offers a course, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies, through Coursera. First offered in the spring, the course begins once more in September 2015. In a description of the course on the website, the 6 weeks of study are designed to teach “everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You’ll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And you’ll be able to integrate ideas from Bitcoin in your own projects.” The school has also offered a free Bitcoin course.\n\nThe Stanford University School of Engineering in Stanford, Calif. will offer a new course, Crypto Currencies: Bitcoin and Friends, in September. The course lasts from Sept. 21 to Dec. 9, 2015.\n\nRead More: Stanford University To Offer Cryptocurrencies Course\n\n“The technology behind Bitcoin and other crypto currencies can be an indispensable tool for protecting information,” said Dan Boneh, a professor of computer science at the school who will be teaching the course. Boneh said virtual currency has the potential to revolutionize business payment transactions.\n\nNorth along Interstate 5 approximately 11 hours, the Mt. Hood Community College has also introduced cryptocurrency curriculum into their coursework. The college, located outside of Portland, Oregon, offers the course, Bitcoin & Crypto-Currencies, for the first time this fall.\n\nAccording to a course description on Mt. Hood Community College’s website,\n\nThis extensive course covers the background knowledge needed to fully comprehend the principles behind bitcoin, the history and development of crypto-currencies, the peer-to-peer network and how to safely use and store bitcoin and data security.\n\nOn the campus of MIT Bitcoin ecosystems have been created among the student population. The school made the “Bitcoin Airdrop” a thing. The school has offered a Bitcoin class.\n\nIt’s not only US colleges and universities offering Bitcoin related coursework. The University of Nicosia in Cyprus became the first accredited University to accept Bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Commonwealth governments should regulate bitcoin to address the risks associated with digital currencies without stifling innovation.\n\nThis was one of the recommendations put forward by the Commonwealth\'s Virtual Currencies Working Group during a three-day conference held in London this week.\n\nAfter hearing from the banking sector, academia, virtual currency operators, users and law enforcement agencies, the group urged governments to re-consider their legislative response to virtual currencies such as bitcoin and strengthen law enforcement to counter criminal use.\n\nThe group, which noted that virtual currencies have potential benefits and could help drive development, concluded:\n\n""Member states should consider the applicability of their existing legal frameworks to virtual currencies and where appropriate they should consider adapting them or enacting new legislation to regulate virtual currencies.""\n\nAdditionally, the group asked governments to provide education on digital currencies and funding for training law enforcement agents, prosecutors, judges, regulatory authorities and the financial sector.\n\nThe group is expected to prepare a report on the prevalence and impact of virtual currencies and plans to reconvene in early 2016 to consider drafting technical guidance on the subject for member states.\n\nView the full conclusions and outcomes from the event here:\n\nConclusions from the Commonwealth Virtual Currencies Working Group\'s Three-Day Event\n\nCommonwealth flags image via Kiev.Victor / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That leaves political barriers as the primary challenge for bitcoin in Cuba. This is no small obstacle in a country where the government only began gradually relaxing control over the economy in recent years.\n\nOne area where controls remain firm is currency. Cuba has a unique dual-currency system: There is one regular peso for mass use, and a much more valuable peso that is convertible to foreign currency, known as the CUC (“kook”). The regular peso trades at about 26 to the dollar, while the CUC trades one-for-one to the dollar, but the government takes a 10-cent “dollar penalty” and a 3-cent conversion fee. Some products, even some necessities, can only be bought with CUCs.\n\nBy imposing these capital controls, the government boosts its much-needed foreign currency reserves each time a foreigner changes money or a Cuban expatriate remits money to family members back home. The controls also make it more difficult for Cubans to leave the island with their wealth.\n\nOf course, one of bitcoin’s most powerful features is its ability to avoid traditional capital controls—that’s why the currency is such a big hit in China, where users could move money outside of the government’s watchful eye, despite constant threats of a crackdown.\n\nIf bitcoin were to become more broadly adopted in Cuba, it could open up a whole new range of activities. Instead of bringing down large amounts of physical cash, Cuban Americans seeking to invest in, say, Cuba’s hot real estate market, could do the transaction in bitcoins. And instead of winding up with a ton of dollars they would have to convert or stick in their mattress, Cuban recipients of bitcoin could take that money out of the country and convert it to another currency without penalty.\n\nDespite a series of government announcements that the dual-currency system will come to an end—these stretch back to 2013—it has yet to happen. Officials say the cautiousness is meant to avoid a run on the currency; observers say it’s because the abrupt transition might threaten the government’s control of the economy.\n\nIn any case, currency unification is seen as a key component of Cuba’s economic reforms by all parties; the costs and complications of two kinds of money are dreadfully inefficient. If the proliferation of bitcoin hastens that process, it will be a win for strange bedfellows—the Obama administration’s hope that normalization will spur reform and the bitcoin community’s push against centralized economic control.', 'UPDATE (28th August 14:21 BST): Mining firm 21 Inc, which accounts for over 7% of the current bitcoin hashrate, has also noted its support for BIP 100. Garzik\'s proposal now has 58.6% of the network\'s hashing power behind it.\n\nUPDATE (28th August 13:12 BST): One of the leading transaction processors, KNC Miner, is now tagging its blocks in support of BIP 100. In a statement, the company said it would support both BIP 100 or BIP 101 as they would ""propel bitcoin for all"".\n\nBTCChina has backed Jeff Garzik\'s block size scaling solution, giving BIP 100 a majority of the network\'s hashing power.\n\nWith the addition of the Chinese bitcoin firm today, the proposal now has support from the top three \'blockmakers\' – who account for over 50% of the network\'s hashrate.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, BTCChina CEO Bobby Lee said the company\'s structure gave it the ability that few others have:\n\n""We are in the unique position of seeing this from several sides, a mining pool, a wallet service, and an exchange. So we must come forward with a sound perspective, and not just vote quickly for the sake of asking the industry to move on.""\n\nUp until today, the firm – alongside China’s other pools – had been backing the 8MB proposal, however it is now taking issue with the consequences of a sudden step change. In an open letter, to released on its blog today, the company said:\n\n""BTCChina has experienced firsthand the problems of high orphan rates and the related risks of the blockchain forking. Our perspective is that the Internet today, in China and also globally, is not yet ready for unrestrained, automatic increases of the block size.""\n\nIf BIP 100 is adopted by the industry, BTCChina will vote for a 2MB limit, with a view to increase to 8MB in the ""mid-term"". This, the firm says, will give stakeholders time to study any effects the increased block size has on the network and plan ahead accordingly.\n\nBTC China is also one of the sponsors behind a Montreal workshop gathering many bitcoin stakeholders to discuss the pros and cons of various scaling solutions. Lee added:\n\n""Even though this issue is not fully resolved yet, I have full confidence that we will come together as a community and one solution will emerge that everyone can be happy with.""\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Acceptance of bitcoin donations has been steadily on the rise for several years already, with more and more charities accepting the cryptocurrency both at events and on websites.\n\nGiving USA, a 59-year old publication highlighting philanthropy, estimates that Americans gave $358.38 billion in 2014. This figure shows a 7.1% increase from 2013, and after adjusting for inflation, it’s the highest total since before the Great Recession.\n\nThe largest source of charitable giving in the US last year was from individuals, at $258.51 billion. Of these funds 32% went to religion organizations, 15% to education, 12% to human services and grant-making foundations, and 8% to health organizations.\n\nThe top five reasons people donate to charity, according to a BBB report, are for emotional satisfaction, recognition, to help the local community, to maximize money\'s impact, and personal tax benefits.\n\nAs more and more people move their daily activities onto the internet, donations to charities who list themselves online are typically on the rise too. In 2014, online giving grew 8.9% in 2014 compared to 2013, while overall charitable giving grew by 4.9%. 100 of the largest charities reported receiving 13% more in online donations.\n\nSmaller nonprofits grew their online donations the most, according to a Charitable Giving Report, derived from The Blackbaud Index. It’s now easier than ever for new charities to accept funding, but there are costs involved.\n\nPayPal company, Braintree, processes donation payments for GiveWell, an American nonprofit charity evaluator and altruism focused organization. GiveWell is charged 2.7% and $0.30 on each transaction. The fee is taken out on GiveWell\'s end which means if you donate $100, GiveWell receive $97.\n\nBureaucracy, graft, and simple inefficiencies can also whittle a $100 donation down to a single meal for someone, or no real benefit at all. Direct Relief attempts to add transparency with it\'s unique map-based tracking system. There are also a number of organisations, including Givalike, that try to highlight the worst, and best, charities to donate to.\n\nIn May, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), filed a lawsuit against four cancer charities which included the Cancer Fund of America and the Breast Cancer Society. The lawsuit alleged the operators used as much as 15 percent of more than $187 million raised to cover salaries and personal expenses, including trips to Disney World, concert tickets and dating site memberships over the course of 2008 to 2012. According to the lawsuit only spent 3 percent of the collective funds raised were used for the intended charitable purposes.\n\n""The defendants\' egregious scheme effectively deprived legitimate cancer charities and cancer patients of much-needed funds and support... The defendants took in millions of dollars in donations meant to help cancer patients, but spent it on themselves and their fundraisers."" - Jessica Rich, director of the FTC\'s Bureau of Consumer Protection\n\nAn example of how bitcoin donations can impact charities is shown in the BitGive Foundation\'s recent video, which details how a water well at a girls’ school in Western Kenya was funded entirely with $11,000 in Bitcoin donations. “It has made a huge impact”, says founder and executive director, Connie Gallippi.\n\nDirect Relief recently partnered with ChangeTip, making it easy to receive bitcoin donations. Direct Relief, a California-based 501c3 organization has become one of the most popular and highly-rated international charities for the victims of disaster relief and poverty.\n\nThe organisations mission statement is “to improve the health and lives of people affected by poverty or emergency situations by mobilizing and providing essential medical resources needed for their care.”\n\nTogether with ChangeTip, Direct Relief has launched an eight-day fundraising campaign to help prevent deaths from pregnancy and childbirth complications in Africa. Since bitcoin has no transaction fees, 100% of the donated funds go toward the cause, which in this case is to purchase prenatal vitamins for 2,000 expecting mothers in the West African nations of Sierra Leone and Liberia. A single $5 bottle of prenatal vitamins can provide for one safe pregnancy, roughly 0.02 Bitcoin at current exchange rates.\n\nUsing ChangeTip makes donating effortless across many different social media platforms. Twitter users can tweet their donations within just a few words while Reddit users can leave a tip by simply posting a sentence similar to “@ChangeTip give /u/Direct_Relief $10.”\n\nWhen ChangeTip finds these commands it automatically moves the right amount of bitcoin out of the senders\' ChangeTip account and into the recipient\'s account. When recipients don\'t have a ChangeTip account yet, it creates one for them automatically, notifying them how to access their funds.\n\nSo far, people have mostly used the platform to send small payments such as paying for a beer ($3.50), a coffee ($1.50), a doughnut ($.35) or a custom-named amount on many of the most popular social media sites, including Reddit, Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook.\n\nWhen ChangeTip approached Direct Relief for the campaign, they had not even considered accepting bitcoin payments, but quickly found it fit their needs very well.\n\n- Victoria van Eyk, ChangeTip’s head of community\n\nChangeTip is only one of many options. A bitcoin wallet has also been set up for Direct Relief, so that all bitcoin users can donate directly. Many other major charities use BitPay or Coinbase to process donations for them.\n\nSave The Children, a top-rated charity founded in 1919 to provide aid for European children who were affected by World War I, has been accepting bitcoin donations since late 2013. The charity started using Bitpay in 2014. The charity is currently running a campaign to raise money to help devastated children and families in Nepal, suffering after the worst earthquake in the country in 81 years. The earthquake killed more than 9,000 people and injured more than 23,000.\n\nThe American Red Cross, one of the largest and most recognized humanitarian organizations, has enjoyed bitcoin donations through a partnership with BitPay since November 2014.\n\n- Elizabeth Ploshay, Bitpay account manager\n\nGiven time, and greater bitcoin adoption, all charities may be inclined to adopt bitcoin donations. Bitcoin provides charities with a cheaper option, donations have no transaction or foreign exchange costs, and can be sent internationally without intermediaries. Donors can also make micropayments, and track their donations from start to finish.', 'The first ever bitcoin exchange in Iran has opened, opening up the cryptocurrency to a previously untapped market. BTXCapital will offer instant deposits and real-time buy and sell orders to users in the country through Draglet\'s exchange platform, though regulatory issues surrounding bitcoin in Iran remain unclear.\n\nThere are more than 46 million internet users in Iran, according to Internet World Stats, yet no convenient avenues for people to purchase bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. In rolling out the new service, Draglet and BTXCapital have both cited increasing demand in Iran for bitcoin as a remittance service.\n\n""It\'s really hard to get hold of bitcoin in Iran,"" Ganesh Jung, CEO of Draglet, told IBTimes UK. ""There were ways to buy bitcoin but the process was very difficult and the amounts it was possible to buy were small.\n\n""The market is massive. A large population with a high proportion connected to the internet means there is a lot of completely untapped market potential. Our platform makes trading really easy. All you need to do is deposit some local currency and then you can trade.""\n\nBTXCapital is not the first cryptocurrency company to operate in Iran, where peer-to-peer sales are offered through LocalBitcoins. However, regulation surrounding bitcoin in the country remains a grey area. Naser Hakimi, IT Director of Iran\'s Central Bank, said in 2014 that bitcoin in Iran is illegal under Article 2 of Iran\'s \'Money and Banking Act\'.\n\nArticle 2 states: ""The official currency of the country comes solely in the form of paper money and metal coins. Only paper money and metal coins that have been produced after the enactment of these regulations are legal tender.""\n\nWhile this makes the Iranian Rial the only official currency, it does not explicitly state that using bitcoin for other purposes – for example, as a means to transfer money overseas – is prohibited.\n\n""From a Western perspective, it\'s cool to have bitcoin spreading this way,"" Jung said. ""There are no legal concerns from our side but the Iranian government could block this kind of service.\n\n""However, we don\'t think they will restrict the trading of bitcoin. I think the recent nuclear deal [limiting Iranian nuclear activity in return for lifting international economic sanctions] is a signal that the country is hoping to reintegrate with the West – and bitcoin is one way to do this.""', 'Cryptosecurities and blockchain recordkeeping systems may not be subject to commercial transactions law under the US Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), according to new research from Cardozo Law.\n\nPenned by professor Jeanne Schroeder, the 60-page research paper, released this week, provides a wide-ranging overview of how bitcoin transactions, both financial and non-financial, would be governed by laws relating to the exchange of property across US states.\n\nThe paper is the latest to highlight potential legal issues that could arise in disputes over ownership of cryptographic assets, such as bitcoin, following research by law firm Perkins Coie in January. At issue is that bitcoin does not fit the UCC\'s definition of money and challenges conventional notions of custody.\n\nThe UCC, first published in 1952, was created by private legal institutions seeking to harmonize state laws regarding commercial transactions. States may adopt the UCC as written or approve or deny specific changes to its provisions.\n\nWhile the paper echoes many of Perkin Coie\'s conclusions, it is perhaps one of the first to speculate on how the UCC would apply to alternative uses of blockchains. For example, Schroeder cites decentralized application platform Ethereum and Overstock\'s tØ as a platform designed to enable the use of tokens outside of currency and payments.\n\nThe paper remarks that such transactions could be filed on a blockchain without any amendments to the UCC, stating:\n\n""There is no reason under the language of the UCC that a state’s filing office, usually the Secretary of State, could not establish a blockchain recording system [in which] recording on the blockchain would constitute filing with that office. Similarly, there is no reason why requirements for numbering, maintaining and indexing records and communicating information provided in records could not be met through an electronic ledger system.""\n\nSchroeder suggested such a system may prove ""more efficient and accurate"" than those in place, while still providing US states the ability to collect filing fees through smart contracts.\n\n""We could continue the practice whereby a filing fee must be paid to the state of the debtor’s location,"" the paper reads. ""A \'smart\' blockchain ledger could be programmed to allow secured parties to automatically transfer filing fees to the Secretary of State of the jurisdiction of the debtor’s location by transferring funds on the blockchain itself.""\n\nAmendment needed\n\nThe finding stands in contrast to the paper\'s less favorable conclusion that the UCC would need to be amended for bitcoin to be used as a payment system.\n\n""Cryptocurrency do not, nor can they be made to, fit within Article 9\'s definition of \'money\',"" the report reads, echoing previous findings.\n\nBuilding on this remark, the author indicated bitcoin is currently defined as a ""general intangible"" asset under the UCC. As pointed out by Perkins Coie, this means that, unlike cash, legal claims on the asset can continue to be valid even after it is transferred.\n\nThe legal interest, the author said, can continue regardless of how many times a specific bitcoin changes owners.\n\n""Unlike virtually every other category of personal property recognized by Article 9, once a general intangible becomes encumbered by a security interest, it can never become unencumbered even by transfer to a bonafide purchaser for value,"" the report reads, adding:\n\n""This could greatly impinge on bitcoin’s liquidity and, therefore, its utility as a payment system.""\n\nThe paper argues general intangible assets are ill-equipped to function as money, as in the exchange of paper currencies, claims on the assets are relinquished at the time of exchange.\n\nCryptosecurities covered\n\nIn contrast, the author argues the UCC as currently drafted can easily accommodate the development of cryptosecurities, or assets traded on a blockchain.\n\nThe technology is currently being pioneered in various forms by major US stock market Nasdaq, online retail giant Overstock and \'smart securities\' startup Symbiont.\n\nSchroeder indicated cryptosecurities would fall under the UCC\'s definition of ""uncertificated securities"", which were meant to cover securities represented not as physical stock certifications, but on the books of a specific corporation.\n\n""Article 8\'s failed uncertificated security regime, which was reformed in 1994, may be given a new life because it permit the issuance and trading of blockchain cryptosecurities in the direct ownership regime,"" the paper continues. ""It is ironic that the drafters who could not understand their own present, may have ended up predicting the future.""\n\nHowever, the paper suggests the custody of a cryptosecurity could also affect the specific UCC provisions under which it is covered, thereby altering definitions they could be afforded.\n\nHand-to-hand currency\n\nThe paper goes on to imply that, even though bitcoin aspires to be a digital form of cash, the UCC contains wording that currently excludes it from acting as such.\n\n""The problem is that, although inartfully drafted, in context it is clear that the term is limited to physical, or \'hand-to-hand\', currency,"" it reads. ""Characterizing bitcoin as money would have a perverse effect because security interests in money can only be perfected by physical custody.""\n\nBitcoin could be given what the author terms the ""super-negotiation"" status of physical currencies, but such a change would require alterations to the text, according to the report.\n\nSpecifically, Schroeder contends that the UCC would need to be updated to include a definition of cryptocurrency, a definition of custody of cryptocurrencies and priority rules with regards to securities interests with the digital assets, among other changes.\n\nStill, the author suggests this problem could be circumvented if bitcoins were held by third-party brokers or banks, at which point they could qualify as ""financial assets"", which are covered by super-negotiation rules.\n\n""Unfortunately, to do so would defeat one of the greatest attractions of bitcoin – the ability to transfer value directly between parties without the use, and expense, of third-party intermediaries,"" the paper concludes.\n\nMoney conceptualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

08/28/2015,"['The way things are going, the digital currency Bitcoin will start to malfunction early next year. Transactions will become increasingly delayed, and the system of money now worth $3.3 billion will begin to die as its flakiness drives people away. So says Gavin Andresen, who in 2010 was designated chief caretaker of the code that powers Bitcoin by its shadowy creator. Andresen held the role of “core maintainer” during most of Bitcoin’s improbable rise; he stepped down last year but still remains heavily involved with the currency (see “The Man Who Really Built Bitcoin”).\n\nAndresen’s gloomy prediction stems from the fact that Bitcoin can’t process more than seven transactions a second. That’s a tiny volume compared to the tens of thousands per second that payment systems like Visa can handle—and a limit he expects to start crippling Bitcoin early in 2016. It stems from the maximum size of the “blocks” that are added to the digital ledger of Bitcoin transactions, the blockchain, by people dubbed miners who run software that confirms Bitcoin transactions and creates new Bitcoin (see “What Bitcoin Is and Why It Matters”).\n\nAndresen’s proposed solution triggered an uproar among people who use or work with Bitcoin when he introduced it two weeks ago. Rather than continuing to work with the developers who maintain Bitcoin’s code, Andresen released his solution in the form of an alternative version of the Bitcoin software called BitcoinXT and urged the community to switch over. If 75 percent of miners have adopted his fix after January 11, 2016, it will trigger a two-week grace period and then allow a “fork” of the blockchain with higher capacity. Critics consider that to be a reckless toying with Bitcoin’s future; Andresen, who now works on Bitcoin with the support of MIT’s Media Lab, says it is necessary to prevent the currency from strangling itself. He spoke with MIT Technology Review’s San Francisco bureau chief, Tom Simonite.\n\nHow serious is the problem of Bitcoin’s limited transaction rate?\n\nIt is urgent. Looking at the transaction volume on the Bitcoin network, we need to address it within the next four or five months. As we get closer and closer to the limit, bad things start to happen. Networks close to capacity get congested and unreliable. If you want reliability, you’ll have to start paying higher and higher fees on transactions, and there will be a point where fees get high enough that people stop using Bitcoin.\n\nWhy take the provocative step of releasing an entirely new version of Bitcoin?\n\nIt was a difficult decision. I’ve been lobbying pretty hard behind the scenes for the last eight months, but was having trouble even getting developers to agree that there was a problem. I had to go public and actually release the code and let people essentially vote with their feet. Now that we’ve done that I think you see people finally coming around to the idea that this is a high priority problem. I’m not happy that it had to come to that, but I think in the long run it will be a good thing.\n\nSome major Bitcoin companies have endorsed your proposed way of increasing the block size, and some miners have even adopted BitcoinXT. Other companies and prominent Bitcoin developers have attacked your move, and suggested alternative solutions—not all backed by working code—that are rapidly gaining support. What’s happening?\n\nIt’s somewhat chaotic. There’s no well-defined process for coming to a decision about changes to Bitcoin and there’s no one correct answer for how to solve this problem. Things are pretty messy – but that’s by design. There’s no central committee. There’s no single person making these decisions for Bitcoin; it takes consensus among the people running the software. It’s a good thing that decisions like this are really hard to make happen.\n\nDo you think that consensus can be reached?\n\nIt’s pretty clear that the maximum blocksize is going to increase. I don’t know exactly how or exactly when. I don’t think it’s clear yet that my proposal will generate enough consensus among miners and the other ecosystem players.\n\nWhat will happen if nothing is done?\n\nTransactions will get unreliable and it’ll get worse and worse over time. My fear is there’ll be no critical event that causes people to react—Bitcoin just kind of has a long slow death. I’m trying to set off alarm bells for ‘You know, guys, if we don’t do this, Bitcoin will be dead in four years.’ It’s not easy to sell that, especially when there’s so much controversy.\n\nIf BitcoinXT activates, it will recognize existing Bitcoins. But not new Bitcoins created by miners who don’t switch. Is that dangerous?\n\nIt’s pretty hard to get left behind. Once the Bitcoin core software sees that 50 percent of mining power has upgraded and you haven’t, it’s going to warn you that you need to upgrade. It would be awfully difficult to be taken by surprise. The economic incentives to switch would be so strong—you want your Bitcoins to be the same Bitcoins that everyone else is using.\n\nHow widely established is Bitcoin now anyway?\n\nIt’s firmly established in a few niche areas and growing there. An early use case is people who pay international contractors in Bitcoin because it’s easier than figuring out how to transfer dollars into local currency. The major barrier to it going mainstream anywhere is there has to be some way of getting Bitcoin as part of your normal activity. Until part of your paycheck is regularly paid in Bitcoin, I’m not sure how it would really go mainstream. I can imagine places in the world where there are not functioning banking systems, or payroll systems, where it could go mainstream first, because you’re not trying to replace the way people are already doing something.\n\nI still say do not invest your life savings in Bitcoin. It is still an experiment and it could still fail.', ""A few banks have gone public with their work, but most of the activity has been happening behind the scenes. At one private meeting, held in April at one of the Manhattan offices of Bank of America, executives from more than a dozen large banks gathered to confidentially discuss how the technology underlying Bitcoin could be used to change foreign currency trading, the largest financial market in the world, according to people who attended the meeting.\n\nCentral banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have their own teams looking at the technology.\n\n“A year ago, it was more of an idea,” said Max Neukirchen, the head of corporate strategy at JPMorgan Chase. “Now, it is a real opportunity. You test it and realize that this can play a big role in our thinking about how our own infrastructure will evolve.”\n\nThis is a long way from the derision that many bankers — including JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon — expressed when Bitcoin burst into the public consciousness in 2013, when the price of a Bitcoin was bouncing around wildly in a speculative frenzy that was often compared to the Dutch tulip bulb mania.\n\nAt the time, some large companies like Dell and Overstock announced that they would start taking Bitcoins for online purchases, but few consumers showed much interest in using the digital money to pay their bills, and the furor around Bitcoin largely died down.\n\nThe institutions that are now becoming involved are generally not interested in selling goods for Bitcoins or owning the virtual currency. They are, instead, looking at the network and software that make it possible for Bitcoin to move around the world instantly, and almost free.\n\nUntil now, digital transactions have always gone through some sort of central authority that can move the money and update the records on both sides — as PayPal and Visa do for many online purchases.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Bitcoin network, on the other hand, is run by a decentralized network of users who jointly keep track of transactions and update the records in real time, with no single user or company in charge. The records of all transactions are kept on a public ledger — essentially just a big, publicly available spreadsheet — known as the blockchain that is visible to anyone and has, at least so far, proven impossible to tamper with.\n\nMuch of the work being done inside banks, and in other industries, is looking at whether the blockchain technology can be used independent of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which was the first thing to be recorded on the blockchain ledger.\n\nThe music publication Billboard recently wrote about how several start-ups are aiming to use a digital ledger like the blockchain to keep track of musical downloads and distribute the royalties to artists without relying on a central record keeper.\n\nVermont’s state government commissioned a study in June to look at how a blockchain could be used as a legal method of record keeping under state law; it is one of several governments, many of them outside the United States, looking at the technology.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the most intense work is being done by financial companies like the Nasdaq OMX Group, which has several programmers in Manhattan preparing software that the company plans to roll out this year.\n\nThe Nasdaq software will allow the trading of stocks in private companies, like tech start-ups, on a new kind of blockchain. This will replace the existing system in which private companies issue and trade shares using paper certificates — a process that means that even basic trades can take weeks to complete.\n\nBeyond the immediate trial, Nasdaq is experimenting with several other markets in which blockchain-like ledgers could be used to make trading faster and cheaper. The work is being overseen by Fredrik Voss, who recently shifted from his work in the company’s commodity division to become its top blockchain executive.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Back then, though, most of the attention was negative, focused on the speculative aspect of the virtual currency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore recently, banks like Goldman Sachs, Santander and BBVA have made their first investments in outside start-ups working on Bitcoin technology, several of which were started by former employees at big banks.\n\nBut the banks have generally been less public about the work they have been doing internally with their own employees. At Citigroup, for instance, there are six different in-house experiments, building software that harnesses the blockchain technology, according to people briefed on the company’s work. In one test, the bank has created its own virtual currency, Citicoin, that employees can experiment with.\n\nAside from Nasdaq’s project, there is much debate about where the technology is likely to gain its first real world use. At Barclays, some of the 20 internal experiments — most of them conducted at two Barclays offices in London dedicated to the technology — are looking at ways to use the blockchain to speed up and lower the cost of consumer payments, to compete with credit cards and direct money transfers.\n\nBut bankers generally say that most of the work is aimed at changing the systems that big Wall Street traders and investors use to buy and sell sophisticated assets like syndicated loans and corporate bonds.\n\nBecause any innovation in this area would require the cooperation of multiple banks, the banks have had joint meetings to discuss how they could work together, often led by outside start-ups looking to provide the software.\n\nOne of the most advanced of those conversations has been coordinated by a start-up known as R3Cev that is led by a former Wall Street executive, David E. Rutter. R3Cev has put together models for how banks could trade foreign currencies on a communally maintained spreadsheet like the blockchain, according to people briefed on the project. It was R3Cev that convened the April meeting at Bank of America, which was attended by more than 75 people from 15 financial institutions, these people said.\n\nThis can seem like rather esoteric business, but these are the markets where huge amounts of money turn over each day, and these markets influence the profits of the largest financial institutions. For instance, more than $3 trillion changes hands each day on the foreign currency market.\n\nFor many bankers, the question is not if the technology is put to use but when. Mr. Neukirchen, at JPMorgan, is one of many bankers who expect that it will take a few years for the first significant use of blockchain technology to gain traction. Mr. White at Barclays expects it even sooner, in the next year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe prospect of banks capitalizing on the technology can be disappointing to early Bitcoin adherents, many of whom were drawn to the technology because it provided a way to move and store money that did not rely on banks.\n\nMany in the financial industry hope they can find a way to use the blockchain concept — what is often referred to as a distributed ledger — without using the blockchain associated with Bitcoin.\n\nAlthough the bankers working on the idea disagree on how this will happen, they show surprisingly little disagreement on whether it will happen. One of Goldman’s top Internet analysts, Heath Terry, said in a recent company podcast that “the whole blockchain tech behind Bitcoin has massive implications for really any kind of asset — and the ability to transfer ownership of digital goods.”\n\n“It’s hard to see a world where that blockchain technology doesn’t end up changing the way we think about asset ownership,” he said."", 'Six years after their first use, there are nearly 14.5 million bitcoins in circulation — a fortune worth more than $3 billion.\n\nBut unlike minted money, the online currency is not backed by the faith and credit of any nation, nor does any central authority police its use. Instead, it depends on its thousands of users to review its exchange, and to give bitcoins any value at all.\n\nWhile bitcoin advocates say the cryptocurrency is here to stay, its relative youth and rapidly evolving marketplace mean there are many questions about its future, including how safe it really is from hacking and other manipulation. Scientists also are eyeing how ""smart"" contracts written in computer code could one day employ cryptocurrency and make it ubiquitous.\n\nA group of researchers at the University of Maryland, College Park are among a small number of scientists working to erase a lag between the growing adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the understanding of them.\n\n""This is only the sort of thing academics do,"" Andrew Miller, a College Park computer science doctoral student who is among the researchers, said of research testing the security underlying bitcoin. ""There are tons of startups, but only an academic research lab is going to take on that sort of challenge.""\n\nThe College Park team is funded by a National Science Foundation grant, which has paid out nearly $600,000 so far. The grant acknowledges that ""usage of crypto-currencies outstrips our understanding.""\n\nThe foundation\'s grant program seeks to ""establish a rigorous scientific foundation"" to cryptocurrency based in cryptography, game theory, programming languages and systems security.\n\nOther institutions receiving the federal grants include Cornell University and the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nCreated as an open-source payment system, bitcoin allows users to conduct transactions with each other that are verified and recorded in a public ledger known as the block chain. The block chain is essentially a database hosted across a network of computers running the bitcoin software. When you pay for something with bitcoin, one of these computers notes it and adds it to a block.\n\nUse of bitcoin has grown steadily since its first transaction in 2009, with daily transactions briefly spiking to 215,000, but subsequently returning to more common levels around 100,000 to 120,000 transactions per day.\n\nThe market remains small, with the daily transaction value ranging from as little as $500,000 to as much as $20 million this year, according to the website Blockchain.info, which tracks the market.\n\nBitcoin\'s growth is causing upheaval already. The community is in the midst of an ideological crisis of sorts over the size of blocks, the chunks of bitcoin transactions that are grouped together to the block chain.\n\nBlocks are capped at 1 megabyte, and as more transactions occur, blocks are getting larger and closer to that limit. That has prompted some to suggest raising the cap, a decision that could make more bitcoin transactions possible but also might expose the system to problems such as someone trying to use the same bitcoin to make two different purchases at the same time.\n\nWhile the researchers are not exploring the block size question itself, the debate illustrates the lack of a scientific foundation to cryptocurrency, they said.\n\n""[Bitcoin] came sort of out of nowhere and was adopted before there was any kind of serious analysis,"" said Jonathan Katz, a computer science professor who is among the Maryland investigators working on the NSF grant. ""It mushroomed into this thing where thousands of people are using it and still people don\'t understand the precise security properties of it.""\n\nFor example, it\'s unclear whether a bad actor could capture enough power across a bitcoin mining platform to somehow manipulate the process of approving transactions. There could be unforeseen vulnerabilities, too, Miller said.\n\n""You\'re just sitting there waiting for an attack to occur,"" he said. ""That doesn\'t inspire that much confidence. That\'s not the best way to do security planning.""\n\nSecurity threats have already created problems for bitcoin. In one high-profile breach in January, hackers stole $5 million in bitcoin from Bitstamp, an online exchange, sending bitcoin\'s value to its lowest level this year, about $177 per bitcoin. After trading for a few dollars per bitcoin in 2011 and 2012, the currency\'s value peaked at $979 in November 2013 and has more recently settled around $200 to $250.\n\nThe researchers also plan to explore how bitcoin payments can be written into computer coded contracts, allowing for automatic payments if the terms are achieved or are violated. Applications could include safe processing of micropayments over peer-to-peer computer networks or giving investors more nuanced control to hedge financial portfolios, Miller said.\n\nThe goal isn\'t necessarily to promote use of bitcoin but just to give people more information about the risks and benefits of cryptocurrency, Katz said.\n\n""We want to allow people to understand what bitcoin provides,"" he said, ""and it\'s up to people\'s own personal preferences whether they choose to use it.""\n\nThe grant is slated to fund the research through July 2018 and also includes plans for a speaker series that ""will bring together technologists, economists, social scientists, and policymakers to foster collaborations that will shape the future of digital currencies.""\n\nBut most important for the future of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could be the theoretical analysis and simulations that could sort out problems before they arise, said Matthew Green, an assistant professor of computer science at the Johns Hopkins University who has researched bitcoin but is not involved with the University of Maryland grant.\n\n""That work on the academic side hasn\'t been funded much,"" Green said. ""Not enough when you think about how much money is at stake.""\n\nsdance@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/ssdance', 'London’s Moniker Art Fair has become the first international art fair to accept Bitcoin payment.\n\nFor its sixth edition, the fair, which has established itself as one of the leading art fairs for contemporary urban art, has partnered with online payment activists Fork The Banks and will pioneer the use of the digital currency, AFP reports.\n\nOver 20 international galleries will participate in this coming edition, which will take place on October 15–18 at the Old Truman Brewery, in East London.\n\nHighlights include MYA Gallery, from France, which will bring pieces by the French street artist Bom.k.

""We look for those convergences that have that synergy,"" he continued.\n\nBut while there is much speculation as to how USAA could ultimately deploy bitcoin-based services or blockchain technology, Pascucci remained tight lipped about what the team he said based full-time on the blockchain is currently developing.\n\n""We want to be sensitive to how much we expose,"" he said. ""We experiment a lot, and if we come out too early, our members expect to see it. The last thing we want to do is mismanage our users\' expectations, so we want to be sensitive to that.""\n\nPascucci did hint that the group is working on applications on both the bitcoin blockchain and on private blockchains that would potentially enable the company to track assets and claims and conduct real-time record-keeping.\n\n""There are so many efficiencies we can unlock,"" he added.\n\nChance meeting\n\nTo date, USAA\'s biggest move in the space was its participation in Coinbase\'s $75m Series C round, completed in early 2015 – a move he attributed to an early meeting with the company.\n\nPascucci said that, in order to keep pace with emerging technologies, his team makes frequent visits to the West Coast to meet with venture firms and FinTech startups.\n\n""We sat down with [Coinbase co-founder] Fred [Ehrsam], Micky Malka from Ribbit Capital and just had a great conversation about bitcoin and the blockchain and the efficiency it would bring,"" he recalled.\n\nBut it was the makeup of the bitcoin services firm\'s user base that ultimately convinced USAA to make Coinbase one of its estimated 10 to 12 annual deals, where it invests anywhere from $1m to $10m in venture capital.\n\n""We saw an amazing index of USAA members using Coinbase,"" he said. ""We were one of the most active user groups, but we saw our members\' accounts were twice the size and they tended to be twice as active.""\n\nFrom there, Pascucci said USAA realized it needed to ""move fast"" to better understand the technology, investing because of the combination of market analysis and member association.\n\nAs for whether it remains interested in subsequent investments in the space, Pascucci was optimistic if non-committal, adding:\n\n""There\'s a strong feeling we\'ll do more, but we\'ve got all types of lines of businesses to serve.""\n\nPossible applications\n\nRight now, Pascucci said USAA is still working to develop a thesis on the technology, and it hasn\'t decided where it might be most applicable.\n\nStill, Pascucci acknowledged bitcoin and the blockchain could impact how USAA interacts internally, with other financial organizations, with its members and how its members interact with each other.\n\n""It\'s that kind of constant balancing act as to where we\'re going to see the best benefit for our members and the cost,"" Pascucci said. ""It feels like bitcoin is most advanced but it feels like the enterprise capabilities are so vast, but it could all take time.""\n\nMore specifically, Pascucci deflected comments on whether it was pursuing blockchain-based recordkeeping technologies for use in its insurance claims process.\n\nUltimately, Pascucci said USAA will continue to base its decisions on feedback from members, with whom he stressed the firm strives to maintain a dialogue regarding its decisions. Should users be uncomfortable with or unsure about the need for certain features provided by the technology, he suggested any interest could fall by the wayside.\n\n""They could surprise us and say \'We like the set up the way it is,\' he said. ""We see the capabilities and the power, but the members are going to tell us what they like.""\n\nPascucci suggested regulatory uncertainty surrounding the technology was another factor, citing discussion as to whether bitcoin is best considered a currency or security.\n\n""My take on that is that the level of understanding has to be consistent with regulations,"" he continued. ""The regulations weren\'t designed for these types of things.""\n\nOngoing discovery\n\nAs for the ongoing work at its facilities, Pascucci was less specific with details, noting that 90% of his team is working on the firm\'s venture arm and tracking emerging trends.\n\n""I have a team of nine that works for me,"" Pascucci explained. ""Zach Gibson, our chief innovation officer, he has the tech resources to incubate ideas, they have a full team of people that\'s exploring disruptive technologies and we\'re working closely with that team.""\n\nPascucci said USAA has an equally strong interest in technologies that enable communication with its members, given that it has no physical branches. Cybersecurity, storage, networking and analytics also remain top priorities in the innovation lab.\n\nCost, he suggested, would also be a factor in the company\'s decisions, and that ultimately any solution it pursues would need to balance expenditure with benefit.\n\nPascucci concluded:\n\n""My team in corporate development is responsible for identifying emerging trends that will ensure it\'s as relevant the next 100 years as it was the last 100 years.""\n\nVic Pascucci is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.

From the market price corrections after the Mt. Gox bubble burst, to specious national regulatory laws and banking lobbyist backlash, to the battle to have the latest and greatest ASIC mining rig technology and beyond, countless miners have fallen by the wayside. Not Genesis Mining, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin companies.\n\nNot only have they survived, but they have thrived under the intense market pressures. They have even expanded their operations, creating Genesis Hive, to assist those who are looking to enter the Bitcoin mining industry do so under their umbrella of protection and leadership. Also, operations have been brought to new, more favorable regions like Iceland, while bringing you behind the scenes with a live streaming service to show you how the operation works in real time.\n\nCoinTelegraph: How is the regulatory climate in Iceland for mining and running a cryptocurrency business?\n\nMarco Streng: Owning and mining cryptocurrencies is ok. However, related to capital controls in Iceland, buying and selling bitcoin is prohibited.\n\nCT: Are there other countries you would consider expanding to, or might recommend, as you see then as Bitcoin-friendly in their regulations?\n\nMS: There are a number of places that are Bitcoin friendly, e.g., Denmark and Hong Kong. However, if it comes to mining you need more than just Bitcoin-friendly regulation. Cheap electricity, low real estate prices, cold climate and a good infrastructure are on the top of the list. And you want to mine in a politically stable region. For example, we received interesting offers for cheap electricity in two countries but eventually declined, as we considered the country risk to be too high.\n\n“Planning and building a good mining farm takes 3-6 months.”\n\nCT: What should one expect, without giving specifics, when starting a new Bitcoin mining operation from scratch on any scale such as yours, without the oversight provided by something like Genesis Hive?\n\nMS: If you start from scratch, without prior knowledge in large-scale mining your first farm will result in substantial losses. This is because you do not have the experience setting up an ideal farm (cooling, airflow, electricity distribution, network), and you will not correctly factor in all costs and will be too optimistic about up-times of machines, failure rates, and maintenance work. Also, you will lose a huge amount of time and money if you don’t have a tool (like our HIVE) for monitoring and optimizing your farm continuously.\n\nFor the second farm, you know a number of things that can go wrong and have better plans for cooling, airflow management, electricity setup and network. Things will look better, though you will have a hard time to break even. There are still things you will learn and need to optimize.\n\nThird farm: you will make it even better this time if you still have enough funds (after your didn’t do to well with the first 2 farms) to experiment and improve your setup and if you have the right monitoring and tuning software (there are no commercial available tools for managing large-scale Bitcoin mining farms).\n\nPlanning and building a good mining farm takes 3-6 months. So you will need about a year of experience with large-scale mining before things are going in the right direction.\n\n“We would prefer if the camps could bridge their differences and agree on an acceptable solution that allows for larger blocks going forward.”\n\nCT: What is your view of the Bitcoin XT fork debate? Which side are you on? Does the way this is being handled bother you? Are your miners voting actively for or against these forked initiatives?\n\nMS: We consider BitcoinXT an option for larger blocks. These are needed to support the medium term growth of the Bitcoin network. It is unfortunate that no consensus was reached on the side of the core developers despite overwhelming interest on the side of users and businesses.\n\nThe situation is not ideal. This is a result of missing governance in Bitcoin and bad communication of many of the participants. Having an alternative is a good thing, however, we would prefer if the camps could bridge their differences and agree on an acceptable solution that allows for larger blocks going forward.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of our users are for larger blocks. We strongly believe that this is the right decision and in the best interest for our clients, as well as, for the Bitcoin community as a whole. Therefore, we will act accordingly, but we continue to watch (the Bitcoin) space closely, also with the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin conference in Montreal this September\n\nCT: How difficult is it for your company to compete with Chinese miners? Do they have any advantages that you may not enjoy when mining at scale?\n\nMS: Chinese miners are strong, but they also fight with a lot of problems. Their main advantage is that most equipment is produced in China and thus transportation costs are lower for them. Labor work in China is cheaper than in most other parts of the world, however, with Genesis Hive we have an excellent tool to increase the efficiency of our workers by magnitudes.\n\nDue to the unclear regulatory environment and quick changes in policy, the Chinese mining farms are based on an uncertain foundation. For this reason, some of the Chinese miners move significant parts of their equipment to facilities abroad. Overall, we are in a very good position in this highly competitive market.\n\nCT: What do you think Bitcoin will become to the world 5-10 years from now? Will it replace Paypal? Will it directly compete, or replace national fiat currencies?\n\nMS: The last 18 months were difficult for Bitcoin and it showed that any prediction regarding its future is hard to make. Nevertheless, the past year also showed that Bitcoin is very resilient and happily alive despite being declared dead dozens of times.\n\nIn the last two years, transaction numbers roughly increased by a factor of four. If this trend continues Bitcoin should grow 30-fold in the next five years. This requires that the block size will be increased and in the long term also requires an additional infrastructure that takes some load off the blockchain (e.g. lightning network).\n\nIf this is the case Bitcoin will find its place for international transactions (in particular between businesses) and also as a store of value. The crucial point here is that regulators around the world understand the value and benefits of Bitcoin and trying to stop bitcoin with red flags. If everything goes well, bitcoin, or another cryptocurrency, could replace a “real” national fiat currency.\n\nCloud mining transparency\n\nTo alleviate the transparency and trust issues within the Bitcoin cloud mining industry, the team at Genesis Mining has decided to provide an in-depth, all-access look at their mining operations with a webinar chronicling the new project “Life Inside a Bitcoin Mine.”\n\nProviding 24/7/365 live streaming to their mining farm in Iceland, Marco, and the team are going to host webinars and give tours directly from the Bitcoin mining farms now and in the future. The locations will soon include their many farms worldwide.\n\nGenesis Mining is looking to create a larger gap between legitimate cloud mining providers and “scam” providers. Fraudulent companies won’t be able to provide this level of transparency through live streams and videos and this could significantly reduce the number of cloud mining scams plaguing the industry.', 'The Bitcoin block size is a hot topic in Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen has been at the center of the heated discussion of how to scale Bitcoin to accommodate higher transaction volumes. The Lightning Network has garnered much support as a possible solution to this problem.\n\nThe co-authors of the Lightning Network white paper, Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja, gained credibility with the release of their ideas. Many projects have already seen the benefit of something like Lightning Network to their projects. And, according to Joseph Poon, this will be an easy thing for them to do.\n\n“Most companies can hook into Lightning quickly, since there are minimal changes on backend service providers required,” Joseph Poon, a co-author of the Lightning Network white paper, told CCN. “They just hook into an API daemon running on top of bitcoind.” Even if a service is a hosted wallet, they can use the Lightning Network.\n\n“It enables services like ChangeTip to do micropayments in a way in which the payment itself is decentralized between the service providers themselves,” Poon said. “So maybe in the future, when someone donates you $0.10 in bitcoin, you can spend it instantly on a newspaper article or video who get paid using Coinbase.” This doesn’t seem to be Poon’s preferred method of using the Lightning Network.\n\n“Of course, it’s more fun and preferred to hold the coins yourself and use Lightning directly,” he added. As the Abstract for the white paper to Lightning Network reads:\n\nThe bitcoin protocol can encompass the global financial transaction volume in all electronic payment systems today, without a single custodial 3rd party holding funds or requiring participants to have any more than a computer on a home broadband connection. A decentralized system is proposed whereby transactions are sent over a network of micropayment channels (a.k.a. payment channels or transaction channels) whose transfer of value occurs off-blockchain. If Bitcoin transactions can be signed with a new sighash type which addresses malleability, these transfers may occur between untrusted parties along the transfer route by contracts which are enforceable via broadcast over the bitcoin blockchain in the event of uncooperative or hostile participants, through a series of decrementing timelocks.\n\n“I think multiple examples with a clear use case would help one understand what a Smart Contract means,” Poon told CCN. “The thesis for the Lightning Network when it comes to Smart Contracts is that what matters is the enforcement. You can digitize contracts all you want, but if it’s not enforceable, it’s meaningless.” In Poon’s mind, the most intriguing aspects of smart contracts are the multiple party social and technological constructions they enable.\n\n“Lightning Network is rebuilding micropayment infrastructure into a globally interconnected decentralized Smart Contract system,” he said.\n\n“I suspect the really interesting things to come will be multi-party organizational systems, but great care needs to be made making these things in a responsible, secure way, as we are very early in understanding the building blocks on how to think about the problem,” Poon said. Where Lightning helps most is instant micropayments.\n\n“OpenBazaar and communications platforms may have some benefits with instant micropayments,” Poon says of projects that have discussed using the Lightning Network. “I think there’s a need across many communications platform to use micropayments to use flow control and anti-spam protection.” This could be important for Bitcoin.\n\nThis can certainly help with decentralized systems vulnerable to spam since Bitcoin in a way is stored/fungible Proof-of-Work hashcash. However, if you want to buy a house on OpenBazaar, you should probably just be using on-chain Bitcoin transactions.\n\n“Getting the soft-forks in. Short-term, Rusty’s suggestion to use OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY will help and create a working implementation,” Poon explains.\n\n“Longer term, some malleability soft-fork and resolving large-scale systemic DoS attacks is necessary,” he told CCN. “I think there’s lots of development lately with writing code, which is very constructive towards having implementations ready as soon as the new opcodes are in bitcoin.” There are some security concerns when it comes to the Lightning Network.\n\n“Yes, the primary risk is with systemic denial of service attacks where transactions that need to get in by a certain time/block-height do not do so. This can be mitigated with some timelock soft-fork – as suggested by Greg Maxwell – or by putting Lightning in a fed-pegged sidechain,” said Poon. “Currently, the problems aren’t explored to the point where I wouldn’t suggest holding significantly more funds than you would cash in your wallet.

He continued:\n\n""A hapless geek who, as much to his own surprise as others\', became the most powerful lord of digital cash. During his reign, bitcoin, the leading form of virtual currency, rose in value from approximately a quarter to more than $1,200.""\n\nNoting the early success of the bitcoin exchange, the author cites various sources, including Tyler Winklevoss – famed for filing a lawsuit against Facebook\'s Mark Zuckerberg with his twin brother Cameron Winklevoss – who said Mt Gox was ""the most powerful and prominent property in bitcoin"".\n\nAfter rendering a detailed history of both bitcoin and the Mt Gox case, Kushner added:\n\n""Throughout my time with Karpeles in Tokyo, he maintained his innocence with such calm that I was left with two possible conclusions. He\'s either the greatest criminal mastermind of the digital age or an overeager chump who got in way over his head, and, perhaps, resorted to the most desperate means to get out.""\n\nWhile adding new details to the narrative, parts of the story may suffer from dating, as the article focused on the author\'s meeting with the Karpeles three months before his recent arrest.\n\nFor example, the article ended with a surprisingly optimistic note by emphasizing how Karpeles believes he\'ll have the chance to put his interests in business to use in the market again.\n\n""Whether he\'s found guilty or innocent, he\'s not done dreaming yet. He hopes to take the lessons he\'s learned at Mt Gox and create a more secure form of digital cash,"" the author wrote.\n\nDark market shutters\n\nFollowing the mainstream media\'s apparent appreciation for bitcoin-related illicit activity, some journalists this week also picked up on the ""temporary"" closure of dark web marketplace Agora.\n\nThe dark market website, thought to be the most popular in terms of daily transaction volume, uses bitcoin to facilitate the purchase of both legal and illegal goods.\n\nOne of the first and most widely cited pieces was by Wired\'s Andy Greenberg, who began his article by alluding to Agora\'s predecessor, Silk Road, writing:\n\n""The Dark Web\'s biggest marketplace for drugs seems to have learned a lesson from the downfall of the Silk Road: When cracks start to appear in your anonymity\'s armour, it\'s time to quit while you\'re ahead – or, at least, retreat and regroup.""\n\nStill, unlike Silk Road articles, it seems the allure of the connection between bitcoin and crime is beginning to fade.\n\nStories by Business Insider and International Business Times, for example, mentioned bitcoin only in passing, scarcely stopping to provide a definition of the technology or its role in payments.\n\nBitcoin trading gets rial\n\nNew bitcoin exchanges don\'t tend to get much fanfare these days in the mainstream media, however, the launch of BTXCapital, a trading platform targeting the Iranian market, bucked this trend.\n\nLaunched on 24th August, the exchange is not the first business to open its doors in the controversial Middle Eastern state, but it was uncharacteristically public about the announcement given the past reticence of local community members to communicate with the global community.\n\nThe exchange\'s application services firm, Draglet, suggested to International Business Times that BTXCapital\'s efforts in the region could be shortlived.\n\n""From a Western perspective, it\'s cool to have bitcoin spreading this way,"" company CEO Ganesh Jung told the news source. ""There are no legal concerns from our side, but the Iranian government could block this kind of service.""\n\nDespite the caution, even from firms affiliated with the venture, IBTimes was, as usual, bombastic with its headline, emphasizing quotes about the ""huge untapped market"" that the exchange could perhaps unlock for bitcoin.\n\nElsewhere, the news received coverage from payments industry news source, The Paypers, as well as a slew of cryptocurrency blogs and publications.\n\nAt press time, the price of bitcoin on the service was roughly $260, a figure that represents a 10% premium from more liquid bitcoin exchange markets.\n\nBusinessman with newspaper, bitcoin, closed sign and Iranian flag images via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

08/29/2015,"['The battle rages on within the Bitcoin community on how to move forward with potential hard fork changes designed to accommodate larger block sizes. Jeff Garzik’s BIP 100 proposal has taken the mining industry by storm, gathering a majority of support of those currently voting. Meanwhile, Bitcoin corporate leaders have formed a united front around the proposal by Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen called BIP 101.\n\nWhich side are you on?\n\nOn Tuesday, August 24, the leaders of many of the largest Bitcoin companies in the world signed off on BIP 101 as their revision of choice. They crafted a manifesto declaring a solid vote of confidence of BIP 101. For details on how BIP 101 works, click here to see the details on GitHub, posted by Gavin Andresen.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officers include Stephen Pair of BitPay, Peter Smith of Blockchain.info, Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville of Circle, Sam Cole of KNCMiner, John McDonnell of Bitnet.io, Charles Cascarilla of itBit, Wences Caseres of Xapo, and Mike Belshe of BitGo. An excerpt reads:\n\n“We support the implementation of BIP101. We have found Gavin’s arguments on both the need for larger blocks and the feasibility of their implementation, while safeguarding Bitcoin’s decentralization, to be convincing. Our companies will be ready for larger blocks by December 2015 and we will run code that supports this.” “As our community grows, it is essential, now more than ever, that we seek strong consensus to ensure network reliability. We pledge to support BIP101 in our software and systems by December 2015, and we encourage others to join us.”\n\nThis high level of corporate support has not been shared by the voting mining community. In fact, quite the opposite, as those who are voting over the last month have flocked towards Jeff Garzik’s BIP 100 proposal, as we have reported here.\n\nBitcoin Block Size Debate Reaches The Alex Jones Show\n\nOther community leaders have spoken out on this issue. Julia Tourianski of BraveTheWorld.com was the guest host on the Alex Jones Show on Friday and responded to a caller’s question about this issue directly.\n\n“Bitcoin XT is a terrible idea, and I would take the other core engineers and developers much more seriously,” Tourianski replied on air. “(They) are organizing an event in Montreal (“Scaling Bitcoin”) in September to have an open dialogue about the changes, and how we can implement them incrementally, and what is the best way of going about it.”', '', 'A 17-year-old high school honor student in Virginia was sentenced to 11 years in prison Friday for conspiring to assist the Islamic State (ISIL), which the US has declared a terror group. Among other allegations, Ali Shukri Amin was charged for assisting ISIL via blog and Twitter posts about encryption and Bitcoin.\n\n""Ali Shukri Amin is a young American who used social media to provide material support to ISIL,"" assistant Attorney General John Carlin said in a statement following Friday\'s sentencing before US District Judge Claude Hilton in Virginia. ""More and more, their propaganda is seeping into our communities and reaching those who are most vulnerable.""\n\nAmin, one of the youngest people in the US to face terror charges, pleaded guilty (PDF) in June and faced a maximum 15 years in prison. The boy founded the @amreekiwitness Twitter handle a year ago, garnering more than 4,000 followers and tweeting more than 7,000 times. Last year, the authorities said, he tweeted on the now-defunct Twitter handle about how jihadists could use Bitcoin ""to fund their efforts.""\n\n""The article explained what Bitcoins were, how the Bitcoin system worked, and suggested using Dark Wallet, a new Bitcoin wallet, which keeps the user of Bitcoins anonymous. The article included statements on how to set up an anonymous donations system to send money, using Bitcoin, to the mujahedeen,"" according to Amin\'s court admission. (PDF)\n\nThe Prince William County Osbourn Park High School student said he ""became lost and caught up in something that takes the greatest and most profound teachings of Islam and turns them into justifications for violence and death.""\n\nOn his blog, the boy said he ""authored a series of highly technical articles targeted at aspiring jihadists and ISIL supporters detailing the use of security measures in online communications to include the use of encryption and anonymity software, tools and techniques, as well as the use of the virtual currency Bitcoin as a means to anonymously fund ISIL.""\n\nThe defendant was also accused of radicalizing an 18-year-old Virginia youth, Reza Niknejad, who traveled to Syria in January to join ISIL, the authorities said.', ""Steve Keen is a fellow contributor here at Forbes so this isn't a declaration of all out jihad upon his ideas. Rather, it's to show that one of his contentions about economics and the economy might still be true but it isn't as important as he tends to make out. That contention of his being that since no part of the market is a truly free market then we shouldn't be using the standard neoclassical models that assume the existence of and model free markets. That there isn't that truly free market is, at the sort of level of exquisite detail that Keen insists upon, probably true. But that doesn't mean that the assumption is imperfect: and it most certainly doesn't mean that we should be having a great deal more government intervention as Keen thinks we should to deal with oligopolistic markets.\n\nKeen's essential contention is that we don't in fact have those completely free markets of the neoclassical models. No one is ever truly a price taker: there's not an infinite number of people in the world, there's not an infinite number of producers of anything, so therefore say a wheat farmer does, however infinitesimally, change the global wheat price by the decision to plant or not. That contention is undoubtedly true.\n\nBut we're interested in something else really, which is the assumption that large parts of the economy act pretty much as free market theory would predict correct? In other words, how many producers and consumers do we need interacting to say that the free market model is good enough, and certainly more accurate than the various models of oligopolistic competition? If we only need three players for the free market model to fit the evidence better then that's obviously different if we need a few million. At either extreme we'd find that different models fit the real world economy. And if it is millions then perhaps Keen's idea would be right.\n\nWhich brings us to the Federal Reserve and their recent note on Bitcoin:\n\nOur estimate of the aggregate daily profit of bitcoin miners dropped below zero for several days in mid-January 2015. The average hash rate over the two-week period following the realization of negative profit was noticeably lower than the average hash rate over the preceding two-week period. It appears that diminished profit may have prompted some miners to exit the market or to reduce their mining efforts. This lower average hash rate caused the network difficulty level to adjust downward at the next retarget, and the relative increase in the ease of mining attracted additional hashing power to the network.\n\nThis is to look at the problem through the other end of the telescope. Instead of counting the number of players and seeing whether it's enough, look for behaviour that would indicate that there's enough players as theory would predict. So, if Bitcoin producers stop mining when prices fall below their ability to profit from mining, then that's evidence that Bitcoin miners are acting as price takers. They're not got market power over the price of their output. Now no, I do not know the number of Bitcoin miners out there. But in terms of miners of any size it's not a large number. With the existence of pools and so on it would surprise me if the number were up in the hundreds in fact. And yet we do very obviously see that in aggregate the producers are price takers. Thus some hundreds of producers is enough for the standard free market models to be useful descriptors of the world we inhabit.\n\nAnd thus Keen's point, that we don't have perfectly competitive markets is right at the level of detail he insists upon. However, it's not important: because we don't need to have all that many producers in a market for it all to behave as that free market model would and does predict.\n\nThere's many things in economics which are like this: correct but not important. And this idea that it's not a pure free market out there is one of them. It's close enough that the free market model is the correct one to be using most of the time."", 'It looks like the Canadian pension fund either has a greater risk appetite, overtly optimistic or just doesn’t care. I would prefer to think that it is the former two. Either way it is good for the crypto-industry.\n\nOn a serious note – The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System which can be shortened into OMERS for good (to make it easier for writing purposes) is planning to invest in bitcoin and blockchain start-ups. OMERS is one of the largest municipal level pension funds in Canada which has its own venture arm called OMERS Ventures. OMERS Ventures has been active for over four years now and it has few highly successful companies in its portfolio which includes Shopify and Hootsuite.\n\nIn a recent interview with one of the Canadian tech magazine – TechVibes, Jim Orlando, managing director and Sid Paquette, director of OMERS Ventures discussed about the vision and mission associated with the fund, along with the domains of interest. In the same interview, they mentioned that in collaboration with Cisco and Bank of Montreal the second round of fund is more focused towards fintech sector, especially in cybersecurity, bitcoin and blockchain based startups.\n\nThis is where you should start disregarding the first paragraph of this article. The fund is backed by Cisco and Bank of Montreal. While Cisco is big on tech and even cybersecurity, Bank of Montreal is a financial giant in the region. The areas of focus when it comes to investment falls into the areas of interest of both the partners. In addition, the favorable atmosphere for bitcoin created by the Canadian senate will also work in their favor.\n\nEver since bitcoin was introduced, it has been slowly clawing into the traditional fintech space and it has succeeded at last! The finance and banking sector has realized the potential of bitcoin and the underlying technology. They are forced to adopt the technology or see the whole structure succumb to the growing success of blockchain technology in fintech sectors where the startups or small players who adopt it might end up overthrowing today’s top dogs in the sector.\n\nWe would love to see more funds like these supporting the crypto- industry and help it realize its full potential in short time. After all, it’s for greater good where everyone benefits.', 'Mastering Bitcoin Author Andreas Antonopoulos recently gave at talk at Harvard’s i-lab, spending much of his time in front of a small audience describing the various issues with Bitcoin as a brand. He noted many problems with the terminology used in Bitcoin, and he also focused on specific products or services in the Bitcoin space that seem to be doing a disservice to potential users.\n\nAt one point during the presentation, Antonopoulos turned his attention to Bitcoin ATMs, asking the audience how many of them had used one of the machines in the past. While a few people raised their hands, those hands went down when Antonopoulos then asked how many of them enjoyed their experience with the Bitcoin ATM.\n\nHow Traditional ATMs Work\n\nTo explain the user experience issues with Bitcoin ATMs, Antonopoulos first talked about the setup of traditional bank ATMs:\n\n“When you interact as a person with an ATM, 1. you have a pre-existing relationship with the bank or financial institution; 2. you have a pre-existing balance; 3. your primary objective is to get in, get cash, [and] get out. Twenty seconds is too long. Three clicks is too long.”\n\nIn other words, there is no need for long explanations or user-onboarding with traditional ATMs. Everyone who uses them already has a debit card, and they’ve already interacted with the corresponding bank in the past. The process can be simple because the user already has his or her bank account setup.\n\nBitcoin ATMs Have Nothing in Common with Traditional ATMs\n\nAccording to Antonopoulos, many Bitcoin ATM developers have been looking too closely at how traditional bank ATMs work when designing their own machines. He noted that Bitcoin ATMs have “absolutely nothing” in common with the ATMs that are currently used by banks, and he went on to describe the experience an average person has when attempting to use a Bitcoin ATM for the first time:\n\n“The average user of Bitcoin ATM is someone who has never seen bitcoin before. It is a person who doesn’t understand what bitcoin is, and the ATM is their first introduction to this currency. It is a person who does not have a pre-existing relationship with anyone in the Bitcoin space. It is a person who does not currently have a wallet because they didn’t know they needed one – because they don’t know what a wallet is (it’s a keychain). And so they walk up to this machine, and this machine has been designed by engineers to simulate the experience of an ATM, even though the experience shares absolutely nothing with the use case we’re putting it to. So you walk up and the ATM tries to give you bitcoin in as few clicks as possible with a minimum amount of interaction. Is that a way to build brand loyalty? Is that a way to build user experience? Is that a way to introduce new users? I mean, it just throws it at you, and you’re not ready for that. But, ‘Please open your phone and display your QR code.’ Like, what? What’s a QR code?”\n\nIn an effort to solidify the point that Bitcoin ATMs should not be operating in the same manner as traditional bank ATMs, Antonopoulos then went through a long list of questions that a user would likely have while attempting to use a Bitcoin ATM for the first time.\n\nThe Right Model for a Bitcoin ATM\n\nAfter describing the problems with currently available Bitcoin ATMs, Antonopoulos explained how he would design such a device:\n\n“If I was designing a Bitcoin ATM, first of all, I’d put it in bodegas. Secondly, it wouldn’t have a lick of English on it. It’d be all-Spanish because I’m going to really push the remittance model. Thirdly, the first function on the ATM would be ‘Send money to Mexico City.’ That’s it. Because I want people to use the bitcoin for something. [Fourthly], I’d have a big button on the front that says ‘Talk to a human.’ I’ve got an Internet-connected device with a forward-facing camera and a tablet screen, and I’m not using it to do video customer service? Are you kidding me?”\n\nIt’s clear that the device Andreas Antonopoulos is imagining is completely different from a traditional ATM. In addition to the focus on international remittances, Antonopoulos also expanded on the idea that the Bitcoin device needs to teach the user about the peer-to-peer digital cash system:\n\n“I don’t want to interact for fifteen seconds. I want to interact for two hours . . . And it tells me where I can spend [bitcoin]. It gives me suggestions on wallets, and it can send them directly to my phone. It’s building loyalty, brand and experience. That’s not a 15-second interaction.”\n\nThis is a perfect example of how sometimes simply applying the old ways of doing things to Bitcoin will not work. The most impactful innovations in the Bitcoin space have been the ones that created something completely new rather than thinking about how things worked in the past. Developers and entrepreneurs should try to avoid simply replacing the carriage with an automobile. It’s time to get rid of the horse.\n\nPhoto BTC Keychain / Flickr (CC)', 'The evolution of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology is gaining interest from all different corners of the world. Most of the focus remains on the financial side of things for the time being, while facilitatory services will start to enjoy their spotlight in the next few years. The decentralized world that is yet to come, is all possible thanks to blockchain technology; but more specifically, the invention of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nAlso read: Visa Begins Blockchain Research, Possible Future Integration\n\nIncreasing Global Bitcoin Acceptance and Awareness in the Netherlands\n\nBitcoin is still suffering from a major PR problem, which stems from the slew of illegal platforms embracing the disruptive virtual currency as a payment method. On top of that, various Bitcoin exchanges and platforms have become the victims of hacking attempts over the past few years, making a dent in the virtual currency’s armor.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, none of these events has managed to decrease the global interest in Bitcoin. In fact, there has never been more focus on virtual currency than in the past few years, especially now that regulatory frameworks are being created all around the world. That being said, there is still a lot of work to be done to convince everyday consumers about the advantages offered by Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.\n\n\n\nThe only way to do so is by actively evangelizing Bitcoin — and its advantages — to as many people as possible. Robert-Reinder Nederhoed, CEO and founder of Bitmymoney, has been a Bitcoin fan for quite some time. When he bought his first bitcoins through Marktplaats, Mr. Nederhoed got hooked and decided to create his very own company operating in the world of virtual currency.\n\nAs Mr. Nederhoed would like to point out, these are very exciting times for Bitcoin as far as media coverage is concerned. One day, there is a lot of focus on the Bitcoin price, while tomorrow’s headlines might talk about a multi-million EUR investment in a Bitcoin company. The day after tomorrow might see another “Bitcoin obituary.” You just never know what to expect.\n\nRobert-Reinder Nederhoed recently commented the following:\n\n“The financial world has discovered Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology. One by one, financial institutions are experimenting with this new technology to create more streamlined, convenient and user-friendly services and platforms. All of this is very positive news for Bitcoin, as it receives the recognitions it deserves – albeit indirectly – for being a financial innovation.”\n\nDevelopments in Blockchain Technology are Changing the Public Opinion\n\nThe blockchain offers some revolutionary ideas and concepts for the future, most of which have not even been thought about; take Bitmymoney as an example. The company is currently working with an Amsterdam-based startup documenting real estate on a blockchain-like platform. Doing so will offer more transparency, and the platform makes the transfer of ownership far less complicated than it is right now.\n\nAnother interesting proposal put forward by Mr. Nederhoed comes in the form of using blockchain technology to allow for real-time tax payments. Imagine a company selling a product or service, and once the transaction has been completed, the accountancy team is alerted and taxes are paid right away. Not only would this save companies a lot of time and money, but it would also prove to be beneficial for the local tax revenue service.\n\nDue to these technological advancements being made thanks to blockchain technology, the public perception of Bitcoin is slowly shifting. Bitcoin’s ideology is getting a lot of attention as of late, part of which can be attributed to the general disgruntlement regarding the current financial ecosystem.\n\nRobert-Reinder Nederhoed described it as follows:\n\n“People are starting to realize there is an alternative to the system they have been using for generations. Bitcoin is a building block to unleash a new level of financial innovation. The average user does not need to fully comprehend how Bitcoin works, they can just go out and use it right away. It works anywhere in the world, as long as there is an Internet connection available.”\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the remarks made by Robert-Reinder Nederhoed?

He is a frequent speaker on next-generation payment technologies, including bitcoin and the blockchain. Here, he examines whether open Internet standards and blockchain technology can rescue the last bastion of analog payments.\n\nIn today’s globally connected, digitally driven, Internet golden age, it may surprise you that when businesses pay each other for goods and services, they still pay by check.\n\nAccording to a recent Goldman Sachs report, paper checks account for at least 50% of B2B payments. While credit cards have made consumer purchases faster and easier, the merchant fees involved are a deal-breaker for high-value B2B transactions. It’s 2015, but without a viable digital alternative, we’re now sending $26tn per yr through an analog system invented 2,000 years ago.\n\nBut what about the hidden costs of continuing to use paper checks? When you factor in the overhead and time spent processing check payments, their actual cost is about $8 per check, not including losses due to human error and fraud.\n\nAll told, legacy payment systems are costing global businesses $550bn a year in direct expenses and inefficiencies.\n\nInstead of losing funds to a leaky payment system, that’s money that could be used to create more jobs, build better products and invest back into the economy.\n\nMoney on the table\n\nThis potentially deadly combo of aging technology and mounting costs represents a once-in-a-century opportunity for businesses to modernize the way they pay each other, or risk joining the graveyard of corporate dinosaurs that couldn’t compete in the 21st century.\n\nThere’s a lot of money on the table for companies that switch to digital – $57B in net cost savings globally each year, according to Goldman Sachs’ research.\n\nAlthough many Fortune 500 companies operate their payments on legacy systems that are the embarrassment of their IT staff, the ones that hold out the longest actually stand to see the most benefit from switching to digital.\n\nJust as some third-world countries skipped over landline telephones and went straight to cellular, companies that resisted pre-Internet EFT and other proprietary systems can leapfrog straight to digital systems that are optimized for today’s Internet and mobile infrastructure.\n\nThey can even take advantage of developments of open, natively digital blockchain technology to slash the cost of payments even further.\n\nTeaching payments a new language\n\nWasted money is the elephant in the room with paper checks, but there’s another big problem with legacy payment networks that could do even greater damage in the long run—the inability to track information about payments throughout the supply chain.\n\nWhile organizations typically invest heavily in their ERP and accounting systems, the actual payment itself is usually not connected to these commerce engines.\n\nIn this era of Big Data, payment systems that can’t provide automated, up-to-date and globally accessible tracking information spread inefficiencies not just to accounts departments, but to all areas of a business.\n\nSo how can businesses be sure that when they move to digital payments they realize the most cost savings and be able to mine the wealth of data that payments can reveal about their operations?\n\nThe answer may lie in an open Internet technology you’ve probably never heard of – FSML, or Financial Services Markup Language.\n\nLike HTML, FSML is a structured language developed specifically for financial transactions, including eCheck, the digital successor to paper checks.\n\nFSML makes it possible for eCheck transactions to carry an unlimited amount of data with them, structured in an open language that can be read and shared between databases and applications.\n\nThis addresses a key limitation of analog check and legacy automated clearing house (ACH) and electronic funds transfer (EFT) transactions, which limit appended data to a handful of cryptic codes.\n\nWhen a company moves from paper checks to eChecks, they gain an opportunity to append their transactions with rich data that can be synced between ERP, CRM and vendor-facing websites. They can begin to connect the dots between procurement, accounts payable and payments, perhaps discovering inefficiencies, double-payments and even fraud along the way.\n\nGet ready for machines that can pay each other\n\nThe eCheck standard with its underlying FSML language is an open technology that businesses can use today to digitize their payments. But this is just the beginning of how open technology can reinvent payments.\n\nLooking out into the not-too-distant future, innovative businesses will begin to record their transactions on blockchain-like ledgers, opening up the possibility of completely automated payments between trusted parties and even between machines.\n\nImagine a world where commercial agreements are executed by digital smart contracts. Where the contract and payments are actually tied together by mathematical rules of the blockchain.\n\nA commercial term like “Net-30” that obligates a business to pay its invoice in 30 days, could be automatically executed on the day it’s due. Or an agreement to pay on delivery could track that the product actually was received and signed off on as in good order, before payment is released.\n\nEscrow systems, third-party agents, and intermediary networks could be rethought to be far more efficient.\n\nOr perhaps even more exciting is the ability for business-to-business blockchains to enable digital native payment networks that can instantly settle funds directly between parties.\n\nToday, electronic payments are delayed as they batch-process through third party processors and legacy networks, like ACH.\n\nWith a blockchain, rich data about the payment can be included, it can operate seamlessly across borders, between currencies and can be executed at the speed of light. Say goodbye to “the check is in the mail”.\n\nThe race is on for businesses to claim their share of the $57bn of cost savings for moving to digital payments. The ones that really think through how to integrate payments with all the moving parts of their business, and embrace open technology standards they can customize and build on, will win the lion’s share.\n\nCheck and dollar images via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Nämlich alle Leute, die an dem Netzwerk teilnehmen, kriegen die ganze Datenbank.""\n\nDurch diese Redundanz der Informationen kann jedoch sichergestellt werden, dass weder Daten verloren gehen, noch dass diese nachträglich geändert werden. Denn das gesamte Netzwerk weiß jederzeit, welche Daten wann erstellt wurden und wer das exklusive Recht hat, diese zu bearbeiten. Die große Herausforderung – so Richter - sei es jedoch, in solch einem dezentralen Netzwerk jederzeit Einigkeit herzustellen, welche Daten echt sind und welche möglicherweise Fälschungen.\n\n""Es gibt ein Resultat in der theoretischen Computerwissenschaft, dieses Problem zu lösen, das ist das Problem der Byzantinischen Generäle, das ist eigentlich unmöglich. Man kann das Problem nicht lösen, man kann es nicht schaffen, verteilte, möglicherweise böse Teilnehmer an einem Netz dazu zu zwingen, das irgendwie zumindest die Ehrlichen am Schluss noch wissen, wer denn jetzt die Wahrheit sagt und wer nicht. Also so eine Datenbank zu synchronisieren, ist eigentlich unmöglich.""\n\nDer Speicherplatz der Bitcoin-Blockchain ist stark begrenzt\n\nDie Bitcoin-Blockchain löst dieses Dilemma mit einem ganz neuen Ansatz: Sie setzt ökonomische Anreize, nicht gegen, sondern nach den Regeln zu spielen. Wer sich konstruktiv an der Pflege der Blockchain-Datenbank beteiligt, kann damit Geld verdienen: Bitcoins. Neben den Bitcoin-Transaktionen lassen sich jedoch noch zusätzliche Daten in der Blockchain speichern. Das ist attraktiv. Denn da die Blockchain fälschungssicher und gleichzeitig öffentlich und jederzeit von überall einsehbar ist, ist sie ein ideales Verzeichnis für alle Informationen, die mit Wert und Eigentum verbunden sind. Dazu zählen auch Urheberrechtsinformationen einzelner Dateien, die sich gewinnbringend vermarkten lassen. Zum Beispiel wenn Sammler und Museen digitale Kunstwerke kaufen, weil es diese nicht beliebig oft gibt, sondern nur in zweifelsfrei begrenzter Stückzahl.\n\nDen Beweis dieser Limitation will Bruce Pon mit der Blockchain liefern. Über Ascribe können Urheber ihre Werke kostenlos in der Bitcoin-Blockchain registrieren und die zugehörigen Nutzungsrechte öffentlich machen. Langfristig, so die Vision, soll jeder Nutzer im Netz so für jede kreative Leistung die entsprechende Anerkennung bekommen. Egal, ob es um Geld oder nur die Nennung des Namens geht. Der Speicherplatz der Bitcoin-Blockchain ist jedoch stark begrenzt. Um seine Vision einer universellen dezentralisierten Urheberrechtsdatenbank zu verwirklichen, plant Pon daher schon mit Blockchain 2.0-Ideen, die auch ohne Bitcoin funktionieren sollen. Stefan Richter ist hingegen skeptisch, ob das überhaupt möglich sein wird.\n\n""Ohne eine Ökonomie kann eine Blockchain nicht funktionieren. Sonst ist es einfach eine sehr schlecht implementierte verteilte Datenbank.""', 'Ali vs Frazier. Harding vs Kerrigan. Vader vs Kenobi. The NBN vs the entire country of Australia.

Regardless, Lingham continues to be fascinated by bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, it\'s fair to say his personal fascination with the digital currency led to Gyft offering it as a payment option in the first place.\n\nLingham told CoinDesk:\n\n""The reason we started [accepting bitcoin payments for gift cards] is because I am a bit of a bitcoin fanatic and being the CEO and co-founder is kind of one of those things where you build the company and its DNA around the things that you are passionate about.""\n\nLingham – a serial Internet entrepreneur – also noted bitcoin integration had acted as a catalyst for the company\'s growth, after the its decision to do so received a significant amount of media attention.\n\n""So we rode out the bitcoin bandwagon for at least a year throughout various hype cycles and so a lot of people adopted bitcoin and they used Gyft ... and we became the de-facto standard for bitcoin usage,"" he added.\n\nBitcoin as a commodity\n\nDespite having a front seat to bitcoin being used in payments, Lingham doesn\'t see bitcoin as a currency – at least not yet.\n\n""The reason for this is its just not stable and you can\'t price things in the currency ... right now it\'s being used as a medium of exchange, the same way you would use gold,"" he said.\n\nAccording to him, bitcoin will become a currency when its supply and demand are balanced and an industrial use-case is found.\n\n""There\'s an unknown amount of demand, but a lot of speculation, so the price fluctuations are pretty intense and because the demand side of the equation is not fully calculated yet, this is why there is so much uncertainty in the bitcoin world,"" he added.\n\nDespite his initially pessimistic observations, Lingham seemed bullish when it came to discussing the digital currency\'s potential price mark, which he believes will reach $10,000.\n\nLingham said:\n\n""It will get there, it may take five years to get there but it will get there and at that point it will be a very stable asset and the price fluctuation will be very minimal. I think we will get to the point eventually where you can use bitcoin as a currency, we are just nowhere close to that right now.""\n\nFor Lingham, bitcoin is essentially a commodity – albeit the world\'s first digital commodity.\n\nBlockchain: a public database\n\nSimilar to his contemporaries, Lingham\'s views on blockchain technology revolve around the notion of using the distributed ledger as a database.\n\n""There are so many potential use-cases [for blockchain technology] that I wouldn\'t even know where to start. I personally think there are a lot of opportunities in identity, property ownership titles and obviously stock market trading and decentralised stock exchanges.""\n\nOther companies who supply gift card services to merchants, he said, are storing them in their own proprietary databases.\n\n""Why does that have to be the case? Why can\'t you store this information publicly in a public ledger or in a public database and so whoever owns that gift card has access to that data and owns that data,"" he added.\n\nThis option, Lingham noted, would be cheaper, more secure and provide a better user experience.\n\nThe company sets out to do this with Gyft Block – a gift card trading platform which leverages blockchain technology – created in partnership with API developer Chain.\n\nWith Gyft Block, Lingham concluded, the company is showing how a neutral third party such as the blockchain can be used to track ""sensitive and financial data"".\n\nVinny Lingham is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.

It’s really come a long way and I imagine in the next two years, it will be much higher actually.”\n\nMerchants & Global Users\n\nGlobal establishments and merchants worldwide that have been accepting bitcoin for the last year or two have announced a positive growth in their sales revenue. Dell, for example, has reported a positive growth of bitcoin sales over the last year.\n\nDell also tweeted:\n\n“If you’re a retailer, there’s really no reason not to accept Bitcoin at this point” t.co/pWYy7NnhXH via @nytimes — Dell (@Dell) July 18, 2014\n\nOnline retail giants like TigerDirect has also reported positive consumer feedback and growth in bitcoin sales over the last 18 months.\n\n“According to Leeds, TigerDirect has been thrilled with its decision to accept bitcoin. Leeds noted that Bitcoin has drawn new users to TigerDirect, with 46 percent of customers purchasing with bitcoin being new users,” reported Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nToday, multinational companies that have had great experience with bitcoin are trying to convince other merchants to accept bitcoin.\n\n“12 months ago, people like myself were at conferences speaking to merchants out there explaining to merchants why they need to accept bitcoin. 12 months later, merchants like Dell, Overstock, and Microsoft are actually speaking to merchants now explaining the value of why accepting bitcoin is important. We’ve seen the ecosystem change quite dramatically,” explained Singh.', 'In the previous Bitcoin price technical analysis titled Indicators Turning Positive, we discussed that the market participants should remain short on the cryptocurrency. Since then, Bitcoin has touched a high of $235.93 and a low of $226.31 very recently.\n\nThis was another failed attempt by the bulls, and a further 3-4 percent cut will complete jeopardize their plans.\n\nImage: https://www.tradingview.com/x/XHPwVVph/\n\nTake a look at the latest technical indications provided by the daily BTC-USD price chart.\n\nBitcoin Chart Structure – There was another reason that made the recent jump unimpressive: Bitcoin failed to head above its previous high of $237.66. However, things will change significantly in favor of the longs if Bitcoin pierces above $235 (marked as the resistance) in quick time.\n\nMoving Averages – This is one very bearish crossover that the market participants must take a look at. The 30-day SMA of $250.0727 has crossed the 200-day SMA of $250.7289 on the downside. When a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average on the downside, it indicates a bearish trend in the short-term.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence – Even while the MACD and the Signal Line are stuck in the negative region with respective values of -11.0700 and -13.0232, the Histogram has topped the 0-mark with the latest value coming in at 1.9532.\n\nMomentum –The Momentum reading headed into the positive region but has once again taken a hit following the price decline. The latest value is -6.4900.\n\nMoney Flow Index –The MFI has surged to 53.9439, its highest value in over 3 weeks.\n\nRelative Strength Index – The RSI reading of 38.0798 is indicative of the underlying weakness.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe technical picture for Bitcoin is still bearish. Market participants should continue to build short positions on jumps until $235 is breached on a closing basis.\n\nIn case, the bulls are unable to protect $215-220, expect a swift decline to sub-$200 levels.\n\nExpect low volatility in the next couple of sessions.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Whereas the S5 used 60 chips per miner, the Antminer S7 uses 162 of the BM1385 chips. Each S7 will be able to generate upwards of 4,850 GH/s while only needing approximately 0.25 J/GH of power.\n\nPart of the reason the chip is so much stronger is because the company went away from using standard design flow methods. “From the BM1385 onwards, we’ll be using full-custom design flow,” Smith explained. While full-custom design flow is more work intensive and does have a greater margin of error, it results in greater efficiency, which is where profit can be found.\n\n“It’s difficult to predict the how long our new chip will take to bring to market, but development on our next chip began almost as soon as this one was completed. Our next chip, the BM1387, will be our second full-custom chip, and our first chip built on a 16-nanometer process node,” Smith said.\n\nWith each new chip released miners have to weigh their options on whether to upgrade. Smith said that there has been considerable interest in the S7 by current Bitmain miners, in particular because older hardware may become obsolete. “The inevitable large deployment of S7s will cause network hashrate to rise and some older hardware to be forced offline. More recent hardware like the S5 will still be profitable, but to a lower degree than at present,” Smith said.\n\n‘We’ll continue to make our machines available to Joe Miner …’\n\nBitmain has deployed a different strategy than other Bitcoin hardware companies has. Other companies have focused their development efforts on creating miners for internal use rather than widespread adoption. For example, Bitcoin Shop (BTCS) announced that it would be merging with Spondoolies-Tech, which would give BTCS access to Spondoolies’ latest miner to give it a competitive advantage. Bitmain, on the other hand, continues to sell its hardware to the general population.\n\n“We’re very strong believers in keeping Bitcoin decentralized. Until recently, most mining was done by so-called average users and not by large mining operations,” Smith said. “It would be a real shame to see this dedicated group left without options for supporting the network in their own way, and perhaps even present a dangerous situation for the network to be secured only by large and well-capitalized firms.”\n\nAs mining does continue to get more expensive, only those companies that have the resources to create large operations will be able to survive. The fewer operations that are mining, the more likely it is that one, single source could take a majority of the hashrate, creating potential security problems.\n\n“We will continue to make our machines available to Joe Miner for as long as we are making hardware,” Smith said. “It’s an unfortunate situation that we’re the only big ASIC manufacturer selling directly to consumers right now; we’d love to see more competition in this space and for the miners themselves to have more options available.”\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and journalist covering finance and bitcoin. He runs a weekly newsletter all about bitcoin and digital currency called Crypto Brief.', 'Do you have bitcoins and don’t know how to spend it on one of the large format stores or an e commerce site that does not accept bitcoin. There is a solution for that and it’s called gift cards. There are many services that allows users to buy and sell discounted gift cards for bitcoin. Some of them include Gyft and Fold. Now there is another service by the name CardCash added to the list.\n\nCardCash is an American online discounted gift card site which has been around for a while, but they are now back in the news for introducing bitcoin payments on their platform. According to the CEO of CardCash Elliot Bohm, the company decided to introduce bitcoin payment option after they realized that many large format stores spread across the United States still do not provide an option to purchase using bitcoin while there are few which already does. The service is meant to bridge the gap and enable people to spend bitcoin and save money at the same time.\n\nThe CardCash application with bitcoin integration will be out next month, enabling users to buy gift cards with bitcoin using the application. The CardCash mobile application helps users buy gift cards on-the -go using bitcoin instantly. For example, one can just walk into Macy’s or Walmart, do shopping and while waiting at the billing counter, order a gift card and pay for the purchase using the barcode generated at the check-out. It will also cave anywhere between 5%-20% for the customer as CardCash users are entitled to discounts.\n\nCardCash has also got mechanisms in place to prevent money laundering and fraud. The stringent AML and fraud prevention measures implemented on the platform. Each card is verified, with 45 day balance guarantee, Sellers on the platform are authenticated, and there is also a maximum purchase limit of $10000 in place to prevent misuse and keep a check on money laundering.\n\nThe CardCash service is available only in the United States for the moment.', 'Those of us who have been closely following the happenings in bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry have heard about National Science Foundation’s recent grant to three top universities in the United States for research on cryptocurrencies. University of Maryland is one of the recipients of the total $3 million research grant along with Cornell University and University of California- Berkeley.\n\nA lot of us haven’t had a chance to know what kind of research these universities will be doing on bitcoin to receive a small fortune. Here is an insight to what the researchers at University of Maryland are up to and why are they doing what they are currently doing.\n\nREAD MORE: 3 US Universities to Conduct Government-Funded Cryptocurrency Research\n\nAccording to one of the publications that interacted directly with the researchers from University of Maryland involved in bitcoin research has given us insights into what’s going on inside those computer labs. The main objective of university of Maryland’s researchers is to find out the cause for knowledge gap between bitcoin adoption and its understanding. They aim to eliminate this gap. This is the job of an academic institution as startups in the sphere will not bother to look into the minor details. They can’t afford to do that as well, because their aim is to become the first one on the top and gain a foothold in the market with rapid growth which can render things a lot of things obsolete within a matter of months.\n\nThe purpose of research revolves around understanding the underlying aspects of bitcoin including the principles of cryptography, game theory, programming languages used and systems security. Since the introduction of bitcoin in 2009, there hasn’t been many significant changes made to the block size.\n\nResearchers believe that there hasn’t been enough scientific thought given to the technology powering bitcoin and it is one of the reasons for the ongoing debate about increasing block size limit. No one is sure about the possible implications of changing the block size. Also, what makes matters worse and calls for immediate scientific attention is the fact that bitcoin was never really tested before people started using, so there are many unknown factors still associated with it.\n\nUniversity of Maryland researchers are also working on addressing the possible security vulnerabilities which might allow an individual or a group to gain effective control over the network by accumulating enough processing power. In such a case, that individual will be able to control how transactions happen.\n\nBitcoin transactions can’t be reversed and even it is virtually impossible to automate bitcoin payments at the moment, which is one of the disadvantages when compared to fiat currency. Researchers are exploring ways to create smart computer coded contracts that can be used in fintech sectors. These electronic contracts should be capable of initiating automatic settlements as soon as the terms of contract are either met or the termination of contract.\n\nThese brilliant researchers from all three universities, supported by NSF are working on the possibility of creating a better bitcoin that can do everything fiat currency can do while being more faster, cheaper and secure so that it won’t throw any surprise at users. With better understanding of the extent to which the technology can be stretched, detecting vulnerabilities and patching it will help bitcoin stand through the test of time and technological advancement.\n\nREAD MORE: University of Maryland Gives Grants for Cryptocurrency Research', 'Entenda como funciona o bitcoin, moeda que movimenta mais de R$ 10 bi no mundo Principal vantagem é a facilidade de transferir dinheiro para outros países em minutos\n\nAtualmente, principal atrativo do bitcoin é investimento Flickr/Zach Copley\n\nUma moeda que não pode ser sacada em caixas eletrônicos, mas é capaz de cruzar o planeta em poucos minutos. Essa é uma definição básica do bitcoin. Trata-se de uma inovação tecnológica criada há seis anos e com um horizonte promissor, segundo especialistas.\n\nO bitcoin ou BTC (abreviação) circula somente no meio digital, ou seja, em computadores, tablets e smartphones. Ele tem uma cotação própria, que varia de acordo com cada moeda. Por exemplo, 1 BTC vale hoje algo em torno de R$ 880 reais — cotação que varia todos os dias. Porém, também é vendido fracionado.\n\nAs compras e vendas são feitas por meio de casas de câmbio específicas. A pessoa cria uma conta com créditos em reais que são usados para adquirir bitcoins. É possível fazer o caminho inverso.\n\nCom a conta criada, é possível receber bitcoins ou enviar dinheiro para outras contas. Essa é uma das grandes vantagens da moeda, segundo o professor da Escola Brasileira de Administração Pública e de Empresas da Fundação Getulio Vargas Alexandre Linhares.\n\n— A gente pode conversar duas horas via Skype com alguém que está na Mongólia ou no Azerbaijão e não consegue mandar um centavo para essa pessoa. Enviar pequenas quantias para o exterior pelo sistema convencional é algo praticamente impossível. Mas com o bitcoin, isso é viável.\n\nGrosso modo, o bitcoin é como se você enviasse um e-mail com dinheiro para uma pessoa. Ela tem a opção de utilizar esse valor para adquirir produtos e serviços ou de convertê-lo para a moeda local, aí sim usando o sistema bancário tradicional.\n\nEstão em circulação hoje cerca de 14,5 milhões de bitcoins, algo avaliado em torno de US$ 3,3 bilhões (mais de R$ 11 bilhões). Diariamente, são jogados na rede lotes de bitcoins que são minerados por usuários, por meio de computadores com grande capacidade de processamento.\n\nComo o próprio nome sugere, o trabalho é muito parecido ao de procurar ouro, mas consiste em uma sequência de valores criptografados. Essa estratégia permite que a moeda seja injetada aos poucos e não perca o valor de mercado.\n\nNo Brasil, o MercadoBitcoin funciona como uma casa de câmbio virtual e tem hoje cerca de 100 mil usuários cadastrados, segundo o CEO da empresa, Rodrigo Batista.\n\n— O principal uso para os brasileiros, que eu consigo reparar, são pessoas fazendo pagamentos para o exterior. Quando eles pagam com bitcoins, não precisa pagar IOF [Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras]. Mas ainda assim, a maioria, acho que 90%, usa como investimento.\n\nSem lei específica, moeda digital ainda precisa conquistar confiança dos brasileiros\n\nAplicar em algo virtual e ainda sem regulamentação no Brasil pode parecer algo arriscado. E realmente é. Nos últimos anos, a cotação do bitcoin apresentou grandes oscilações em curtos espaços de tempo, algo que Batista aposta que irá diminuir.\n\n— Eu acredito que conforme o bitcoin vá se espalhando pelo planeta, e isso tem acontecido aos poucos, essas oscilações tendem a diminuir. Usar o bitcoin como investimento ou como uma forma de guardar é algo de risco. Mas é a mesma coisa que você comprar ações na bolsa de valores.\n\nOutra questão que causa polêmica é o anonimato em torno dos usuários do bitcoin. Todas as transações que ocorrem na rede são públicas, mas a identidade de quem as faz não é. Há casos de crimes envolvendo esse meio de pagamento. Um dos mais conhecidos foi o do site Silk Road, que vendia drogas e recebia pagamento em bitcoin. O dono foi preso nos Estados Unidos.\n\nPerdeu algum programa da Record? Assista no R7 Play\n\nPorém, Batista garante que o anonimato não existe.\n\n— No bitcoin, quando se olha as transações, que são todas públicas, não se sabe quem é a pessoa que está vinculada a ela. Mas essas transações passam por bancos, por empresas como a minha, que exigem identificação. É possível seguir o rastro do dinheiro. É tudo registrado na rede e essas informações são públicas.\n\nO fato de o bitcoin ser relativamente novo e uma tecnologia complexa é uma barreira para muita gente. Mas o professor Alexandre Linhares diz acreditar que com os investimentos que estão sendo feitos será possível aperfeiçoar e tornar a moeda digital acessível.\n\n— Este ano, mais de US$ 1 bilhão foi investido em startups de bitcoins. Hoje, o dinheiro não está indo para comprar bitcoin em si, mas sim para as startups. E tem também o investimento na mineração de bitcoins, que traz mais segurança para as transações da moeda.\n\nEle cita uma dessas empresas, a Xapo, que tem como conselheiros Lawrence Summers, ex-secretário do Tesouro dos EUA e ex-presidente de Harvard; Dee Hock, fundador e ex-presidente da empresa de cartões Visa; e John Reed, ex-presidente da Bolsa de Valores da Nova York.\n\nOs grandes avanços dessa tecnologia estão acontecendo no Vale do Silício (Califórnia), em Londres, no Japão e em Berlim. No Brasil, o Banco Central diz que acompanha as discussões sobre o tema para, se necessário, adotar medidas de regulação.\n\nLeia mais notícias de Economia', 'CALGARY – Il existe une application pour pratiquement tout, même pour acheter de l’or.\n\nLe cofondateur de BitGold, Josh Crumb, dit avoir créé ce système, qui relie automatiquement les acheteurs aux vendeurs et aux compagnies d’entreposage d’or, pour faciliter la tâche aux gens qui souhaitent s’en procurer pour se protéger de l’inflation ou se créer une réserve de valeur.\n\n«C’est juste tellement plus facile, comme pour tout le reste, de le faire à partir de son téléphone mobile», a-t-il affirmé.\n\nSa compagnie encaisse des frais d’un pour cent sur les transactions d’or, mais l’entreposage est gratuit. L’application permet aussi aux utilisateurs de transférer leur valeur en or sur une carte de crédit prépayée pour réellement pouvoir se payer un café avec leur or.\n\nM. Crumb et le cofondateur Roy Sebag ont été inspirés par les avenues qu’offre Bitcoin, qui permet des transactions financières internationales sans passer par les systèmes bancaires.\n\nComme avec le bitcoin, BitGold permet les transferts libres entre utilisateurs. Une option de virement d’argent à l’international est en cours d’élaboration.

À la fin juillet, elle comptait déjà plus de 168 000 utilisateurs à travers le monde et avait transigé quelque 7 millions $.\n\nD’après M. Crumb, c’est un système qui devrait être populaire auprès d’une frange d’acheteurs d’or qui entrevoient l’effondrement imminent du dollar américain et une montée de la valeur de l’or, mais il souhaite aussi rejoindre une base plus grande qui l’utiliserait comme compte d’épargne.\n\n«On n’achète pas de l’or pour devenir riche comme on achète des actions d’Apple.

For the luxury marques, though, the pain had begun a while back. A crackdown on ostentatious consumption had threatened to depress sales for the likes of Bentley and Rolls-Royce, ever since Chinese president Xi Jinping launched his anti-corruption campaign in 2013. This year, the impact has started to show. “Everyone’s really hurting,” says one executive at a luxury carmaker. A combination of a slowing economy, restrictions on registration plates in larger cities to ease congestion, and increasing consumer appetite for domestic brands — all against the backdrop of the anti-corruption drive — have created a difficult environment for western manufacturers. “All of these factors have a more direct correlation to sales than a volatile stock market,” says Bill Russo, a Shanghai-based consultant. Even so, the sudden deceleration in Chinese car sales came as a surprise to some — not least when sales went into reverse in recent months. In July, car sales fell for a second consecutive month, by 6.6 per cent, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Some analysts believe that the scale of the decline is such that multinational manufacturers such as Volkswagen and BMW — respectively the parent companies of Bentley and Rolls-Royce — will be forced to warn on profits in the coming weeks. “Please keep in mind that we still have some drama ahead of us,” says Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein Research. It amounts to a startling turn in fortunes for the car industry. Between 2010 and 2014, premium and ultra-premium car sales grew by 50 per cent, as brands such as Audi, BMW, Porsche and Land Rover almost doubled their volumes in the country, according to data from IHS Automotive. But registrations of luxury and ultra-luxury vehicles were down almost 10 per cent year-on-year in the first six months of 2015, based on figures from Bernstein Research. A devaluation of the Chinese currency has not helped, making already expensive European cars even more so. This has taken a heavy toll on exports of British-made models. Bentley, which counts China as its second-biggest market, reported worldwide first-half sales down almost 12 per cent to 4,600 units. It was a similar story at Rolls-Royce, for which global deliveries fell 10 per cent to about 2,000 cars in the first half. Neither manufacturer breaks out six-month sales by country, but domestic peer Jaguar Land Rover offered a window to the state of the world’s largest car market: sales in China were down 27 per cent in the first half. Not all luxury car brands have suffered such declines. Porsche, maker of the Cayenne sport utility vehicle, reported sales up 48 per cent in the first half of the year. But volumes to not tell the full story. China’s economic headwinds have already created what analysts describe as a “hyper-competitive” market. Porsche has admitted that dealers, independent of the company, have been cutting the price of its Panamera sports car by as much as 20 per cent. Chinese pricing website Bitauto also carries examples of Bentley Flying Spurs and Rolls-Royce Wraiths discounted by a similar percentage. To put that in context, in the past, western luxury cars typically sold at a premium to their list prices in China. For some companies, this turnround is already having an effect. China accounts for more than 60 per cent of JLR’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to Bernstein — and the country’s slowdown has caused net income to almost halve at parent company Tata Motors. Similarly, Bentley’s operating profit fell from €95m to €54m in the first half. Both companies, however — having ridden the tide of rising wealth in China for several years — are outwardly calm. “Don’t worry,” said Wolfgang Dürheimer, Bentley chief executive, speaking to the FT last month. “Of course we need to take the slowdown of the market seriously but\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I strongly believe in the Chinese market. There are some changes going on at present, but on the long-term view it will be a very profitable basis for us.” Industry executives point to low car density — less than one in 10 people drive in China — and a still growing middle class as growth opportunities. Bentley and Rolls-Royce, for example, plan to launch SUVs — increasingly the vehicle of choice in China — over the next two years. Amid the turmoil this week came another cause for optimism. Alongside the interest-rate cut announced on Tuesday by the China’s central bank was a targeted intervention in the car industry: the country reduced by 300 basis points the reserve ratio required to be held by auto financing and leasing companies, potentially increasing the funds available to car buyers in the country. It seemed to suggest that China was committed to supporting car sales. But with two-thirds of premium auto purchases still made in cash, the impact may initially prove limited.']"
08/31/2015,"['Shaun Bridges, a former secret service member, pleads guilty to money laundering after another member of same task force admitted to similar crimes\n\nA former US secret service agent has pleaded guilty to stealing over $800,000 worth of bitcoin during an investigation into online drug marketplace Silk Road.\n\n\n\nSilk Road: undercover DEA agent turned bitcoin thief pleads guilty Read more\n\nShaun Bridges, 33, appeared in federal court in San Francisco and admitted to money laundering and obstruction of justice.\n\nSilk Road operated for more than two years until it was shut down in October 2013 having generated more than $214m in sales of drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoin, prosecutors said.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, Silk Road’s creator, who authorities say used the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, was sentenced to life in prison after a federal jury in Manhattan found him guilty of charges that included distributing drugs via online sales.\n\nBridges belonged to a Baltimore-based federal task force that investigated Silk Road. Another member of that unit, former US Drug Enforcement Administration agent Carl Force, has admitted extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice.\n\nAn attorney for Ulbricht said those charges “remove any question about the corruption that pervaded the investigation of Silk Road”.\n\nIn court on Monday Bridges admitted his theft had made Ulbricht believe that another individual was stealing from Silk Road and helped lead Ulbricht to try to hire someone to kill that person.\n\nSentencing for Bridges was scheduled for December.', 'Banks have been poking around bitcoin technology for some time to better understand how it works and how they might use it. Now, they appear to be getting a lot more serious about the digital currency.\n\nOver the weekend, Barclays announced (paywall) that it would help charities accept bitcoin payments, making it the first UK bank to support the currency. The new feature is a small but important step toward Barclays—or any bank—fully accepting bitcoin.\n\nBanks across the world have been exploring bitcoin, trying to determine the potential uses for the digital currency and its underlying blockchain technology. While most of these discussions and projects have been private and internal, banks are slowly escalating their bitcoin experiments.\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that 75 employees from 15 different financial institutions held a private meeting at Bank of America to discuss using blockchain technology to revamp the foreign currency exchange market. Bitcoin has a number of advantages for forex trading, including near-instant transfer speeds and a much lower cost structure than current methods.\n\nSome hurdles remain before banks widely adopt bitcoin and blockchain technology. There’s still a lot of concern that bitcoin is the currency of choice for illegal activity, and banks are worried about more government scrutiny.', 'Bitcoin users in Canada can now buy and sell bitcoin using Coinbase.\n\nThe bitcoin services firm, which has raised $106.7m in four public venture rounds, is now available in 27 countries in North America and Europe. The move follows the company\'s expansion to Europe in September 2014.\n\nCEO Brian Armstrong had previously indicated that Coinbase is seeking to extend its services to 30 countries by the end of 2015, a goal he disclosed at the time of the startup\'s $75m Series C round, announced in January.\n\nAs a result of the move, Canadian residents can now buy and sell bitcoin using Canadian dollars (CAD), deposit CAD funds into bitcoin wallets and trade CAD/BTC using the Coinbase bitcoin exchange.\n\nIn an interview, Armstrong explained that, while the company has so far found success launching in more developed markets, it remains active in its efforts to extend its services to developing markets. However, he suggested the regulatory environments have so far proven easier to navigate in countries where English language proficiency and technology literacy are high.\n\nArmstrong told CoinDesk:\n\n""It\'s not where we would want to launch first, it\'s actually where the partners we have to work with are able to work with us first. But certainly Canada has a huge population of people that are interested in bitcoin that didn\'t have easy ways to buy and sell it.""\n\nThe company indicated its legal counsel does not believe Coinbase to be ""engaged in any regulated activity"" in Canada, a factor that encouraged it to launch its brokerage and exchange services across all Canadian provinces.\n\nNotably, the company\'s CAD/BTC exchange will be kept in a separate order book, meaning, for now, US exchange users will not be able to access the pair via their US accounts.\n\n""There\'s certainly an advantage to multiple currency pairs, but we wanted to be more conservative from a legal and regulatory sense,"" Armstrong continued.\n\nAs part of the launch, Coinbase said it would waive retail conversion fees for users of its bitcoin brokerage service through 6th September. Trading fees on its exchange product will not be subject to the promotion.\n\nWall Street shoe-in\n\nArmstrong also commented on the increasing competition in the US bitcoin exchange space, which has seen the launch or announcements of expected launch by well-capitalized competitors including itBit and Gemini.\n\nWhile those exchanges may have garnered the lion\'s share of media discussion, Armstrong feels Coinbase is best positioned to capture investment from this demographic. In particular, he cited the New York Stock Exchange\'s (NYSE) investment in the company and co-founder Fred Ehrsam\'s experience at Goldman Sachs.\n\n""If Wall Street is doing to do anything [with bitcoin], they\'re going to do it with us. Perception here is that we\'re a shoe-in in the banking crowd,"" he said.\n\nCoinbase Exchange is currently available in more than 30 states, as well as Washington, DC and Puerto Rico, partly through licenses secured in each jurisdiction. Rival itBit has alternatively secured a New York banking charter, which it has claimed gives it the ability to service customers in all 50 US states.\n\nThough he spoke positively of rival itBit, Armstrong called Gemini\'s effort, including its recent filing for a banking charter in New York, ""embarrassing"", suggesting the investors and entrepreneurs behind the project, brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss don\'t have a reliable track record of product delivery.\n\nBusiness model questions\n\nAs for Coinbase\'s long-term revenue model, Armstrong said the startup is likely to add additional financial products to its exchange product, potentially including derivatives.\n\nArmstrong described the company\'s brokerage and professional trading tools as its ""Google AdWords"", the revenue-generating arm of the firm that will allow it to pursue more innovative, low-cost, consumer-facing services.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that, across the industry, wallets and exchanges are having difficulty raising revenue, but he believes Coinbase is well-positioned to monetize through its brokerage service, given that the company has established a trusted name in the industry.\n\n""It\'s more an Apple than a WalMart model,"" he continued. ""I think the consumer business is going to be defensible and profitable and allow us to offer the developer platform for free.""\n\nFor now, he reiterated Coinbase is seeking to build an ""open and efficient payment network"" for a global user base, emphasizing that its services in Canada are yet another step toward that goal.\n\nCanadian flag image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Hilton of the Eastern District of Virginia sentenced Ali Shukri Amin, 17, of Manassas, Va. to 136 months in prison along with a lifetime of supervision for conspiring to support a terrorist group, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the U.S. Department of Justice announced.\n\nAmin, who pled guilty on June 11, 201, admitted to using Twitter to provide advice and encouragement to ISIL and its supporters, according to court documents. Using Twitter handle @Amreekiwitness, he provided instruction on how to use bitcoin to mask the provision of funds to ISIL, as well as to facilitate ISIL supporters interested in traveling to Syria to join ISIL.\n\nAccording to a court document posted on arstechnica.co.uk, Amin tweeted a link to an article on or about July 7, 2014 titled, “Bitcoin wa’ Sadaqat al-Jihad” (Bitcoin and the Charity of Jihad.) The link sent the user to the article on the defendant’s blog. It explained how to use bitcoins and how jihadists could utilize the currency to fund their activities.\n\nBlog Instructed Terrorists In Using Bitcoin\n\nThe article on the blog explained how bitcoin works and suggested using Dark Wallet. It discussed how to set up an anonymous donation system to send bitcoin to the mujahedeen.\n\nAmin also created a blog containing a series of technical articles targeted at jihadists and ISIL supporters on using security measures in online communications. The blog addressed the use of encryption and anonymity software, tools and techniques, as well as the use of bitcoin.\n\nAmin admitted facilitating travel for Reza Niknejad, an 18-year-old Prince William County resident who went to Syria in January 2015 to join ISIL. The Eastern District of Virginia charged Niknejad on June 10, 2015, with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, as well as conspiring to provide material support to ISIL to kill and injure people abroad.\n\nAli Shukri Amin was an honor student and was originally from Iran, according to The InquistR now-defunct Twitter handle about how jihadists could use bitcoin “to fund their efforts.”\n\nFBI Investigated Activities\n\nThe FBI’s Washington Field Office investigated Amin’s activities. Michael P. Ben’Ary, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Caroline H. Friedman, Special Assistant U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of Virginia prosecuted the case. Trial Attorney Stephen Sewell of the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section provided assistance.\n\n“Today’s sentencing demonstrates that those who use social media as a tool to provide support and resources to ISIL will be identified and prosecuted with no less vigilance than those who travel to take up arms with ISIL,” said Dana J. Boente, U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nThe Department of Justice will continue to pursue those that travel to fight against the United States and our allies, as well as those individuals that recruit others on behalf of ISIL in the homeland.\n\n“Ali Shukri Amin is a young American who used social media to provide material support to ISIL,” said John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.\n\nISIL continues to use social media to send their violent and hateful message around the world in an attempt to radicalize, recruit and incite youth and others to support their cause. More and more, their propaganda is seeping into our communities and reaching those who are most vulnerable. The Department of Justice will continue to use all tools to disrupt the threats that ISIL poses, and our efforts will be furthered by parents and other members of our community willing to take action to confront and deter this threat wherever it may surface.\n\nAlso read: Hacktivist groups join fight against ISIS\n\nOnline Radicalization On The Rise\n\nAndrew G. McCabe, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington, D.C., Field Office, said the case serves as a reminder of how persistent and pervasive online radicalization has become. “The FBI, through our Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF), remains dedicated to protecting the United States against the ongoing violent threat posed by ISIL and their supporters,” he said. “Today marks a personal tragedy for the Amin family and the community as we have lost yet another young person to the allure of extremist ideology focused on hatred.”\n\nStephan Hudson, Chief of the Prince William County, Virginia, Police Department, said school staff followed up by the School Resource Officer made observations about the teen’s suspicious behavior.\n\nThose observations were quickly relayed to our partners with the JTTF who acted upon this information very quickly. We greatly appreciate that these observations were observed and reported to the proper authorities proved to be instrumental in the overall investigation in stopping a dangerous network such as ISIL from further infiltrating our community.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""This story appears in the October 2015 issue of Bloomberg Markets.\n\nThe penthouse meeting room in Le Parker Meridien hotel in midtown Manhattan is humming with chatter on this June afternoon. About a hundred money managers are networking at the end of the day at a Sandler O’Neill & Partners investor conference as the green rectangle of Central Park stretches into the distance 42 floors below. With neckties loosened and icy drinks in hand, the attendees largely ignore the founder of a fintech startup who’s presenting a PowerPoint about his investing smartphone app. But when the next guest takes the floor, the room falls silent.\n\nThese Wall Street veterans all know who Blythe Masters is. She’s the wunderkind who made managing director at JPMorgan Chase at age 28, the financial engineer who helped develop the credit-default swap and bring to life a market that peaked at $58 trillion, in notional terms, in 2007. She’s the banker later vilified by pundits, unfairly some say, after those instruments compounded the damage wrought by the subprime mortgage crash in 2008. Now, one year after quitting JPMorgan amid another controversy, Blythe Masters is back. She isn’t pitching a newly minted derivative or trading stratagem to this room. She’s promoting something wilder: It’s called the blockchain, and it’s the digital ledger software code that powers bitcoin.\n\nMasters is the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, a New York tech startup. She says her firm is designing software that will enable banks, investors, and other market players to use blockchain technology to change the way they trade loans, bonds, and other assets. If she’s right, she’ll be at the center of yet another whirlwind that will change the markets.\n\n“You should be taking this technology as seriously as you should have been taking the development of the Internet in the early 1990s,” Masters, a lithe 46-year-old Englishwoman with auburn hair and the proper diction of the Home Counties, explains to the rapt audience. “It’s analogous to e-mail for money.”\n\nThat’s a bold statement, but Masters isn’t the only voice heralding the coming of the blockchain. The Bank of England, in a report earlier this year, calls it the “first attempt at an Internet of finance,” while the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis hails it as a “stroke of genius.” In a June white paper, the World Economic Forum says, “The blockchain protocol threatens to disintermediate almost every process in financial services.”\n\nIn a matter of months, this word, blockchain, has gone viral on trading floors and in the executive suites of banks and brokerages on both sides of the Atlantic. You can’t attend a finance conference these days without hearing it mentioned on a panel or at a reception or even in the loo. At a recent blockchain confab in London’s hip East End, the host asked if there were any bankers in the room. More than half the audience members, all dressed in suits, raised their hands.\n\nNow, everyone’s trying to figure out whether the blockchain is just so much hype or if Masters’s firm and other startups are really going to change the systems that process trillions of dollars in securities trades. When investors buy and sell syndicated loans or derivatives or move money around the world, they must cope with opaque and clunky back-office processes that rely on negotiated contracts between buyers and sellers, lots of phone calls, lots of lawyers, and even the occasional fax. It still takes almost 20 days, on average, to settle syndicated loan trades.\n\nMasters is betting that the blockchain, the breakthrough that permits people to buy and sell bitcoins without the need for an intermediary, can be used to streamline all manner of financial transactions. A June report backed by Santander InnoVentures, the Spanish bank’s fintech investment fund, estimated the blockchain could save lenders up to $20 billion annually in settlement, regulatory, and cross-border payment costs.\n\n“You have front-end systems trading at warp speed, and nanoseconds of competitive advantage are being extracted, and yet the back end of Wall Street hasn’t been fundamentally overhauled in decades,” Masters says in an interview at her offices in Manhattan’s Flatiron District. “Firms are dealing with greater requirements for reporting, transparency, and dissemination of data. Costs have gone up and revenues have gone down. This technology really gets to the core of all those issues.”\n\nThat’s why there’s been a Cambrian explosion of blockchain startups, accelerators, and skunkworks in London, New York, and Silicon Valley. In April, UBS installed a half dozen developers in London’s Level39 accelerator to download blockchain source code from the Internet and delve into how it might revolutionize payments, cybersecurity, and other banking needs. Barclays, Goldman Sachs, the New York Stock Exchange, and Santander are backing cryptocurrency ventures. And no surprise, Marc Andreessen, Jim Breyer, Reid Hoffman, and other denizens of Sand Hill Road are all over this space. Venture capitalists plowed $400 million into dozens of digital currency startups in the first six months of this year, a fourfold jump from all of 2013, according to industry news site CoinDesk.\n\nSome of these ventures are building on the actual bitcoin blockchain. In June, Nasdaq teamed up with Chain, a San Francisco firm, and launched a project to use the blockchain to issue and transfer the equity shares of closely held companies on the exchange’s private marketplace. “The blockchain is going to bring levels of efficiency to the financial markets that we’ve never seen before,” says Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld. “In time, it could be as impactful on the back office as electronic trading was on open outcry.”\n\nBy contrast, Ripple Labs, another San Francisco company, runs a self-contained network for financial institutions that doesn’t rely on bitcoin at all. Masters plans to offer banks and other financial players both options: Digital Asset is creating an off-the-shelf private blockchain product and developing ways to connect its customers to the existing bitcoin system.\n\nWhatever form it takes, the blockchain has the potential to change the very structure of the financial services industry, says Oliver Bussmann, the chief information officer at UBS. “If you brought up bitcoin with bankers 12 months ago, you’d lose their attention immediately,” Bussmann says. “Now, everyone sees this as a critical topic. I know of more than 100 firms that are trying to make the blockchain more scalable, more secure, to make the one that everybody will use. There’s a race on out there.”\n\nMaybe so, but rewiring the market’s infrastructure is an awfully big task. So is persuading financial players to place their trust in a system embraced by cryptocurrency anarchists and other fringy characters. Even if market pros do grasp the blockchain’s potential, will they buy in?\n\n“Look, the technology is potentially great, but you’re going to have to bring along all the regulators and the banks to change the ecosystem,” says Hank Uberoi, the former co-head of Goldman Sachs’s global technology operations and now the CEO of Earthport, a London-based payments venture. “Change comes very slowly in that world. That’s going to be the hardest part.”\n\nWhen it comes to adopting innovation, the financial services industry doesn’t exactly have a stellar record. For example, the global interbank payments system, which Uberoi’s Earthport is trying to shake up, is managed by a consortium of more than 10,000 institutions. It’s so antiquated that it still takes days to send transactions from one part of the world to another. Jon Matonis, a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a Washington group that promotes the cryptocurrency, says a private blockchain run by banks could end up as just “another cartel” and function as poorly as the payments consortium.\n\nMasters had a hard time believing Digital Asset's Sunil Hirani was serious when he first talked to her about bitcoin. Photographer: Guzman/Bloomberg Markets\n\nBlythe Masters swings open the door of her ninth-floor offices, parks her suitcase, and exhales. Fresh off a flight from London, she’s relieved to be back on solid ground. Masters says her airliner was landing when it suddenly roared back into the sky to avoid a collision on the runway. “That’s the most dangerous moment I’ve ever had on a plane!” says Masters, who’s dressed in a black knit tunic, black tights, and Burberry-plaid flats.\n\nHer new digs at Digital Asset Holdings, with a worn wooden floor and views of air shafts, are a far cry from the Park Avenue executive suite at JPMorgan. The glass walls are covered in scribbled pieces of code and diagrams with a lot of boxes and arrows. A gray terrier named Luna, the office pooch, scampers under the conference room table. A guest notes that Nasdaq has just hired a “blockchain technology evangelist.” “We have a blockchain artist,” Masters replies, pointing out the one decorative object in the place, a painting depicting a network of black and blue lines. “That is our COO’s homegrown work,” she says with delight. “I rather like it.”\n\nBorn in Oxford and educated in economics at Cambridge, Masters came of age at JPMorgan. At 18, she joined its London office as an intern during a year off before university. By her mid-20s, Masters was working on the bank’s derivatives team in New York. She helped design a way to remove lending risk from JPMorgan’s balance sheet by getting another party to protect the bank against a default in return for a premium. The contract, which made it possible to bet a bond would fall in value, was dubbed a credit-default swap, and investors fell in love with it. In 1999, Masters, then 30, was named head of the bank’s global credit derivatives unit.\n\n“Blythe has about as much wrapped up in one brain as I’ve ever encountered in finance,” says John “Mac” McQuown, co-founder of KMV, a maker of widely used credit analysis tools. McQuown, 81, has known Masters since the early 1990s. “She is inventive, a risk taker, and beyond a doubt a force to be reckoned with.”\n\nMasters advanced quickly up JPMorgan’s ranks. Following a stint as CFO of its global investment bank from 2004 to 2007, she was appointed chief of a newly formed unit that helped clients manage risk in commodities markets. During the next five years, she built it into a profitable business that oversaw billions of dollars of physical assets. At the same time, Masters served as a board member and then chair of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, known as SIFMA. Along the way, she earned a reputation as that rare figure on the Street, a corporate player with the innovative chops of an entrepreneur.\n\n“You were one of the most powerful women on Wall Street,” CNBC host Bob Pisani noted during an onstage interview with Masters at a fintech conference in June.\n\n“What do you mean I was?” Masters deadpanned.\n\nAfter the fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, some media outlets highlighted her work with credit derivatives and cast her as one of the instigators of the crash. She became such a target of critics that a French graffiti artist spray-painted her likeness onto the wall of a museum called the Abode of Chaos near Lyon.\n\nIn a speech that year at SIFMA’s annual conference in New York, she noted that she’d been dubbed “The Woman Who Built Financial Weapons of Mass Destruction.” She responded to the swipes by saying the problem wasn’t the instrument but the way people used it. “Unfortunately, tools that transfer risk can also increase systemic risk if major counterparties fail to manage their risk exposures properly,” she said.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon backed her all the way through this period, but her fortunes turned in 2013, when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigated whether traders in her commodities division manipulated California’s electricity market. JPMorgan paid a $410 million settlement to end the case without denying or admitting wrongdoing; Masters wasn’t implicated in the matter. Dimon agreed to sell the business to a Swiss trading firm called Mercuria Energy Group in March 2014, and Masters resigned.\n\nFor the first time in her career, she had nowhere to be and nothing to do except hang out with her husband and daughter in her Tribeca townhouse, catch up with friends, and pursue her passion for show jumping. Masters has won first-place ribbons riding her two beloved European warmblood horses, Aslan and Vamos.\n\nThen one day that summer, she grabbed breakfast with Sunil Hirani, an entrepreneur who co-founded Creditex Group, one of the first CDS brokerages. Hirani, 48, an effusive man who’s made a fortune at the intersection of technology and derivatives, couldn’t stop talking about bitcoin. He was toying with the idea of creating futures contracts around the ersatz currency. He was also forming a startup, Digital Asset, to explore how to apply the blockchain to the markets. He’d teamed up with Don Wilson, the founder and CEO of DRW Trading Group, a Chicago-based market maker and trading firm.\n\nMasters was surprised. Hirani was a shrewd Street vet. He’d sold Creditex for $513 million to Intercontinental Exchange in 2008. Why was he messing around with a technology associated with cypherpunks and anti-Fed libertarians? Wasn’t the currency’s price cratering amid scandals involving bitcoin-lubricated online drug bazaars and bankrupt bitcoin exchanges? “Can’t we talk about something more serious?” Masters pleaded with her old friend.\n\nHirani knew that Masters’s knowledge of the inner workings of the markets would make her the ideal person to build the firm he envisaged and to sell this new technology to Wall Street. So he persuaded Masters to do some homework. Over the next few weeks, she delved into bitcoin’s origins and discussed its potential with Hirani and his colleagues as well as her network of regulators and market players.\n\nPhotographer: Guzman/Bloomberg Markets\n\nSo what, exactly, is this thing that sounds like something you’d build with Lego pieces? Like many innovations in finance these days, the blockchain is code.\n\nIn 2009, a mysterious coder named Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin and the math that makes it work on the Internet. He (or she or they—Nakamoto has yet to be identified) created a peer-to-peer network to enable people to buy and sell bitcoins and to automatically secure and perpetuate the system. Every 10 minutes, coders around the world known as miners race to be the first to solve mathematical equations and record transactions made with bitcoins as entries, or blocks, on a digital ledger. In return for their work, which requires brute force computing power to complete, the program rewards miners with bitcoins, which motivates them to process transactions faster.\n\nHere’s the key part: Every new block is connected to every prior one in a digital chain. So the record of every bitcoin transaction lives on the computers of the miners and is updated with each new entry. That’s why the blockchain is also called a distributed or a decentralized ledger. This replication makes the blockchain secure. The only way to tamper with it would be to seize control of most of the computers holding the blockchain in their memories, which miners call the “51 percent attack.” Such an assault has a better chance of materializing in the next Bond flick than in reality, says Matonis, who’s also an editorial board member at CoinDesk.\n\nAs Masters dug deeper into bitcoin, she learned that it was just one of many applications that could run on the blockchain. Startups in London, Silicon Valley, and even Mexico City were already developing ways to use it to transfer and record land titles, airline miles, gold, and diamonds. Masters realized that bitcoin wasn’t really about bitcoin—it was all about the blockchain. “I had an aha moment,” Masters says.\n\nShe then plumbed why the ledger could transmit assets without an intermediary, which would change everything she knew about the way the markets completed trades. Buyers and sellers, of course, can’t automatically trust one another. In the fixed-income market, for example, we need middlemen to draw up contracts between buyers and sellers that cover interest payments, terms, and collateral, plus clearinghouses to guarantee the exchange of cash for securities.\n\nThrough her research, Masters understood how you could input all that information into a digital “smart contract” on a distributed ledger. Conceptually, it’s similar to the way you can embed video in an e-mail. But the difference is that when you send that smart contract along, it doesn’t just contain data, it transfers ownership of the security. The value belongs to whoever possesses it. So a trade could be settled in minutes instead of days or weeks, Hirani says.\n\nAnyone with access to the ledger can read the contract with a click of a mouse. That means regulators, who depend primarily on self-regulatory organizations to police the markets, could easily verify that a securities transaction didn’t violate anti-money-laundering rules or other laws. The blockchain, in essence, automates trust, Hirani says.\n\nThe clincher for Masters was how the technology can affect risk. Every hour that a trade hangs suspended between sale and purchase, the chances mount that it won’t be fulfilled, she says. Institutions have to set aside capital to protect themselves from such failures. Since the 2008 crash, regulators in the U.S. and the European Union have directed banks to allocate ever-larger sums to cover their exposures. If the blockchain could shorten the settlement time for, say, syndicated loans, from 20 days to 10 minutes, this risk would be reduced and capital would be freed up.\n\n“I spent my whole career thinking about risk, markets, infrastructure, and regulation,” Masters says. “I had seen the financial crisis unfold, and I had seen the credit derivatives market get operationally ahead of itself, which resulted in systemic risk counterparty exposures. I began to believe that distributed ledgers had the capability to tackle that problem.”\n\nIn March, Masters joined Digital Asset as CEO. She, Hirani, and Wilson set to work developing blockchain-based software for three inefficient markets they deemed ripe for an overhaul: syndicated loans, U.S. Treasury repos, and equity shares in private companies. At the same time, Masters recognized that the open structure of the bitcoin process—no one controls who does the mining—would be anathema to an industry in which client confidentiality is sacrosanct. So in July, the company acquired Hyperledger, a San Francisco software firm that’s developing the technological equivalent of gated communities. Its system is designed so that users will be able to process transactions themselves rather than depend on the open bitcoin blockchain.\n\n“With private chains, you can have a completely known universe of transaction processors,” Masters says. “That appeals to financial institutions that are wary of the bitcoin blockchain.”\n\nWhile this vision of a superefficient financial world is enticing, let’s not forget that Masters and her rivals will have to persuade institutions and regulators to uproot decades of legacy IT systems and practices. And the introduction of the blockchain will make the markets’ infrastructure even more complex than it already is, at least in the short term.\n\nSkeptics question whether one piece of code could in a single stroke make finance faster, more transparent, and more efficient. “People are talking about how the blockchain is going to be some kind of Messianic savior for the database industry,” says Bradley Howard, the head of digital media at Endava, a London-based IT services provider. “It may be fantastic in some cases, but it could also just be the latest fad.”\n\nYet Masters, who in July joined the board of Santander’s U.S. auto financing unit as nonexecutive chairman, is betting that the mindset at the highest levels of finance is changing. The advent of peer-to-peer lending, mobile banking, and other innovations is forcing Wall Street’s chieftains to rethink their businesses. She says the blockchain may be the biggest fintech play of them all.\n\n“Blythe sees that a new industry is being created,” says Hirani, who’s known Masters for 17 years. “There’s no infrastructure. There’s no companies that have any kind of scale. She’s done the bank thing. She did commodities. She did derivatives. She did loan portfolio management. This allows her to bring all of that experience to bear in creating an ecosystem—and a company around it.”\n\nTwenty-three years ago, Masters opened up fresh territory with credit derivatives. Now, she’s determined to do it again, although this time it’s with a technology that was initially designed to bypass the financial system. Masters, with a very British dose of understatement, puts it this way: “I’ve always been motivated to innovate where the implications are significant.”\n\nThis story appears in the October issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine."", 'Beam has announced it will no longer focus on using bitcoin in an attempt to disrupt the Ghanaian remittance market.\n\nLaunched last October, Beam emerged as one of a number of ""rebittance"" firms seeking to use the bitcoin blockchain as a means to enable low-cost cross-border payment services.\n\nBeam had sought to appeal to local remittance users with a variety of payout options, allowing bitcoin received by its users to be applied to mobile phone airtime and utility bills, and by using charitable donations as a way to promote its efforts.\n\nIn a new interview, however, Beam CTO Falk Benke told Disrupt Africa that a revamped version of the service will not use bitcoin, saying instead that it would focus on international debit and credit cards.\n\nThe media outlet indicated that Benke cited the lack of local bitcoin adoption, the high cost of exchanging bitcoin for Ghanaian cedi and the volatility of bitcoin against fiat currencies as the reasons underlying the decision.\n\nThe news source suggested that Benke remains optimistic about bitcoin\'s potential as a means of payment on the continent, but that the move was a business decision, writing:\n\n""[Falk] said he was not saying that bitcoin would not work in Africa, but said it was no longer on Beam’s agenda for the time being.""\n\nDespite the closure, other African startups remain focused on using bitcoin to unlock new savings in remittance markets, with $1.7m startup BitPesa focusing on East African markets.\n\nRepresentatives from Beam did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nGhana money exchange via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It became operational earlier this month.\n\nA part of the agency’s in-house forensic tools is its own virtual currency, which can be used in a simulation-based training game.\n\n""It\'s a virtual world that we have created, and personnel can come and operate these things and learn by operating them,"" IGCI director of cyber innovation and outreach Madan Mohan Oberoi told the newspaper during the security trade event Interpol World.\n\n""We felt that these things, if you try to teach people from a policing background through PowerPoint presentations, it doesn\'t make too much sense. Let them play around and learn more.""\n\nThe agency says on its website that police worldwide are facing an increasing difficult operational landscape, as criminals take advantage of new technology, the ease of international travel and the anonymous nature of virtual business.\n\nAs Bitcoin gains further acceptability around the world, it still has a reputation as the currency of choice for cyber criminals. MIT Technology Review warns that a new Bitcoin-inspired technology – known as smart contracts – may be set to unlock a new wave of criminal innovation.', 'According to Vinny Lingham, CEO of digital card platform Gyft, when the company first integrated bitcoin payments they accounted for 90% of the company’s sales. Although Paypal and credit card purchases made up the remaining 10%, Mr. Lingham has stated to CoinDesk that the field has shifted dramatically.\n\nSince the initial bitcoin integreation in 2013, Gyft has seen an incredible 80% drop of bitcoin’s usage, leading to a complete reversal of purchasing trends – now Paypal and credit cards make up 90% of the payment methods, while bitcoin hangs on at 10%. Lingham remains steadfastly fascinated by bitcoin, as he has since he spearheaded the endeavor to accept it as a payment option.\n\n“The reason we started [accepting bitcoin payments for gift cards] is because I am a bit of a bitcoin fanatic and being the CEO and co-founder is kind of one of those things where you build the company and its DNA around the things that you are passionate about.”\n\nRapid Company Growth Attributed To Bitcoin Acceptance\n\nThe media attention surrounding Gyft’s integration of bitcoin sparked an rapid growth rate for the company, Lingham stated.\n\nAdding that the company “rode out the bitcoin bandwagon for at least a year throughout various hype cycles and so a lot of people adopted bitcoin and they used Gyft … and we became the de-facto standard for bitcoin usage.”\n\nHowever, Lingham does not see bitcoin as a currency, despite his company being on the leading edge of acceptance of bitcoin as a payment method. That, he said, will happen when suppply and demand are balanced and an industrial use-case is found.\n\n“The reason for this is its just not stable and you can’t price things in the currency … right now it’s being used as a medium of exchange, the same way you would use gold,” he told CoinDesk.\n\nRegardless of his current viewpoint, Lingham stongly believes bitcoin’s potential price point will reach $10,000.\n\nIt will get there, it may take five years to get there but it will get there and at that point it will be a very stable asset and the price fluctuation will be very minimal. I think we will get to the point eventually where you can use bitcoin as a currency, we are just nowhere close to that right now.\n\nUsing The Blockchain as a Public Database\n\nAs many of his counterparts, Lingham sees use-cases of block chain technology in the distributed database arena.\n\nThere are so many potential use-cases [for blockchain technology] that I wouldn’t even know where to start. I personally think there are a lot of opportunities in identity, property ownership titles and obviously stock market trading and decentralised stock exchanges.\n\nPresently, Lingham said, companies in the gift card service niche are storing customer data in proprietary databases.\n\n“Why does that have to be the case? Why can’t you store this information publicly in a public ledger or in a public database and so whoever owns that gift card has access to that data and owns that data,” he added.\n\nLingham noted that his option would be cheaper, more secure, and provide a better user experience.\n\nTo achieve this, Gyft is launching Gyft Block – a gift card trading platform which leverages blockchain technology. Gyft Block was created in a partnership with Chain, an API Developer.\n\nLingham concluded that with Gyft Block, the company is showing how a neutral third party technology such as blockchain can be safely used to keep track of “sensitive and financial data”.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Wikipedia.

According to Bitpay Chief Commercial Officer Sonny Singh, the trend among venture capitalist groups in the valley is to invest in bitcoin and related technologies like the blockchain.\n\n“You can see the rapid growth of the VC investments in the bitcoin space,” explained Singh. He mentioned that investments in bitcoin companies has grown thrice this year compared to last year.\n\nGrowth in Bitcoin Companies\n\n“Two years ago, bitcoin wouldn’t have been on that,” said Singh. “It shows how much of a traction bitcoin has gotten in just over the last two years. It’s really come a long way and I imagine in the next two years, it will be much higher actually.”\n\nSingh also pointed out that around a year ago, they had been convincing large companies to accept bitcoin. This time around, these same companies such as Dell and Microsoft are explaining to their customers why bitcoin is important. “We’ve seen the ecosystem change quite dramatically,” concluded Singh.\n\nData from industry analysts has also revealed that bitcoin is taking over financial services and digital fund transfers, such as the money remittance services of Western Union and Xoom. Coindesk and PwC reported that bitcoin investments in 2015 have totaled US$916 million so far, a 262.5% increase compared to last year.\n\nEven established tech companies such as Dell have been reaping the rewards of using bitcoin, as the company reported a positive growth of bitcoin sales over the last year. Online retail giants like TigerDirect has also seen positive consumer feedback and growth in bitcoin sales over the last 18 months.\n\nMoreover, the space continues to show more growth potential, with companies now focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in various aspects of their operations.']"
