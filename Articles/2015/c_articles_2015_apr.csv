04/01/2015,"['New information in the Silk Road case is sending ripples of schadenfreude through the cryptocurrency community as it reacts to a foiled effort by two US Federal Agents to skim thousands of Bitcoin out of Silk Road and Mt. Gox coffers.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the United States Department of Justice on Monday, two federal agents are charged with wire fraud, money laundering and falsifying government documents for stealing Bitcoin while working on the Silk Road investigation.\n\nThe agents were part of a Baltimore-based task force investigating the Silk Road marketplace. Their mission included the task of building a relationship with Ross Ulbricht (aka ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ the accused owner of Silk Road who was found guilty last month). The two agents leveraged their status as federal agents to mislead, pressure, and personally profit from their activities during the investigation – all of it which went unreported or unnoticed to the departments that employed them.\n\nInformation in the criminal complaint revealed that the Baltimore task force gained administrator access to Silk Road after arresting one of its employees. Secret Service Agent Shaun Bridges then logged into the Silk Road admin account that afternoon to personally conduct sizeable thefts from Silk Road accounts.\n\nThis theft was the cornerstone of the alleged “kill for hire” requests that were part of the case against Ulbricht’s. After the BTC went missing, Ulbricht had offered money to kill an employee who he believed stole from the Silk Road. Little did he know that it was Bridges, acting as the employee, who did the siphoning.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that these Bitcoins were moved from Silk Road to Mt. Gox by Shaun Bridges where he could exchange them from BTC to USD, giving him time to set up a LLC and open a bank account so he could send the funds back to the United States.\n\nDuring that same time – the other federal agent charged, Carl Force, reached out to Mark Karpeles of Mt. Gox via Linkedin and asked if he would back Force on a sale of 250 bitcoins. Force said he was a federal agent but was looking for other employment.\n\nDuring this time, Bridges’ funded his bank account with nine wires from Mt. Gox totaling $820,000 in a three month period. After completing these bank transfers, Bridges signed the seizure warrant against Mt. Gox, confiscating $5 million USD shutting down the Bitcoin exchange in the process. The affadavit charged that Mt. Gox was acting as a money services business without a license, unlawfully allowing people to exchange bitcoins to fiat currency – an activity which Shaun Bridges had conducted just days before.\n\nA lovely email from Carl Force after the Mt. Gox seizure mockingly told Karpeles that he should have partnered with him – an offer which was declined by Karpeles a couple days before the shutdown. It’s important to note that Carl Force, a DEA Special Agent for 15 years – was doubly employed during this time as a ‘Compliance Officer’ for a Bitcoin exchange called coinMKT where he personally invested $110,000 USD worth of bitcoin.\n\nIn fact Carl Force used his DEA access to illegally run criminal history checks against users of the exchange and illegally froze one of its individual customer’s accounts containing $297,000 USD worth of digital currency and $37,000 USD in cash. The account in question belonged to a California resident who worked as a self-employed actor – unfortunately, due to a glitch in CoinMKT’s system preventing withdrawals over $10,000 – this account was flagged gaining the attention of Carl Force to take control of the funds even though he lacked a sufficient legal basis on which to do so.\n\nClaiming that the seizure was part of a federal investigation (which was faked), Carl Force then had coinMKT move the bitcoins to his personal account at Bitstamp. Thankfully, Bitstamp became suspicious and froze the account after they noticed Carl Force trying to withdraw $80,000 USD into a personal bank account – while using the TOR (private) browser because he didnt wan’t the “NSA looking over [his] shoulder.”\n\nIt was only after Bitstamp talked to Bridges that Carl Force’s accounts were unfrozen and he was able to move the stolen Bitcoins which were exchanged to USD and transferred to his personal bank account. Carl Force’s made several real estate purchases, transferred some cash to off-shore banking accounts, and paid off his mortgage.\n\nShaun Bridges and Carl Force stole millions of dollars worth of bitcoin and digital currency. The federal agents used a number of bitcoin exchanges, payment processors, and bank accounts in an attempt to move their funds between accounts and identities. Unfortunately for them, they were unfamiliar with how Bitcoin is inherently traceable and transparent with transaction flows. Thankfully, we can thank IRS Special Agent Gambaryan Tigran for piecing this together. In the end, this strange sad saga is one more step on the road to cryptocurrency’s mass adoption and acts mostly as a cautionary tale for those who think they can fool the hackers at their own game.\n\nEditor’s Note: Lisa Cheng is the chief executive of the Vanbex Group, a cryptocurrency consulting firm.', 'The 2015 edition of the St Petersburg Bowl will not be known as the Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl, according to ESPN.\n\nA representative from the TV news source would not comment as to whether the move foretells a sponsorship change for this year\'s event, or if it is currently seeking a new sponsor for the 2015 bowl game. Last year\'s event was sponsored by bitcoin processor BitPay, which inked a three-year deal to brand the college football playoff.\n\nThe spokesperson told CoinDesk:\n\n“The decision to rebrand the event to the St. Petersburg Bowl was a mutual one between both BitPay and ESPN.”\n\nWhile the \'Bitcoin Bowl\' was a ratings hit and a symbolic event for the bitcoin community at large, its effectiveness as a marketing tool was called into question by the mixed merchant reaction to its promotional tactics.\n\nThe comment is a response to strong social media reaction that followed the removal of last year\'s bitcoin-centric imagery from the event\'s website and related social media accounts.\n\nESPN offered no additional comment, while BitPay has been unresponsive to requests for further information.

A look at felons in Florida', 'Czech police have seized a luxury property purchased with bitcoin by a couple previously linked to the hack of drug bazaar Sheep Marketplace.\n\nThe house, reportedly worth around $345,000, was bought in a series of transactions by Tomáš Ji?ikovský and his partner Eva Bartošová. The property was originally registered under Ji?ikovský\'s grandfather, Jan Goliath.\n\nSheep Marketplace shut down in December 2013, following claims hackers had absconded with approximately $5.3m in bitcoin. Users who tracked the stolen funds on the blockchain voiced suspicions that the theft was an inside job. A site named Sheep Market Scam alleging that a further 40,000 BTC was moved to an address previously associated with the site.\n\nAccording to reports, The Ministry of Finance\'s Financial Analytical Unit (FAU) flagged a payment of approximately $35,000 from bitcoin exchange Bitstamp to Bartošová, who was unable to account for the origin of the funds. Further payments to a lawyer and a realtor were also reportedly tracked.\n\nA loosely translated report published by FAU, noted payments to Bitstamp Ltd, which it refers to as \'BL\':\n\n""During the inspection of a bank we caught an international payment on behalf of a newly opened bank account under the name of \'EB\', which was sent by a certain company \'BL\', that runs a virtual currency exchange in the European Union. During the investigation we found that the payment was intended for person \'TJ\', a partner of \'EB\'.""\n\nThe report continued: ""We found that the name \'TJ\' is mentioned in the context of theft of digital currency from the market \'SM\'. In the investigation we detected more payments in hundreds of thousands and millions of Czech crowns that went to the accounts of \'EB\' and \'TJ\', from the company \'BL\', to buy a property and other things.""\n\nThe FAU confirmed that a complaint for suspected money laundering had been filed according to section 216 of the criminal code. CoinDesk has contacted the FAU to determine whether any arrests have been made.\n\nDenial of involvement\n\nAllegations of Ji?ikovský\'s and Bartošová\'s involvement with Sheep Marketplace first surfaced in 2013, with Redditor \'throwme1121\' claiming that the perpetrators were Czech back in November 2013.\n\nThrowme1121\'s allegations were based on another Reddit post by researcher Gwern Branwen and a document he uploaded on Pastebin.\n\nAt the time, the couple released a statement denying any involvement with the illicit marketplace. ""We are web hosting a fan page for the sheepmarketplace.com domain, but no the real marketplace,"" read the translated statement.\n\nCommunity reacts\n\nKarel Kyovsky, owner of General Bytes, a Prague-based bitcoin ATM manufacturer, said the recent media coverage was likely to have a negative impact on the average Czech reader. ""Those who do not know much about bitcoin will think that it serves as a tool for criminals,"" he said, adding:\n\n""As a bitcoin believer, I know that bitcoin is not a tool for criminals. It is a technology that will change our lives in the next 10 years, like the internet did.""\n\nKyovsky agreed with Alena Vranova, director of the Czech startup behind the Trezor bitcoin vault, Satoshi Labs, that educating people to handle their bitcoin securely is of great importance to safeguard against future theft.\n\nImage via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""On the Nasdaq website, Martin Tillier asks, “Could Bitcoin Destroy the Global Banking System?\n\n”Tillier imagines a possible “Kodak moment” for the whole banking industry. In the early days of mobile phones, only a few enthusiasts dared to imagine that camera-equipped phones could ever threaten established camera manufacturers, but Kodak was forced to declare bankruptcy only a few years later, in 2012.Tillier’s answer is that yes, Bitcoin could seriously hurt the banking system. The reason is very simple:“Banks are so used to taking a cut every time money changes hands that they cannot imagine life without that particular revenue stream.\n\n”Transaction fees are only a small part of banks’ revenue, and therefore banks could survive without that particular revenue stream. But they would be seriously annoyed:“[Transaction revenue] is some of the only money that banks make that has zero associated risk and very little associated cost,” notes Tillier. “There is no risk, and hardly any cost, in charging you $30 to receive a wire transfer, especially when the bank takes three days of interest on that money by delaying payment to you. If that revenue is removed or even seriously reduced, it will have to be replaced, meaning that a higher proportion of bank revenue will be coming from increasingly risky loans or trading.\n\n”The unique advantage of the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin is that it permits faster, cheaper, and transparent transactions. Every bitcoin transaction is permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain, which is maintained by Bitcoin users at zero cost to the banks. The fact that we can transfer bitcoin instantly (in a few seconds, or a few minutes waiting for the transaction to be confirmed by the network) to the other side of the planet, at a very low cost, shows that traditional banking fees are obsolete legacy practices that must be abandoned. Innovative Bitcoin “banks” such as Circle (which is not technically a bank, but plays an equivalent role for its clients) are doing just that, and beginning to offer cheap and fast money transfers.“[Bitcoin] may well be a threat to the easy money that banks currently take from you and me, but that doesn’t pose an existential threat to the system,” concludes Tillier. “The banks’ reaction to a reduction in that easy money, on the other hand, could be a different story.\n\n”Of course, the banks won’t give up their easy money without a fight. Barclays’ CEO Antony Jenkins recently discussed the growing concern among financial institutions that faster, cheaper payment systems will start to seduce their consumer and business customers in the coming years.In a recent report titled “Digital Disruption – UK Banking Report,” the British Banking Association argues that Bitcoin is a threat to the banking industry.\n\n“As digital and cryptocurrencies gain traction, the threat to banks' free-income streams will grow,” notes the report. “Banks must invest time and energy in understanding how best to use the technology behind principles like bitcoin, before other players step in to make that decision for them.”Of course, banks can (and do) also lobby to make digital cryptocurrency illegal, but the United Kingdom and other governments recently have expressed open-minded positions in the interest of common good. Meanwhile, forward-looking banks such as German Fidor Bank are integrating Bitcoin with their consumer banking operations.\n\nThe term “threats” frequently occurs in official reports related to the emerging digital economy. In a recent discussion paper, the Australian government mentions bitcoin and digital currencies as potential threats to tax collection.\n\n“New ways of transacting, including cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, were not contemplated when the current tax system was designed,” notes the report. “These developments make determining the appropriate tax outcome for a particular company in a specific country difficult and raise concerns about the ability of companies to relocate profits to minimize their tax.\n\n”Other governments are less scared of Bitcoin as a threat to taxation, probably because they are confident in their ability to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions and trace them back to their originators. In the United States, there have been proposals to gradually introduce tax payments in Bitcoin, which would constitute a quite radical shift from early libertarian perceptions of Bitcoin as a financial privacy tool.\n\nPhoto via stantontcady / CC BY-ND 2.0"", 'Charlie Shrem is in jail.\n\nApparently the Bitcoin millionaire, founder of BitInstant, has every intention to keep working as a Bitcoin entrepreneur from behind bars. According to Upstart Business Journal, he made productive use of his time under house arrest at his mom’s place. Shrem will have limited contact with the outside world and will mostly put it to use continuing to advance Bitcoin for a profit:\n\nBased on Shrem’s time under house arrest, this contact with the outside world could be rather productive. He worked as a consultant for Payza, Decentral.tv and others, helped pilot bitcoin payments at the Holiday Inn, and earned a healthy paycheck while doing so.

Dan Held calls it an “interplay of hardware and software.” Victoria van Eyk, Head of Community Development says,\n\n“We’ve been keeping this under wraps for a while, because it’s quite a controversial project. However, we believe the value of Bitcoin is pushing the envelope in ways that benefit society—and this is one of them.”\n\nSince they launched in November, ChangeTip has added several ways for users to easily top up their tipping accounts, including ACH transfers directly from their bank account to their ChangeTip wallet, and the ability to replenish their balance from other popular bitcoin wallets. Recently, another service called TipUp.me also allows users to use a credit or debit card to purchase bitcoin.\n\nHeld says that they still “wanted to go a step further” toward enabling mainstream adoption.\n\nTo Christian Williams, Head of User Experience, direct bank purchases still produced “too much friction.” He says they wanted to create an “instantaneous way to transfer debt-backed currency into an instant asset.” While they only support iPhones along with conversion of USD with this first version, cases that support other phones and fiat currencies are expected in the future.\n\nhttps://www.changetip.com/scan\n\nChangeTip SCAN for the iPhone is available to pre-order now and costs $199 + tax, and can be purchased with bitcoin.

04/02/2015,"['Say goodbye to the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl.\n\nLast June, the bitcoin payment startup BitPay cut a three-year deal with ESPN to be the title sponsor of the St. Petersburg Bowl, an annual NCAA college football postseason game. The game took place on December 26 in Florida, between North Carolina State University and the University of Central Florida, and there were supposed to be two more years of the game with the ‘Bitcoin Bowl’ branding. But the sponsorship has abruptly ended. The news broke on April 1, but it was not an April Fools’ joke.\n\nYou might have thought that bitcoin—both the peer-to-peer technology and the virtual currency that it supports—would gain valuable exposure to a larger, more mainstream audience by sponsoring a college football game. So: why end the deal?\n\nJulia Patterson, a spokesperson for BitPay, would only say that it was a “mutual decision” between ESPN and BitPay. “I can’t give any more comment right now,” she said. “I think probably in the future we’ll be able to talk about it more, but at the moment, we’re not going to go into it.” She did add that the company has been inundated with calls for comment about the news. ESPN has taken the same route: it told CoinDesk that “the decision to rebrand the event to the St. Petersburg Bowl was a mutual one.”\n\nThe St. Petersburg Bowl is not exactly a golden opportunity for marketing exposure. The game was played on a Friday night, the night after Christmas, between two teams from minor athletic conferences. If BitPay wanted to get its name on a high-profile sports event, this was no slam dunk.\n\nBitPay, which launched in 2011, has appeared to go through problems recently. In January, the company laid off nine employees. It reportedly has small margins on its bitcoin transactions. And it was surprising to many in the community when BitPay spent big money (believed to be in the single-digit millions) for a college football sponsorship. Along with other payment companies in the space, BitPay suffered big losses when the price of bitcoin dropped precipitously last year. Is the company in trouble?\n\nInsiders and obsessives on Reddit’s bitcoin forum are already sounding the alarm, speculating that the dropped sponsorship is a possible death knell. “I believe Bitpay is getting drilled in the bear market worse than Coinbase,” commented one user. “They make barely any money on the transactions… BitPay has got to be bleeding money.”\n\nIt’s possible that both parties truly did agree that the sponsorship was not productive. The deal brought ESPN some light ridicule. When the network announced the news in June, and then when the game aired in December, there was widespread mocking on Twitter and other social media. Today, again, when news of the axed sponsorship came, so did the jokes on Twitter. “Sounds like they’ve been… devalued,” tweeted @AndrewBucholtz. Even CBS Sports, in its news story, couldn’t resist from joking that readers would be “crying” about the dropped deal.\n\nOf course, it’s possible that it’s much simpler than any of this analysis. It’s possible that BitPay evaluated the benefit of the sponsorship, concluded that it wasn’t a smart use of its marketing budget, and acted quickly.', 'Thanks Jennifer.

Or is it the payment system they're developing?\n\nSINGER: Bingo. It's the payment system. It's the blockchain encryption. And there are interesting things. I think bitcoin, or the, really, blockchain encryption that's behind it, has a greater ability to bring more of the world's population out of poverty than anything we've seen in\n\nFORBES: Well, for one thing, it's a cheap payment system.\n\nSINGER: For one thing, it's a cheap payment system. But it's more important than that. It's more important than that. Blockchain cryptography is all about digital transfer of ownership in a completely transparent and public way. Okay, I don't want to go into any of the math and the complexity behind it, but think of what that means.\n\nThat means that I can actually record ownership in public, in a digital means. 50% of the world's population has a mobile phone. I read an estimate this month that in 2020, 90% of the world's population will have mobile phones. That's probably a high estimate, but that's okay.\n\nFORBES: $25, $35 smartphones.\n\nSINGER: We're throwing them away and they can ship them off to emerging markets. But what's powerful about this, now think about Hernando de Soto.\n\nFORBES: Yes.\n\nSINGER: Okay. The Institute for Liberty and Democracy in Peru, I really think Hernando de Soto should win the Nobel prize for the work he's done. I hope he does. But he's going around the world and identified one of the most powerful things to the economy and the creation of wealth. And that is the ownership of property.\n\nFORBES: Which you can then use as collateral.\n\nSINGER: Which you can use as collateral and when you own it, you will develop it. The best thing you can do for the environment is to own it. Because when you own it, you make sure it's sustainable for your future family. And that's powerful. But they don't have the ability to own it. If you live in a shantytown, you operate outside of the legal economy. It's not that you want to operate outside of the legal economy, but you have no ownership of any property.\n\nFORBES: Although in the neighborhood, everyone knows who owns what.\n\nSINGER: And once you introduce blockchain cryptography, guess what they can do? Have a public ledger of ownership and transfer that cannot be denied because it's absolutely transparent. It's absolutely transparent. It is the means through which these individuals can get exactly what Hernando de Soto thinks they best need to bring themselves out of poverty.\n\nIt is so much more profound than that, but at its very basis, it has the ability to give these individuals the right of ownership to property. And that has more than anything else, the ability to bring them out of poverty. And I can't wait. It'll be adopted elsewhere. I mean, blockchain encryption is such a powerful tool. It'll be used by banks, it'll be used by credit card companies, it will become a standard. But what's more interesting is what it can do to poverty around the world to eliminate poverty."", 'I ask blockchain expert and Bitcoin-skeptic Bryce Weiner to interview at his establishment, Groove Coffee, located in northern Kentucky-Cincinnati, USA. We talk about alternative crypto networks, DNMs, and his upcoming innovations. We also get to the bottom of that Twitter ISIS Bitcoin tipping incident. His whitepaper, “Thinking in Blockchains” can be found here.\n\n\n\nBryce and I have an esoteric, and funny, similarity. We mutually disdain Romanian cryptographer Mircea Popescu. This is how we start our conversation. While sipping espresso cubano on the sun-drenched deck, I try and comprehend the immensity of Bryce’s newest plans. Between long drags of American Spirit cigarettes and quick sips from an old-style, glass Coca-Cola, he spends nearly two hours talking.\n\nWe talk about the eight crypto-coin networks he helps maintain. Unobtanium, a SHA-256 “proof of work” coin, is the most popular of those networks. Unobtanium (UNO), according to Coinmarketcap.com, has a market capitalization of $620,000. “It never goes down!” says Bryce, referring to the BTC/UNO exchange rate. “That’s the thing people love about UNO. It never goes down.” Another well-followed project, Razor (trading as RZR), has a market cap of $13,500. In development, is a decentralized darknet market (DNM) using the RZR coin. “I design blockchains to have purpose. I want the open-source, decentralized DNM to succeed so I can use my RZR coins to buy weed,” quips Bryce. He plans to market these coins on his cryptocurrency exchange, Altmarket.com.\n\nBryce tells me he wanted to be a clinical psychologist before he discovered blockchains. “I’ve developed what I call a Bitcoin Circadian Rhythm. I’ve noticed my body has begun aligning itself with the 10-minute block time of the Bitcoin Blockchain.” In the future, he plans to apply for grant money to better develop the theory. Speaking of psychology, he laments to me his misunderstood relationship with Brock Pierce, managing partner at Blockchain Capital and former cinema personality. “I want to move on from this High School mentality we have among Bitcoin circles.” He says that his strong opinions as an anti-Bitcoin personality have actually made the Bitcoin network stronger and more resilient.\n\nI find that Bryce’s Bitcoin skepticism comes from pretty technical understanding of blockchains and their problems with scalability. I do think, however, that he doesn’t fully understand the network effect of Bitcoin. I believe the cryptocurrency has utility, especially as a transactional unit. The broad and decentralized peer to peer network of Bitcoin exchangers, which can’t be quantified using simple market capitalization, is something he never mentions.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation Bryce hands his barista/assistant a handful of single Dollar bills and asks her to fetch another pack of cigs. This marks the turning point when the focus shifts to a new project, EVUE. He tells his EVUE dream of a RIAA-approved blockchain system that will allow users to keep track of digital content and freely transfer it via internet platforms (i.e. Spotify, iTunes, Windows Media). “People will be able to keep their digital content for life,” he says. The project will be a massive undertaking requiring a large seed investment. “Our options are the venture capital community or a controlled crowd-funding,” he hasn’t decided how he will progress.\n\nWe talk about the ISIS incident to end the conversation. February 28th, micropayment service ChangeTip blocked Weiner’s attempt to send $1 to a suspected ISIS account over Twitter. Soon after, he says he voluntarily deleted his Twitter account, re-activating it later. “Twitter was complying with the US Patriot Act to destroy ISIS communication. They were purging the whole system of ISIS accounts.” The incident further cemented his status as an anti-Bitcoin rebel. However, Bryce will tell you reputation never really matters, anyway.', 'Buying your first Bitcoins\n\nDespite the fact that the popularity and worldwide acceptance of Bitcoin is growing with every day, there are quite a few challenges to obtaining it. It might seem that becoming a Bitcoin owner will be easy as pie, and that it must be available through the means we all have gotten used to, such as cash, a credit card or PayPal. In reality, it is much more difficult than that, and involves either cosmic fees or a widely used identity verification procedure. The problem is that Bitcoin is currency, and just like any currency, it requires that third parties do the job of conversion and securing the deals.\n\nIn the article, we will try to show you that it might be easier than you think to buy cryptocurrency and provide you with some basic information on where to spend your coins. For example, did you know you can buy gold with Bitcoin? Well, you can.\n\nWays to buy Bitcoins\n\nThis is always an issue both for new and experienced cryptocurrency users. The posts like ‘How to get Bitcoins’ are never disappearing from the first screens at the most popular Bitcoin-related social media sources like Reddit and BitcoinTalk. These queries are never left without an answer too. While everyone had his or her own take on this matter, we have been aiming to provide the most complete answers ourselves — we have described the most popular ways to become Bitcoin owners by paying for them. You can take a glance at those here and here. In general, crypto users (or people who want to become such) can buy Bitcoins with cash, pay for them with a credit or debit card, use a bank transfer, trade other cryptocurrencies for it, or find payment processors which allow making payments with\n\nBuy Bitcoins with cash\n\nThere are several ways to buy Bitcoins with cash. The first (probably the most old one) is peer-to-peer in person, then peer-to-peer online, through a Bitcoin ATM, and by making a wire transfer. Let us see how it all can be done.\n\nBuy BTC Peer-to-peer\n\nPeer-to-peer purchasing can be worked out through the community or through specialised websites. For example, the biggest Bitcoin forum, BitcoinTalk, offers a section Marketplace where everyone can post an ad and find a person who is ready to make a cash deal through a face-to-face encounter. You should be careful and take all possible measures to eliminate risks of being scammed. For this purpose, there is a reputation system – trust points – which can be gained through fair trade on the forum. Other communities, like r/Bitcoin on Reddit, can be used likewise.\n\nPeople who like to travel do not always convert their money to local currency or use payment cards due to the high commissions. They might just ask the community if anyone would like to exchange their fiat to Bitcoins. Of course, you should keep it in mind that you probably won’t see this person again and, therefore, make sure that you have at least studied their forum profile.\n\nUse the Bitcoin ATMs\n\nAnother convenient option of buying Bitcoins with cash is through one of the Bitcoin ATMs. Sometimes, you can buy with Bitcoin fiat money, but in most cases it works the other way round. You can read about those machines in more detail here. They are, however, not that easy to find and usually only major cities in a limited number of countries have them. For instance, there used to be one in a Berlin-based bar, Room 77, but it was there just for a limited time. The same applies to the ATMs in Istanbul Ataturk Airport.\n\nIf you look at the map of Bitcoin ATMs on CoinDesk, you will see that they are unproportionally concentrated in some parts of the world, mostly in Europe and the US. Thus, the usability of this method is questionable and depends on where you live. For those in, say, Chile, Venezuela, Russia, and most of Africa, this is simply not an option.\n\nUse a local bank\n\nYou should bear in mind that if you have decided to buy Bitcoins on an exchange, this doesn’t necessarily involve having a bank account or completing some tricky verification procedures. On CEX.IO, you can make a cash deposit to purchase BTC without any problem. This is quite simple. First of all, you will need to select “Bank transfer” as a payment option, and then follow the instructions. You will receive a downloadable and printable sheet with bank payment details. Then you will have 5 days to go to any bank in your neighbourhood with cash on hand and make the payment. As soon as you’re done, and the bank processes the money transfer, you will be credited your Bitcoins.\n\nWhere to spend Bitcoins\n\nOnce you have acquired Bitcoin with one of the most proven ways — cash — you might be wondering about what you can buy with Bitcoin (and where). Previously on our blog, we have covered the issue of spending your first Bitcoins or a few of the most basic resources to look into – in case you are searching for brick-and-mortar places to buy with Bitcoins things or services that you are interested in. There are also a number of places offering food to buy with Bitcoin or several places to go out on Bitcoins – for US-based cryptocurrency owners.\n\nBuy gold with Bitcoins\n\nSince there have been comparisons between Bitcoin and other commodities like gold, it is quite inevitable to see emergence of services offering to buy gold with Bitcoin. On websites like Coinabul, one can find a shiny gold bar which is available for purchase with cryptocurrency. At the moment, one ounce costs approximately 5.4 BTC. There is a variety of precious metal chunks you can buy with Bitcoins. On GoldSilverBitcoin, you can not only buy the respective metals, but also sell them for BTC. In this case, however, the price will be much lower.\n\nSo who will buy gold with Bitcoin? First of all, we should remember that in some countries, local currency might be even more unstable than crypto. People might be searching for ways to invest money. Why not invest in Bitcoin or gold, or both, for that matter? Also, it can be a valuable present you can make someone (just don’t forget to tell them that silver and gold are among the things you can buy with Bitcoin).\n\n..Or trade on exchange\n\nIn order to make a successful trade or before attempting one, you should do some research and choose crypto that you can buy with Bitcoins. Whether it is Dash (Darkcoin), DOGE, or Litecoins, make sure you have learned the trading basics and made yourself acquainted with the altcoin price charts. Combine the knowledge base you will find on our blog with your personal experience, and enjoy trading on the CEX.IO platform.', 'International payments cost companies a great deal of money and Bitcoin-related startup Align Commerce wants to change that. According to Marwan Forzley, CEO and Founder of Align Commerce, “businesses spend over $50 billion on wire and foreign exchange fees,” and his startup hopes to change that by using the Bitcoin blockchain as intermediary instead of the current, inefficient legacy systems in place now.\n\nTo do this, Align Commerce has announced the launch of the beta version of its service the Align Commerce Payments Platform, now available in 34 countries.\n\nUsing the platform, customers and businesses will be able to pay in their local fiat currency and businesses can receive in their local currency without having to interact with foreign exchanges.\n\nAs Bitcoin is a global phenomenon that does not stop at borders, Forzley envisions using it as a method for transferring wealth in the same manner that wire transfers do now. The usual transfer of money across borders, according to Forzley, can take up to seven days and can be compounded with complexity and multiple fees.\n\n“The blockchain offers a ready alternative,” says Forzley. “The Align Commerce Payments Platform is the first in the industry to use this global rail to help small and medium-sized businesses quickly collect and receive payments in their local currency while avoiding high wire fees and various hidden fees.”\n\nUsing the technology of the Bitcoin blockchain, Align Commerce claims that it can cut down payment processing time down to as little as one or three business days, down from as many as seven.\n\nA second benefit of using the Bitcoin blockchain is that it brings a sense of transparency to transactions. Current legacy systems use a closed system of multiple banks and each step can be fraught with a lack of communication. With the blockchain, funding, sending, and receiving, all occur on the Bitcoin ledger and can be followed from one address to another predictably by those who know the addresses and transactions.\n\nAs a result of using the Bitcoin blockchain to transfer funds between businesses, Align Commerce can brag lower fees—due to less intermediary steps—higher speeds, and greater transparency.\n\nFor developers, the Align Commerce Payment Platform has released documentation on using its API. The payment platform can integrate with a number of common ecommerce systems such as Ubercart, WordPress ecommerce, Zencart, and others.\n\nThe Align Commerce Payment Platform is currently available for sending and receiving money in Austria, Belgium, China, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Philippines, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and the United States. And businesses can receive payments, but not send them, via the platform in Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\nphoto credit: marfis75 via photopin cc', 'With Bitcoin dominating the cryptocurrency field, it is rather easy to forget about its smaller, less popular counterparts. Neverthless, a number of alternative cryptocurrencies have seen a spike in both market coverage and usage in the last few years. These currencies may not pass Bitcoin in popularity anytime soon, but each has its own advantages. Like bitcoins, most of these currencies are mined by computers solving hard mathematical problems. The “coins” do not exist physically, of course, as the currencies are virtual existing only as computer files.As they are based on peer-to-peer protocols, no one computer controls the currencies, but networks do indeed keep track of all transactions made using these digital currencies.\n\nWithout further ado, here are 10 alternatives to think about before putting your time, effort and money into Bitcoin.\n\nLitecoin\n\nLike bitcoin, Litecoin is another crytography-based digital currency, which has also seen a dramatic rise in value in recent months.\n\nLitecoin, a peer-to-peer opensource digital currency, could be described as an offshoot of bitcoin. In fact, it is based on the bitcoin protocol, but instead of requiring extraordinary computing power to mine effectively, can be mined efficiently using standard computers due to its algorithm originally designed by Dr Colin Percival for the Tarsnap secure online backup service for Linux and other opensource operating systems.\n\nNamecoin\n\nAlso based on bitcoin, namecoin is another opensource offshoot. A cryptocurrency, namecoin also acts as a decentralised DNS – the protocol on the internet that turns human-comprehensible website names such as into addresses understandable by machines. By acting as its own DNS, the currency operates outside the regular internet and therefore outside the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann).\n\nThe currency values and domain names are stored within the blockchain record, which limits the total number of namecoins to 21m, with each coin divisible down to eight decimal places.\n\nPeercoin\n\nAnother variant of the bitcoin-like peer-to-peer currency principle, peercoin promises increased efficiency of mining, improved security and safeguards to avoid abuse by group mining, which has recently been highlighted as a potential flaw with bitcoin.\n\nPeercoin has the fourth-largest market cap among “altcoins” as these alternative digital currencies are known, according to CoinMarketCap.com, which tracks emerging and traded currencies.\n\nPrimecoin\n\nA cryptocurrency like bitcoin, primecoin differs at its core because it uses a totally separate mathematical basis for mining. Instead of relying on bitcoin’s “Hashcash” algorithm, primecoin finds long Cunningham chains – a certain sequence of prime numbers named after the mathematician AJC Cunningham – to build value into the currency.\n\nUnlike bitcoin, primecoin’s mining difficulty increases slightly with each new coin created, scaling more evenly than bitcoin’s bigger shift in mining difficulty every 2016 blocks.\n\nFeathercoin\n\nBased upon litecoin, feathercoin adjusts its mining difficulty more often than litecoin and was announced in April 2013. Unlike some other digital currencies, feathercoin updates regularly to incorporate new features and enhancements, including protections from abuse and forking by group mining.\n\nNovacoin\n\nYet another peer-to-peer digital cryptocurrency, Novacoin differs from most of the other altcoins by integrating protection schemes within the core of the currency, which deters abuse by mining groups.\n\nNovacoin also has a technical cap of 2bn coins, a much larger number than most of the other digital currencies which top out in the millions, rather than billions of coins. The cap could also be increased if it was ever reached, giving novacoin a theoretical dynamic inflation.\n\nInfinitecoin\n\nAnnounced in June 2013, as another litecoin spin-off, infinitecoin differs with more frequent difficulty adjustment rate during mining and the total number of coins that can be created, which is 1142.86 times as many as litecoin.\n\nMegacoin\n\nA bitcoin analogue in its infancy, created within the fourth quarter of 2013, megacoin is limited to 42m total coins and is mined like every other crytocurrency. Each coin worth around $0.50, and its main selling point is its overt branding, something quite a few other digital currencies lack.\n\nQuark coin\n\nAnother altcoin in its infancy, Quark coin takes the security elements of the cryptocurrency very seriously employing nine separate rounds of encryption using six different algorithms.', '0\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañolDue to Argentina’s recurring inflation crisis, capital controls, and overall financial repression, it’s become a staple opinion in bitcoin circles to predict that the country is set for a crypto-currency boom.\n\nActually, Argentina is very far from widespread bitcoin adoption, and it’s likely that most people never used it. However, a lot of Argentineans have heard about bitcoin through the media, and they are perhaps more willing than others in Latin America to try it out.\n\nAs such, it’s worth taking a look at the current situation of Argentina’s bitcoin community and how people use it.\n\nMultiple Uses\n\nArgentina is suffering annual inflation higher than 30 percent, and has in its recent history hyperinflationary episodes that even reached monthly rates of 200 percent (1989). It’s also experienced blocks on bank deposits (2001) and confiscations of the same (2002).\n\nMeanwhile, transfers of money abroad require special permits that the average citizen rarely obtains. Receiving money from outside involves the Central Bank taking a cut of over 30 percent of the sent amount, given that foreign currencies are forcibly exchanged to Argentinean pesos at the official exchange rate, which is 30 percent worse than the going rate for pesos on the street.\n\nThese kinds of experiences, a regular feature in the history of Argentina, have made locals accustomed to unorthodox situations: from saving and exchanging certain goods or services in a different currency to the peso, to buying shares in companies valued in national and foreign stock markets, buying them locally but selling them immediately on foreign markets, “sending” money abroad.\n\nIt’s here that bitcoin has awakened a particular interest among those who are used to struggling with non-traditional financial solutions, storing money outside of the banking system, and realizing exchanges without letting political borders get in the way.\n\nIn this category are freelance workers, programmers, graphic designers, and other small entrepreneurs who need to collect and send money internationally. For these kind of users, bitcoin is an easier option than selling, for example, through Paypal or Skrill, given that bitcoin comes with more buy/sale locations than other payment processors; due to government financial restrictions, it’s not easy to transfer virtual balances into cash.\n\nWhile some services like Neteller now allow people to top up online accounts via bitcoins, for many Argentineans they have to take the reverse route to be able to convert Neteller or Skrill balances (for example via oDesk jobs), to bitcoins, to to able to sell locally with ease. Today, the conversion between these kinds of balances and bitcoin is carried out through services like Saldo.com.ar.\n\nOther local uses include currency remittances and transfers for those who have overseas bank accounts and need to deposit or withdraw from them, using services like Coinbase, Safello, or Bitstamp, among others, with this objective. In general, this is usually for people and their personal savings or small companies; large corporations use other mechanisms that don’t rely on bitcoins for these kinds of operations.\n\nFinally, we have traditional users, independent on the particular economic situation of Argentina. Here, the reality isn’t very different from the rest of the world: purchases are made online of all kinds, and some physical businesses accept bitcoins as a means of payment, but such transactions are still relatively scarce.\n\nGrowing Community\n\nBeyond certain exceptions, it can be said that local bitcoin activity began in April 2011 with a post on gaming forum 3DGames. Gamers, accustomed to having good 3D video equipment, shared their experiences about “mining” bitcoins using their GPUs and exchanging batches of 1,000 bitcoins (almost US$250,000, according to the current exchange rate).\n\nThe majority of these “miners” sold their bitcoins rapidly and only a handful of them today are part of the local bitcoin community. Meanwhile, the website elBitcoin was being created, the only site in Spanish of the era that had information about bitcoin.\n\nTowards the end of 2012, Wences Casares, today the CEO of Xapo, created a meeting via the Meetup platform. From that point onwards a community was formed that organized regular events; the same Meetup group now has more than 1,500 members, one of the five largest in the world linked to bitcoin.\n\nIn 2013, the NGO Bitcoin Argentina was born with the objective of promoting and facilitating the use of bitcoin and related technologies. It led the way with talks in universities, colleges, and governmental institutions.\n\nThe Latin American Bitcoin Conference (laBITconf) of 2013, held in Buenos Aires amid a dramatic surge in the value of bitcoin and organized by Argentineans, attracted hundreds of interested people, and boasted the principal companies and supporters of bitcoin technology. In 2014, the same organizing group collaborated with the Fundación Bitcoin Brasil to bring the conference to Rio de Janeiro, where a huge quantity of Argentineans attended, more than 20 percent of those present.\n\nIn parallel, an ecosystem of bitcoin businesses began to emerge in Argentina. The creation of the Espacio Bitcoin (Bitcoin Center) in 2014, a virtual currency hub located over three floors in a building a handful of blocks from the financial districts of Buenos Aires, is now set to become one of the most vigorous centers of the global bitcoin community.\n\nTranslated by Laurie Blair.

04/03/2015,"[""In light of a sudden “executive order” issued by Barack Obama in America, many Bitcoin redditors surmised that it's now illegal to donate money to people like Edward Snowden.\n\nBut netizens that they are, political boundaries and proclamations mean very little to them. Within just a few hours of the legalese going up at WhiteHouse.gov, a whole swarm of Bitcoin users and miners alike decided to send some extra thanks to Snowden.\n\nThe monetary gratitude turned out to be even larger than the one elicited by the release of the Snowden documentary Citizenfour:\n\nIn less than 24 hours, nearly 200 unique Bitcoin donations – ranging from 25 cents to US$2,141 – poured into 1snowqQP5VmZgU47i5AWwz9fsgHQg94Fa, the “Official Snowden Defense Fund.”\n\nSome went on to dub it the “Obama Effect,” or the result when a political figure attempts to ban something that is generally very popular.

More amazing still is that the leaks haven't stopped – a document detailing the infection of millions of phone SIM cards was leaked to The Intercept less than two months ago.\n\nSnowden may live an isolated and potentially lonely life in Russia, but the blockchain proves that he has no shortage of appreciative supporters in America.

The innovation lab, located in Level39’s high growth space, HighGrowth:42, will explore the role of blockchain technology in financial services.\n\nUBS, a Swiss global financial services company with its headquarters in Basel and Zürich, Switzerland, provides investment banking, asset management and wealth management services for private, corporate, and institutional clients worldwide. Operating in more than 50 countries with about 60,000 employees around the world, UBS is the biggest Swiss bank and is considered as the world’s largest manager of private wealth assets, with more than 2.2 trillion Swiss francs (CHF) in invested assets.\n\nEstablished by Canary Wharf Group plc, Level39 is Europe’s largest technology accelerator space for finance, cyber-securities, retail and future cities technology companies. Six months after launching in March 2013, Level39 opened the High Growth Space: 42 on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square.\n\n“By establishing a dedicated innovation lab at Level 39 we are moving away from a purely in-house innovation strategy, optimizing collaboration opportunities with the growing FinTech business, startup and investor community in an open and transparent way,” said UBS Group CIO Oliver Bussmann. “Our innovation lab at Level39 will provide a unique platform to explore emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and to understand the potential impact for the industry.”\n\n“The UBS team have already established their credentials at Level39 over the last two years through mentoring alongside other leading experts at various accelerator programs,” said Eric Van der Kleij, Head of Level39, Canary Wharf Group. “Oliver Bussmann’s bold public statements and vision about the future of finance show that UBS is an organization that is genuinely determined to transform and thrive in a new world of finance.”\n\nThe blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin can enable participants to share financial transactions on a common public ledger and, therefore, enhance transparency and trust while significantly reducing transaction and processing cost. Therefore, it has the potential to trigger far-reaching changes in banking processes.\n\nBy creating a dedicated lab for financial technology innovation at Level39, UBS will explore new technologies in partnership with others and will be fully involved in the innovation ecosystem.\n\n“It is always good news to see a global bank take a purposeful step outside of its traditional environment to work with – and learn from – the innovators who are helping to transform financial services,” said FinTechCity Co-Founder Julie Lake.\n\nThe Wall Street Journalnotes that, while many in financial services have expressed an interest in the underlying technology of Bitcoin, UBS is one of the first major banks to go public with their plans. Bussmann said in October that the blockchain is the technology with the biggest potential to disrupt financial services and trigger massive simplification of banking processes and cost structure, changing not only the way we do payments but also the whole trading and settlement topic.\n\nThe Wall Street Journalarticle mentions other major banks, such as Barclays and Banco Santander, that are backing or launching initiatives to increase their interactions with the fintech start-up ecosystem as they seek to stay abreast of the rapid changes in technology which threaten their businesses.\n\n“UBS sign” by twicepix / CC BY-SA 2.0', 'A man from Hyannis, Massachusetts has been charged and arrested after attempting to buy a $2,500 firearm from a darknet website using bitcoin.\n\nAccording to US Attorney Carmen Ortiz\'s office, Justin Moreira was arrested after he picked up a package he believed contained a .380 caliber pistol and a silencer, sent by an undercover federal agent, from a local post office.\n\n""Federal agents monitoring the Post office box immediately arrested Moreira after he retrieved the package this morning,"" the 2nd April press release noted.\n\nMoreira was charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\nIt is believed that Moreira engaged the federal agent in a series of online messages during which he looked into purchases of various firearms.\n\nMoreira, a felon convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute in 2013, now faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and a $250,000 fine.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Gox fiasco, but a Singapore-based venture sees a big opportunity in fostering a bitcoin market in Japan.\n\n“When we thought about it, Japan is the third-biggest economy in the world, huge economy, huge market . . . nobody was really tapping that market from a bitcoin perspective” after the fall of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, Mario Gomez Lozada, CEO of Quoine Pte Ltd., said during a recent interview in Tokyo.\n\nThe 42-year-old, originally from El Salvador, launched the bitcoin exchange Quoine last June and said that while it might take a number of years, he is confident he can attract Japanese consumers to Quoine, because it was built based on his experiences and knowledge of traditional banking systems.\n\nHe said that what makes Quoine different from other exchanges is that its management team members, including himself, have worked at global financial institutions like Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, HSBC and UBS.\n\n“We have this significant amount of experience from banking that we can apply to this new area of finance,” said Gomez Lozada, who was chief technology officer of fixed income, currency and commodity technology in Merrill Lynch’s Asian offices and also served as chief information officer at Credit Suisse’s Tokyo branch.\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency launched in 2009 and operated via peer-to-peer networks that are used for services like Skype, which connects users’ computers directly to each other instead of via a main server.\n\nOne advantage of bitcoin is that small amounts can be sent to other people worldwide at any time and almost free of charge.\n\nA core technology of bitcoin is the block chain, a public ledger that has recorded every transaction in the currency since its launch. The chain is maintained by bitcoin users known as “miners.”\n\nMiners use extremely powerful computers checking on whether people are trying to alter the records kept by the block chain and receive bitcoins as a reward for keeping the ledger accurate. Such efforts are dubbed “mining.”\n\nSince the block chain is maintained by users, it can realize a legitimate currency system without any central authority like banks and governments, an innovative aspect for many technology experts.\n\nAs Gomez Lozada became acquainted with bitcoin, he said he began to view it in terms of “the next generation (model) of how people will be doing banking in the future.”\n\nTechnology has drastically changed the industrial landscape over the last decade and more, especially in such areas as photography and the video-rental business, and “finance and banking is one of the last remaining industries,” he said, adding this is why he decided to launch Quoine and run a bitcoin exchange.\n\nBitcoin is known for its high volatility. While 1 bitcoin currently trades for around $250, in November 2013 it peaked at about $1,200.\n\nHe also said that although the block chain technology is powerful and innovative, many bitcoin exchanges do not seem to possess know-how on operating online financial services, a reason he believes Quoine’s technological knowledge and experience can work to its advantage.\n\n“From our technology perspective, the exchanges that existed (before us) were not built with banking processes in mind. They were just put together real quickly,” he said.\n\nGomez Lozada said Quoine is taking measures to protect customers’ bitcoin accounts.\n\nFor instance, the company keeps customers’ bitcoins offline, so that even if hackers break into Quoine’s system, they cannot steal the currency. Also, the firm runs a check of all accounts at least once a day to monitor for any suspicious record that might be the result of manipulation.\n\n“This is pretty much in line with what banks do,” he said.\n\nMt. Gox. reportedly lost its customers’ bitcoins over a long period of time and was not even aware of it, which Gomez Lozada said is unthinkable by today’s high standards of international banking.\n\nAside from top-level security, Gomez Lozada said Quoine offers a variety of trading options via bitcoin. While many bitcoin exchanges usually provide a simple buy-and-sell trade, Quoine offers margin trading, lending systems and other derivatives, he said.\n\nHe said Quoine’s top priority is the Japanese market, where the firm has attracted close to 6,000 clients so far.\n\n“The business that we are doing in Japan is larger than I expected, which was a quite pleasant surprise to us,” he said.\n\nHe added the peak daily volume of transactions in Japan was around 200 bitcoins a day around January, but that figure has now risen to around 780 bitcoins.\n\nQuoine earns revenue from commissions on trades, and Gomez Lozada said the firm will probably start seeing profit within several months at this rate of growth.\n\nQuoine is also in talks with a payment company in Japan to apply a bitcoin payment option to the latter’s roughly 20,000 merchants, which will contribute to spreading bitcoin in Japan, Gomez Lozada said.\n\nOther than Japan, Quoine runs its business in Asian countries including Singapore and Indonesia, he said.', 'Bitcoin’s blockchain technology may have found a new application: cutting the time and cost required by cross-border wire-transfer payments. Align Commerce has launched a public beta test of a system to let either businesses or individuals pay invoices globally, the company announced on Thursday (April 2).\n\nAnd in a sign that Align understands clearly how most businesses feel about new technology, the bitcoin and blockchain pieces are all under the covers. All the sender and receiver deal with is money in their respective currencies.\n\n“Businesses spend over $50 billion on wire and foreign exchange fees, wait up to seven days for transactions to complete, and have no visibility into the process,” Align Commerce CEO Marwan Forzley said in a prepared statement. “The blockchain offers a ready alternative. The Align Commerce Payments Platform is the first in the industry to use this global rail to help small and medium-sized businesses quickly collect and receive payments in their local currency while avoiding high wire fees and various hidden fees.”\n\nThe process is relatively straightforward: The individual or business paying an invoice sets up Align Commerce as the payee for a bank transfer in local currency. Align uses a bitcoin exchange to convert the payment into bitcoins, then transfers the bitcoins to a bitcoin exchange local to the business receiving the payment, where it’s converted to the local currency, which is sent on to Align, which deposits the amount into the recipient’s bank, less a 1.9 percent fee, according to Forbes.\n\nBy comparison, a standard wire transfer involves more paperwork, more time as payments move between correspondent banks communicating through the SWIFT payments-messaging network, and an uncertain cost, because banks on both ends will profit from the foreign-exchange spread as well as charging for the transfer itself. It’s also never clear exactly where in the process a payment is under the conventional system.\n\nAlign’s system allows visibility into the transfer and cuts the time from as much as a week to one to three days, Forzley said. Most of the time is used in transferring funds into and out of banks to feed into the bitcoin rails.\n\n“You can get the funds transferred essentially in real time. That’s one of the key things about this technology — the speed of it is superior,” Forzley told Market Platform Dynamics CEO Karen Webster in an interview last month. “If you look at the payments systems around the world, they are all mainly built as a domestic vehicle. The interesting thing about the blockchain is that there is no concept of domestic payment.”', 'Back in October, CCN reported on the online gaming platform called Gambit, which allows users to bet on versions of Risk, Monopoly, and Battleship with Bitcoin. (Their versions are respectively called World War, Bitnopoly, and Oh Ship! – and there are other games on the platform as well.)\n\nPlayers deposit Bitcoin using an in-house system and then can place bets on the games they’re playing. Bets go into a pot, and the winner takes all minus a house fee. Though for the past few weeks, the site has been taking no rake whatsoever, apparently in a bid to stimulate user sign-ups. CCN was particularly fond of the Bitnopoly game, because we were, in fact, one of the more valuable properties on the board.\n\nDollar Gambling Added\n\nOn March 13th, the site made an exciting announcement – they had added US dollar gaming. Users were able to fund their dollar account using Bitcoin, as well, which was a nice added feature. For withdrawal, the user could withdraw to a debit card or a bank account. The seamless and smooth way these transactions were handled – and the way they integrated Bitcoin – were all but unheard of, especially as far as betting on board games goes.\n\nOne can find a multitude of sites that offer peer-to-peer gambling for money, such as Seals with Clubs, or that offer paid gambling in general. But to find a site that offers peer-to-peer board gaming with the ability to profit by it – that is a difficult task.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nDollar & Bitcoin Gambling Feature Killed\n\nJust two weeks after adding US dollar gaming, on March 30th, the site made a crushing announcement which many players were unhappy with. They would soon stop supporting both Bitcoin and Dollar gaming, and would convert to a for-fun-only gaming site, presumably supported by advertising or something. These are their stated reasons:\n\nIt is costly and difficult to ensure 100% legality in all 50 states for every game we’d like to offer on our platform.\n\nBitcoin ecosystem is still very small. It will be years before there are enough Bitcoin enthusiasts to make Bitcoin betting on skill games a viable business model.\n\nSkill-based betting is a difficult market to operate in. Sharks prey on the fish until the fish no longer want to come back. Sharks never play each other and stalemates ensue.\n\nIt is very difficult to police and prove that a user cheats. As the site grows, so will the cheating.\n\n“Years Before There Are Enough Bitcoin Enthusiasts”\n\nAs you can see in the following image, 5 out of 8 users has explicitly negative views toward this change. One might safely wager that the majority of the players came for the very reason that they could have fun and bet Bitcoin (without traditional gambling) at the same time. Only a small percentage of the site’s existing user base is not a “Bitcoin enthusiast,” and thus it seems the site might be shooting itself in the foot.\n\nIt is sad to see this highly functional gaming site leave the Bitcoin ecosystem and go on to compete with ancient contenders like Yahoo! Games. It does offer games that are difficult to find elsewhere, but will it have a large user base now that it doesn’t have its one redeeming feature, Bitcoin? The site’s owners seem to think so, in that they write in their blog:\n\n“It has become clear that the majority of users on Gambit come to play for fun. Even if they do wager with Bitcoin, it’s in such small quantities that it is no different than playing for fun. […] As soon as we launch these changes, you’ll be happy to hear that we will be doing a massive marketing campaign to let millions of users know about Gambit.”\n\nIt does not mention the reasons that bets are small, but they are pretty simple. One, it’s hard to find others to match a larger bet when one is placed, due to the small size of the site’s user base. And two, there is currently no “provably fair” feature to the site, so users have to trust that everything is working the way it’s meant to, and also that there is no cheating going on. The first problem could be solved by increasing the number of users (doing the marketing campaign without changing anything). The second could be solved by instituting better controls on cheating.\n\nSites come and go. Hopefully, a new site which offers Bitcoin skill-based gaming will rise to fill the void that will be left by Gambit. Certainly there is a demand, and as Gambit themselves state, that demand is growing all the time.\n\nImages by Shutterstock and phm.link.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '“We have a goal to move the conversation about blockchain technology beyond financial tools.” - Peter Kirby, Factom President\n\nFactom is the first usable blockchain technology to solve real-world business problems by providing an unalterable record-keeping system.\n\nBy creating a data layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, Factom’s distributed ledger technology secures millions of real-time records in the blockchain with a single hash using cryptographic isolation. Businesses, governments and any other organization that relies on secure data can use Factom to document their information so that it cannot be modified, deleted or backdated.\n\nFactom’s technology decentralizes record keeping by ensuring that the integrity of stored data remains intact, providing complete transparency, while at the same time maintaining user privacy in an increasingly digital world.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke with Peter Kirby, the president of Factom, who works closely with leaders in financial services, government and law to address the most complex data security issues around the globe. We discuss the company’s in-process crowdsale, the recently held Texas Bitcoin Conference, and how the blockchain-based data layer can not only solve Bitcoin’s scalability issues but also real world business problems by providing an unalterable record keeping system.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Your factoid crowdsale began on March 31. How has that been going and what how will the funds be allocated?\n\nPeter Kirby: The Factoid Software sale has been really exciting. So far, we have sold over US$200,000 in 48 hours. This becomes the endowment for the Factom Foundation, a non-profit organization that focuses on developing the open-source software. 75% of the funds will go directly into development and the remaining funds will go to administrative, legal, and outreach.\n\nCT: You recently took part in the Texas Bitcoin conference in Austin. How did you find the event this year?\n\nPK: Paul Snow, my partner at Factom, runs the conference along with his wonderful wife Linda and a small army of passionate volunteers. The venue this year was the Moody Theater, home of ACL live - right in the heart of downtown Austin. This year there was an emphasis on giving and contributing to good projects, but there was also an eye-opening regulatory panel with an SEC representative and a Texas specialist on money laundering and cartels. They even had a fireside chat with David Johnston and Erik Voorhees.\n\nFactom was the title sponsor of the conference, so we spent most of the time talking about our project and discussing the software sale with potential purchasers.\n\nCT: Factom recently announced some new partnerships with Rivetz and Vaultoro, for example. How do these partner companies fit into Factom’s strategy moving forward?\n\nPK: We have a goal to move the conversation about blockchain technology beyond financial tools. Factom lets you use blockchains for data and a lot of our partnerships are to explore interesting ways to demonstrate this power. For example, Vaultoro has a very transparent system to let gold holders see exactly what\'s going on with their holdings. With Factom, they can build a true third-party audit system to provide an even higher level of transparency and accountability to their customers.\n\nWe\'re also trying to be a good member of the open-source community and contribute to blockchain technology tools. Our partnerships help us explore a next set of best practices to share with the ecosystem.\n\n“Factom, by design, can handle many orders of magnitude more data than Bitcoin - so it\'s built for a different level of scalability, speed, and cost than Bitcoin.”\n\nCT: There is an ongoing debate about bloat issues with the Bitcoin blockchain and increasing the block size limit. How does the Factom data layer on top of the blockchain address this problem?\n\nPK: Blockchain bloat is a big problem and probably one of the key hindrances to adoption by mainstream institutions. I really like Gavin\'s proposal to increase block size and believe that will help tremendously.\n\nFactom takes a slightly different stance. We believe that blockchain technology (like the internet) is made up of layers. The Bitcoin blockchain should provide a value transfer layer (kind of like TCP/IP provides a packet transfer layer) and tools like Factom can handle more complicated data structures that helps us move many transactions off the Bitcoin blockchain and in to a data layer. Factom, by design, can handle many orders of magnitude more data than Bitcoin - so it\'s built for a different level of scalability, speed, and cost than Bitcoin.\n\nCT: Identity theft and social network hacks are becoming increasingly common. Could Factom potentially make Facebook or Twitter more secure when it comes to managing your online identities?\n\nPK: Yes. Paul set out to build an identity and reputation platform on the blockchain and discovered that it was impossible without a general purpose data layer (like Factom). Once you can build a bullet-proof identity ledger on top of Factom, you can imagine validation and verification of your Facebook credentials or Twitter identity that are vastly more secure than the current systems.\n\nIdentity and reputation on the blockchain is a very powerful idea that still requires a lot of heavy lifting, but you\'ll start to see some applications come out that explore it soon.\n\nCT: In your view, how big is the disruptive potential of Factom? Who will benefit the most from this solution and who stands to be disrupted?\n\nPK: Paul Snow wrote ""Honesty is Subversive"" as the introduction of the Factom white paper. The idea that we can build transparent and tamper-proof systems of record is very powerful. Most of the fiscal and political crisis of our lifetime is due to poor record keeping (like the mortgage industry) or a lack of transparency (like the Enron fiasco).\n\n“Most of the fiscal and political crisis of our lifetime is due to poor record keeping or a lack of transparency. […] I believe that real time auditing of government spending will bring a new level of accountability.”\n\nI see lots of big institutions like banks and insurance companies creating transparent systems to better serve their customers. I imagine a tamper-proof voting system will reign in corruption. I believe that real time auditing of government spending will bring a new level of accountability. I\'m excited about the world the blockchain hints at.\n\nCT: Interpol cyber threat researchers have recently identified a threat to the blockchain in virtual transactions which could result in their being embedded with malware or other illegal data. Is malware a potential threat to data on the Factom blockchain data layer?\n\nPK: Factom is designed in a way that you can choose what data you want to hold. So if you ran a Factom node, you could easily prune any illegal data or malware that someone tried to enter (just like you can avoid downloading malware from the internet, but can\'t prevent it from being posted).\n\nEntering data into Factom also has a cost, so there\'s a disincentive to just dump garbage and spam into it. That\'s a big improvement on the way the internet works today.\n\nCT: What are your thoughts on other decentralized data storage approaches like Storj, Maidsafe etc.?\n\nPK: I\'ve had a chance to meet Shawn and Tome at Storj and a few of the Maidsafe guys like Daniel and Nick. Totally wonderful people working on some impressive technology. It fills a different need in the technology stack as Factom, so we\'ve been able to collaborate on projects and share ideas. These are tools that look to replace cloud storage like Dropbox. Factom is designed to be a thin data verification and validation layer.\n\nCT: When and where can we expect to see Factom in action?\n\nPK: You can hop on Github and build on the Alpha version of Factom right now. It\'s been live for several months. At the $Million Hackathon this weekend, a pair of programmers built a true Internet of Things application around some security cameras and used Factom as a back-end. Great way to show off the power of blockchain technology.\n\nBeta version of Factom will go live in May following the software sale.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Does anyone really need digital currencies like bitcoin? Who are they intended for, and what purpose do they really serve?\n\nBanks are focused on growth\n\nAs the recession recedes into a distant memory, banks have begun to shift strategy – moving from containing costs and mitigating risks to focusing again on growth. A recent survey of 100 banks showed that in 2014, bank CIOs believed that the underbanked offered the second-greatest revenue opportunity over the next three years (second only to the “Mass Affluent” segment).\n\nA recent banking report from SWIFT and McKinsey entitled “Putting Growth First” demonstrated how banks could achieve sizeable revenue growth by targeting regions with sizeable underbanked populations.\n\nBanks’ core financial services — payments, loans, insurance, etc. — are under attack from a wave of innovative fintech startups, who are placing downward pressure on banks’ operating margins.\n\nThe underbanked as a source of growth\n\nThe success of the M-Pesa mobile banking initiative operated by Safaricom in Kenya, which helped reduce the percentage of those underbanked in the country from 60 percent to 25 percent, highlights the role that technology can play in serving the underbanked. But the underbanked are critically important to more developed markets, too. A staggering 68 million U.S. citizens do not use a bank. Meanwhile a survey by Goldman Sachs just last week found that 33 percent of American millennials thought that they would not need a bank in five years.\n\nIt’s this alliance of the underbanked, millennials, and “the next billion” to come online over the next 10 years who will drive adoption of mobile payments and digital currencies. If banks do not support them, they risk missing out on a vital source of revenue.\n\nCustomers are now in a position to start building their own financial infrastructure using a basket of companies that they know and trust. It’s incredibly straightforward to download a bitcoin wallet from the App Store or Google Play and start managing your money straight away.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook announced the launch of a mobile payments system through its Messenger app, meaning that financial transactions can now take place in the same app, with zero transaction costs. Snapchat has done something similar with SnapCash.\n\nNext-generation tech\n\nFaced with disintermediation, traditional financial institutions are starting to think about how they can integrate next-generation technologies to serve the underbanked.\n\nNow some fintech startups are offering the ability to load bitcoin on prepaid debit cards, without providing a guaranteed income to get set up. If an underbanked person uses these services with a bitcoin wallet, they then have a way of managing their money without needing a bank account. Their funds can be spent anywhere that cards are accepted.\n\nCustomers gravitate toward services that reduce friction in their lives and shy away from the eye-watering transaction fees typically involved with services such as check cashing. Laborious and expensive transactions suddenly appear unnecessary and out-dated.\n\nA decentralized economy\n\nWith the power firmly back in the people’s hands, banks must update their services to adjust. It will no longer be acceptable to charge large fees for simply cashing paychecks and sending money abroad. By supporting technology solutions such as bitcoin that truly help the underbanked, banks can tap into this vital source of revenue and growth.\n\nBitcoin is maturing into a safe, secure system that offers tangible benefits for the underbanked. No longer a solution looking for a problem, it will be a way for many consumers over the next decade to gain access to financial tools while avoiding large transaction fees and service charges.\n\nFeatured Image: Blablo101/Shutterstock', ""A little more than a week after release of NeuCoin's technical whitepaper, an intense debate been sparked between the proponents of the two main crypto technologies, proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nOnline forums including Bitcointalk, Peercointalk and Reddit, as well as NeuCoin’s own forum, have been playing host to the exchanges, which have drawn in not only lay community members but several of its household names.\n\nOn Reddit, Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik began by fiercely defending Bitcoin from PoS supporters’ allegations that PoW is becoming centralized.\n\n“Bitcoin has many existing stakeholders. If large mining pools misbehave, the network and the existing stakeholders can choose new miners -- and it is within their economic interest to do so. Separation of powers means that stakeholders and miners are two separate classes,” Garzik wrote.\n\nNeuCoin co-creator and co-author of the white paper Dan Kaufman, who initiated the Reddit debate, posted in response:\n\n“Transaction volume could grow by 1,000X to compensate for coinbase awards going the way of the dodo bird. But for right now, the math is the math. Don't believe Bitcoin mining is becoming centralized? Ever heard of Bitfury and KncMiner?”\n\nBitcoin's Garzik further suggested that the Peercoin's use of checkpointing might make it even more centralized than Bitcoin. “Peercoin has been beset with security problems,” he said, “resulting in the need for centralized administration through checkpoints.”\n\nTo this Kaufman commented that checkpoints “won't be necessary in NeuCoin's design” and that the solution it is poised to present is “making a lot of larger holders of Bitcoin uncomfortable.”\n\nMeanwhile on Peercointalk, in an unusual endorsement of a competing coin, senior Peercoin developer Ben Rossi voiced his approval of NeuCoin’s underlying technical foundation.\n\n“The fact that the NeuCoin team has been able to detail the underlying maths that make up proof of stake is important [...]. I personally believe that these documentation deficiencies have retarded the spread of information about the protocol and by association reduced the number of developers who wanted to jump through the hoops to make sense of what was going on greatly.”\n\nAmid the renewed debate on the issue of underlying technology in crypto, CoinTelegraph reached out to NeuCoin co-founder Dan Kaufman for more background on the project and how developers envisage ensuring its success in the long term.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What prompted the creation of the NeuCoin Project and the digital currency? How/when did you and your co-founders get together to launch this initiative?\n\nDan Kaufman: The NeuCoin project started about a year ago. We loved the idea of what Bitcoin could mean for mainstream consumers, but were struck by how techy, intimidating and inaccessible it was. Bitcoins were hard to obtain and had no real applications yet that regular consumers care about. And not surprisingly, even with all the buzz and media attention, Bitcoin had gone nowhere in six years of existence in terms of consumer adoption.\n\n“NeuCoin distribution model rewards all participants who grow its utility and user base, not just miners.”\n\nWe also saw how Bitcoin’s distribution to just miners was hindering its mainstream adoption. Looking at Ripple and, more recently Stellar, we saw there were alternative technologies that would let you use coin distribution as a strategic tool for growth and adoption.\n\nWith our consumer marketing background we knew that for the mainstream to adopt, you’ve got to put consumer experience and usability first. So, we gathered a strong tech team and spent the last year building a digital currency that is first and foremost easy to use, free to try, and actually useful for regular consumers through micropayment platforms with content partners. It is also designed for growth: the NeuCoin distribution model rewards all participants who grow its utility and user base, not just miners.\n\nCT: In the press release about NeuCoin and the initial funding, you were quoted as saying, “Strategic currency distribution is a huge advantage over Bitcoin and other Proof-of-Work coins.” What other advantages do you see NeuCoin offering over other digital currencies? What potential do you see in NeuCoin as becoming widely adopted?\n\nDK: You’re right; NeuCoin’s distribution model is the engine for growth and adoption, really a huge advantage over PoW coins. Here are two other key advantages for NeuCoin:\n\nFirstly, NeuCoin is totally consumer-driven: it is easy to use, free to get started and focused on micropayments, offering consumers something new to do that they haven't been able to do with traditional payment methods.\n\nSecondly, execution: NeuCoin already has micropayment partnerships in place and will be ready to roll out the first pilots soon after the coin launches. We’re a big, strong team with a solid track record of building successful consumer-facing services and have real funding from prominent investors, also from the consumer media and tech world.\n\nCT: What was NeuCoin's approach to attracting investors?\n\nDK: The high Proof-of-Stake awards! Like anyone getting in early on NeuCoin, their coin stake will grow tremendously. But first of all, our investors know us and our track record well. Second, they also come from consumer-driven media and tech, companies like King, Uber, Facebook, Spotify, Hotwire, and have a very consumer-oriented look on any type of project. They were fascinated by the potential of cryptocurrencies, but agreed it has so far been totally inaccessible for mainstream users, and that no one had approached it from a pure consumer experience angle.\n\nLike us, they saw the potential for mainstream adoption, by offering an easy, freemium and actually useful experience. That’s how you get consumers onboard, just like with any other digital consumer product.\n\nCT: According to the NeuCoin website, micropayment platforms will drive consumer adoption. How do you see micropayments as being the path to mainstream adoption?\n\nDK: For any product or service to get adopted by the mainstream it has to be easy and provide some obvious benefit, fill a need, solve a problem, be fun and engaging.\n\nSame thing for digital currency: it has to offer some actual benefit over traditional payment methods, otherwise why would a consumer bother? Being able to make anonymous transactions isn't something most mainstream consumers care about. Buying a computer at dell.com is actually easier with a credit card than Bitcoin, so that’s not it either.\n\nInternational transfers is one area where crypto has huge potential. Micropayments is another, it offers consumers and digital content providers a new experience that hasn’t been viable with traditional payment methods, like being able to pay 5 cents to watch a video, or 20 cents to get rid of all video ads for the day, or 50 cents for a micro subscription, tipping your favorite content creators.\n\nTo get consumers and content providers to try this new experience with as little friction as possible NeuCoin's micropayment platforms will be powered by freemium distribution of NeuCoin to users, who will be able to try premium content for free - a significant advantage over micropayment platforms using Bitcoin. NeuCoin will also give user acquisition bounties to participating content providers for all new users that sign up for free NeuCoin, to keep the circle of adoption going.\n\nCT: Neucoin is supported by three independent non-profit foundations in the Isle of Man, each with its own focus: code, utility, and growth. Tell us more.\n\nDK: NeuCoin’s core development, consumer marketing, and projects to increase the coin’s utility will be handled by three independent non-profit foundations based in the Isle of Man – the Code, Growth and Utility foundations.\n\nThese three foundations also control the allocation of NeuCoin's pre-mine, and are bound to use this resource to maximize the value of NeuCoin. Three separate foundations with distinct functions and resources were created rather than a single one, with the object of making the currency more decentralized. This structure also affords NeuCoin greater flexibility and adaptability to navigate the international regulatory environment for digital currencies that is still evolving.\n\n“All foundations are ultimately controlled by NeuCoin holders (1 NeuCoin = 1 vote), who have the power to hire, fire and set compensation for the foundations’ Council Members [.]”\n\nAlthough the three foundations are independent of each other, they all share the same mission – to maximize the long-term value of NeuCoin.

A formal statement on their association with the group can be found here.\n\nThe latest bitcoin alternative to garner media attention, LEOCoin has so far trumpeted the more than 130,000 merchants that have allegedly signed on to accept it as payment.\n\nThis claim, the headlines assert, suggests that LEOCoin is quickly gathering interest from an international community. However, representatives of the project have for more than a week been unwilling to provide support for these statements.\n\nDespite requests, LEOCoin has not provided a list of merchant partners or a white paper detailing the specifications of its “revolutionary” cryptocurrency. The silence on the matter takes on a new light when examining the history of project founders Dan Anderson and Atif Kamran.\n\nBoth Anderson (sometimes spelled as ""Andersson"") and Kamran were involved in a suspected pyramid scheme, UNAICO Pakistan, an “IT development and consulting business” that was the subject of a formal warning by the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) in 2012.\n\nAn official statement from SECP dated 27th April, 2012 names Dan Andersson as UNAICO’s CEO, an association confirmed by YouTube videos that feature UNAICO branding, advertise opportunities in Pakistan and include appearances by Andersson and Kamran.\n\nSECP executive director Nazir Ahmed Shaheen wrote:\n\n”I have closely observed the business activity of the company and noticed that the activities of the company broadly falls within the definition of \'fraudulent activities\'.”\n\nKamran was further implicated in the business operation by his association with the social community SiteTalk, described as a “sister concern” of UNAICO in the formal complaint.\n\nThe SECP filing goes on to compare the UNAICO system to a pyramid scheme, an investment scheme by which participants are encouraged to enroll new members for monetary rewards. Language on the LEOCoin website suggests a similar system, whereby members are rewarded for “recommending LEOCoin to merchants”.\n\nThe company is also creating its own LEOCoin exchange, where users can trade it for fiat currency, as well as a point-of-sale device. Anderson also suggests that LEO will be used to incentivize the promotion of its other products and services.\n\n""You can participate in LEO, and one of the things we do for people who get involved in representing our products and helping us market our products is we give them awards for hitting certain sales targets,"" Anderson states.\n\nIn an accompanying video, Anderson sums up what he views as the potential of LEOCoin over alternatives, stating:\n\n“If you missed the microwave, if you missed the mobile phone, if you missed e-commerce, if you missed m-commerce, don’t miss LEOCoin.”\n\nLong-running operation\n\nAs alluded to in an introductory video, LEOCoin is just part of the larger Learning Enterprise Organisation (LEO) suite of services and products, of which Andersson is CEO and president and Kamran is general marketing director.\n\nBased in the UK, LEO operates a number of websites for its different operations and projects, including WelcomeToLeo.com, which frames the group as one that is focused on “e-learning, e-tutoring, live seminars and technology products platforms”.\n\n“The gap between rich and poor has never been so large. LEO’s products are positioned right in this gap and fill it for you to become more successful, by learning what successful entrepreneurs know, and manifesting that in tangible terms,” the official website reads.\n\nLEO members are encouraged to earn “bonus points” by signing up new members, which business presentations suggest are then redeemable for luxury items.\n\nThose who rise to the rank of “director” at the company, are then said to be eligible to have £100,000 invested in their business idea.\n\nAn example of LEO\'s commission structure and rewards programs can be found here.\n\nExotic property\n\nA website for the Germany-based LEO Tower AG advertises that LEO members have the ability to purchase pre-shares in exotic properties, awarded based on sales. Here, the website highlights Andersson’s involvement as CEO as well as Kamran’s role on its advisory board.\n\nProperties include LEO Tower, a proposed construction in Dubai; LEO Village, a development in Portugal said to have started development in 2013; and LEO Haciendas, “heavily discounted luxury properties” in Menorca sold at “30% below bank valuations”.\n\nDescribing the project as a series of “themed villages, built around lifestyle”, the goal, according to the company, is to create “an international community of entrepreneurs”.\n\nThe LEO Village website indicates the company aims to support customers with assistance on legal forms, bank transfers and the visa application process to complete the purchase of real estate at “30% below market value”.\n\nLEOCoin’s big debut\n\nThough it garnered the most attention for its recent “UK launch”, LEOCoin seems to have first appeared in Dubai in June 2014 under the auspices of a stealth startup known as “Project X”.\n\nUnlike many cryptocurrencies, which often begin with an innocuous post on Bitcoin Talk LEOCoin had an unusually audacious debut, gathering 400 attendees for its launch at a hotel that video suggests included a particularly raucous party.\n\nDescribed on MyLeoBusiness as the “final piece of the LEO puzzle”, LEOCoin promises anonymity and security that are “nothing short of revolutionary”.\n\n""We studied bitcoin, saw its strengths and weaknesses, and launched LEOCoin on the shoulders of its achievements, while improving on just about every aspect of it,"" Andersson said, before elaborating on the projects value propositions that include “complete anonymity” and “state-of-the-art security”.\n\nDespite its strong marketing, LEOCoin is described on its official GitHub as a “Scrypt-Jane, proof of work” coin, an approach also used by ultracoin and cachecoin. In total, the complainy states, 1bn LEOcoins are set to be mined, with 50m LEO initially set aside for the company.\n\nMurky history\n\nA LinkedIn account for Kamran is particularly light on details, listing only his experience as “global marketing director” of LEO and an education status which lists an “in progress” MBA from Brunel University London.\n\nUnmentioned is Kamran’s involvement as senior director of UNAICO, though YouTube videos from UNAICO and SiteTalk illustrate Kamran’s involvement in the group as well as SiteTalk’s affiliation with UNAICO. Kamran is not named in the SECP filing, though it reveals Dan Andersson is listed as the group’s CEO.\n\nReports by Pakistan Today, however, show Kamran was placed on an Exit Control List (ECL) in Pakistan for his involvement with the firm.\n\nAndersson’s LinkedIn does not include reference to UNAICO, though it advertises his affiliation with Oxford Programme Ltd, a group that acted as the “main UK business host” for UNAICO.\n\nThe SECP warning includes only mention that the company was conducting “training programs tilted ‘Oxford Program (Secret Code)’. Ultimately, the SECP called for the “winding up” of the group due to its concerns.\n\nThe official UNAICO Facebook page indicates that by 1st September, the group had started “the process of liquidation” and that it had closed offices in Islamabad.\n\nSuspicions raised\n\nCommenting on the company’s claims, William Keep, dean of the business school at the College of New Jersey and an expert witness in the prosecution of pyramid schemes indicated that there were some aspects of LEO that were potentially cause for concerns.\n\nStill, while he said no materials suggest LEOCoin has promised specific compensation plans, the company’s statements raise questions about its business model.\n\n“The most bothersome aspects of the LEO program combine messages of: a) almost unlimited opportunity, b) anyone can be successful, c) indirect (and unverifiable) endorsements, d) rewards derived by recruiting others, and e) personal financial freedom within reach,” Keep told CoinDesk.\n\nIn particular, Keep emphasized that LEO and LEOCoin have encouraged a model that “appears to strongly emphasize recruitment”.\n\n“The presence of multi-generation income and the recognition of an upline (and therefore a downline) without many specific in terms of the process raises some concerns,” Keep concluded.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Janssens claims that the foundation is “effectively bankrupt,” which has since then been confirmed on the foundation forum by Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen and—to a slightly lesser extent—Executive Director Patrick Murck.\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation was founded in September 2012 by then Bitcoin lead developer Gavin Andresen, then BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem, then MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles, CoinLab CEO Peter Vessenes, investor Roger Ver, and lawyer Patrick Murck. Although the foundation never officially represented Bitcoin itself, it did intend to standardize, protect and promote the use of Bitcoin.\n\nThe establishment of the Bitcoin Foundation has always been controversial in the Bitcoin sphere, however, as some feared that such an organization could become a centralizing force in the decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem. One of the most severe critics is the Belgian Bitcoin early adopter and millionaire Olivier Janssens, in particular since Brock Pierce was elected to the board of the foundation in May of 2014, and after Janssens visited the Bitcoin Foundation\'s Bitcoin 2014 conference in Amsterdam that same month. Janssens therefore put up a US$100k bounty for a software platform that could replace the Bitcoin Foundation - a price that was won by Mike Hearn and his Lighthouse crowdfunding platform last year.\n\nMore recently, Janssens decided to run for a seat on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation himself, and was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development last month. As such, he gets to attend the meeting of the board, and has now revealed to the Bitcoin community that the Bitcoin Foundation is essentially out of money, stating:\n\n“[The] Bitcoin Foundation is effectively bankrupt. As a result of two years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in November of last year.”\n\nBecause of that, Janssens says, the foundation decided to replace then Executive Director Jon Matonis with Murck, who made the decision to refocus the foundation\'s efforts on core development:\n\n“In extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. That new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause.”\n\nBased on statements made by others involved with the foundation, it seems that Janssens revelations regarding the effective bankruptcy are mostly true.\n\nOn the foundation forum, Andresen - who was a board member of the foundation until last month - acknowledged that the organization has gotten itself in financial trouble. Moreover, Andresen expressed doubt this situation can be resolved easily, stating:\n\n“\'The Foundation will support core development\' vision didn\'t work; I took a couple of weeks off from doing technical work to meet with people capable of funding that vision and it very quickly became clear most \'deep pockets\' don\'t trust that the Foundation would stick to that vision, or aren\'t willing to risk their reputations being closely associated with an organization that had two of its Board members resign in disgrace last year.”\n\nMurck, in turn, nuanced Janssens’ statements somewhat, while expressing his discontent for the manner in which the information was published. Murck said,\n\n“The Foundation is not bankrupt, but a restructuring is needed. Olivier basically jumped in front of our announcements on that and our annual report on the 2014 finances to be released next week, and he spun it very very negative.”\n\nOn Twitter, Murck expressed doubt on the future of the Bitcoin Foundation as a whole:\n\n@jgarzik @BTCFoundation when you have 2 board members openly working against efforts to sustain the org might not be worth the effort — Patrick Murck (@virtuallylaw) April 4, 2015\n\nRegarding the future of the Bitcoin Foundation, Andresen has posted an open request to all members to share their opinions in order to come up with a solution. He wrote,\n\n“I had an idealistic vision of the Foundation being a member-driven organization, but that never happened. Now would be a good time for you, the membership, to make me proud and come together and figure out a vision for the Foundation moving forward. What do you want to do, and how will that get paid for?”\n\nJanssens, meanwhile, proposes some solutions for the lack of funds in his own Reddit-post. Most notably, he promises to create a special trust fund to which he says he will donate several US$100K in order to pay for the salaries of Andresen as well as core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan and some other core developers. Additionally, Janssens pledges to organize a crowdfunding campaign to add to the initial several US$100K, while emphasizing that the core developers, and only the core developers, should have control over the money: “At no point do I want to have any control whatsoever.”\n\nAndresen, in turn, seems open to this suggestion: “I still think the best way to move forward with [core development] funding is some type of not-for-profit legal entity, whether that is Olivier\'s crowdfunded Trust or something else (or both) I don\'t really care.”\n\nConspiracy theories about the @BTCFoundation ""controlling"" #bitcoin core development, this time by a board member: t.co/nfXr7aXoIM — Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) April 4, 2015\n\nAnother of the core developers, Jeff Garzik, tweeted in strong disagreement with this proposed solution, however. He said, “It is a HUGE mistake to create a single trust fund controlled by [the core developers]. That centralizes [development] funding, which is currently more decentralized [because it is] spread across several companies/entities. ” He added that it also “formalizes the notion of core [developers] as a legal entity, rather than a decentralized group as it is now.” Garzik is currently on the payroll of BitPay.\n\nThe weak financial status of the Bitcoin Foundation is somewhat surprising, as the organization owned over US$4.6 million in assets only a year ago. One obvious reason for the loss of funds is the decline in the bitcoin price, as the foundation held about 90% of these assets in bitcoin. On top of that, the foundation indicated spending roughly US$1.8 million a year. Neither of these account for the loss of the full US$4.6 million, however. What happened to the rest of the funds remains unclear for now.\n\nFurther criticism\n\nIn addition to the revelation that the foundation is “effectively bankrupt,” Janssens also expresses some severe criticism on the proceedings at the foundation in his Reddit post. In particular, Janssens denounces the perceived lack of transparency in decision making, and he criticizes the control he believes the foundation has over the process of development, stating:\n\n“The truth is that the Foundation’s plan was to hire even more [core developers and] to start a Bitcoin Standards Body. No organization should have this much control over Bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided.”\n\n1/ A #bitcoin protocol standards effort should be applauded, not derided with fear-mongering. Ask yourself: does IETF rule the Internet? — Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) April 4, 2015\n\nThis criticism was strongly refuted by Garzik on Twitter, however. Garzik said, “A [Bitcoin] protocol standards effort should be applauded, not derided with fear-mongering. Ask yourself: does IETF rule the Internet?” He added, “Anyone who thinks [the foundation] controls bitcoin, or controlled [it] in the past, is grossly uninformed about bitcoin, software [and] the net.”\n\n7/ Anyone who thinks @BTCFoundation controls #bitcoin, or controlled in the past, is grossly uninformed about bitcoin, software & the net. — Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) April 4, 2015\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to both the Bitcoin Foundation and Janssens, but received no response before publication. (Edit: After publication of this article, Janssens has commented in response to Garzik in the comment section below this article.)\n\nThis article was further edited on Sunday to add some clarification and fix minor mistakes.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

According to the report, women currently move 50 percent of the estimated $582 billion global remittances, and they send a greater percentage of their wages than men.\n\nWomen also are the largest group of recipients, receiving over two-thirds of remittances. The flow of money to these women can be a matter of life and death if they have no alternative means of earning a living. The United Nations reports that despite women working two-thirds of the world’s working hours and producing more than 50 percent of the world’s food, women earn only 10 percent of the world’s income and own less than 1 percent of property.\n\nWith the flow of remittance having such a major impact on the lives of so many women, it is fitting during Bitcoin Women’s Week to consider how digital currency may be able to help.\n\nHow can digital currency make a difference?\n\nThe global remittance market is ripe for disruption from a low-cost, frictionless value transfer mechanism such as Bitcoin. The remittance market is plagued by commercial monopolies, outrageous fees and opaque transfer records.\n\nThe World Bank reports that the average cost of sending money through commercial banks is around 12 percent, and the global weighted average cost of sending money through all channels is about 8 percent.\n\nAlternative remittance services can provide lower cost alternatives to commercial banks, but they often rely on risky internal processes such as “netting out.” An example of a netting out process is where a person in Australia (Company A) has an agreement with a person in Cambodia (Company C). The sender in Australia pays Company A and the receiver in Cambodia is paid by Company C. However, no physical transfer of currency takes place between Company A and Company C.\n\nThese informal transfer systems present significant regulatory challenges due to the lack of transparency in the transactions. Effective monitoring of these systems is entirely reliant on the accuracy of the records that both Company A and Company C keep. It is a regulatory double-entry nightmare.\n\nOnline and account-to-account services still make up only around 17 percent to 20 percent of global money transfers. But the adoption of mobile technology will see the digitization of remittances increase rapidly in the near future. With estimates that mobile phone use in Africa alone will increase twentyfold in the next five years, and reports of smartphones retailing for less than $50, a mobile-driven digital currency such as bitcoin could find a comfortable home.\n\nThe Opportunities of Digitizing Payments report says that this mobile finance revolution could have a direct positive impact on women’s economic empowerment. With women unable to access traditional banking services in many countries, the ability to use mobile technology to send and receive funds will facilitate financial inclusion for women.\n\nDigital currency also has the potential to solve both the cost and regulatory issues with remittance. Transfers on distributed ledgers, such as the blockchain, provide a transparent public record of transactions that can be settled for nominal amounts.\n\nTechnology such as Eris Industries’distributed application stack can take this a step further by enabling distributed ledger technology to be employed in an internally fully auditable, yet externally private transfer system.\n\nBitcoin companies such as BitPesa, Rebit.ph and igot.com are actively working on opening remittance corridors and using bitcoin to facilitate the flow of money in a cost-effective and transparent manner. With BitPesa in Africa, Rebit.ph in the Philippines, and igot.com in more than 40 countries, bitcoin is starting to make a splash in the remittance markets.\n\nWith a presence in both the United Arab Emirates and India, igot.com operates a strong remittance corridor between these two countries. In the Philippines, Rebit.ph reports that they had more volume in February 2015 than their entire volume since they launched. The low transfer cost also has resulted in transactions as low as $10USD being made on their platform.\n\nWhat challenges does digital currency face?\n\nA significant challenge for digital currency remittance businesses is the cost of regulatory compliance. As Juan Llanos (contrarian compliance consultant extraordinaire) regularly points out – compliance is more than just having a written policy document. Substantive regulatory compliance requires constant monitoring of transactions and vigilance in the identification and authentication of customers.\n\nRick Day, co-founder of igot.com, reported recently that his company has stopped more than $1.2 million in fraudulent transactions in the last 6 months alone. This hasn’t been an easy process. To reach this level of fraud detection, igot.com has had to introduce extra KYC measures such as Skype verifications, and intensive manual oversight of the transaction monitoring system. Vigilance is resource-intensive and costly.\n\nIn the very near future, technology like Subledger’s Continuous Real-time Auditing project or Coinalytics’ AML risk profiling may increase efficiency and reduce costs. If they do, it will be another way that distributed ledger technology has helped improve the remittance process.\n\nFor the billions of women around the world who rely on remittances, this can only be a good thing.\n\nImage by Jim Holmes-AusAID / CC BY 2.0', 'Bititcoin is an astounding revolution. It’s not like anything that has come before. You could say sending a bank transfer is faster than mailing a cheque, and that’s true. You could even say that 3D printing is a way of moving the manufacturing from source to destination eliminating shipping and so on. And that’s also true. But they don’t come close to Bitcoin. The closest thing that I can come to into terms of explaining what Bitcoin and its revolution represents is would be the invention of the internal combustion engine. In terms of how that changes society as a whole.\n\nBitcoin is a tough thing to understand, but the important thing to understand is that Bitcoin is not just money transfer. That’s very important. That’s a component of it and it’s one of the things that give it great value but Bitcoin is not just money transfer. Bitcoin is an entire programming environment. Bitcoin is a publicly ordered ledger of what has occurred for you, financially, in terms of property, in terms of ownership, in terms of contracts and all these kinds of things can be publicly audited and verified.\n\nBitcoin is immune from attack almost completely. The argument being if you have the computing power to attack the network of Bitcoin, then you would be better off using that power to generate Bitcoins rather than attempting to spoof the network, so it is practically impossible to hack.\n\nIt is completely encrypted; your identity is completely encrypted. You could reveal it if you want, you can be out there with or without an avatar, but the encryption is functionally impossible to break.\n\nAnd what it does most fundamentally is it eliminates labour in financial transactions, and it eliminates labour in conflict resolution. It eliminates labour in things like wills, it eliminates labour in accounting, it eliminates labour in lending, and there is in fact an entire stock market on Bitcoin. It eliminates labour in initial public offering or going public, and it doesn’t just eliminate some of it, it can eliminate most if not all of it.\n\nAnd as you can imagine the financial service sector is completely insane in terms of how big it has become. The financial services sector is between 8-15% of the entire economy in the west. And if you can eliminate a significant proportion of that, say 70-80%, then that means that 8-15% of the world’s economy can go back into the hands of the people. And away from those vertical ice cube tray glass towers called financial institutions. The money can go back to the people. For example why do you put money in the bank? Fundamentally for two reasons, one because it might get stolen and two because there is inflation and if you don’t put your money somewhere it is just going to get eaten away. Put it under your mattress you may as well have a box of termites in there as well chewing away on the paper.\n\nWell you can’t have your money stolen in Bitcoin. You simply can’t. With tiny and reasonable measures of security you can even keep your money completely offline, and it is never exposed to any computers at all. So you simply can’t have your money stolen through Bitcoin.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it never happens, it just means that if you leave your wallet somewhere it’s going to get stolen but there is very simple things you can do to keep it completely encrypted and anonymous. So your money can’t be stolen so why would you put it in the bank? And certainly your Bitcoin money isn’t any safer in a bank. So that is a very important thing as well.\n\nBitcoin cannot be inflationary because the amount of Bitcoins is fixed at a maximum cap of 21 million, and they get progressively harder to make. So it cannot be inflationary which is why the value of Bitcoin is going up. A few years ago Bitcoin was worth close to nothing, and how can you even believe that now they are worth close to $250 USD each. People that don’t know what Bitcoin can do, view it as a bubble. They say it’s from from $2 to $250 in just a few years therefore there has to be a price bubble somewhere.\n\nI can completely understand that perspective but I would say that’s arguable because the true value of what Bitcoin can do in terms of replacing financial services is truly astounding and I argue is the biggest revolution in economic history if a widespread adoption continues. Which I can see happening from the true value of having a one-on-one, and no need for a third party financial institution, having that available to people is such a value that its irresistible. There’s just so much profit to be made from it.\n\nOf course what it will do is release all of the people currently involved in heavy-duty accounting and heavy-duty conflict resolution and financial services and banks and so on. It will release them to get real jobs. Obviously we have a great deal of concern for these poor people in the financed industry who may be threatened with loss of livelihood, naturally with Bitcoin charities can be set up to take care of them and make sure they stay with their Jaguars, and BMW’s and Ferraris that they are accustomed to because we wouldn’t want them to have to downgrade. That would be a great human tragedy of course.\n\nI’m making a pretty big case here and I’m going to go through some details to help you understand that Bitcoin isn’t just upgraded money. It’s not just PayPal without fees. Or bank transfers without fees. It is those things, but it is much, much more than that. And we are talking about a massive revolution.\n\nMoney is everything in terms of power. And people think that having political power, the power to having law courts and military armies and police and so on, that that’s the real power, but that’s not the real power. The real power is always and forever in the money. You cannot wage war without debt and cannot have debt for war without central banking without government control without fiat currency with any linking that is limited.\n\nHaving something that is limited in terms of money is very important otherwise you can just run the photocopier and you basically end up in the Weimar Republic where you need a wheel barrow of money to buy a loaf of bread and it’s probably more cost effective to burn the money for heat than it is to actually spend it on something.\n\nSo the real power in the world is the power of money which is why governments will always try to gain control of money and when you gain control of money you then have to gain control of interest rates, because debt drives up interest rates and thus invalidates the value of borrowing money for governments.\n\nYou get these massive controls over the economy in terms of currency, in terms of interests rates and in terms of debts. If you look at, for example, the promises made by politicians, they’re almost always to do with giving you “something for nothing”. Right? Pretending that you can violate the laws of physics and give people something for nothing, and the only way they can do that is through the control of money.\n\nAnd this is one reason why you’re getting poorer and the rich are getting richer. The rich and the politically connected have control of money and you don’t. And neither do I, if that’s any consolation. But people complain that Bitcoin has a market cap of this or that or more Bitcoins are being created. The Federal Reserve creates as much money in about two hours as there is in four years of Bitcoin history, and they’re only accelerating whereas Bitcoin is decelerating.\n\nThese are just important considerations to have. The choice is not between existing money and some sort of fantasy money that you can just have that is gold backed and physical and interest bearing yet not subjected to whims and creases of incompetence of various administrations.The choice is between some sort of electronic currency and the existing fiat current system, which is rapidly accelerating towards its inevitable mathematical conclusion. Which is not pretty at all.\n\nSo I think it’s really important to spend a few minutes to really understand the capacities and potentials of Bitcoin. Bitcoins and the Bitcoin architecture, not only can replace the entire stock market but it actually has in some incidences, as there are actually stock markets running in the Bitcoin environment, but one small part of it is the transfer of Bitcoins, the Bitcoin architecture. The major part of it is that it’s an entire programming environment, an entire lookup environment. We’ll get into what that means in a few minutes. But it is the biggest revolution in economics in history. Assuming that it is adopted and I would really argue that the future of freedom relies upon it adoption. So please educate yourself on Bitcoin by reading other articles hosted here at Coinbuzz.\n\nBitcoin can replace significant proportions of financial markets. Well what kind of size of markets are we talking about? Financial markets in the United States are the largest in the world. In 2011, finance and insurance represented 8.3% or nearly $1.3 trillion of U.S. gross domestic product. Now this is a rapid growth and it has not coincidentally been considered with the rise of the power of the size of the state.\n\nPart of things that happen, like foreign exchange, vanishes in a Bitcoin environment because there is no such thing as foreign exchange. Credit and debit card processing take half the profits from smaller stores. Unlike credit and debit cards, which you can commit fraud with if you have the right information, Bitcoins cannot be spoofed or impersonated in any way shape or form.\n\nThere are fundamentally no transaction fees for Bitcoin, versus Credit and Debit cards, which take huge percentages from smaller stores, and also from each and every transaction.\n\nThese are just tips of the iceberg, the possibilities are literally, not just virtually, but literally limitless. It has been described as the internet of money but given that it’s not just mainly for porn and fraud, that it is also infinitely more secure than the internet and infinitely more anonymous than the internet. Bitcoin is a complete revolution and a way of bypassing all of these third parties. You could argue there was some necessity for them in the past, but generally they are now considered parasitical to the future and wealth of man kind. This is the way of tunneling out of a labyrinth and maze of financial regulations and complexities, and having a clear and direct, friction-free interaction with each other. If you can replace a significant amount of banking, replace a significant amount of stock markets, replace and eliminate credit card companies, I believe we can literally double our wealth within a few years. Doubling our wealth as a society, that means more for the poor, that means more help for the third world, that means more help for people that need medical care, that means more income for people so if they want to stay home with their kids rather than putting them into bug infested daycare, so much the better.\n\nBitcoin is not so much a revolution in money but a revolution in what is possible for us as a society and a species.\n\nBitcoin is, the future.', 'India is an ideal place for Bitcoin startups. It has the right startup culture, huge market opportunity and a growing economy. Thanks to the growing market opportunities and enthusiastic startup community, we are seeing a lot of emerging Bitcoin companies entering the market.\n\nHere are some of the Indian Bitcoin based startups –\n\nUnoCoin:\n\nUnocoin is one of the leading Bitcoin exchange in India at the moment. Unocoin is based out of Bangalore and Tumkur, is part of CoinMonk Ventures Private Limited. They are referred to as the Coinbase of India. Unocoin offers Bitcoin wallet and exchange services to the Indian customers.\n\nCoinSecure:\n\nCoinSecure is another Bitcoin exchange, with offices in Bangalore and Delhi. CoinSecure is a brainchild of a group of Bitcoin enthusiasts. Apart from being a Bitcoin exchange, it also provides a secure Bitcoin trading platform.\n\nZebPay:\n\nZebpay is one of the recent additions to the list of Indian Bitcoin startups. Zebpay is a simplified mobile Bitcoin wallet that allows peer-to-peer Bitcoin transfer using mobile number. By making Bitcoin transfer as simple as sending an IM on WhatsApp or WeChat, anyone who knows how to use a smartphone can make Bitcoin transactions. Even for Bitcoin enthusiasts, it saves them from using wallet addresses each time they want to make a transaction.\n\nBTCXIndia:\n\nWhile UnoCoin boasts of being the first Bitcoin exchange in India, BTCXIndia claims itself to be the largest Indian Bitcoin exchange. BTCXIndia is a Hyderabad based company that offers wallet, trading and live market update services for the Bitcoin community in the country. BTCXIndia follows a strict AML and KYC norms, on par with financial institutions. It may not go well with proponents of anonymity of Bitcoin transactions, but in the long run, they seem to have gotten all their bases covered for any changes in regulations.', 'With great powers come great responsibilities! These words from the movie Spiderman are also applicable to Bitcoin. The intentions behind development of Bitcoin might have been noble, but you can’t say the same about the people who use it. Bitcoin was developed as a decentralized alternative to fiat currency that revolutionize the way transactions happen between people across geographical boundaries. Bitcoin eliminates the role of a governmental or financial institution in these transactions, reducing costs of transaction, with an obvious increase in speed at which transactions can be completed.\n\nHowever, as always, it didn’t go as intended. Soon after it entered the market, Bitcoin became the favored currency of criminals. Silk Road is one of the websites to make extensive use of Bitcoin and its qualities. Silk Road might not be there anymore, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other similar sites and services in the deep web that are into borderline illegal or completely illegal business activities.\n\nBitcoin does have a positive ring to it. Take a look at the way Bitcoin based services are now providing access to financial services to the unbanked in developing countries, they are enabling foreign remittance at a fraction of cost charged by conventional money transfer services etc. Bitcoin is on its way, rebuilding its credibility while gaining worldwide adoption. As you grow comfortable with Bitcoin, there is a new set of problems emerging on the horizon. They are Bitcoin scams, something you have to be aware of, to prevent yourself from becoming a victim.\n\nSome shocking statistics for you:\n\nSince 2011, over 13,000 people fell victim to various Bitcoin scams.\n\nThere were 42 Bitcoin scams that took their money/Bitcoins\n\nOver $11 million worth of funds were cheated out of these victims\n\nMost lucrative categories of Bitcoin scams include wallet scams, exchanges, mining and high yield investment /Ponzi scams.\n\nSome of the Bitcoin scams in recent days include exchange scams like where the exchange claims to buy Bitcoins for a premium (10% or more above the market value). The customers are paid the promised amounts during the initial small transactions, gaining their trust. Once the customer decides to sell larger amount of Bitcoins, he won’t receive the proceeds for those sales, leaving him without money and Bitcoin.', 'The cross-border remittance market is a booming industry – currently valued at $24 trillion globally – and Align Commerce (AC) wants a slice of the pie.\n\nAlign Commerce has announced the first iteration of its payment platform which is based on decentralized ledger (blockchain) technology. The San Francisco startup was founded in 2014 by Marwan Forzley and Aldo Carrascoso. Forzley is a veteran of the online payment industry, who previously held a managerial position at Western Union and founded his own payment processing company (eBillme), which was later acquired by WU in 2011.\n\nInternational payment networks such as SWIFT that currently facilitate currency transfers across the globe are very outdated, slow and opaque. Align believes it can offer a much more rapid and transparent solution for moving fiat currency around the world. AC’s platform uses Bitcoin’s blockchain to transfer value from one customer to another. Both sender and receiver are paid in fiat currency. International wire transfers can take up to several days to complete. On the other hand, transactions on the AC platform take only several hours. Not only is AC’s platform faster than traditional payment systems, but it is cheaper as well. Transactions that take place on the blockchain are publicly viewable, whereas wire transfers are not. When a business sends an international wire, there is currently no way to accurately estimate how long the transfer will take. This kind of uncertainty creates additional burdens on businesses that operate on tight deadlines. Currently, Align Commerce charges a 1.9% fee on foreign currency exchanges that is only levied on the party that is doing the conversion.\n\nThe Align Commerce platform allows users the ability to view the progress of their international transaction in real-time. This kind of transparency is not possible with the current international payment infrastructure. The AC platform is currently in beta, and only businesses from a select group of 22 countries are eligible to participate (United States, Spain, Austria, Belgium, China, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Philippines, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia).\n\nBitcoin companies are currently not regulated yet in the US. This loose regulatory environment provides a very cost-effective environment for new startups. Established remittance services such as Western Union have sizeable regulatory and compliance costs that are passed on to consumers in the form of higher fees. Blockchain-based payment systems such as the one provided by Align have the potential to greatly disrupt the established cross-border payment networks such as WU and SWIFT.\n\nImage Source: https://aligncommerce.com/', 'The issues at Paybase, Paycoin and GAW Miners that have festered over the past month have now finally come to a head. Paybase will be ceasing operations on April 30th, 2015, in accordance with a SEC and DOJ investigation into the actions and business practices of one Josh Garza.\n\nPaybase red flags surfaced weeks ago\n\nAs we reported here at CCN on March 23rd, Twitter and Reddit were ablaze with angry Paybase users unable to make withdrawals for several days. Paybase started to experience trading issues in January when the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation (see the GAW Miners Official SEC Subpoena here). This led to accusations that Paybase and GAW Miners were executing “fraudulent conduct in the sales of securities” concerning the sale of their Paycoin digital currency. Now, Garza has also been contacted by Department of Justice representatives regarding Garza’s GAW Miners operation, according to sources contacting Vice’s Motherboard.\n\nWe attempted to contact Garza via Facebook, Twitter, and a phone call on the 23rd for Mr. Garza’s side of the story, before running our piece, to no avail.\n\nPaybase account holders were greeted with this ominous message on their dashboard upon logging into their accounts this week, provided by Paybase user TradesAce:\n\nTo reflect Paybase’s checkered past, some users seem able to retrieve their funds, while some are not, and the clock is ticking before the forfeiture deadline.\n\n“We found we could do more for the currency by working with other companies and having them merge Paycoin into their forums,” CEO Josh Garza told Vice’s Motherboard when asked why the company shut down. “We never intended Paycoin to become its own world. We realize now it became that.”\n\nWhile this clearly ties in with the withdrawal issues over the last few weeks, Garza remains defiant that it’s apples and oranges. Fortunately, he has his reputation to fall back on. An enterprising user on GetHashing created a comprehensive list of the promises made by Josh Garza that were never fulfilled. (See list here.)\n\n“We are still here,” he told Motherboard. “Most scams involve an exit. You don’t rob a bank and sit around to count your money while the alarm is going off. We are here because we want to make it happen.”\n\nAlso read: Paybase stops Withdrawals; Josh Garza Disappears\n\nFortunately for users, Garza seems to see a light at the end of this tunnel for all that were affected by this situation. He has found a solution. He recommends users transfer their funds to Mineral, a Hong Kong-based digital currency platform. He states that he, not GAW, has anything to do with Mineral, but that is in question. BitcoinX, a Bitcoin exchange review site, says that GAW acquired the exchange Coin-Swap, and Mineral has the same code base as Coin-Swap does.\n\nSo another Bitcoin exchange has gone up in flames, with this one attracting direct government intervention. This is nothing but more bad publicity for the Bitcoin community, and we need to generate some form of oversight for exchanges, as I’ve written about before. They have too much access to new users and fiduciary responsibilities to be allowed to run amuck. Exchanges need to be rated, insured, and invest in their own consumer safeguards, as banks do.\n\nFor those who would still like to use Paycoin, it is seemingly unaffected by these proceedings to this point and is still traded on major exchanges as of this writing. Maybe that’s what he meant when he said “We are still here.”\n\nHopefully, all parties affected by Paybase’s practices can regain their funds without any further delay or misinformation.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\nWould you still use Paycoin?

04/05/2015,"['Bitcoin is a virtual currency that uses cryptographic encryption system to facilitate secure transfers and storage. Unlike a fiat currency, bitcoin is not printed by a central back, nor is it backed by any. Bitcoins are generated by what is called mining—a process wherein high-powered computers, on a distributed network, use an open source mathematical formula to produce bitcoins. It takes real high-tech hardware and hours or even days to mine bitcoins. One can either mine bitcoins or buy them from someone by paying cash, using a credit card, or even a PayPal account. Bitcoins can be used like a fiat world currency to buy goods and services.\n\nBitcoin is now listed on exchanges and has been paired with leading world currencies such as the US dollar and the euro. The US Federal Reserve acknowledged the growing importance of bitcoin when it announced that bitcoin-related transactions and investments cannot be deemed illegal. At the start bitcoin\'s attractiveness was attributed partly to the fact that it wasn\'t regulated and could be used in transactions to avoid tax obligations. The virtual nature of bitcoin and its universality also make it harder to keep track of in cross-country transactions. In addition, government authorities around the world soon realized that bitcoin attracted black marketers who could make illegal deals. Naturally, it was impossible for bitcoin to escape the tax authorities\' radars for long.\n\nAround the world, tax authorities have tried to bring forth regulations on bitcoins. The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and its counterparts from other countries are mostly on the same page when it comes to treatment of bitcoins. The IRS said that the bitcoin should be treated as an asset or an intangible property and not a currency, as it is not issued by central bank of a country. Bitcoin\'s treatment as an asset makes the tax implication clear.\n\nThe IRS has made it mandatory to report bitcoin transactions of all kinds, no matter how small in value. Thus, every US taxpayer is required to keep a record of all buying, selling of, investing in, or using bitcoins to pay for goods or services (which the IRS considers bartering). Because bitcoins are being treated as assets, if you use bitcoins for simple transactions such as buying groceries at a supermarket you will incur a capital gains tax (either long-term or short-term depending on how long you have been holding the bitcoins). When it comes to bitcoins the following are different transactions that will lead to taxes:\n\nSelling bitcoins, mined personally, to a third party.\n\nSelling bitcoins, bought from someone, to a third party.\n\nUsing bitcoins, which one may have mined, to buy goods or services.\n\nUsing bitcoins, bought from someone, to buy goods or services.\n\nScenarios one and three entail mining bitcoins, using personal resources, and selling them to someone for cash or equivalent value in goods and services. The value received from giving up the bitcoins is taxed as personal or business income after deducting any expenses incurred in the process of mining. Such expenses may include the cost electricity or the computer hardware used in the mining of bitcoins. Thus, if one is able to mine 10 bitcoins and sell them for $250 each. You have to report the $2500 as taxable income before any deductible expenses.\n\nScenarios two and four are more like investments in an asset. Let’s say bitcoins were bought for $200 each, and one bitcoin was given up in exchange of $300 or equivalent value in goods. The investor has gained $100 on one bitcoin over the holding period and will attract capital gains tax (long-term if held for more than one year, otherwise short-term) on $100 earned by selling/exchanging the bitcoin.\n\nIf bitcoins are held for a period of less than a year before selling or exchanging, a short-term capital gains tax is applied, which is equal to the ordinary income tax rate for the individual. However, if the bitcoins were held for more than a year, long-term capital gains tax rates are applied. In the US, long-term capital gains tax rates are 0% for people in 10%-15% ordinary income tax rate bracket, 15% for people in the 25%-35% tax bracket, and 20% for those in the 39.6% tax bracket. Thus, individuals pay taxes at a rate lower than the ordinary income tax rate if they have held the bitcoins for more than a year. However, this also limits the tax deductions on long-term capital losses one can claim. Capital losses are limited to total capital gains made in the year plus up to $3000 of ordinary income.\n\nHowever, taxation on bitcoins and its reporting is not as simple as it seems. For starters, it is difficult to determine the fair value of the bitcoin on purchase and sale transactions. Bitcoins are very volatile and there are huge swings in prices in a single trading day. The IRS encourages consistency in your reporting; if you use the day\'s high price for purchases, you should use the same for sales as well. Also, frequent traders and investors could use ""first in, first out"" (FIFO) or ""last in, first out"" (LIFO) accounting techniques to reduce tax obligations. (Refer to the Bitcoin Tax Guide for a detailed explanation of issues in Bitcoin Taxation and reporting.)', 'Some of the U.S.’s biggest proprietary traders and investors are testing the waters for a bigger move into bitcoin, giving a potential boost to the fledgling virtual-currency industry.\n\nWhile still cautious of becoming exposed to “cryptocurrencies,” some of the firms, which trade with their own money on their own behalf, say they see potential for big profits in trading bitcoin as more investors enter the market and financial-services...', ""For all the ecosystem's advancements, buying bitcoin with cash is still a slow process, one some argue has been traditionally underserved by industry startups.\n\nBitQuick, a peer-to-peer cash-for-bitcoin startup, however, is looking to reinvigorate this dormant sector. By offering some basic bitcoin protections, BitQuick aims to serve the underbanked market while positioning itself as more secure and convenient than competitors.\n\nThe idea is to eschew the hassles of in-person cash-for-bitcoin transactions, which on other services could entail the inherent risk of meeting an unknown person for monetary exchange.\n\nBitQuick CEO Jad Mubaslat believes BitQuick can position itself to capture a segment of the market that is largely ignored by industry heavyweights, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“For the buyer, you don't have to be banked. If you don't have a bank account, you can’t do the things Circle and Coinbase require.”\n\nHow it works\n\nUsing BitQuick is relatively simple: sellers list their prices on the marketplace, where the company says bitcoin sales go for a 5% premium, and wait for a matching buyer.\n\nOnce a match is made, the seller places the buyer's bitcoin into a multi-signature escrow wallet.\n\nThe buyer then must go deposit cash using a provided account number into a local bank location such as a Bank of America branch.\n\nWithin three hours, the buyer’s bitcoin is released from the seller’s escrow account, and the transaction is complete.\n\nIn the past, this type of process usually meant trading on sites like the LocalBitcoins marketplace, which has sometimes been criticized for its lack of consumer protections.\n\nUsing Localbitcoins also relies on buyers and sellers communicating, working out terms and managing payment all on their own, another weakness BitQuick aims to address.\n\nMubaslat said BitQuick customers are simply looking for a quick buying or selling process, noting: “Mainly [BitQuick users are] people speculating. People who don’t want to wait to get bitcoin in 3 – 5 days.”\n\nProtecting users\n\nBitQuick has a number of measures in place that bitcoin marketplace competitors like LocalBitcoins don’t possess.\n\nFor example, in order to ensure both sides of the transaction are protected, BitQuick utilizes BitGo’s multi-sig wallet technology, which is insured up to $250,000.\n\nThose companies require users to link a bank account or credit card online in order to purchase bitcoin whereas with BitQuick, a buyer only needs cash. In addition, BitQuick asks for information at predefined limits – the platform currently requires users who make a transactions larger than $400 to scan US-issued identification.\n\nMubaslat says LocalBitcoins does almost 2,500 in BTC ($630,000 at press time) in volume every 24 hours on the US market.\n\nFuture plans\n\nSince BitQuick started in Boost VC's bitcoin accelerator earlier this year, the company has seen promising transaction volume growth.\n\nAt the beginning of its time at Boost, the company was conducting $22,000 in transactions per week. Now, BitQuick is up to $85,000 in seven-day volume, with over $3m in total bitcoin transactions processed.\n\nIn addition to looking at other payment options for customers, BitQuick also plans to expand into new markets.\n\nMubaslat said in the interview:\n\n“We want to gain a stronghold in the US, then transfer that perfected model we get over to India, Taiwan. Whichever market looks best to expand to first.”\n\nBitQuick is available to US-only bitcoin buyers and sellers at this time.\n\nImages via Daniel Cawrey for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The textbook definition in your dictionary may even give credence to money being “stamped by public authority”. That’s interesting, given the fact that before there were governments creating paper currency people did exchange beads for feathers, or milk for eggs. There was barter, as currency, and Gold was real money for its ability to hold value since the dawn of time.\n\nCurrency is man-made to remove Gold as an independent, natural medium of exchange, to great effect. It takes power from the people and passes it to government in the form of “currency”. Money pre-dates government-created currency throughout the history of man, and their central banking system. If man only existed in the last three hundred years, currency as money would be fairly accurate, but overall, given definitions are incomplete. Knowing the difference between currency and money is important to your future, as the global economy becomes more and more unstable under a mountain of fiat-induced debt.\n\nMoney and currency are similar, but not the same\n\nBoth money and currency share many properties: They are both units of account (are numbered in value), a medium of accepted exchange and portable. They are both divisible (into smaller units of measure), durable (won’t physically turn to dust after a couple of days) and fungible (the value of the unit is the same for you as it is for me; has similar value here or there). What makes money different is it is also a store of value, meaning it will hold value, or grow, over a long period. Can you put it in a bank, safe deposit box, or under a mattress, save it, and it will retain its monetary value over time? Some currencies are better monies than others.\n\nThe Difference between Currency and Money\n\nMany don’t understand the difference between currency and money, and which is which. For the sake of familiarity, let us use the U.S. Dollar, the world’s global reserve currency, the creme-de-la-creme, as an example. Is it currency and money, or just a currency? It is portable, fungible, durable, a unit of account, a medium of exchange and divisible into smaller units. Is it a store of value?\n\nYour government, particularly in the U.S., will use a national scale to show an annual inflation rate called a CPI (Consumer Price Index) to reflect the value of of money versus various goods and services. In the U.S., the government has a vested interest in keeping the rate of inflation at around 2%. Any fiat currency is built on trust in the currency since it isn’t actually backed by anything of intrinsic value. The problem with the government’s numbers is they tend to be fudged to reflect the desired result. If beef is going up in price at 20% a year, which it has done very recently, it is replaced in the CPI with something else that will get the numbers desired. Suffice to say, if your look at the factors that make up CPI or the inflation rate, the goods and services used has changed dramatically over the last generation. This has been to keep the 2% story alive and well. (Just don’t look behind the curtain too much.)\n\nAlso read: When the Dollar Collapses, which is Better Money, Gold or Bitcoin?\n\nPlus, you have the government on the hook for cost-of-living increases in many entitlement programs. And with more and more people dependent on the government, and the government over $18,000,000,000,000 in debt, showing the cost-of-living is stable helps the government immensely. Whether it is the truth or not is another story. Perianne Boring did a great article on this subject for Forbes last year if you want more detail on this topic. It explains how actual inflation, as of last year, was closer to 5% than 2%. A pretty big margin for error, I’d say. If you avoid the establishment narrative and do your own due diligence, it’s amazing what you can find out about how the economic world really turns.\n\nSo you can make a weak argument that Dollars are a kind of money but are just very “bad actors” as money unless you like losing value, consistently. The point is dollars are not an effective store of value because they lose value every year. Since the privately-owned and operated Federal Reserve took over national currency production in 1913, the U.S. Dollar has lost approximately 97% of its value. Many economic experts believe that it will continue doing what it has been doing for over a century, declining, until it reaches its true value of zero. Inflation means your dollar loses value every year, so how can it be a store of value? It cannot.\n\nBitcoin, or gold, in contrast, can be considered money in its truest definition. Bitcoin’s market value, in US Dollars, was about a five cents five years ago and is currently just under $250 USD. Critics love to bring up the peak of $1100 in November of 2013, but that was obviously a bubble created by Mt. Gox “Willy Bots” and China’s ability to buy Bitcoin before government intervention. Now that the market has corrected itself, Bitcoin has returned to its original trajectory it would’ve had if Mt. Gox hadn’t occurred. Its current value is well ahead of its value in October of 2013. The point is Bitcoin is anti-inflationary and is designed to be a store of value. It cannot be inflated to destroy its future value to pay for wars or debt. It is not debt-based, nor government controlled by a private subcontractor. It is governed by mathematic algorithms, and you know how many bitcoins there will be now and decades into the future.\n\nGold also has seen plenty of bubbles and market manipulation. It has been as high as $1900 USD or as low as under one thousand dollars over the last few years. Bitcoin certainly didn’t invent market bubbles and manipulation. Gold has been seen as money for thousands of years. The only real problem is making it divisible. It is somewhat difficult to mine and create coins and use them in the general exchange of goods and services. One nugget of gold is not worth the same as another nugget of Gold. You can make them all divisible and fungible, but it takes a government or a private company to do that. Gold is generally not circulated as money but held for overall investment value, and it has value as a useful metal in industrial capacities.\n\nNo currency or money has “intrinsic value”. We all give these things value or assign things value, based on our belief that we can exchange them now and in the future. Many have deep questions about how long Bitcoin will be around, as well as the U.S. Dollar. You may not want to invest, long-term, in currencies as much as you should in money. Money always beats currency over time, because of money’s definition as a store of value over time. Just look at Gold versus every paper currency that’s ever existed. Gold has remained valuable for thousands of years running. Gold is money; it’s just not very good at being money. Gold is a great investment, past, present, and in the future. Paper currencies of human history, not so much. Paper currencies have a very poor track record of lasting over time. The Dollar has been no different than any other fiat currency. The U.S. Military has just been able to “stretch the soup”, if you will. Nothing last forever in fiat currency.\n\nBitcoin has been declared dead over 50 times by the mainstream media, yet it has shown to be a great store of value if volatile. It is volatile while growing in relative value; upwardly volatile. Paper currencies, like the dollar, have shown volatility on a downward spiral over time. Just something you should think about.\n\nIf you haven’t already, Mike Maloney does a great job of going into detail about these key differences in this video, “The Hidden Secrets of Money”, Part one of a four-part series. Watching and subscribing to him would be a wise move to further your financial education, and understand where this all may lead, and where Bitcoin may fit into your future.\n\nWhich direction are your financial investments going?\n\nDo you need more money, or are you happy with the state of your currency?

The association, which goes by the name Verenigde Bitcoinbedrijven Nederland (Associated Bitcoin Companies of the Netherlands or VBNL) was formally established in December of 2014, and plans to increase its presence this year.\n\nAlthough several of the associated companies had been informally sharing some mutually beneficial insights since 2013, the initiative to formalize this collaboration and establish the VBNL was taken in 2014. The main reason for the delay was the high level of fraud experienced by Dutch Bitcoin brokerages, as fraudsters would often abuse the Dutch payments system iDEAL to trick their victims into buying them Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the shared interests comes when dealing with government institutions or banks. The association will also seek to install a membership quality standard, through which it hopes to manage a level of self-regulation in order to guarantee a high standard for the Dutch Bitcoin industry.\n\n“By forming this association, its members hope to learn from one another, hence further strengthening the Bitcoin industry in the Netherlands as a whole,” Jouke Hofman, CEO of bitcoin brokerage Bitonic and one of the initiators of the VBNL, told CoinTelegraph. Another initiator, Anycoin Direct CEO Lennert Vlemmings, added:\n\n“On a business level, most of us compete with each other of course. But at the same time we are all facing very similar problems, which could potentially slow down or perhaps even damage the adoption of bitcoin in the Netherlands. That is obviously bad for all of us all, so it made sense for us to establish the VBNL.”\n\nCurrently, the VBNL consists of seven brokerages, namely Anycoin Direct, Bitmymoney, Bitonic, BTC Direct, Coinvert, Happycoins and Litebit. A notable exemption from this list is bitcoin exchange CleverCoin, while several other Dutch companies are as of yet missing as well.\n\n-- Bitonic CEO Jouke Hofman and Anycoin Direct CEO Lennert Vlemmings\n\n“This is mainly because we started out as a cooperative to counter some very specific forms of fraud,” Hofman explained.\n\n“As bitcoin brokerages, all of us use similar payment tools, and as such we often suffered from the exact same types of malice. But it's certainly possible that more Dutch Bitcoin companies will join the association in the near future, especially as we increase our presence and broaden our goals.”\n\nA somewhat noteworthy aspect of the VBNL is that it is a whole new organization, and as such circumvents existing alternatives, such as the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation and the Bitcoin embassies in Amsterdam. This is particularly notable because the VBNL was launched shortly after Hofman himself had stepped down as a board member from the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation in September 2014. Both Hofman and Vlemmings emphasized that the two events are entirely unrelated, however.\n\n“I believe there is room for both a Dutch Bitcoin Foundation, as well as the VBNL, as they serve different purposes,” Vlemmings said. “While the foundation aims to be a representative body for the whole of Bitcoin and all of its users in the Netherlands, we are specifically geared towards Dutch Bitcoin companies.”\n\nSpecifally referring to his stepping down from the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation, and the discord within the Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam, Hofman concluded: “The VBNL had been in the works before any of that happened. The timing is purely a coincidence.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Saying that he felt it was his duty to divulge certain facts about the organization, he detailed his experience working as a board member.\n\nTransparency Not A Priority\n\n“I was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development,” Janssens says early in his post. Throughout the post, he explains how the organization has done its best to hide its inner-workings and ineffectively manage its resources.\n\nWhen I joined on my first Board meeting, Jim Harper and myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. We followed Robert’s rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. […] It was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the Foundation.

The Bitcoin Foundation hates transparency.\n\nBeing that in our era, recording things is not a hard thing to do, it does speak to some other motive that the other foundation members have to keep things off the record. Effectively, at least according to Janssens, the organization is in dire financial straits since last November.\n\nMajority of Employees Fired\n\n“The Foundation has almost no money left, and just fired 90% of its people. Some will stay on as volunteers,” says Janssens, while not referencing any way for us to verify this. It seemed apparent that he was writing this for the press, as in the very beginning of the post he wrote, “NOTE TO THE PRESS: The Bitcoin Foundation does not represent Bitcoin in any way.”\n\nRegardless, it seems there’s no reason to make up the statistic that 90% of the Bitcoin Foundation’s employees have been fired. It seems that if they’re running out of money, which is primarily raised through memberships and from industry donors, letting go of a good number of people would be a helpful way to cut expenses.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nAlso read: Patrick Murck: Bitcoin Foundation Turns The Corner On Operating Sustainably\n\nIntimidation Tactics Regularly Used to Suppress Leaks\n\n“Jim Harper was threatened for doing a press release which was (barely) critical of the Foundation after he got elected. The Foundation tries to make sure we hide the truth by subtly threatening us on a regular basis,” Olivier Janssens tells the Reddit community. He also mentions that he believes this post will most likely hasten his exit from the board seat he’s only recently begun to occupy.\n\nIf I get asked to leave the Foundation for telling the truth, so be it. The truth is being told. […] I totally expect the current Board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. They are very bad at taking personal responsibility. I have had several threats, but I’m releasing this anyway.\n\nBitcoin Foundation is Broke\n\nAccording to the post, the Foundation went almost totally broke last November, and that is when it sought out a new executive director. Patrick Murck took over and immediately instituted a policy of fund-raising for the purpose of core development. By this time, Janssens says, the damage had been done.\n\nAs a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in November of last year. In extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. That new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. But people were smart enough not to trust the Foundation anymore. […] The truth is that the Foundation’s plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a Bitcoin Standards Body. No organization should have this much control over Bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided.\n\nLead Developer Pessimistic About Foundation’s Future\n\nThe Reddit post was actually a cross-post from the Bitcoin Foundation’s forums, and Gavin Andresen, the lead developer from the earliest days of Bitcoin development, expressed a negative outlook moving forward.\n\n“I had an idealistic vision of the Foundation being a member-driven organization, but that never happened,” he said.\n\n“The Foundation will support core development” vision didn’t work; I took a couple of weeks off from doing technical work to meet with people capable of funding that vision and it very quickly became clear most “deep pockets” don’t trust that the Foundation would stick to that vision, or aren’t willing to risk their reputations being closely associated with an organization that had two of its Board members resign in disgrace last year.\n\nOne of the board members he’s referencing here is former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem, who is presently serving a federal prison sentence for his role in laundering illicit funds among other mistakes made while running the Bitcoin exchange. “Unfortunately I’m pessimistic about a coherent vision arising– too many of the “squeaky wheels” here want to wallow in past mistakes,” he said. And, in closing, asked other members of the forum and foundation to prove him wrong – to constructively discuss what should come next for the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation has been the subject of much criticism since its inception in 2012. During the most recently board member election, one candidate, Cody Wilson, actively sought to disband the organization. The feeling in the wider berth of the community seems to be that the organization is either unnecessary or too friendly with regulatory bodies who seek to change the very nature of Bitcoin.\n\nIt will be a very interesting year for a professional organization with almost no money to function. In the meantime, core development will have to find a way to sustain itself. Janssens personally offered to help fund as much, saying:\n\nA special trust fund is being created and I will donate several 100k to pre-pay Gavin’s, Wladimirs and some other core devs wage for the next year (if they choose to accept). The control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, who can decide who can join it.\n\nA few hours after Janssens’ reddit post he followed up with this tweet:\n\nWhat do you think? Should the Bitcoin Foundation disband? Should a new organization which is more decentralized and transparent be formed in its place? Have foundation members gotten their money’s worth?

Dutan is CEO of Novaux, a restaurant point-of-sale (POS) system with Bitcoin at its heart.\n\nDutan saw a clear opportunity in the NYC restaurant business, which has over 22,500 restaurants, most of them using point-of-sale systems that charge varying but unanimously high bank fees and charges. He realised that Bitcoin could be just what the restaurateurs needed.\n\nThe stress of running a restaurant in New York City has certainly not proved to be too much for Dutan. After opening his first restaurant at age 16, Javier went on to set up more than 10 restaurants for his family and clients.\n\nCoinTelegraph interviewed Dutan to find out more about him and his innovative ideas.\n\nCoinTelegraph: As a young restaurateur, what attracted you to Bitcoin?\n\nJavier Dutan: Bitcoins have much lower processing fees than credit cards, and in a restaurant, your bottom line counts. An extra 2 to 3% in fees takes away from the little profit margin we have.\n\nBitcoin is much easier to process. Our card processing takes one to two days to deposit funds in our account. Bitcoin takes less than 10 minutes and about a day to process the fiat currency. Cash flow is extremely important in restaurants, missing one ingredient or missing a payment due to lack of funds is always an expensive mishap.\n\nBitcoin is really cool, whenever I tell anyone about my restaurant and how we accept Bitcoin, I see their faces light up. Honestly, Bitcoin is still not mainstream enough for the average Joe to know about it, which makes it cool and hip.\n\nCT: What advantages does Bitcoin pose in the retail POS business?\n\nJD: Bitcoin is really easy to pay with. Just scan a QR code and send your payment over.\n\nIt’s very secure and avoids the whole PCI compliance setup (very expensive for POS and businesses).\n\nTipping and other cool ideas could become mainstream in the next few years. Tipping is hard to innovate.\n\nCT: What has Novaux's traction been like so far?\n\nJD: We have over 50 restaurant clients in NYC, primarily in Hispanic neighborhoods and immigrant communities. The system is very easy to use and aimed to have only the core features you need in business, instead of high-detailed features (food temp, oz./lbs./weight ratios and complex inventory).\n\nWe have a lot of overseas users. We have over 250 businesses using the POS.\n\nBitcoin sales have been very low. I believe mainstream adoption is still a few years away.\n\nCT: What has the trend of Bitcoin usage been like in NYC and in the restaurant space in general?\n\nJD: Bitcoin is huge in NYC, but not in a retail space. A lot of POS competitors announced their support for Bitcoin over six months ago and almost none of them had delivered on the promise. It’s not a super-requested feature for businesses yet. There’s also a really cumbersome registration process to accept bitcoins and have them converted to fiat.\n\nBitcoin is getting bigger in remittance and financial services such as SecondMarket. Wall Street seems to be warming up to it.\n\nThe general population is more fascinated by the “revolutionary” Apple Pay.\n\nCT: What does the future of restaurant-based POS integration look like to you?\n\nJD: Restaurant POS is growing rapidly, as the data you can derive from restaurants can be used to enter other markets such as loyalty programs, marketing, collecting customer data, etc. Including Bitcoin in the mix would be nice since you can track its information through metadata and the blockchain. You might see some crazy tracking of it in the near future.\n\nWe have Bitcoin set up in a simple fashion. Print through a receipt, or show on a tablet screen. (Pay at table or counter). We have some more ideas of making it more streamlined. We are waiting for mainstream adoption to grow, or when restaurants start requesting more features before we dedicate man -hours to the project.\n\nCT: Tell us about your plans for Novaux.\n\nJD: Novaux is a great and easy tool for restaurants to manage orders, payments, kitchen data, Bitcoins, and so much more. We initially wanted to be a big driver in Bitcoin, but we are too small of a team to do so.\n\nWe are pivoting towards restaurant automation, which essentially means that with the data we are collecting from restaurants, we want to make a restaurant owner’s life much easier by estimating financial projects, efficiency, and eventually inventory. In the restaurant industry, each restaurant has so many functions that need to be done by various people. A small restaurant has the owner who does everything. We can make their lives easier by taking the POS data from Novaux and creating concise, to-the-point reports about their restaurant.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The latest report of Juniper Research’s forecast on the Bitcoin community hitting 5 million users by end of 2019 doesn’t come as a surprise. As its adoption grows, the number of people trying to scam the users of their Bitcoin also grows.\n\nUsing Common Sense against Bitcoin Scams\n\nNo, you don’t have to be worried about Bitcoin scams. All you have to do is, ask a few questions and do some basic research to make sure that you have covered all your bases. You don’t have to be an expert to look for these answers. All it needs is some common sense and a few standard questions (or knowledge about basic internet search).\n\nA recent report – There is No Free Lunch, Even Using Bitcoin: Tracking the Popularity and Profits of Virtual Currency Scams by Marie Vasek and Tyler Moore explains the extent of Bitcoin scams since the year 2011. It shows the prevalence and success rate of various Bitcoin scams.\n\nFive steps that can prevent you from becoming a victim of Bitcoin scams\n\nListen to your common sense – If something sounds too good to be true, then it is probably not true… If someone promises you ridiculously high returns for your investment, then it is probably a scam. Keep your cards close to you. Don’t give your private key to anyone. Don’t blindly believe in what the company’s website or information brochure says. Verify whether whatever they say is true by checking the company’s name in the respective country’s company information registry database. Make sure that the company lists its promoters and developers on its website. You can also search for their names on LinkedIn or other sites. A Google search for WHOIS information about the company and its domains will also help you find out who is behind it along with the hosting information etc. It is always advisable to opt for publicly audited companies. If a company provides its customers access to its proof-of-reserve cryptographic audit information which clearly shows the company’s Bitcoin holdings that can be readily verified. More transparent a company is with regards to its operations, the better it is to do business with them. Check whether the company follows best business practices, has all its policies and terms clearly mentioned on their website and communications. Mismanagement or Scam, both are dangerous for your money, even though the former doesn’t have any malicious intentions. Especially with the number of Bitcoin businesses growing exponentially, there are many Bitcoin startups that do not have the required funding or infrastructure to run a full-fledged Bitcoin business and some of them end up looking like a scam due to mismanagement. It is good to stay away from them, for your own benefit, but in case you find and conclude the site to be genuine , then by all means go ahead (at your own risk).\n\nFollowing these steps won’t guarantee 100 percent protection against bitcoin scams, but it will surely reduce your risk of exposure to them.']"
04/06/2015,"['Further Reading Bitcoin makes bid for respect with new foundation One of the newly elected board members of the Bitcoin Foundation—the 2.5-year-old organization that was meant to bring order to the famously open source and freewheeling cryptocurrency—has declared the group ""effectively bankrupt.""\n\nWhile the Bitcoin Foundation obviously does not have control over Bitcoin itself, it’s the closest thing to a public face that the community has. Individual memberships start at $25, while corporate memberships start at $1,000 annually. The non-profit’s own tax filings from 2013 show that it ended that year with over $4.7 million in total assets—nearly five times as much as it had at the same time the previous year. It has yet to release financial details for 2014.\n\nThe organization was founded in 2012 by a number of Bitcoin luminaries who have since fallen, and the group itself has been marred by controversy in recent months. Of its original five founders, one is now in prison (Charlie Shrem), another oversaw the collapse of the largest Bitcoin exchange (Mark Karpeles), and yet another has since left the United States for a Caribbean nation known for offshore banking (Roger Ver). Of the original board members, only Bitcoin lead developer Gavin Andresen has remained.\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment, nor did it address the issue on Twitter or its blog.\n\nIn a Saturday blog post, the new member, Olivier Janssens, claimed that the group has been hiding this financial distress from its membership. As he wrote:\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation hates transparency. If they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. Something I think the members have a right to know, wouldn’t you think? Members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. But instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director that will come up with another magic plan. Ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with.\n\nHide-and-seek\n\nJanssens previously said in May 2014 that he would resign his lifetime membership from the organization after board member Brock Pierce was allegedly linked to a sex abuse case. He ultimately decided not to leave it and wanted to reform things from within—Janssens recently stood for election to the group’s board and succeeded on that effort.\n\n""My big issue was that they did not tell the membership about the real financial status,"" Janssens told Ars via an encrypted chat on the Telegraph app. ""You can’t be a member-run non-profit and still try to get money from your corporate or individual sponsors while hiding the fact that you’re near-bankrupt. That’s the reason I came forward, I could not live with that. That’s up to the members to decide.""\n\nJanssens said he would prefer to heed whatever the group’s existing members decide.\n\n""If it’s up to me, I’d make it a positive-only organization, no longer involved in any power position,"" he added. ""I would think it’s great to engage the members and make a map of every store in the USA, and have members go store to store to convince them of the benefits of Bitcoin, and in return they could get an affiliate percent or a referral reward. I also see the Foundation helping to organize mass changetip events to get a bitcoin (or bit) into the hands of every person in this world. For something like that, it can be very useful, and add a lot of value to Bitcoin itself. It’s a non-threatening, positive thing to do.""\n\nUPDATE April 7 4:13pm CT: The Bitcoin Foundation has released a statement, refuting some of Janssens\' claims.', 'Buttercoin, a bitcoin exchange startup backed by Y Combinator and Google Ventures, is closing its doors this month after failing to raise new investment.\n\n“Buttercoin will be turning off our service on April 10th at 11PM Pacific,” the company said in a note on its website. “Be sure to move your bitcoins to another service and remove your dollar balances by Friday April 10th at 11PM.”\n\nAny unclaimed funds will be returned to the accounts that they came from, the company added.\n\nUnlike other bitcoin shutdowns, which are often triggered by hacks and result in customers losing money, Buttercoin is solvent and will provide users with their balance in full. The startup said it is winding down because it wasn’t able to raise new funding — that’s something it attributes to a “dip in bitcoin interest among Silicon Valley investors.”\n\nButtercoin launched in 2013 with the aim of tackling the global remittance space, aka money that migrant workers send to their relatives back home. It’s a huge opportunity — The World Bank estimates that some $515 billion will be sent in developing countries this year — and Buttercoin’s take was ambitious, it wanted to open local exchanges in a range of countries to facilitate cheaper cross-border currency transfer.\n\nButtercoin raised a total of $1.6 million from investors, including Google Ventures’ Kevin Rose and Chris Hutchins, Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, Floodgate, Initialized Capital, Rothenberg Ventures and Switzerland’s Centralway, via its first early-stage investment fund.\n\nYet, despite those influential backers, it looks like investors are less keen to be involved in bitcoin. Beyond the valuation of the cryptocurrency, which has found some stability this year — as the chart from Coindesk below shows — the bitcoin exchange market has found relative maturity. The rise of Coinbase, Bitpay and a handful of others — which have sucked up millions from investors and won big clients — makes the chances of a smaller player breaking through less likely. Even when that player is backed by reputed people and institutions.\n\nMight this be the first of many casualties from the consolidation of bitcoin? We shall find out.\n\nThe value of bitcoin versus the US dollar over the past year\n\nFeatured Image: Antana/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED)', 'Jacob Dienelt is the latest Morgan Stanley veteran to leave Wall Street and join the Bitcoin industry. Following the likes of former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters and former JPMorgan Managing Director Paul Camp, Dienelt has made the move from traditional banking at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management to join the emerging digital currency industry as head treasurer of Factom .\n\nFactom, a Bitcoin 2.0 company creating a notarized audit trail with blockchain technology, has hired Dienelt as part of its focus on bitcoin asset management for its software token sale. Dienelt brings his experience managing a Futures Specialists desk at Morgan Stanley’s New York office to the nascent Bitcoin industry. He graduated from Kenyon College in 2003 where he majored in Game Theory. After graduation, he worked at a private real estate asset management company performing REIT analysis.\n\nOn leaving his Wall Street job, Dienelt states, “After two years traveling to Bitcoin conferences, mining, and running a paper wallet company, I’m glad to have found a home in the space.\n\n“Factom is the first non-financial application of the distributed ledger technology that will, over the next decade, change how people prove their data is authentic, and so much more. I spent almost ten years at Morgan Stanley, and I’ll miss my friends and clients dearly. I just couldn’t miss an opportunity to help shape such an important ecosystem as it develops. I’m very excited to be working with [founders] Paul, David, Peter, and the rest of the team.”\n\nFactom has been featured recently for their series of partnerships involving Bitcoin price stability with Tether, documenting gold exchange trades with Serica, and providing notarized audit trails for the Internet of Things with Rivetz.\n\nDavid Johnston, Chairman of the Factom Foundation, welcomed Dienelt to the team, saying, “As the world’s large companies and institutions begin adopting blockchain technology, it naturally follows that their top people will get involved in projects such as Factom in order to be leaders in that transition.”\n\nJohnston is referring to the recent trend of Wall Street executives who have left to join Bitcoin companies despite the public skepticism Bitcoin has received from banking executives. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, was quoted last March stating that ‘Bitcoin [is] a terrible store of value that could be replicated over and over.’\n\n“The question isn’t whether we accept it,” Dimon said in a recent interview with CNBC. “The question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin?”\n\nUnlike Bitcoin companies which are focused on Bitcoin’s use as a digital currency for payment solutions which Mr. Dimon is referring to, Factom is only using the technology of Bitcoin – namely the distributed ledger and consensus system that makes up the blockchain. Factom provides a distributed consensus and audit trail leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain. The company’s open source platform stores a compressed and encoded version of data into the immutable blockchain record as a hash. Factom recently began a crowdsale of tokens supporting the development of the platform and has raised over 1000 bitcoins to date. Upon close of the token sale at the end of the month, Dienelt will be taking the lead on managing the bitcoin received during the sale, bringing his wealth of knowledge and experience from Morgan Stanley to Bitcoin 2.0.\n\nEditor’s note: In the interest of full disclosure, Lisa Cheng is an advisor to the Factom project and does not hold any financial stake in the company. She will be participating in the token sale and receiving Factoids.', ""Developers for Bank of New York Mellon Corp have been experimenting with bitcoin's open-source code for use as part of the bank’s newly created corporate recognition program, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe so-called “BK Coins” will be awarded to staff for contributions to the bank’s software development, and can be redeemed for gift cards and other rewards.\n\nThe initiative was announced by BNY Mellon CIO Suresh Kumar during a meeting last week at the bank’s innovation center. Kumar noted at the time that the bitcoin testing fits within BNY Mellon’s broader goals of exploring open-source software for the bank’s growing needs.\n\nKumar, according to the Journal, noted at the time that the scope of the rewards program may be expanded to cover other activities conducted by bank employees.\n\nKumar said of the development work:\n\n“There is a big mindset change that comes with many of these new technologies. So if we can find a way to make it tangible, in a controlled environment like our internal employee recognition program, then we have a great opportunity to help our businesses better understand the potential value.”\n\nBNY Mellon is the latest large bank to test the waters of digital currency.\n\nLast week, for example, UBS announced the creation of a London-based development center dedicated to experimenting with the technology.\n\nNew York image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Not only was a rising star executive leaving a Fortune 500 company after only 10 months, but his reasons for leaving fascinated people. Watson, who joined Nike as its CIO in April 2014, was unhappy in the Portland area, Fortune first reported. He is from London and is young, single, gay, and used to urban social life. He experienced a “culture shock” while living in Portland and working in Beaverton, where Nike (NKE) is based.\n\nNow Fortune has learned where Watson will land next. After taking a few months to examine his options, the 40 Under 40 alum is joining a banking startup called Bitreserve. He will be its president and COO.\n\nThe company, founded in the last six months, transfers deposits of the digital currency bitcoin into other currencies and allows customers to send and receive money anywhere in the world for very low fees. A promo video calls Bitreserve “a next-generation money service built on top of bitcoin,” but goes on to describe the volatility of bitcoin, and says that Bitreserve, “solves bitcoin’s volatility problem by enabling you to hold bitcoin denominated as stable, real-world value.” The site currently offers eight currencies: dollar; euro; pound; franc; yen; yuan; rupee; and peso. It also offers commodities—for now, the metals gold, silver, platinum and palladium.\n\nThat latter feature was particularly exciting to Watson. “What I think is so revolutionary here is that it can allow you to trade in any commodity,” he told Fortune in an exclusive interview. “Right now it’s metals, but it could be cocoa beans. The broader vision is much bigger than digital currencies.”\n\nWatson’s background is in banking—prior to Nike, he was CIO of Europe, Middle East, and global operations at Barclays. While at Nike, he longed to get back into the banking world in order to help change what he sees as an unjust financial system. “I was itching to make an impact,” he said. “I wanted to do something that is valuable for people broadly, not just in one industry. And what Bitreserve is looking to achieve really democratizes finance. It’s going to help people all over the world. The financial system is inherently unfair—it’s always the richest who have access, and the poorest don’t have access, or when they do, they have to pay astronomical rates.”\n\nBitreserve charges a 0.45% fee for BTC to USD conversions. The company also stresses transparency—it created a public web site that shows exactly how much money is currently in Bitreserve wallets ($1.43 million) and the currency breakdown (63% bitcoin at the moment). Bitreserve is growing fast: it has 35 employees at five offices and has raised $14.6 million in funding.\n\nWhile Watson is getting a top job at a young startup, Bitreserve is getting an experienced star who is also an outspoken gay rights activist and GLAAD boardmember. That’s something that Bitreserve founder and CEO Halsey Minor says played a big part in the hire. “I think we’re perfect for him and he’s perfect for us,” Minor said. “Our business is money, and he has an extraordinary amount of experience and success in banking. But also, our ethos is inclusion. He’s a leader in social inclusion. So from my standpoint I don’t think we could have found anyone better.”\n\nMinor was the founder of CNET (CBS) and a cofounder of Salesforce (CRM) and is one of the bigger business names to have jumped into digital currency. And yet he is not exactly a bitcoin believer. Whereas most in the bitcoin space fervently refute those who dismiss bitcoin as “fake money,” Minor readily says that the point of his company is to help people turn bitcoin into “real money.” Bitreserve had to begin with bitcoin, Minor says, “because then I didn’t need a bank license to start it. What bitcoin does is allows for the creation of financial institutions without having to go through the traditional financial system, which is the great magical beauty of bitcoin. But what you can expect from us is that in the not-so-distant future, you can put money in with many paths. We’ve taken the idea of bitcoin and applied it to the world consumers already live in, rather than trying to force consumers into a new world that has high risk.”\n\nTo be sure, Nike, the country’s leading sports apparel giant, and Bitreserve, a digital currency startup that is less than a year old, couldn’t be more different. And Minor acknowledges, “There appears to be some sort of implied suspicion around [bitcoin] and around anyone doing anything new with money in the U.S. That doesn’t exist in the rest of the world. There’s a desperate need in the U.S. to change the attitude toward new financial systems.” Watson knows the perception that some have of digital currency, and it doesn’t concern him. “I’ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years,” he said. “It’s a means to an end. The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology. I think once the world becomes more accustomed and attuned to the platform of bitcoin, the noise will go away, and the currency will go away too. The real transformation is the idea of taking all barriers down and having it be ubiquitous. Whatever currency or commodity you want to transact in, you can, and you can do it for free. That’s pretty revolutionary.”\n\nIn a way, Watson represents a growing number of workers that refuse to sacrifice personal life for their career. They value work-life balance, and won’t move anywhere just for a job. When he left Nike, Watson realized that he will only be happy living in big cities like New York, Los Angeles, or London. Now, he will live in Los Angeles but travel constantly (mostly between San Francisco and London). Bitreserve has offices in San Francisco, London, Portugal, Shanghai, and Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n“Millennials don’t want to or need to work in one big concrete building in one location,” Watson said. “That’s not how the world works anymore. Some people want to work remotely from home, some want to work from a coffee shop, some want to work at an office. People perform their best when they’re happiest and content in their personal lives. I could have been happy working for another big company, and working in another city than L.A., but this gives me the opportunity to live and work in multiple cities.”\n\nWhat’s next? Naturally, television. Watson says he has been asked to do a reality show in Los Angeles. He’s thinking about it. “I probably won’t have the time to do it,” he said, “but it’s flattering.”\n\nWatch more business news from Fortune:', 'Digital currencies such as bitcoin are becoming more mainstream Bogdan Cristel/Reuters\n\nOne of the world’s biggest digital currency markets is in talks with financial watchdogs about setting up a regulated bitcoin exchange in Britain.\n\nCoinbase opened the first regulated bitcoin exchange in the United States this year with $106 million of backing from the New York stock exchange and several banks.\n\nBrian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, said in an interview that the company had been in talks with regulators in the UK “for at least six months” about setting up an exchange.\n\nThese conversations were “positive and all moving in the right direction”, he said, adding that he was “hesitant to avoid putting any measure” on a possible launch date.\n\nBitcoin has struggled to shake off its image as the preferred currency of drug…', 'Image representing the decentralised Bitcoin network\n\nMoney is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever created.\n\nMoney has long fascinated me, and not for the obvious reasons. Although I’d like to have more of it, my interest is largely philosophical. It is the ontology of money that has always disturbed me. Ever since I was a child, collecting old coins and hoarding my pocket money, I’ve wondered why it is that certain physical tokens can function as money and others cannot. What is money made from? What is it grounded in? Why do certain monetary systems fail and others succeed?\n\nFor many years, I set these questions aside, convinced that I had a basic grasp of how they could be answered. But in the past year they have re-emerged. I have started to teach a course on money and banking law. And, as is my wont, I cannot possibly teach it without trying to address some of the deeper philosophical issues. Some of these issues are purely political or ethical, but some are ontological. In particular, I have found the ontological questions to be pertinent when trying to assess the nature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThis post is my first attempt to write down my thoughts on the ontology of money, in general, and Bitcoin, in particular. It is pitched at an introductory level, reassembled from notes I prepared for my classes. It may well contain some misconceptions or misunderstandings. I welcome feedback. The post is an attempt to achieve some degree of insight through the process of writing; not an attempt to reproduce well-thought out views in a written form.\n\nI’m going to break the discussion up into four main parts. First, I’ll talk about the social function of money. Second, I’ll discuss two different ontologies of money — the naive realist ontology and the more sophisticated subjectivist ontology. Third, I’ll talk about five steps in the social evolution of money. And then fourth, and finally, I’ll talk about Bitcoin and how it fits into my preferred subjectivist ontological theory.\n\n1. The Social Functions of Money\n\nI don’t think the ontology of money can be understood apart from the social function of money. So that’s where I shall start. I can’t remember where I picked up the idea (I think it might have been from this podcast) but I like the analogy between money and a computer’s operating system. Money can be seen as the operating system for an economy: the software program that greases the engines of production and exchange (I guess that’s an awkward mix of metaphors).\n\nMoney has its origins in the importance of exchange. We all face the same basic problem of existence. We are mortal, fragile, biological beings. We need certain things in order to ensure our survival: food, clothing, shelter and so on. We also want certain things to make our existence more pleasant. How do we go about getting the things that we need and want? There are two basic strategies. The first is that of self-sufficiency, i.e. you, as an individual, can source and produce all the things you need to survive and (if you have any time left over) all the things you want in order to live a more pleasant life. The second is that of specialisation and exchange. Rather than spending all of your time catering to all of your needs and wants, you specialise in producing some particular good or providing some particular service, and then exchange with others who specialise in other areas.\n\nWhile the self-sufficiency strategy holds appeal for some people, most societies have opted for the specialisation and exchange strategy. And this is where money comes into play. Although money is not strictly necessary for exchange (one could have systems of altruistic or communal sharing), it is the most common method of facilitating specialisation and exchange. This is because money performs three essential functions:\n\nMedium of Exchange: It provides a medium for exchanging different goods and services. Put another way, it provides a medium for converting one type of good or service into another. This is perhaps the most important social function of money.\n\nStore of value: The medium is one that retains (to some degree) its value over time. In other words, if you have money put in your hands on Monday it can still function as a useful medium of exchange on Friday, because people still accept that it has a roughly equivalent value. If money loses its value too rapidly — as happens in hyperinflationary cycles — it ceases to provide a useful medium of exchange. Similar negative effects occur if it increases in value too rapidly: people might stop using it as a medium of exchange and hoard it instead.\n\nUnit of account: It provides a way of precisely accounting for the value of different goods and services. In other words, it is not too coarse-grained in how it accounts for their value. This is important insofar as an effective price system is thought to be essential not just for facilitating exchange, but for facilitating competition and the efficient use of resources.\n\nThis is the standard economic account of the functions of money. It will be familiar to all first year economics students. But it is connected to the ontological question that I find more interesting: what is the “stuff” that performs these three functions?\n\n2. A Subjectivist Ontology of Money\n\nOntology is the study of what there is; what kinds of things exist and what are they made of. When it comes to the ontology of money, I tend to think that there are two schools of thought. One, which I think is clearly incorrect, is the naive realist theory of money. This is one that I, and I suspect others, found appealing in our youths. The other, which I think is correct, is the sophisticated subjectivist theory of money. Of course, the labels “naive” and “sophisticated” are value-laden, and I could perhaps do without them. Nevertheless, I think they are worth tacking on, mainly because I think there is a naive subjectivist theory that we should seek to avoid. More on this anon.\n\nI start by offering a brief description of the naive realist ontology:\n\nNaive Realist Ontology: Money is any physical commodity with intrinsic value, that can be used as a medium of exchange (i.e. it is a commodity that is valuable, but also portable, divisible, hard to fake etc.).\n\nI call this a naive realist ontology because it maintains that money is “out there” in the natural world, the world beyond that of human imagination and culture. It corresponds, roughly, to other realist ontologies insofar as it thinks that the phenomenon of interest is not dependent on human observers for its existence (i.e. it thinks that money is mind-independent). This is a view that I think many people find attractive in their youths. I know I did. I used to think that coins, particularly those made of precious metals, counted as money because there was some mystical intrinsic value attached to those metals.\n\nThis view is naive and clearly false. History proves this point. Humans have used many commodities over the centuries, from tea leaves and cowry shells to pieces of paper and lines of computer code, as money. Many of these things lack intrinsic value (whatever that is). In fact, most of them lack instrumental value (beyond the value they provide as a medium of exchange). This is true of precious metals just as much as it is true of coloured printed paper. It is obvious that a piece of paper with numbers and symbols upon it has no intrinsic value, but, when you think about it, it is also pretty clear that gold and silver are devoid of intrinsic value. They merely have the value that particular cultures attach to them (e.g. for ornamentation and jewelry). If such a diverse, and clearly intrinsically valueless array of phenomena can count as money, the naive realist view must be false.\n\nBut this then raises the question: how is it that such a diverse array of phenomena can function as money? The answer lies in the sophisticated subjectivist ontology of money:\n\nSophisticated Subjectivist Ontology: Money is anything (physical or non-physical) that humans are collectively willing to represent and intend to function as a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account.\n\nTo go back to the software analogy introduced earlier on, money isn’t some physical hardware that is “out there” in the real world, rather it is a software package that all participants in an economy simply agree to run on their brains. I believe it was Terence McKenna who once said that “what we call reality is, in fact, nothing more than a culturally sanctioned and linguistically reinforced hallucination”, and while I wouldn’t endorse this as a general description of reality, I think it is perfectly true when it comes to the reality of money. It really is just a collective hallucination.\n\nThat said, we must not fall into the trap of endorsing a naive subjectivist ontology. It is not the case that we can simply and easily hallucinate money into existence. It is far more complicated than that. Yuval Harari’s quote — which served as an epigram to this post — captures the difficulty. Money is a system of mutual trust, and societies have to go to extraordinary lengths to reinforce that system of mutual trust. As he puts it:\n\nWhy should anyone be willing to exchange a fertile rice paddy for a handful of useless cowry shells? Why are you willing to flip hamburgers, sell health insurance or babysit three obnoxious brats when all you get for your exertions is a few pieces of coloured paper? People are willing to do such things when they trust the figments of their collective imagination. Trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted….What created this trust was a very complex and long-term network of political, social and economic relations.\n\nIndeed, it is when you realise how difficult it is to create a system of mutually reinforcing trust that something of the naive realist view of money starts to creep back in. It turns out that some physical (and social) phenomena are better at creating such a system than others. So we cannot completely ignore the features of the objective (mind-independent) reality when it comes to understanding the ontology of money. This point can be illustrated by considering the historical evolution of money.\n\n3. Five Steps in the Evolution of Money\n\nUnfortunately, history is full of messy and complex facts. I cannot pretend to know everything about how money came to be or how it changed over time. Nevertheless, I think I can point to five steps in the evolution of money. These five steps may represent something of a historical “just so” story — one that cannot be easily mapped onto a chronological sequence of historical events — but I think they do capture something of the truth.\n\nI’ll start by describing the five steps and explaining why they succeeded or failed to create an effective system of money. I’ll use this as a bridge toward the discussion of Bitcoin:\n\nStep One – Barter: This is actually a pre-monetary step. It is what prevailed in economically simple ancient communities and what resurfaces at times of monetary crisis. It involves the direct exchange of one good or service for another, with no intervening medium of exchange. Its limitations are what spur the need for the mental creation of money. In a barter system, members of the community can struggle to store value in physical goods and services (the vegetables I grow in my garden will rot and go off), to find willing partners for exchange (the fisherman down the road may not want any of my vegetables) and to meaningfully account for the value of different items (how much is a freshly-caught salmon worth in sticks of celery?).\n\nStep Two – Commodity-based Systems: This is really the first step in the development of proper money. It is what happens when a community picks some available commodity (barley grains, shiny stones, sea shells, salt, tea leaves etc) and collectively agree (through practice and trial and error, not through formal contract) that this commodity will function as money. Many different societies have trialled many different types of commodity money. Some commodities are clearly better at doing this than others. The stone disks used as money on the Island of Yap, for instance, have some limitations. They are not readily portable and divisible, and are unlikely to be accepted as valuable in other communities. They also face a trust problem: how do you ensure that people do not “double-spend” their stone disks?\n\nStep Three – Coined Money: This is a sub-type of commodity money based on coins made from precious metals such as gold, silver and bronze. It was an effective system of commodity money and became popular in a number of different cultures. There were many reasons for this. Precious metals had some instrumental value across many different cultures (for making weapons, tools, jewelry etc) and so could facilitate larger trade networks. They were also highly portable, and capable of being melted and sub-divided into units representing different quantities of value. However, they too faced a trust problem. Initially their value was tied to the weight or quantity of the metal in the coin, that was part of the reason people were willing to accept them as currency. But it was always possible to introduce counterfeit or impure coins. Communities tried to counteract this by adding official stamps and signs to the official currency. Counterfeiters reacted by developing methods for copying these stamps and signs. The trust arms-race started to take-off: governments introduced more and more elaborate mechanisms designed to restore trust in the monetary system (I ignore, for now, the fact that some governments also tried to decrease the value of their currencies through a practice known as seignoirage).\n\nStep Four – Paper Money Backed by Coin/Precious Metal: Although coined money was relatively effective as a medium of exchange, it did have some inconvenient features. In addition to the counterfeiting problem, large sums of coined money were difficult to carry around and made one a target for thieves and bandits. As a convenience, goldsmiths started to offer safe storage facilities to people who wished to stash their coins. They would be issued with receipts which they could exchange for coin. In time, people started to use these slips of paper to pay for goods and services, confident that the holder of the receipt could always trade-in for the prescribed amount of coin. Paper money was born. Paper money also had its trust problems, with counterfeiting being a serious issue (as it still is) and with occasional crises of confidence when the holders of coin reserves became involved in fractional reserve banking. Since these institutions would lend multiples of the actual sums of coined money they held on reserves, they were prone to “runs” when people worried that borrowers would not be able to pay back their loans. Centralisation of the banking and monetary systems solved some of these problems and led to perhaps the most famous system of paper money backed by precious metal: the Gold Standard.\n\nStep Five – Fiat Money: [Skipping over lots of the important historical details] The next step in the evolution of money came when governments (who controlled the gold standard) realised that this system was expensive, and limited what they could do during times of national crisis (e.g. during WWI and the Great Depression) to restore confidence to the broader economy. They realised that it was possible to get people to trust the paper money system through force of law alone. All the government had to do was declare that X amount of money was in existence, and thus it was that X amount money came into existence. This is money created by governmental fiat. This is the system that prevails today, and nowadays the majority of such money does not exist in paper or coined form. It exists as account balances on computer programs run by the banking system. This fiat system also clearly suffers from trust problems: it only works to the extent that people have faith in the stability and probity of government, and the prudence of the banking system.\n\nAs I say, this is a crude summary of the historical evolution of money. But I think it does show why our subjectivist ontology must be sophisticated rather than naive. We see now the problems that arise when trying to create a system of mutual trust that will provide the basis for money. For the majority of human history, these problems were solved by attaching value to commodities with the right kinds of properties (portable, divisible, widely perceived as having instrumental value, hard to fake etc.) and correcting for any trust deficits through the use of institutions and laws. In the most recent evolutionary step, money has been delinked from physical commodities. The mutual trust needed is fashioned from our trust in other social institutions (specifically governments, central banks and banks). These institutions are themselves fashioned out of our collective imaginations. Money has now truly become a collective hallucination, one that is maintained by a complex and esoteric network of rituals and laws.\n\n4. The Ontology of Bitcoin\n\nWhere do Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fit within this ontological framework? Despite claims to the contrary made by its mysterious founder — Satoshi Nakamoto — Bitcoin is not a “trustless” monetary system. It is just as much an exercise in collective trust and imagination as is the fiat money system. But it does mark something of a move away from the pure fiat system and a return to the classic commodity-based systems. Only this time the commodity in question is not some physical object like silver or gold, but rather a digital program that runs on a decentralised network of computers. Bitcoin tries to solve the trust problem by getting us to attach value to a computer program with a number of unique properties.\n\nI’m going to try to describe some of these properties now. But before I do so a caveat: the Bitcoin protocol solves the trust problem in a manner that also tries to implement a whole political and economic philosophy (roughly that of the Cypherpunk movement). In what follows, I try to ignore the features of that political and economic philosophy as much as possible. I do so not because I think they are unimportant or uninteresting — far from it: I want to write another post on whether Bitcoin is an economic and political failure at a later date — but because some of those details may distract from the purely ontological focus of this post.\n\nSo, anyway, what are the properties of the Bitcoin protocol that address the trust problem? This is not the place to launch into a full explanation of how Bitcoin works. To be honest, some of the technical details elude me (I have a basic grasp of how cryptographic hash functions work and how the mining competition operates, but I couldn’t claim to know everything). Fortunately, all I need to explain the ontology of Bitcoin are a few choice details. One of which is the basic gist of the idea. Bitcoin takes to the hilt the notion that pretty much anything can be used to represent value. It does this by encouraging people to attach value to digital tokens that represent numerical balances stored in personalised digital wallets. It then gets people to trust that these digital tokens and balances really can represent stores of value, and really can function as a medium of exchange, by creating a system that protects them from fraud and abuse (the digital tokens are bitcoin the currency; the protective system is Bitcoin the protocol).\n\nEvery type of money is open to fraud and abuse. What types of fraud and abuse are unique to Bitcoin? One of the major problems with a digital currency is that its users are being asked to trust that the digital records of their balances and payments are accurate. This is a tough sell since it is so easy to create and copy digital files. A user will always be inclined to ask: Couldn’t somebody be using the same digital token to pay for many different things? Couldn’t a sophisticated programmer or hacker be altering the digital records, stealing currency from others or creating an endless supply for themselves?\n\nBitcoin solves these specific trust problems by creating a computer program with a number of distinctive properties. I’ll mention four of them here:\n\nThe Blockchain: This is probably the key property of the Bitcoin program. It is a decentralised digital ledger that contains a record of every bitcoin transaction that has ever taken place. This ledger is what gives people confidence in the system. It allows them to be sure that there are no double-spends or fake transactions. It is constantly growing, and maintained and verified by a decentralised network of computers (in theory: anyone can contribute to this effort, provided they have the right equipment). This process of maintenance and verification occurs in ten minute intervals.\n\nCryptographic Security: The program uses a variety of cryptographic methods to protect the anonymity of its users and to prevent fraud and abuse. The primary methods are public key encryption, cryptographic hash functions, and proof of work protocols. These methods are used, respectively, to enable primary transactions between buyers and sellers, to add transaction data to the decentralised ledger, and to verify that the correct transaction data is being added to the Blcokchain. These are all essential to ensuring that people trust the system.\n\nCompetitive Mining: The people who maintain and verify the Blockchain are encouraged to do so through an interesting reward mechanism. During each ten-minute round, the computers running the system participate in a competition to ensure that they are the ones that get to add the next verified transaction block to the Blockchain. If they win this competition, they are rewarded with some freshly minted bitcoin. This has nothing to do with creating and maintaining trust per se, but rather with attracting people to the currency in the first place. In other words, it gets them to buy into this particular collective hallucination.\n\nRadically Deflationary Currency: The final property of the Bitcoin program is that the currency is radically deflationary. That is to say: less and less of it will be created over time, until the maximum of 21 million bitcoin is reached. This stands in direct opposition to modern fiat money systems which are, if anything, radically inflationary in nature. Again, the radically deflationary nature of the currency has nothing to do with maintaining trust in the system, but rather with encouraging people to get onboard. Why? Because if a radically deflationary currency takes off, the particular units of currency can be expected to go up in value over time. Thus, if you are an early adopter, you will be richly rewarded. The purchasing power of your units of currency will increase, rather than decrease over time.\n\nThese are the four properties of the Bitcoin program that I think have facilitated is acceptance as a type of money. But these four properties are not the end of the story. Many other people tried to create digital currencies with similar properties, and yet they all failed to take off. What was it about this particular version that captured the popular imagination? The answer does not lie in the features of the protocol alone. The answers lies in the particular socio-cultural milieu in which Bitcoin was launched.\n\nIt is probably no coincidence that Bitcoin was launched and took off in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis of ’08. This was a moment when our collective trust in the social institutions propping up the fiat money system was at a low ebb. It is also helped that Bitcoin came along at a point in time when the internet — and the concept of digital transactions — had reached a certain level of maturity. People had already begun to believe in the notion of a digital payment system: the notion of a completely digital currency was less of a conceptual leap. Finally, it no doubt helped that the anonymity of Bitcoin facilitated a community of people who wanted to trade in illegal goods and services (such as the illegal narcotics that could be bought and sold on the Silk Road).\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis post has gone on for too long. I’ll wrap up by summarising three key points. First, in terms of the ontology of money, I think we ought to subscribe to a sophisticated subjectivist ontology, according to which money is simply anything that people collectively agree can represent and function as a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. In short, money is a collective hallucination.\n\nSecond, it is not easy to get people to collectively agree to a particular system of money. They need to trust that the system really will function as a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Many different systems have been trialled over the course of human history, each of which comes with advantages and weaknesses. The two primary systems are the traditional commodity-based systems — which try to manufacture the necessary trust by utilising commodities with a unique set of properties; and fiat systems — which try to manufacture the necessary trust by using a network of social institutions, norms and laws.\n\nThird, Bitcoin fits within this general subjectivist ontology. It is not a trustless system. It tries to manufacture the necessary trust by utilising a computer program with a number of unique properties. These include: (i) the Blockchain, which provides an authoritative record of transaction data; (ii) the various methods of cryptographic security, which make it hard for hackers to fake or manipulate transaction data; (iii) the mining competition, which incentivises people to maintain the authoritative record; and (iv) the radically deflationary nature of the currency, which encourages people to opt into the system by guaranteeing that, if it takes off, the units of currency will increase in value.', 'For the first time, bitcoin has been used to incorporate a legal entity in Italy. The legal status of Bitcoin varies by country, but the Bank of Italy defines it as an unregulated digital decentralized virtual currency based on peer-to-peer, encryption on a shared blockchain.\n\nAccording to Italian Civil Code, the formation of a private limited company requires that the company have a minimum capital amount of €10,000. This minimum capital requirement means that business owners must make an initial contribution to the company.\n\nAccording to Art. 2464 of the Italian Civil Code, “1. The value of the contributions may not be less than the total capital. 2. Any assets capable of economic assessment can contribute to capital.” Based on that definition of capital contributions, Thomas Bertani incorporated a new private limited company using bitcoin.\n\nOn March 24, 2015, Bertani incorporated Oraclize Srl (Extract of Public Register) with a capital contribution of 45 bitcoin, which was registered by Public Notary Giacomo Pieraccini (Act of Incorporation).\n\n\n\nStefano Capaccioli assisted with the incorporation to ensure proper identification, traceability and proof of property through the validation of the signature that manages the Bitcoin address. Capaccioli, CPA and auditor in Arezzo, Italy, is founder of AssoB.it, an Italian association that aims to represent businesses and promote the activities on blockchain technology.\n\n\n\nBertani created a Bitcoin address during the incorporation, transferred 45 bitcoin, and delivered the private key to the appointed director. That transaction was included in block 349007.\n\nThis form of contribution is made during the process of incorporation. The transparency and traceability of this process is important, most notably during the passage of the ownership of bitcoin and verification of any further transaction. Making this contribution in bitcoin allows for additional transparency.\n\nThis process is similar to the one used by Spanish Bitcoin exchange Coinffeine, which used bitcoin as initial capital funding called “social capital” in Spain. As in Italy, Spanish law permits the social capital for a corporation to be real goods rather than cash only. In this case, the four engineers who founded Coinffeine used bitcoin instead of Euros.\n\nThe newly incorporated company aims to build a platform (www.oraclize.it) for the creation of smart contracts, in which some bitcoin transactions can take place based on the occurrence of some verifiable real-life event, based on third-party services which were already acting as oracles such as Wolfram Alpha.\n\nOraclize brings the computable knowledge of these complex engines to the Bitcoin world. The main purpose is setting up a powerful platform to create and execute smart contracts while keeping the users in control of their funds, thanks to the use of multisig wallets.\n\nThis article has been updated to include information about Coinffeine’s incorporation using bitcoin as social capital.', 'Synereo, which calls itself the world’s first fully-decentralized social network, recently launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise 4 700 bitcoins ($1.2 million). The goal is to have the technology and resources to build a decentralized network and provide a better social network experience. Synereo will reward contributors in AMPs – the network’s own currency which can be used to amplify messages within the social network. The crowdsale began March 23 and will end on April 22.\n\n“The $1.2 million will be what allows us to create a fully distributed application that’s up to the standards of modern, cutting-edge mainstream services in terms of the user experience – and that we expect would allow us to reach our first million users,” Dor Konforty, CEO and co-founder, told CCN.\n\nUsers can amplify their presence on the network by investing AMPs to increase the amount of views their post can receive. Hence, anyone on the network can purchase user attention. When other users see “AMPed” content in their streams, they in turn receive a portion of the AMPs as compensation for their attention.\n\nOnly 8 102 419 AMPs has been sold during the crowdsale. $1 is 183 AMPs which means Synereo only has sold AMPs worth 173 bitcoins or 44 275 USD during the first 15 days. Will they reach 4 700 bitcoins?\n\nhttps://crowdsale.synereo.com/\n\nResources needed to actualize vision\n\nKonforty said the crowdsale would allow Synereo to invest in resources that will allow it to actualize its vision.\n\n“We have a very crude UI (user interface) at the moment, meant to provide simple access for the Synereo developers. This is one of our most important goals for Synereo. We are aware of the fact that mainstream adoption of the platform hinges on its front-end and user experience.”\n\nAs more people contribute to the crowdsale, the price of AMPs will increase.\n\n“AMPs can be converted to any other currency. They will be traded on respected and established exchanges when the crowdsale ends,” Konforty said.\n\nHow proceeds will be distributed\n\nThe Synereo website explains the AMPs will be distributed as follows: 18.5 percent will be sold in the initial crowdsale; 10 percent will be used to compensate users as they join the network, invite others, and contribute to it; 7.5 percent will go to content creators who begin operating on the network; 10 percent to the founders of Synereo, vested over a period of 30 months; 11.5 percent for bounties to be awarded to contributors and developers; 42.5 percent for future funding rounds.\n\nThe Omni Foundation is supervising the crowdsale. The foundation has access to all transactional information, with their executives serving in the role of trustees for the AMP tokens.\n\n“As we are an existing legal entity and as our identities are fully disclosed, any misconduct in the sale will have harsh legal implications for the Synereo founders,” Konforty said.\n\n“However, we wanted to provide our backers with extra assurances with regards to the clean conduct of the crowdsale and with regards to the security of all funds handled. Real-time transparency and supervision are better than post-factum legal enforcement.”\n\nSynereo assures users complete privacy, total identity ownership and data control, and even anonymity if they seek it. The network has no single point of failure and is resilient to take-down attempts since it allows any two or more peers to communicate directly.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nA unique social network\n\nKonforty claims all leading social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube, are for-profit entities. Hence, the service they provide to users must generate revenue for the company and its shareholders.\n\n“Features that would benefit the users but would hurt the company’s revenue stream simply cannot be implemented,” he said.\n\n“In fact, user experience in these services is often degraded due to these considerations. Recent examples include Twitter’s annihilation of the third-party client ecosystem for the sake of creating a single Twitter client that can show ads, and Facebook’s reduction of organic page reach to increase spend by businesses. This profit-driven user experience model simply doesn’t exist in the Synereo decentralized network. With Synereo, it’s all about the user; literally nothing else matters.”\n\n“We will bring the Synereo user experience up to par with the industry standard,” Konforty told CCN. “Without a UI and an experience that users are comfortable and happy with, no modern application has a future.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Uma casa de câmbio da moeda virtual bitcoin apoiada pelo braço de investimento do Google e por uma famosa aceleradora de startups de Nova York vai encerrar suas atividades em Abril, ainda nesta semana.\n\nA plataforma Buttercoin vai deixar de funcionar neste sábado (11).

The malware program bogged down the police systems for 5 days after which the department finally decided to pay up.\n\nChief of Police Timothy Sheehan said, “Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists. We did everything we possibly could.” Timothy went on to add that, “It was an eye-opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.”\n\nIt was possibly the last resort given that even the cyber specialists from federal and state law enforcement along with two private cyber security firms were unable to retrieve the files.\n\nMalware programs such as CryptoLocker, KEYHolder, and CryptoWall enter into the system via emails. When the users open these tainted emails and click on the hyperlink given in the message, the computer is affected. The programs then encrypt the data and render the data useless unless a decryption key is provided.\n\nMoreover, the hackers demanded that the Bitcoin ransom be paid via Tor network, which makes it extremely difficult to trace the location of the hackers.\n\nThis is not the first instance of a police department being forced to pay. Earlier in November 2013, Swansea Police Department fell victim to a similar threat and had to pay $750 to get its files back. In January, the Midlothian police had to pay the hackers $500.\n\nThe Tewksbury Police Department could have chosen not to pay the Bitcoin ransom had it backed up its files and other crucial data. In Durham, N.H., chief of police Dave Kurz decided not to bow down to the threats of hackers as the department had backed up the encrypted information.\n\n“We had to clean essentially all the computers, but all of our data was prepared,” Kurz said.', 'Bitcoin wasn\'t built for banks. But as cryptocurrency technology evolves, bankers and financial technology startups have begun to consider ways that it could prove useful for financial institutions \x97 from speeding up correspondent banking to facilitating remittances.\n\nA provocative new report aims to clarify the future of the financial industry\'s relationship with Bitcoin and related technology. The upshot: banks are unlikely to embrace Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Distributed ledger technology, on the other hand, has plenty of commercial potential since it can help banks move financial assets faster and at lower cost without requiring them to take on the risks that accompany ""permissionless"" ledgers.\n\nBanks will remain wary of Bitcoin because its ""permissionless ledger"" relies on anonymous participants to validate transactions, cryptocurrency researcher Tim Swanson writes in ""Consensus as a Service: A brief report on the emergence of permission, distributed ledger systems."" This setup means that there is no one to hold accountable in legal disputes over the ownership of assets, should someone tamper with a transaction.\n\nThe issue isn\'t that Bitcoin is bad, according to Swanson, but that it was designed to facilitate online transactions rather than those involving real-world assets like homes and cars.\n\n""No bank\'s going to want to put a billion dollars of value [on a ledger] if it can be destroyed by anonymous validators,"" he said in an interview.\n\nBy contrast, distributed but ""permissioned"" ledgers use legal entities to validate transactions, providing banks with official records of asset ownership and legally accountable participants. This approach makes more sense for banks, according to Swanson, since ""in the real world of finance, all participants are already authenticated and entities like validators and transmitters require legal identities.""\n\nDistributed ledger technology has the potential to help banks send cross-border payments and settle and clear derivatives more efficiently, among other uses, Swanson argues. His report cites eight companies, including Ripple Labs, Eris Industries, Hyperledger and Clearmatics, that offer permissioned distributed ledger systems. (Swanson serves as an adviser to the latter two companies.)\n\n""The idea with the distributed ledger system is to say, \'how can we take the useful parts of Bitcoin \x97 or at least the ledger idea \x97 and integrate it with businesses that have legal reputations?\'"" said Swanson, who is known for tweaking the noses of Bitcoiners at conferences and on social media.\n\nHe is not a complete skeptic, however, given that he works in business development for the digital currency exchange Melotic, based in Hong Kong. But Swanson\'s conclusions are guaranteed to irk Bitcoin\'s early adopters and most passionate supporters, who often argue that its breakthrough technology is inseparable from the digital tokens used to reward participants for securing the system.\n\nFrom banks\' perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, according to Houman Shadab, a professor at New York Law School whose research frequently focuses on these technologies.\n\n""Distributed ledgers, at least for now, are more attractive because of the control they afford over the system,"" he said. ""They\'re not subject to the vagaries of price volatility of the underlying currencies. And also they have a more secure, distributed authentication process that doesn\'t rely on the incentives of miners who authenticate transactions based on the value of the currency.""\n\nGiven these differences, the report suggests that the fates of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger systems may be set to diverge, with each existing ""independently, not necessarily interdependently, of one another.""\n\nAt least one player already established in the distributed ledger space agrees with that assessment.\n\n""The financial industry isn\'t interested in alternative money and digital currencies,"" said Robert Sams, founder and chief executive of Clearmatics, which is developing a platform for clearing and settling over-the-counter derivatives. ""It\'s interested in the distributed ledger.""\n\nSuch technology is innately compatible with the way that financial institutions conduct transactions today, he said.\n\n""We live in a world of dematerialized assets and ownership as electronic book entries,"" Sams continued. Transactions involving these assets are ""held together by layers of accounting systems that are robust but not transparent, slow and expensive.""\n\nSams\' company sees particular opportunity in using the technology sprung from cryptocurrencies to overhaul securities settlements as well as the foreign exchange markets and OTC derivatives markets.\n\n""Distributed ledgers could replace the entire technological back end of dematerialized securities in real time, without the need for reconciliations and lots of financial controls,"" he said. ""That\'s what financial institutions find interesting.""', ""\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. speaks in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)\n\nRand Paul, the firebrand libertarian senator from Kentucky, is running for president. And early donors to his campaign are already noting how Paul is setting himself apart from the pack.\n\nHe's taking your donations in Bitcoin.\n\n[Rand Paul announces presidential run]\n\nPaul's Web site will accept traditional payment methods, too, of course, such as credit cards. But the GOP contender is the first declared candidate in the 2016 race to fund his White House bid with virtual currencies. It's possible Paul is the first presidential candidate in U.S. history to do so, in the latest sign of how politics and technology now frequently overlap.\n\nPaul has long admired virtual currencies. He's even thought about ways he would improve upon Bitcoin, which, for the unfamiliar, is a form of digital cash that can be spent on real-world goods and services.\n\nSo it's no surprise that he'd turn to it as a way to juice his campaign. But there's a longer-term strategic play, here, one that speaks to Paul's appeal among tech-focused libertarians in Silicon Valley and young people who are eager early adopters of new services. As my colleague Katie Zezima wrote this morning:\n\n[Paul is] opening offices in Austin and Silicon Valley and using platforms like Snapchat to broaden his appeal to younger voters who may not respond to traditional political ad buys or outreach efforts. Paul is also trying to tap into the vast well of tech money, holding meetings with big-pocketed potential donors in California and other tech hubs.\n\nThis raises a key question for Paul's campaign: Just how big is the techno-libertarian audience he's trying to reach? Although there's been substantial polling about Americans' libertarian leanings in general, their technological bent is less well-defined. Some surveys suggest video gamers identify more closely than others with libertarian beliefs. One (completely unscientific) reader survey conducted last year by the tech site Pandodaily suggested that the tech scene is still held primarily by liberals, with libertarians coming in a close second.\n\nStill, going after that crowd doesn't hurt his party, which needs to attract younger voters to succeed in the coming cycle.\n\nMeanwhile, by encouraging voters to donate with Bitcoin, Paul gets to take advantage of another benefit: Transactions by Bitcoin will probably cost his campaign far less in merchant fees, increasing his revenue slightly on every Bitcoin transaction. Over hundreds or even thousands of donations, those savings could add up.\n\nPaul isn't the first candidate to take Bitcoin. State-level candidates in a number of places, including New Hampshire and Vermont, have accepted donations in the virtual currency in previous campaign cycles. The Federal Elections Commission voted 6-0 last year to allow Bitcoin donations to political committees."", 'In light of recent events within the bitcoin industry, namely the Evolution Marketplace going up in a burst of flames with customer money, it has become clear that cryptocurrency deviates from traditional money in more ways than initially meet the eye.\n\nBitcoin, among a slate of other cryptocurrencies, violates the principle of fungibility within money - that is, each coin\'s transaction history differentiates them from every other bitcoin in circulation. With the collapse of the hidden Evolution Marketplace, these coins have now been tainted, and services are wilfully denying their deposit into wallets held by exchange businesses.\n\nBitcoin fungibility has been called into question and it is becoming glaringly obvious that this poses a threat to the stability and long-term usage of such currency. Exchanges want nothing to do with these stolen funds, and therefore, lessen their value in relation to otherwise identical cryptocurrency units.\n\n“Fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution. That is, it is the property of essences or goods which are capable of being substituted in place of one another."" - Merriam-Webster\n\nCryptocurrencies such as DASH (formerly darkcoin) have come onto the scene with promises of anonymizing transactions by design, something which is not implemented in the core of Bitcoin.\n\nDash has since seen a dramatic rise in value since the collapse of the Evolution Marketplace and could continue to gain traction as users discover the importance of relatively-untraceable transfers. However, what is becoming more apparent, is that Dash holds a competitive advantage over bitcoin in the very make-up of its monetary characteristic - that of improved fungibility among its coins.\n\n-- Dash has gained momentum following the collapse of Evolution Marketplace\n\nIs bitcoin perhaps too traceable? Does the anonymizing function of Dash and future cryptocurrencies pose a grave threat for the current king of cybermoney?\n\nOne could perhaps make the argument that this type of transaction history surveillance will only intensify with bitcoin similarly to how closely watched an individual\'s social media activity is today. Is it reasonable to believe that, eventually, all transactions will be \'forensically accounted\' for?\n\nAs we move forward, look for blockchain applications, which map the relationship (and the identities) behind digital money, something where Dash and other cryptocurrencies propose to be the \'Tor\' of digital money.\n\nTime will tell all, but it remains self-evident that bitcoin violates the principle of fungibility in a way which is structurally different from any form of money we have seen to date.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

During this period, the Bitcoin Core client 0.8 was released, which created a hardfork that was not fully supported and adopted by the miners.\n\nA hardfork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol that requires the Bitcoin network’s acceptance and adoption. Any alteration to the Bitcoin protocol, such as changes to the block structure or difficulty rules, or an increase in the set of valid transactions, is considered to be a hardfork. Some argue that the process to apply new changes to the protocol is slow, and such changes can be dictated only by certain individuals or a small group of people.\n\nThe fork that occurred in 2013 caused a rollback for those who upgraded to the newer version. Pieter Wuille, a top Bitcoin developer and contributor at the time, asked miners to roll back to version 0.7, and he sent an alert on the Bitcointalk forums to ask merchants to stop processing transactions until further notice.\n\nThe incident provides an example of how hard it can be for these hardfork alterations in newer versions to kick off within the network and among miners. A shortcoming of the currently used Bitcoin core protocol is that it isn't implementation agnostic, meaning only a supermajority of Bitcoin nodes are running the Bitcoin core software, thus core developers can dictate protocol features.\n\nDespite the fact that Bitcoin was first developed by Satoshi and then maintained and upgraded by a certain group of core developers, it has never restricted or imposed anything against the desires and opinions of the majority of the users and miners. In this way, modifications in the hardfork wishlist are only gradually implemented and added.\n\nIf we take a closer look at the Bitcoin protocol, we figure out that the only reason for its existence is that it is decentralized, it is strictly verified and it provides a consensus regarding the state of all the coins. At the end of the day, either the majority decides to accept a fork, or they do not. Such a decision can be guided and led by certain people, but it cannot be enforced by anyone.\n\nSimilar examples have occurred within the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). The consortium put a lot of effort into XHTML specifications that were eventually found by developers and users to be incompatible with existing real-world implementations and requirements. Therefore, XHTML was largely neglected, unlike HTML5, which came later and was easily adopted by everyone.\n\nWhile it is true that Bitcoin is quite slow in adopting changes, this can be seen as an advantage because it requires a consensus of the majority of its users in order to implement a new alteration, which makes it a democratic system. These changes have never been, and never will be, dictated to the users by anyone. Changes to the protocol can only be suggested and adopted if they truly add benefit to everyone, and this is why we all love Bitcoin.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

But starting a new value system also requires a level of faith in the people using the math. As “shitcoin” scams pile up, it’s becoming clear that new currencies need trust, too. And they don’t have it.\n\nNowhere is this more evident than the chaotic Paycoin saga. Paycoin, an alt-coin launched late last year, was marketed as a more stable alternative to Bitcoin. In the months since its launch, however, Paycoin founder Josh Garza has become a figurehead for crypto-chicanery. The contentious response to Garza and his coin highlights how volatile the fickle fraternity of digital dreamers can be.\n\nGarza has been accused of suckering people into investing in Paycoin and his businesses under false pretenses and then straight-up stealing money. Online forums like Reddit and Bitcointalk paint him as man peddling a “promise ponzi,” getting people to invest in schemes and then failing to deliver before moving onto the next one. There is an entire subreddit called joshgarzaisafraud.\n\nBut Garza and Paycoin loyalists claim the altcoin, which debuted last December to frenzied speculator interest, is getting deliberately tanked by crypto-extremist trolls and hounded by bitter blackmail tactics.\n\nBadbitcoin.org, a group that calls out fraudulent crypto schemes, has actually fiercely defended Paycoin, calling its detractors “haters” and “FUDsters”—FUD stands for “fear, uncertainty, and doubt.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut are the FUDsters really vengeful trolls, or is entrenched skepticism the only rational stance in a community walloped with scams?\n\nJust look at Mt. Gox, once the top dog Bitcoin exchange. CEO Mark Karpeles lost $473 million in his customers’ money in a full-on meltdown. Time after time people promote their hot new alternative coins as panacea to the problems of Bitcoin, convince people to invest time and money in their fledgling currency, and then “pump and dump,” aka take the money and run. There’s an entire category of investors known as “Coin Wolves,” who use their influence in the community to run up prices on coins, so they can sell out during the peak.\n\nMyCoin, VootCoin, XICoin, CryptoDouble are all scam projects from recent years that have left people poorer and more suspicious. So when it looked like Paycoin’s creators were reneging on a number of promises, it’s understandable that people would fear fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParanoia is sharp from all angles. Whether or not they’ve lied about literally everything else, Garza and and his CTO John Caceres are right on this point: Their efforts have given rise to a community of suspicion.\n\nBefore ascending to the dubious Olympus of altcoin-supervillainy, Josh Garza rose to prominence in the crypto world by building GAWMiners, a Bitcoin mining hardware business. Mining is one way people can get Bitcoin: If you use hardware to solve complicated mathematical problems, you’re awarded with a portion of Bitcoin. Compared to sketchy competitors like Butterfly Labs, which sold obsolete equipment or just never fulfilled orders, GAWMiners had a fairly solid reputation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGAW fueled enthusiasm for Paycoin by implying it would establish a $20 price floor for the currency. This made many people think they’d have no problem buying low and selling high, and excitement grew at the prospect of an easy buck. Early trades valued Paycoin at around $24. Then it plummeted dramatically.\n\nNow, Paycoin is currently valued well under a dollar. The SEC is inquiring into GAW Miners. Shapeshift.io, a crypto exchange where people traded Paycoin, made an unprecedented move and took the coin off its exchange for “a high threshold of evidence as fraud.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarza later backpedaled and insisted that while he had, in fact, estimated that the coin wouldn’t go lower than $20, he had never promised. This pissed people off. And when buzzed-about partnerships with big vendors like Amazon didn’t pan out, they got even angrier. Add a failed side projects into the mix—a service called “Hashlets” didn’t work out, with former friends calling the price “exploitative” before GAW shuttered it—and the roiling contingent of people speaking out against GAW kept growing.\n\nShapeshift.io CEO Beorn Gonthier told me he’s never seen anything like the hatred for Paycoin. “The extent of the outrage caused us to look into Paycoin ourselves,” he said. “We didn’t want to succumb to the mob mentality, and indeed much of the antagonism toward Paycoin was mob mentality.” Yet despite his wariness about bandwagon jumping, Gonthier felt obligated to ban the coin from his exchange— he found it too untrustworthy to trade.\n\nWhether GAW is a struggling business addled by an angry mob or a convoluted string of scammy tactics—or a little bit of both—anti-Paycoin people are not backing down. Last month, someone leaked a trove of Garza’s emails, including the ones I’d sent to Paycoin. The first batch made Paycoin look terrible, with emails detailing plans to rip off an investor named Rishab Jain called out as especially damning.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when I wrote Jain to find out how he felt about the deception, he was pissed for a different reason than I’d assumed: His “hacked” emails had been faked. “Most of these emails were edited or entirely created in the past few days from people who don’t like Garza I guess,” he told me.\n\nOkay, so there were clearly people into tanking GAW so much that they’d fake hacked emails to make them look bad. Then again, I know some of the emails are legit because they include the ones I sent. And just because people want to tank a company doesn’t mean they don’t have a good reason.\n\nAfter the hacked email debacle, people started complaining that they were unable to withdraw funds from Paybase, GAW’s exchange platform for Paycoin. Garza vehemently denied that he was leeching money from Paybase, but later the exchange announced it was shutting down on April 30, according to users—another GAW plan shuttered after resentment festered.\n\nThe whole altcoin industry is hobbled by fraud, aggrandizement that sets up huge flame-outs, major security flaws, and the persistent problem that their currency systems remain difficult to use on a daily basis. The biggest name in cryptocurrency is still, by far, Bitcoin, and while it is making inroads at mainstream acceptance—albeit far more slowly than supporters would like—even the movement’s OG coin is saddled with security problems that breed paranoia. Researchers recently identified hundreds of scams since Bitcoin gained popularity, pinpointing over $11 million lost to fraud. In a climate like that, it’s easy to see why Garza’s often-shifting promises are regarded with such intense suspicion.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Paycoin, it’s still uncertain exactly where it all fell apart. “It could be a scam, or just a foolish economic experiment, or even a good economic experiment that was just executed poorly,” said Beorn. “We don’t have enough evidence to judge these things, but we did have enough evidence to remove the coin from ShapeShift because a clear term and promise of the coin had been violated.”\n\nThe maelstrom around Paycoin is emblematic of one of the cryptocoin community’s biggest weaknesses—the culture’s erratic vacillation between bombastic ambition and sharp failure. It’s a movement that, by necessity, needs optimism and trust to survive, but with the continuous stream of disappointments, flame-outs, and heists, people are quick to cry scam. And they’re right often enough to keep doing it.\n\nGIF by Tara Jacoby']"
04/08/2015,"[""According to a month-old internal document originally drafted by the management team of the Bitcoin Foundation and which has now been openly published, the foundation is considering splitting into two separate organizations.\n\nOne of these organizations would effectively be the continuation of the current foundation, but reorganized as a promotional body. The other would be a made up of the core development team, split off to focus exclusively on development of the core protocol — which is currently the Bitcoin Foundation's mission.\n\nAlthough the newly released document indicates that the change might also make sense for tax purposes, the main reason for the proposed restructuring of the foundation seems to be its weak financial status, as exposed recently by newly elected board member Olivier Janssens.\n\nThe year 2014 was particularly disastrous for the foundation, as it lost some US$4.7 million worth of assets due to expenses and a falling bitcoin price. Since Patrick Murck was appointing as executive director in October of 2014, he cut monthly losses significantly and has since volunteered to take himself off the payroll. Despite this, the foundation is running out of funds quickly, and at current spending rates could run out of funds within a month. It may be a matter of interpretation, however, whether this represents an “effective bankruptcy,” as Janssens has phrased it. The board of directors in an official statement denied bankruptcy.\n\nIf the proposals to restructure the foundation are approved, this would mean a reorganization according to the “Mozilla approach,” as opposed to the current “Linux approach.” For the foundation itself, it would entail it becoming a promotional organization.\n\nAlthough many of the details of what exactly this would encompass are not included in the document, what is clear is that the foundation would focus foremost on public relations for Bitcoin, while it would also be involved with organizing a number of conferences. Additionally, the foundation could still lead funding efforts for a second organization that would exclusively focus on the development of Bitcoin core. This way, the foundation would require minimal staffing, and could cut down on expenses even further.\n\nIn addition to the restructuring of the current foundation, the new organization—referred to in the document as “New Co.”— would be established with the mission to specifically focus on engineering resources. The three core developers currently on the payroll of the foundation— Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen, Core Maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, and developer Cory Fields—would move to the new organization. Additional hires are planned.\n\nDetails regarding this proposed organization are lacking. The document states that “NewCo will be structured to specifically meet the needs of the highest value contributors in terms of oversight of their funds, most likely through direct board representation.” Additionally, the organization would lead an effort to establish a “Bitcoin Standards Body,” another separate organization, which would oversee standardization efforts for the Bitcoin protocol. The document suggests that “New Co” would soon be able to raise US$2 million.\n\nThe short history of the Bitcoin Foundation has been bumpy. It was founded in September 2012 with the intention to standardize, protect and promote the use of Bitcoin. This has always been controversial in the Bitcoin sphere, however, as some feared that such an organization could become a centralizing force in the decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe image of the foundation was further tainted in 2013 when two of its board members —CoinLab CEO Peter Vessenes and Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles — became involved in a legal struggle. One year later, Charlie Shrem and Karpeles both stepped down from the organization disgracefully.\n\nOn top of that, the election of Brock Pierce to the board in 2014 was regarded as controversial because of his alleged prior involvement in a sex scandal, although Pierce was never convicted and denies any wrongdoing. Andresen and the foundation have indicated that the tainted image as well as the corporate governance structure with elected board members are important reasons why funding has now dried up.\n\nWhether or not the Bitcoin Foundation will indeed split into two different entities is currently not clear. While the official statement released by the board of directors indicates that the plans have been approved, both Janssens and the other newly elected board member, Jim Harper, deny this to be the case. Furthermore, based on public remarks on the foundation message board by both Janssens and Andresen, members may get an important say in the matter.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The transaction was an all-stock deal, Lukasiewicz told Reuters, although he declined to give the total value.\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency created through a “mining” process where a computer’s resources are used to perform millions of calculations. It has been hailed as revolutionary by the currency’s advocates because of its lack of ties to a central bank and its potential as an alternative to credit cards to pay for goods and services.\n\nLukasiewicz said Coinsetter chief technology officer Marshall Swatt reached out to Cavirtex “just kind of on a hunch and it evolved form there.”\n\nCavirtex shut down in March following a breach that compromised security information including password hashes. Lukasiewicz said the exchange would resume operation later on Wednesday.\n\n“We saw a lot of assets in Cavirtex not only in terms of entering the Canadian market, but being a leader in it,” he said. “But probably the most important asset was the exchange’s compliance-approved domestic bank account in Canada.”\n\nHe said banking relationships had become difficult to obtain for bitcoin companies and “bitcoin exchanges have become the connecting point between the traditional banking institutions and the bitcoin ecosystem.”\n\nCoinsetter has an average daily volume of 1,200 bitcoins, or just over $290,000.\n\n“(We) will create a ... Canadian bitcoin exchange with low latency trade execution, margin trading and growing interaction with customers through our Toronto office,” said Swatt.\n\nIn midday trading, bitcoin was down 3.5 percent at $244.84 BTC=BRSP.', 'Coinbase is one of the world’s most popular bitcoin wallet touting an impressive 2.1 million users since its short inception in June, 2012. Their face paced growth has made it the target of proponents, critics, and now, cyber criminals. A suspicious email has recently been sent to an unknown number of Coinbase users, advertising an investment product with a guaranteed return of 150%. The emails were sent from [email protected] with the subject line, “We’ve got a message for You.”\n\nThe contents of the email are riddled with grammatical and syntax errors, an early warning sign that it may be fraudulent. As the email progresses, the reader pitched an opportunity for “risk-free” deposits which are “insured by the New York Stock Exchange.” The author likely meant to write “insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.” The FDIC is the actual agency that insures banks and other lending institutions whereas the NYSE is a platform for trading and, in fact, does not insure investments.\n\nPoor Quality, But..\n\nDespite the poor quality of its content, the fact remains the author was able to create an address that appears authentic and gain access to user email addresses in order to execute his scheme. Coinbase has verified that the email is NOT authentic as it did not come from them. Coinbase was reassuring in their email reply to CCN:\n\n“We’re aware and have taken immediate action to address the phishing attack, which is now resolved. No Coinbase customer data has been compromised.”\n\nThey acknowledge that there was an attack, but claim that no user data has been compromised. At the time of this writing, the attack occurred only three hours prior, not nearly enough time to conduct a thorough investigation. Many users have indicated they do not have accounts with Coinbase, collectively agreeing the perpetrator must come have gained access to the emails some other way.\n\nIn the event a security breach at Coinbase would occur, an insurance policy is in place that would restore,\n\n“the average amount of bitcoin stored online at any given time.”\n\nThe policy has been in place since November 2013. It would become effective, “in the event of a breach of our physical security, cyber security, or as a result of employee theft.” While all of this is reassuring, it is important to note that 97% of customer funds are stored offline.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Further Reading You’re infected—if you want to see your data again, pay us $300 in Bitcoins A small town police department just outside of Boston finally agreed to pay a $500 ransom to regain access to a police server that it had been locked out of after being infected with CryptoLocker ransomware. As the name suggests, once the malware infects a computer, it encrypts the drive and can only be unlocked once the private key is entered—for which the criminals demand a ransom payment.\n\nThe Tewksbury Police Department chief told its local newspaper, the Tewksbury Town Crier that those who infected the computers in early December 2014 were ""terrorists.""\n\n""Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,"" said Chief Timothy Sheehan. ""We did everything we possibly could.\n\n""It was an eye-opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything,"" he added. ""Paying the bitcoin ransom was the last resort.""\n\nFurther Reading We “will be paying no ransom,” vows town hit by Cryptowall ransom malware Tewksbury will now be added to the ever-increasing list of local law enforcement agencies that have been hit with with the malware. A suburban Chicago police department also agreed to pay a $500 ransom in February 2015, as did a Tennessee sheriff’s office. By contrast, the City of Detroit, Michigan and the Town of Durham, New Hampshire have refused.\n\nAccording to the Town Crier, the infected computer contained a significant amount of police data, including its ""Computer Aided Dispatch, records management, arrest logs, calls for service, [and] motor vehicle matters.""\n\nIt turned to the FBI, Homeland Security, and the Massachusetts State Police, ""as well as private firms in an effort to restore their data without paying the ransom.""\n\nIn 2013, Swansea Police Department, which sits south of Boston, paid a similar $750 ransom, just a month after Ars first reported on the phenomenon.', 'Startup OneBit is developing a Bitcoin wallet app that lets users pay at any store with contactless mobile payments via the MasterCard PayPass payment network.\n\nOneBit securely converts bitcoin on the fly at market rate into any major local currency using BitPay, and pays the merchant via their NFC payment terminals. OneBit will permit users to pay at any MasterCard PayPass-accepting merchant worldwide, with zero fees.\n\n“The magic that happens underneath” is done by BitPay, which converts the OneBit user’s bitcoin to the local currency of the merchant, and MasterCard, which actually sends the money to the merchant.\n\nOneBit was developed by entrepreneur Toby Hoenisch at a Mastercard Hackathon and, according to Hoenisch, got very positive feedback from MasterCard.\n\nMasterCard is helping OneBit get a partnership with a card issuer, and OneBit is trying to secure funding for industrialization. OneBit is available on an invitation-only basis to selected early-access testers.\n\n“We don’t want to launch a half-assed Bitcoin wallet that gets us in trouble for violating KYC laws,” says Hoenisch on Reddit. “And yes, legal is the main reason we can’t just ship it.”\n\nAnyone can apply for early access on the OneBit website.\n\nHoenisch has a background in AI, IT-security and cryptography, and his co-founders have backgrounds in user interface design and security.\n\n“I have been fascinated by Bitcoin for the last three years, but never quite found the right idea to form a company around until now,” says Hoenisch. “We managed to get MasterCard and DBS bank interested in OneBit and with their help, I am confident that we can build OneBit without getting burned like Charlie Shrem did.”\n\nOneBit has been invited to the selection days of the startup bootcamp fintech accelearator in Singapore. If Hoenisch and his team get into the startup bootcamp accelerator program, which will also give them access to DBS bank and their network, they plan to launch OneBit at the end of their three-month program on July 28th.\n\nIf Hoenisch and his team manage to get funding and launch the project, OneBit promises to be nothing short of revolutionary: Bitcoin holders will be able to pay merchants directly from the Bitcoin wallet on their phones without requiring merchants to take direct steps to accept bitcoin.\n\nNFC-enabled PayPass payment terminals are very common in Europe and Singapore, and increasingly common in Canada and Australia. Therefore, it seems likely that OneBit will make the life of daily bitcoin users much simpler and reduce their dependency on exchanges.\n\nThe direct involvement as a partner of MasterCard, whose APIs and SDKs are used together with those of BitPay to power the OneBit platform, may seem surprising to those who remember recent statements by MasterCard that indicated hostility to Bitcoin.\n\nIn a December 2014 submission to an Australian Senate inquiry, MasterCard urged regulators to move against the pseudonymity of digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\n“Contrary to transactions made with a MasterCard product, the anonymity of digital currency transactions enables any party to facilitate the purchase of illegal goods or services; to launder money or finance terrorism; and to pursue other activity that introduces consumer and social harm without detection by regulatory or police authority,” said the MasterCard statement.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) recently replied to the same Senate inquiry by stating that it is unlikely that any benefits of Bitcoin regulation would outweigh the potential costs. RBA’s head of payments policy Tony Richards also said that, while digital currencies are not legal tender, there is nothing to prevent two parties agreeing to settle a payment using a digital currency.\n\nPerhaps, after many similarly open-minded positions on Bitcoin taken by governments worldwide, MasterCard realizes that Bitcoin is here to stay and moving toward more integration with mainstream fintech.\n\nImage via OneBit.', ""“Everyone thinks bitcoin is the currency of criminals.”\n\nAccording to Alasdair Rambaud, senior vice president for payment solutions provider CardinalCommerce and a self-proclaimed bitcoin user, this is the only factor prohibiting bitcoin from mass adoption.\n\nRambaud believes that “most large merchants” in the US are currently looking into accepting bitcoin as payment, and that the reasons go far deeper than the publicity that can be gained.\n\nRambaud told CoinDesk:\n\n“I don’t see any other barriers to mass adoption of this aside from the image. It’s easy to use, super transparent and you don’t have to take any risk as a merchant.”\n\nThe two-year CardinalCommerce veteran explains that this strong value proposition was what encouraged his company to partner with bitcoin processor Bitnet on 25th March. The deal enables any CardinalCommerce merchant to add a bitcoin payment option through its existing integration with its OneConnection service.\n\nWhile positioning Cardinal at the forefront of alternative payment trends, however, the move followed what Rambaud described as 24 months of merchant demand for the offering.\n\n“We started an inquiry and started asking other merchants. The feedback was definitely positive. They said it’s definitely something that was interesting,” Rambaud continued.\n\nCompeting today\n\nThough enthusiasm within the bitcoin business community may be waning for e-commerce as a pressing use case of the technology, Rambaud offered a different take.\n\nIn particular, he framed bitcoin as a compelling international e-commerce option, one that would allow larger merchants to increase overall business.\n\n“Merchants, especially internationally, if they have an order coming from Nigeria with a credit card, they’re probably not going to accept it,” Rambaud explained. “But with bitcoin, there can be a different strategy, because it’s a guaranteed payment.”\n\nRambaud further stressed that large merchants have an incentive to reduce the high fees they currently pay to accept payment, suggesting that any solution that attacks this pain point is likely to spark interest.\n\n“Merchants are looking at how they can lower their cost for accepting payment and they’re seeing bitcoin as a way to lower that cost,” he added.\n\n'Revolutionary' payment\n\nDespite the number of alternative payments that have emerged in recent years, Rambaud said that bitcoin is pulling away from the pack by helping merchants avoid credit card fees and removing the need for currency conversion.\n\n“If you look at Google Wallet, MasterPass, all the new ones are sort of the same and they don’t change the cost for the merchant,” Rambaud said. “All of those alternative payments don’t change the business model.”\n\nRambaud suggested that the ease of use promised by the products hasn’t proven enough to overcome the similarity of these payment methods to more traditional options.\n\nFurther, he explained that one of the key reasons he uses bitcoin is due to the high credit card fees he used to pay on his frequent travels to Europe from the US.\n\n“I’m a French and US citizen, so I’m constantly using euros and dollars,” Rambaud said. “I found that using traditional methods of payment, these fees were pretty well hidden but fortunately I have a finance background so I was able to locate all of them and was not too happy with what I saw.”\n\nToday Rambaud has two bitcoin wallets – one connected to a US bank account, the other to a bank account in Europe.\n\nMerchant involvement\n\nKey to lowering these overall costs, however, will be that merchants incentivize bitcoin use through discounts, something that Bitnet partner Rakuten recently did upon its bitcoin launch.\n\nThese discounts, Rambaud said, are likely to be an effective way to create what he called a “win-win” situation for merchants and consumers, even those who may currently believe the credit card rewards points are the most compelling offers.\n\n“You have point junkies, but if you have a 2% transaction fee and you’re only getting 100 points, and someone else is saying we’ll give you 2% off for using bitcoin, I think you have a real value proposition. Your 2% that you’re going to give them is better than the reward they would get,” Rimbaud said.\n\nOf course, promoting this activity as the best course of action for bitcoin merchants will be something left to Cardinal’s new partner, Bitnet.\n\n“Now that we have a partner in Bitnet, they can explain the value proposition. We can engage the interest and they can come in with case studies around other merchants they have,” he added.\n\nHowever, for now, Rimbaud suggested that the bitcoin industry should have one overall goal in mind, concluding:\n\n”Anybody who’s working with bitcoin needs to work on the image of bitcoin.”\n\nImage via LinkedIn; John Copland / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, according to researchers, the decentralized and quasi-anonymous nature of Bitcoin renders it vulnerable to self-interested parties that seek to exploit the system.\n\n“There’s still a lot of uncertainty about the stability of the currency,” said Jens Grossklags, an assistant professor at Penn State’s College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST).\n\nGrossklags, along with Benjamin Johnson, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, and Aron Laszka, a research scholar at Vanderbilt University, are investigating how conflicting interests threaten to negatively impact the Bitcoin ecosystem. The overall goal of their research is to provide guidelines for ensuring that the currency remains long-term viable and trustworthy. They presented the results of their study in their paper, “When Bitcoin Mining Pools Run Dry: A Game-Theoretic Analysis of the Long-Term Impact of Attacks Between Mining Pools.”\n\n“Healthy competition is normal,” Grossklags said. “However, we want to avoid down the road that distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or other adversarial events are disrupting the overall Bitcoin economy.”\n\nPublished in 2008 and released as open-source software in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency system that is controlled through an online communication protocol and facilitated in a decentralized fashion. Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the block chain. The ledger uses its own unit of account, also called bitcoin. The system works without a central repository or single administrator, which has led the U.S. Department of the Treasury to categorize it as a decentralized virtual currency. While most stakeholders have jointly benefited from the growing importance of Bitcoin, according to Grossklags, Johnson and Laszka, misaligned incentives may undermine the stability of the system.\n\n“In particular, incentives to derive short-term profits from attacks on mining pools threaten the long-term viability of Bitcoin,” they wrote in their paper.\n\nBitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into the public ledger. This activity is called mining and is rewarded by transaction fees and newly created bitcoins.\n\nThe process of mining new bitcoins is organized in the form of a race in which the miner that solves a proof-of-work task first will be rewarded; all other miners will leave empty-handed. Individual miners have found it beneficial to join forces in the form of mining pools, as averaging mining proceeds across many participants makes earnings more predictable. In fact, a miner working alone may not win any race in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe specific setup of each mining pool, according to Grossklags, Johnson and Laszka, typically differs across several dimensions which can be tangible (e.g., related to the computing and communication infrastructure) or intangible (such as reputation or details of the payout schemes). The researchers term the sum of these factors the “attractiveness” of a mining pool.\n\nHowever, the rules governing how Bitcoin operates as a currency leave room for cheats to destabilize the system.\n\nFirst, attackers may abuse the resources of unsuspecting computer users for mining purposes through security compromises.\n\nSecond, attackers may attempt to redirect or siphon off mining capabilities from a competing pool.\n\nThird, attackers may diminish the mining power of competing pools through DDoS attacks or by exploiting weaknesses in the implementation of the procedure/software used by a particular pool.\n\n“Botnets, which are networks of infected machines, can be put in play and could give one or another mining pool some advantage over the other,” Grossklags said. “Such malicious attacks may be conducted to increase the earnings of one pool.”\n\nIn their paper, the researchers developed a game-theoretic model that allowed them to capture short-term as well as long-term impacts of attacks against mining pools. Game theory is a way to mathematically calculate how individuals might choose to cooperate, compete or cheat given the options available to them and the strategies of others. Using this model, they studied the conditions under which the mining pools have no incentives to launch attacks against each other (i.e., peaceful equilibria), and the conditions under which one mining pool is marginalized by attacks (i.e,, one-sided attack equilibria).\n\n“It is better for everyone involved that the equilibrium is peaceful,” Johnson said. “If one of the pools doesn’t get too big or attractive, then it is more likely that all the miners productively work for the system.”\n\nAccording to the researchers, evidence from the Bitcoin mining community has shown that the size of mining pools appears to be related to the probability of being targeted by an attack. The observations indicated that larger mining pools were more frequent victims of attacks.\n\nBuilding on those findings, Grossklags and his colleagues investigated the adversarial interaction between two representative mining pools that can choose between productive and destructive investments (i.e. computing power vs. DDoS attack on its competitor).\n\nThey found that in particular the relative size of the mining pools is a critical factor for the incentives to engage in attacks. This insight complements what is a well-known threat to the viability of Bitcoin. A mining pool controlling 51 percent of all bitcoin mining power could tamper with the block chain to do things like spend bitcoins twice.\n\n“People are most worried about the economic side of the currency,” Johnson said. “If you have one entity that controls more than 50 percent of the currency, this can prevent others from mining for it.\n\n“As a pool gets larger and larger, then the economic incentives actually point towards the other pools attacking it,” he added. “The upside is that if the pools are attacking each other, it mitigates the possibility of one pool growing too big.”\n\nThe research helps to understand how complex incentives impact the stability of Bitcoin mining, Grossklags said. The results imply that, in order to achieve a peaceful equilibrium, Bitcoin needs a proactive and informed user population to balance the objectives of short-term and long-term success. Aiming for mining dominance threatens to destabilize the economy well before any pool reaches the critical threshold of 51 percent.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has achieved undeniable success in the past several years, Grossklags and Johnson said, it remains to be seen whether the virtual currency will ever achieve the same legitimacy as credit cards or paper money. The international aspect of Bitcoin adds further complications, Grossklags said, since “malicious actors may be outside the jurisprudence of the U.S.” and could be difficult to prosecute.\n\n“Our study provides findings that are chipping away at the space of uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin mining,” Grossklags said. “Hopefully, our work will contribute to making this currency system more viable in the future.”\n\nGrossklags and Johnson presented their research on Bitcoin at the 2015 International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security that was held in late January in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nPeople in the Penn State community will have an opportunity to expand their knowledge about Bitcoin during IST Startup Week, which will be held April 13-17.

Big trading and investment houses don’t want to miss out on possible profit opportunities as bitcoin continues to grow.\n\nMore of the big proprietary trading firms are dipping their feet into bitcoin, thanks to the profit opportunity it can offer and its ability to streamline transactions, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal. The growing interest of Wall Street trading and investment firms serves to raise Bitcoin’s profile in the investment community and the economy at large.\n\n“Their involvement could help reduce the volatility in the market for bitcoin, which has struggled to gain legitimacy in part because of concerns about wild swings in its price.”\n\nMore trading and investment firms are using bitcoin for trades.\n\nMore traders enter the fray\n\nDRW Holdings LLC, a Chicago-based trading firm, is a founding investor in Digital Asset Holdings that launched last month.\n\nCumberland Mining & Materials LLC, a DRW subsidiary, has begun to experiment with cryptocurrency trading.\n\nCitadel Securities LLC in Chicago and KCG Holdings Inc. in Jersey City, N.J. were among the firms that offered to buy shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) which listed last month on OTC Markets. OTC Markets serves as a trading platform for companies that are less regulated than stocks listed on stock exchanges. BIT holds bitcoin in a fund that issues shares to SEC-accredited investors.\n\nWedbush Industries, a Los Angeles-based investment bank, also sought shares in BIT, which it sees as a good place to get started with bitcoin, a company spokesperson said.\n\nSome traders await regulatory input\n\nGlobal Trading Systems Inc. in New York is looking at trading bitcoin but is waiting for input from regulators.

The company has traded almost 800,000 bitcoins valued at more than $300 million since its inception.\n\nBitcoin is accepted by an estimated 100,000 merchants worldwide. In addition, investment in bitcoin and digital currency-based businesses has increased in recent months, reflecting interest by venture capitalists and other investors in non-currency uses for the technology that underlies bitcoin.\n\nSome of the recent bitcoin investment activity is designed to remove middlemen from the financial system and enhance record keeping and transparency in the broader economy.\n\nAlso read: Traditional bankers creating bitcoin derivatives\n\nTraders face challenges\n\nBitcoin can be challenging to trade due to the low number of buyers and sellers at exchanges. Some executives at the exchanges have sought to persuade high-frequency trading firms to establish markets in bitcoin.\n\nIn market trading, a firm offers both bids and offers for assets, so investors have a willing party to trade with. The trading firm tries to capture the spread between the bids and offers.\n\nFor trading firms to be more active trading bitcoins directly on a large scale, the bitcoin landscape will need to evolve. Charles Cascarilla, CEO of ItBit Pte. Ltd., a bitcoin exchange, said regulatory certainty will help.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'An internet of money. That\'s the dream.\n\nThrough bitcoin and other digital currencies, so many activists, entrepreneurs, and opportunists are chasing the dream. They envision a world where we can trade money as easily as we trade data, where anyone can send and receive currency from any machine on earth, where our financial system is controlled not by big banks or big government but by the people.\n\nThe trouble is: we need a way ensuring that the people can be trusted, that this vast network of machines can reliably keep track of our money, that no one can game the system and make off with money that isn\'t rightful theirs (or, at least, that no one will game things too easily). Bitcoin tackles this issue using a rather elaborate online system where people build specialized computers, or ""mining rigs,"" that do little more than solve random math problems all day long. But David Mazières is proposing a new method, one that affords trust—perhaps even a greater level of trust—without relying on the expensive and power-hungry mining operations that drive bitcoin.\n\nDavid Mazières is a professor of computer science at Stanford University. But right now, he\'s on leave at Stellar, a San Francisco non-profit that\'s seeks an extreme version of that dream. Stellar aims to create a worldwide network of machines that lets anyone send any currency and have it arrive as any other—bitcoin could arrive as dollars, euros as yen, Brazilian real as dogecoin—and last summer, the organization asked Mazières to show that all those machines could keep each other accurate and honest.\n\nThe result is a new kind of algorithm. You can think of as a mathematical model for online trust, and it can help drive not only the Stellar network, but all sorts of other online systems that seek to operate without a central authority, from digital currencies to stock markets to email services. As Mazières describes it, at the highest of levels, the algorithm provides a way for a vast network of machines to reach a reliable consensus. ""It\'s a way of having everyone in the world agree on something,"" he says. And this include everyone agreeing that everyone else is on the up-and-up.\n\nAchieving Consensus\n\nIt\'s a fascinating, if rather complicated, proof, and today, Stellar and Mazières are sharing it with the world. They\'re releasing a paper that describes this ""consensus algorithm,"" seeking comment from outside academics and developers, and they\'re open sourcing a new version of the Stellar software that makes use of it. Stellar had previously open sourced software for running its money network, but according to project founder Jeb McCaleb, it didn\'t work all that well with a large number of machines—and it needed a way of ensuring trust. ""We never really had a good proof for why the system works,"" he says. ""We needed to show that anyone can plug into the system, and it can remain robust.""\n\nDan Boneh, a computer science and electrical engineering professor at Stanford who specializes in cryptographic systems, has reviewed the paper, calling it ""pretty interesting."" The algorithm, he says, could help build a wide range of online systems that require many machines to securely and accurately work in concert. ""It can serve any system that\'s based on quorums, where we must all agree on what the state of the world is,"" he says. ""It can be used for payments transactions, the exchange of property rights, financial trading, all the standard applications of a trust ledger.""\n\nAt least, that\'s the theory. Although he has reviewed the paper, Boneh has not reviewed the software code—and that code is still evolving. Stellar must still turn theory into reality.\n\nTrust Without Miners\n\nStellar was bootstrapped by McCaleb, an early bitcoiner, and Stripe, the startup that helps drive online payments for he likes of Apple, Facebook, and Twitter. Like bitcoin, McCaleb and Stellar aim to create a universal online ledger that securely controls the movement of money from one place to another. But unlike bitcoin, it will deal in many currencies, not just one. And it won\'t use miners.\n\nBitcoin miners serve multiple purposes. These are the machines that run bitcoin\'s universal ledger, or ""blockchain."" And if you set one up, you\'ll receive a fraction of the new bitcoin currency the system creates with each passing day. That\'s how the system encourages people to run its network. But mining requires a pretty large investment too: you can\'t win those new bitcoin unless you build a pretty hefty rig that performs more mathematical busy work than most miners on the network. That\'s how the system engenders trust. ""If someone spends enough money on the infrastructure needed to mine bitcoin,"" Boneh says, ""then they have incentive to keep the system running well.""\n\nWith his algorithm—dubbed federated byzantine agreement—Mazières builds trust in a very different way. In short, he knits together a large trusted network from smaller trusted networks. In joining the network, you connect to people you know and trust. They, in turn, connect to machines they trust. And so on. If the system can show that none of the small quorums are separated from the rest, then we can all trust the larger whole. ""As an individual, I choose users that I can trust and those users do the same,"" Boneh explains. ""If we can achieve that combinatorial property, we can achieve consensus.""\n\nThat may sound simple. But the proof is not. As McCaleb explain it, in analyzing how the network is organized, the system can mathematically determine where the weak points are, and then work to shore up those weaknesses. Basically, it can help machines determine what other machines they should trust. ""You can see where you need to plug in to make the system stronger,"" McCaleb says.\n\nAccording to Boneh, who has worked alongside Mazières at Stanford but has no connection to the Stellar project, the algorithm is something new. Existing ""byzantine fault-tolerance algorithms"" do something similar, but they only work with a fixed number of machines. Stellar\'s algorithm, in theory, works with a unlimited number of machines. Plus, it allows more people to join the network because it doesn\'t require power-hungry mining rigs. ""Anyone can potentially participate in the consensus—and you don\'t burn up a lot of power,"" Boneh says.\n\nWhere\'s the Incentive?\n\nThe rub is that this system doesn\'t encourage people to add machines to the network in the way that bitcoin does. You don\'t have miners paying people for their hardware resources. But according to McCaleb, who launched one of the first big bitcoin exchanges, all sorts of organizations will help run the Stellar network simply because they want that ""internet of money.""\n\nUnlike bitcoin, McCaleb points out, Stellar is trying to build a system that handles all currencies, that means its audience is potentially larger, that more organizations will be interested in using it, from PayPal to Wells Fargo. These organizations will not just want to use the system, but help run it—so that they can ensure that it runs well. ""Anyone who is running a business on Stellar will want to run their own node,"" he explains. ""And because it\'s lightweight, asking people to run it is not a big thing.""\n\nIt\'s an idealistic pitch. But that\'s the nature of the project. Stellar isn\'t an startup designed make money. It\'s a non-profit intent on building a way for others to move it. That\'s an ambitious undertaking. But at least some of the pieces are in place.']"
04/09/2015,"['A spokesman from the first major online retailer to accept Bitcoin, Overstock.com, has confirmed that the company is planning to conduct exclusive Bitcoin-only customer outreach including sales and discounts.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Digital Currency Council vice president Sarah Martin ahead of his pitch at the Virtual Currency Today Summit at the end of April, the firm’s director of communications Judd Bagley explained that “incentives” were part of what was needed to increase consumer adoption of cryptocurrency.\n\n“We’re preparing to do our part to short circuit the cycle by adding additional motivations for customers to use Bitcoin. For example, there will soon be Bitcoin-only sales and discounts for purchases made with Bitcoin.”\n\nHe continued by reiterating Overstock’s longer-term plan to increase company-wide use of bitcoin. Both suppliers and staff are on the radar for expansion of Bitcoin’s role within the company, with a combination of “education and incentives” being seen as necessary to gain the necessary support. “It’s a classic chicken/egg conundrum when it comes to consumer adoption,” Bagley explained, his comments gaining considerable recognition on social media.\n\nOverstock CEO Patrick Byrne first signaled in January that staff would be given the option of receiving their salary in Bitcoin, with the company at the same time installing a Bitcoin ATM at its headquarters in Salt Lake City.\n\nWhile the varied state-by-state environment has been a testing one for its Bitcoin integration, the company could be set to benefit from its home state of Utah’s seemingly moderate stance on cryptocurrency regulation. A bill advocating acceptance of Bitcoin for state services such as payment of taxes, via the setting up a specialized committee to investigate the potential role Bitcoin could play at state level, is currently being considered.\n\nBagley also offered his thoughts on the trending debate of how mass adoption of Bitcoin or blockchain technology will be facilitated, and specifically which will come first, stating:\n\n“Longer term, we need to develop more non-currency applications for decentralized ledgers such as the Blockchain, and let the public get comfortable with the ease and security of it. Once that’s happened, cryptocurrency will seem an obvious next step. That’s when things will take off.”\n\nHe added, “In other words, Bitcoin 2.0 will facilitate the adoption of Bitcoin 1.0. I believe that someday, the fact that currency was the first application of the Blockchain will be the answer to a business trivia question.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

This could be a digital platform for the future"".\n\nThe news comes after Orange expanded its VC effort with the creation of Orange Digital Ventures, announcing its goal to support 500 startups worldwide by 2020 in March.\n\nOther telecommunications companies have embraced investing opportunities in the digital currency sector. DoCoMo, Japan\'s predominant mobile phone operator, invested in San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Coinbase during its $75m round in January.\n\nBitcoin payments are also seeing increasing adoption in the communications industry. Perseus Telecom, a high-speed, heavy-bandwidth communications channel provider for major global stock and securities exchanges, partnered with GoCoin to begin accepting bitcoin payments in early 2014.\n\nT-Mobile Poland also announced that it was trialling bitcoin mobile top-up payments in February, following a partnership with local bitcoin processor InPay S.A.', 'SAN FRANCISCO — Hackers targeted SendGrid, a mass email service used by 180,000 companies including Uber, Pinterest, Spotify and Foursquare, to infiltrate Coinbase, one of the most popular Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nSendGrid confirmed that one of its Bitcoin-related clients was compromised on Wednesday. It would not name the customer, but Coinbase confirmed in an email on Thursday that hackers had compromised its SendGrid account, though it said no Bitcoin were stolen.\n\nIn a statement, SendGrid said it believed the attack was an isolated one. However, the attack follows a similar pattern to an attack last year against a former SendGrid customer, and there is evidence that other Bitcoin companies are being targeted via their mass email providers.\n\nMass email services like SendGrid, which sends 14 billion emails a month, are a powerful tool for hackers looking to send spear-phishing emails on a large scale. SendGrid sends transactional emails on behalf of trusted companies like Spotify and Pinterest, alerting customers to updates in the service and new followers. Most customers don’t even realize the emails are coming from SendGrid, making it more likely that they would take the bait and click on malicious code that grants hackers access to their accounts.\n\nLast year, ChunkHost, a fast cloud service provider that accepts Bitcoin and is used by many Bitcoin-related clients, said it was targeted by hackers through its SendGrid account.\n\nNate Daiger, a co-owner of ChunkHost, said that a hacker had managed to persuade a SendGrid employee to change his company’s account information over the phone, took over ChunkHost’s account and reset passwords for two of its Bitcoin-related clients in an apparent attempt to steal Bitcoin wallets.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Daiger said, the attack was unsuccessful because both clients used two-factor authentication, a security mechanism that requires a second password when logging into an account from an unrecognized machine.\n\nMr. Daiger said this was the second time his company was targeted by hackers through SendGrid. When Mr. Daiger tried to warn other SendGrid customers about the potential security hole in a blog post, he said that he was asked by SendGrid to retract his post. He refused. In an email, SendGrid denied ever asking Mr. Daiger to retract the blog post.\n\nIn a statement, SendGrid said that it was not the only email service provider that had been targeted in this week’s attempts to steal Bitcoin, and that the compromise at Coinbase, using its service, was an isolated incident.\n\n“From SendGrid’s perspective, this appears to be an isolated attack on one SendGrid customer, however we are aware that users of other Bitcoin related businesses have been targeted this week with phishing attacks via multiple email service providers,” the company said in a statement.\n\nOnline, users of two Bitcoin services, including Localbitcoins and Btcjam, complained they were receiving spear-phishing emails through mass email service providers. They did not name the service providers, although one Localbitcoins spear-phishing email appeared to come from Mailchimp, a SendGrid competitor that sends email newsletters on behalf of seven million customers. Mailchimp did not return repeat requests for comment, nor did Localbitcoins or Btcjam.\n\nBut the motivation for attacking these companies was crystal clear.\n\nMr. Daiger said that although hackers were ultimately unsuccessful in stealing Bitcoin, he did not foresee them surrendering their efforts any time soon. “The fact that you could potentially steal thousands or millions of dollars make these attacks pretty motivating!” he said.', 'A Mississippi electric company has filed suit against GAW Miners for non-payment and breach of contract.\n\nAccording to court documents, Mississippi Power Company (MPC) is seeking repayment of roughly $224,000 in services, as well as nearly $50,000 in costs incurred specifically for servicing GAW.\n\nMPC is looking to collect an additional $73,493.48, an amount the utility claims it is entitled to as a result of the alleged breach of contract.\n\nThe suit was filed on 8th April in the Southern District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The electric utility is being represented by Mississippi-based law firm Balch & Bingham LLP.\n\nIn total, MPC is seeking $346,647.29 plus interest and any court fees associated with the suit.\n\nThe complaint stated:\n\n“By GAW failing to make payments on a monthly basis for electric service provided by MPC, it is in breach of the contract. Additionally, by failing to complete the one-year term under the contract, GAW is in breach of the contract. Due to GAW’s breach of the contract, MPC has suffered certain damages, including, but not limited to, the Installation Cost, the Monthly Minimum Amounts and the Past Due Balance.”\n\nThe lawsuit comes months after GAW discontinued its mining operations.\n\nThe move to cease mining, which at the time the company attributed to unfavorable conditions and cost issues in a notice posted to the ZenCloud cloud mining platform, stirred controversy among customers due to the sudden nature of the shutdown.\n\nCustomers first became aware of the previously unannounced shutdown on 30th January, several days after MPC claimed in its court filing that it shut off service to GAW\'s Purvis, Mississippi data center.\n\nBreach of contract alleged\n\nThe court filing stated that GAW became an MPC customer in late September 2014, with electric service commencing in mid-October. Prior to the start of electric service, MPC said, it spent $49,335.20 installing transformers and equipment to provide GAW’s data center with power.\n\nMPC alleged in its complaint that GAW failed to meet its payment obligations, making only a single payment between the start and termination of services.\n\n""MPC began to provide electric service to GAW on or about October 15, 2014. Since that time, MPC has billed GAW on a monthly basis. To date, GAW has only made one payment to MPC for the electric service provided, despite MPC\'s monthly billing statements being sent to GAW,"" the company alleged in the complaint.\n\nOn 27th January, the filing stated, MPC shut off electric service at GAW\'s request.\n\nFollowing the cessation of services, the filing explained, MPC unsuccessfully sought repayment of the funds it said are owed by GAW. Documents submitted in the complaint include an invoice dated 10th February, requesting payment of $223,818.61, as well as a 6th March demand letter from Balch & Bingham.\n\nIn a post on the HashTalk community forum, GAW CEO Josh Garza said that the suit arose as a result of “a dispute over the fee structure”.\n\nNeither GAW nor MPC immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe full court filing can be found below:\n\nMississippi Power Company vs. GAW Miners, LLC\n\nPowerline image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Hasen, a campaign finance expert at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law. The system already relies on some measure of trust from candidates, he said, “but the difference with Bitcoin is that it is inherently untraceable.”\n\nIn a ruling last year, the Federal Election Commission agreed to allow a political action committee to accept Bitcoins with a voluntary limit of $100, but the commissioners split over how the online currency — which can fluctuate widely in value — should be treated on a broader scale or whether it should be capped.\n\nVideo\n\n“Bitcoins are no more anonymous than any other contribution,” wrote Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner who was then the chairman of the panel. He said that technological innovations should be embraced in the political system and that Bitcoins should be treated no differently than a computer, securities, a painting or other legal, “in-kind” contributions.\n\nBut the three Democratic commissioners — Ann M. Ravel, Steven T. Walther and Ellen L. Weintraub — were much more cautious in endorsing the limited use of Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoins should be treated the same as cash, with a cap of $100, to protect against unethical and illegal activities, the three commissioners wrote. “The fact that Bitcoins are ultimately untraceable makes prophylactic measures at the outset of the transaction particularly important,” they said. The commission did not adopt the cap.\n\nFor Mr. Paul, who has been sharply critical of the government’s electronic surveillance programs as an attack on privacy, his embrace of Bitcoins — with their added layers of privacy — is a way to establish his bona fides with younger voters who put a premium on Internet freedom and technology.\n\n“Senator Paul will run the most tech-innovative campaign in 2016,” a spokesman, Sergio Gor, said when asked about the decision to accept the digital currency. “From Snapchat to Bitcoin, we’ll engage in various forums before anyone else.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“This is certainly new territory,” said David Mitrani, a Washington lawyer who specializes in campaign finance law and has represented several candidates who have accepted Bitcoins.\n\n“It is traceable, but only if the campaign follows the strict instructions that were given by the commission” for identifying the donor, he said. “If a committee doesn’t implement these strict measures, there’s certainly a concern.”\n\nAs an experiment, Mr. Mitrani tried to make an online donation of more than $200 in Bitcoins on Mr. Paul’s campaign website — above the voluntary limit that his campaign placed on Bitcoin donations.\n\nThe donation was rejected. “Bitcoin donations are limited to $100,” the automated response said. “If you would like to contribute more than $100, you may select Credit Card as your payment option and contribute up to $2,600 for the primary election and up to $2,600 for the general election.”\n\nRepresentative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, became the first member of Congress to accept Bitcoins as donations last year.\n\nMr. Polis said he collected $1,986 in Bitcoins, a tiny fraction of the nearly $1.2 million he raised over all in his 2014 re-election. He said Bitcoins were not only a way to give people another way to donate, but also to show his support for Internet freedom, a cause he has championed.\n\n“It’s no riskier than any other kind of contribution,” he said.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts predicted that Mr. Paul would be the first of many presidential candidates to rake in Bitcoins.\n\n“He’s at the forefront of a tech revolution, like the first candidates to have websites,” said Brian Klein, a Los Angeles lawyer and a Bitcoin supporter who has represented many clients involved in the currency.\n\n“I bet other presidential candidates will follow his lead, and soon,” Mr. Klein said. “I also believe in a year or two, this won’t be a story because every candidate will accept Bitcoins — just like every candidate has a website.”', 'New Jersey is known for many things. As a burial ground for New York mobsters. Home to an impressive array of environmentally toxic factories. Atlantic City is the established gambling capital of the Eastern United States. Newark, New Jersey: one of the United States’s most criminal-minded cities. And a catchy state tourism jingle “New Jersey and You. Perfect Together!”. Now you can add one more feature to its impressive resume. New Jersey is ready to begin the double taxation of New Jersey residents who own and use Bitcoin for retail transactions.\n\nAs someone who lived in New York for over thirty years, I could go deep into a rant of all the debilitating issues New Jersey injects into American culture. Today, we’ll focus on their generally shady business ethics.\n\nNew Jersey and Bitcoin Taxation\n\nHere’s the thing with Bitcoin and state or national governments. Bitcoin is not “legal tender” anywhere in the United States. You can say the same about Bitcoin and pretty much any sovereign government on Earth. You cannot pay your taxes, parking tickets, or any state fees with Bitcoin. It is not accepted as money by any government. So where does the business ethics argument come from that it is indeed taxable by the state if it has no real value to the state? Bitcoin is, in effect, a digital marker of value to individuals and a few cutting-edge businesses. Yet, New Jersey sees fit to tax Bitcoin as property for owners, and as a taxable “barter transaction” when used for a retail transaction. So Bitcoin gets none of the benefits of being a currency in the state of New Jersey, but all of the downside of being “legal tender”.\n\nRegarding the use of Bitcoin, the New Jersey Division of Taxation issued this technical advisory memorandum (Click here for it in its entirety.) It explains how New Jersey sees Bitcoin as a stream of revenue for the state’s coffer, as each party “gives something of value to the other in order to receive something of value in return,” according to the memorandum. It continues:\n\n“As a result if a seller uses convertible virtual currency as consideration for goods or services, sales tax is due based on the amount allowed in exchange for the virtual currency. If the customer that provides convertible virtual currency in the trade receives property that is subject to tax, the customer owes tax based on the market value of the virtual currency at the time of the transaction, converted to U.S. dollars.”\n\nAlso read: New Hampshire Bitcoiners Testify to State Regulators\n\nIn other words, according to the state, any barter transaction is taxable. If I give you a pair of shorts, and you give me a shirt, this is a state-taxable transaction. You can be legally seen as a tax cheat if you don’t submit for taxation any swap of goods, whether you use fiat currency or not.\n\nMaybe that’s wonderful to all the statist out there who like more and more tax burdens on citizens, but double-taxation is “dirty pool”, no matter who plays it. Just because Bitcoin is innovative and can do many things doesn’t give the state an ethical leg to stand on in taxing it over and over again.\n\nAnd, in the end, all this can serve to do is to drive Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related businesses to better locales with more ethical, less predatory tax codes. Bitcoin is not legal tender, so it should not be just another revenue stream for the state. A perfect example of where the government takes from the citizenry but doesn’t give back. This anti-Bitcoin memo, which is not up for a vote as a referendum by the citizens of New Jersey, is an authoritarian decree by a totally unaccountable arm of the state. It is anti-innovation and anti-digital currency. It just turns Bitcoin into a honey pot for the state to tax every time it’s used. Why would anyone use Bitcoin in New Jersey?\n\nDid you really expect any better economic ideas from New Jersey? New Jersey seems very happy to sit in the shadow of New York, fearing innovation and new business, and driving it away into the light of more progressive locales like New Hampshire. Bitcoin is a new technology where everyone picks a side. Are we working with it, or against it? Do we see a future with it, or without it? New Jersey and its autocratic state memorandums have chosen which side they’re on.\n\nNew Jersey and you are not “perfect together”, unless you like more taxes and less innovation. That goes for any government taxing Bitcoin, and essentially banning it through legislation and taxation.\n\nImages courtesy of Wikimedia.commons\n\nWhat do you think of New Jersey’s state taxation stance on digital currency?

As the original text to the filing reads:\n\nA merchant can typically open a standard PayPal account and begin accepting payments through PayPal within a few minutes. Most online or mobile merchants can onboard quickly and are not required to invest in new or specialized hardware. Our Payments Platform supports growth with a variety of value-added services designed to help businesses of all sizes manage their cash flow, invoice clients, pay bills, and reduce the need for merchants to receive and store sensitive customer financial information. For our standard service, we do not charge merchants setup or recurring fees. A merchant can also integrate with Braintree to begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards, PayPal, Venmo, digital currencies such as Bitcoin, or other payment solutions with a single integration.\n\nIn September 2014, PayPal announced it would accept Bitcoin via integration with Braintree, and the same month announced partnerships with Coinbase, BitPay and GoCoin. Via the PayPal Payment’s Hub merchants could use customizable APIs to integrate Bitcoin into their shops for digital goods. At the time, it released a video hinting at Bitcoin integration.\n\neBay CEO John Donahoe said in 2014 that Bitcoin would play an “important role” in eBay’s plans before the two companies agreed to a split due to a changing digital payment’s landscape.\n\n“PayPal is playing the role of the intermediary, but the cost will be left up to the merchant and the payment processor,” said Scott Ellison, PayPal’s senior director of competitive intelligence and corporate strategy, at the time of the original announcement.\n\nThe digital payments firm will split from its former parent company, eBay, Inc., effective at the end of 2015. As eBay writes of the split in the filing:\n\n…The commerce and payments landscape is rapidly changing, and each business faces different competitive opportunities and challenges. Consequently, in September 2014 the board decided to separate the businesses. As independent companies, we expect eBay and PayPal will be sharper and stronger, and more focused and competitive as leading, standalone companies in their respective markets. eBay and PayPal also will benefit from additional flexibility and agility to pursue new market and partnership opportunities.\n\nWhether or not PayPal will pursue a more aggressive Bitcoin policy has yet to be seen. In 2014, weighing in already on Bitcoin currency regulations, the company told the Australian Senate:\n\n“While the currency itself should not be regulated, and transactions by individual users without the assistance of the intermediaries should not be regulated, companies that provide a financial service for digital currency transmission, for issuance or sale of digital currency, or for exchange with other currencies such as the Australian Dollar, should be regulated in a manner similar to the existing regulations that apply to other payment services… Those regulations, however, should be adapted to recognize the specific details of how different digital currencies work, particularly ‘decentralized’ digital currencies that are not controlled by a specific issuer.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Once again, artist Marguerite Christine has sent Internet denizens down a cryptographic rabbit hole.\n\nEarlier this month, Christine published her third Bitcoin puzzle painting with this challenge: “The painting is a # puzzle, there is 4.87 # bitcoin concealed by this image. Happy # EasterEgg.”\n\nI’m not sure “happy” is the word that the multitude of treasure hunters would use to describe their efforts to unlock the secret and claim the Bitcoins. But it has once again become a massive obsession for many searchers. Just scroll through this thread on Reddit dedicated to solving it, or this one on Bitcoin Talk.\n\nThe prize is worth roughly about $1,400, but that doesn’t really justify the huge time investment to solve it. Clearly, being part of the challenge and an obsession to solve the riddle are a reward unto themselves for many participants.\n\nThis is the third Bitcoin puzzle in a series called “The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto” (the name or pseudo-name of the person credited with creating Bitcoin).\n\nChristine is the lead of the project, and this time around she created the cryptographic puzzle with the help of three other team members: Rob Myers, an artist and programmer based in Vancouver, B.C.; Ruben Alexander, a graphic designer based in Massachusetts; and Tyler, a nano-materials engineer based, like Christine, in North Carolina.\n\nIf you want to get a sense of just how complex the puzzle is, and how much work goes into creating it, then I suggest you (try to) read the 32-page explanation for the solution to her last piece.\n\nI reached out to Christine, 29, to ask her why she creates these pieces and what inspired her. In an email exchange, she said the project came out of her growing involvement with the Bitcoin movement.\n\n“I’ve learned about cryptography gradually, beginning with trying to understand Bitcoin in 2013,” she said in an email exchange. “However, I’ve always been fascinated by machine learning and pattern recognition.”\n\nThe more she connected with other Bitcoin community members, the more inspired she became to reflect that in her art.\n\n“I found myself making this work from a progressional level of involvement in the Bitcoin community,” she said. “First, I was doing freelance work for emerging startups. Then I found myself making friends with the folks at the relative media outlets and started making portraits.”\n\nBut while the painting is the end result, it is only the very last stage of her own work, a process she’s found every bit as thrilling as the art.\n\n“Scheming the artwork, the stories, the trail is probably as addicting as playing them,” she said. “Mystery has always intrigued us, art on its own is a cryptic puzzle, but what happens when we combine art that literally conceals the patterns and data that lead to money? I wanted to find out.”\n\nStill, she was surprised by the degree to which her own growing obsession with Bitcoin, cryptography, and art seemed to resonate with others.\n\n“The response has been astonishing,” she said. “I honestly wasn’t prepared for how many people took to it. It was staggering. I also didn’t anticipate how emotionally attached people would become to the puzzles. People made friends and formed teams, there was a range of personalities who morphed into characters within the pages of the forums. The puzzle evolved into an emotionally saturated adventure novel.”\n\nIn an email, deCourcelle said he decided to get involved because he felt it would help spread the word about Bitcoin.\n\n“I believe there are new, innovative ways we can educate the public regarding Bitcoin, cryptography and blockchain technology,” he said.\n\nAlexander said he contacted Christine after becoming hooked by reading the 32-page solution to the last puzzle.\n\n“I’ve seen the first examples of cryptocurrency visual art on bitcointalk, reddit, and from http://cryptoart.com,” he wrote in an email. “Bitcoiners definitely challenge my definition of what art is with some of the funnier pieces being made in mspaint (e.g. magic internet money wizard).”\n\nMyers said he learned programming at art school and had used encryption in previous commercial networking projects.\n\n“My background is in art and code so this project was very much in my main line of work,” he said. “It was a good way to put what I’ve been learning about cryptocurrency into practice.”\n\nThere is no deadline for solving the puzzle. Meanwhile, Christine said she’s already working on her next Bitcoin art.', 'If bitcoin acceptance reaches a critical mass where necessities of food, shelter, and clothing can be bought with it, it will likely have reached a tipping point where it displaces national currencies.\n\nIn this scenario, many areas of the world would be leapfrogging banking infrastructure and traditional money wire transfers. Most notably this would describe the financial landscape in developing economies such as the nations of Africa.\n\nBitcoin Leapfrogging Banks\n\nLeapfrogging is described as a theory of economic development, which skips inferior or obsolete technologies in order to move directly to advanced ones. Take, for example, phone coverage in African countries. Landlines and grids for household use were never fully developed because, by the time Africa came into market view, mobile phones were the new paradigm of telecommunications and hence, the entire infrastructure for household landlines was leapfrogged by cellular technology.\n\nSimilarly, Bitcoin technology could leapfrog the banking infrastructure of western economies and go directly to a new financial paradigm and serve the needs of the vast number of the unbanked in these regions. All that would be required on behalf of the citizens is a mobile device with internet connectivity.\n\n-- World Unbanked Population (ALBERTO CHAIA, 2010)\n\nWorldwide, approximately 2.5 billion people do not have a formal account at a financial institution. Access to affordable financial services is linked to overcoming poverty, reducing income disparities, and increasing economic growth.\n\nIf one third of adults don’t use formal banking systems, can you imagine what a bank account stored in cyberspace will allow them? Bitcoin will benefit Africa more than any other area in the world once it is properly accessible and accepted. In doing so, it would have a considerable effect on pulling struggling African economies out of the dark and into the developed and modernized world.\n\n“The combination of ubiquitous Internet-connected mobile devices and digital currency presents a tremendous opportunity to radically expand access to financial services on a worldwide basis.” - Jeremy Allaire, Circle Internet Financial, 2013 US hearing on digital currencies\n\nMobile Payments\n\nThe potential to provide financial services worldwide is echoed by the adoption of mobile payment technologies such as M-Pesa, a mobile-phone based money transfer and microfinancing service for Safaricom and Vodacom.\n\nM-Pesa is estimated to have a near 70% market share in regions such as Kenya and are becoming more accepted in surrounding countries.\n\n-- Mobile Payments Africa (WORLD BANK, 2012)\n\nAdmittedly, there remain many social barriers needed to bridge the unbanked to the rest of the financial world. Bitcoin does not help the illiterate learn to read instructions, nor does it guarantee someone with a mobile phone will want to do banking through it. Traditional customs of African countries also show that their citizens more often rely on societal traditions of borrowing money from friends and family rather than a third party.\n\nCurrency Mismanagement\n\nBeyond just mobile payments and access to banking infrastructure, several African economies are the product of mismanaged currency policy. Zimbabwe’s legacy of collapsed currency, with inflation reaching a nauseating 231,000,000% in mid-2008, is a prime example of such disastrous government intervention.\n\nBecause of the devastating effects of hyperinflation, Zimbabwe has since adopted the US dollar as the main currency, a position it still holds today. The hyperinflation that crippled Zimbabwe was largely caused by currency being too liberally printed, a swollen stock of money chasing a diminished supply of goods. The economy since has been recovering albeit only slowly making ground.\n\nWith a young population set to explode in the coming decades, Africa is in prime position to benefit from a financial network built around Bitcoin. Since the money supply of bitcoin is hard capped, and money printing is impossible, currency manipulation becomes much less of a concern. Governments in Africa will have fewer options of instituting thoughtless policies once bitcoin is adopted by the populous.\n\nBitcoin may not be the definitive answer for the masses that remain unbanked, but it is at least a step in the right direction. The hotspots for adoption will be most apparent in geographies, which have a very unreliable currency and financial infrastructure to back it. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that out of all the nations of earth, African countries will stand to benefit the most from financial technology such as Bitcoin.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

04/10/2015,"[""Reid Hoffman has an expert eye for promising tech startups. The LinkedIn chairman and co-founder's early stakes in Facebook, Airbnb and Dropbox prove he's able to see the next big thing before most of us even know what it is -- and it’s paid off for him time and again.\n\nThese days, the so-called “startup whisperer” is placing his bets on Bitcoin. As a full-time partner at venture capital firm Greylock Partners, he claims his primary focus is to invest in “world-class entrepreneurs with new categories of ideas with the possibility of massive scale.” One of those entrepreneurs is Wences Casares, co-founder of Xapo, an ambitious, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Bitcoin wallet and storage startup. With Hoffman leading the charge, Greylock invested $20 million in Xapo last year.\n\n“Bitcoin has the potential to be a massively disruptive technology,” Hoffman wrote in a post announcing the investment last July. “It is the leading digital currency and it’s growing fast.”\n\nRelated: LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman: Success Tips From Silicon Valley\n\nThen, in November -- a month before Bloomberg declared Bitcoin the worst-performing currency of 2014 -- he announced a hefty personal stake in Bitcoin that he brokered, a $21 million investment into Blockstream. The Montreal-based startup aims to improve upon Bitcoin’s blockchain backbone, the shared public ledger upon which the virtual currency’s entire network relies.\n\nWe caught up with the father of online professional networking recently to find out why he’s betting big on Bitcoin and why he thinks the controversial cryptocurrency is here to stay. What follows are portions of that interview, edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nRelated: Why This Internet Pioneer Thinks Bitcoin Has the Power to Break the Cycle of Poverty\n\nWhen did Bitcoin first pique your curiosity and when did you become a believer?\n\nI first got into it after speaking with Wences Casares, who I refer to as Patient Zero for Bitcoin in Silicon Valley. Patient Zero is the first infection of a viral contagion.\n\nI’d been paying attention to Bitcoin because a couple of other people that Wences had talked with, like Katana Capital founder Charlie Songhurst, had also talked to me about it and said that it was very important. No one had made the argument in a way that stuck yet, but it made me curious. I started to really think about it, so I sought out Wences in the summer of 2013. We had a fairly thorough conversation. He articulated very strong positive theories about Bitcoin and I began to feel empowered.\n\nRelated: IBM Looking at Adopting Bitcoin Technology for Major Currencies\n\nWhat is most interesting about Bitcoin to you? What attracts you to it?\n\nOnce I started really digging into it, I came to realize that there are three aspects to Bitcoin that are interwoven and Bitcoin is most interesting because of them. They are: One, it’s an asset, like digital gold 2.0. Two, it’s a currency in as much as currency is like the digital app that allows you to begin to transact and trade. And, three, it’s also a platform where you can build financial and other products on top of it. These attributes all bound together are what convinced me that there’s a certainty that there will be at least one global cryptocurrency and that there’s a good argument that it’s Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin is one of them, if not THE one. And, if Bitcoin isn’t that global cryptocurrency, then something else will be.\n\nI think that a global cryptocurrency that is an asset, a currency and a platform, is pretty essential for good progress in what we can do when it comes to building products and services, banking the unbanked in the third world and creating effective commerce across borders, among other things.\n\nRelated: 'Days Felt Like Years': What Morgan Spurlock Found When He Tried to Survive on Bitcoin for a Week\n\nYou’ve said that you’re not concerned with the day-to-day price of Bitcoin, that you’re more focused on the long-game outlook of your Bitcoin investments. Why?\n\nMy investment philosophy is very much long-term. I don’t do any small trades, like, “Oh, I’ll own this for a year and then I’ll sell it.” I invest only in long-term trends. That’s part of the reason I’m a venture investor. When I invested in Airbnb, when it was totally a new and random thing, most people said, “No way, no one’s gonna’ have strangers over at their house to rent a room, etc.” I saw it differently.\n\nWhen I invest, I think, “What is the way the world should be and is this investment part of that end? Is this plan the best plan for that to happen?” So that’s minimum five years. When it comes to Bitcoin, that’s the framework that I think about it in.\n\nWhy do you think the price of Bitcoin has diminished so much since late 2013, when it soared above $1,000?\n\nI think that the price drop has gotten lost in asset speculation. A lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, I gotta’ get in now!” They thought it was a get rich quick scheme. Obviously the run up was driven by speculation. Speculation tends to be very volatile to, “Oh, my God, it’s headed down now. Oh, get out quick.” Speculators are not long-term buyers. Speculators are cash in on the upswing and know when to get off the boat.\n\nHonestly, I don’t even check the price. I don’t even know what it is right now. I would guess it’s around $200-ish. Once it went down to $200, it’s actually not been that volatile since. The volatility decreased after that big drop and it’s now coming to a point where it’s at the current clearing price.\n\nRelated: How a Teenage Entrepreneur Built a Startup on Bitcoin Riches\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges holding Bitcoin back from mass adoption?\n\nThere aren’t enough use cases that make it easy enough to transact in Bitcoin yet. It has to be easy to use and reliably fulfill people’s needs. Most of the places a digital asset is needed very badly are not places like the U.S., where I can sit with my dollars in the bank. It’s more like Argentina or Ukraine or Russia. Those areas still have to get to the point where it’s useful.\n\nOnce you get the asset store working in those locations, you have to figure out where people want to transact in Bitcoin. Is it cross-border transactions? Is it other types of transactions that are unique and difficult to do?\n\nWhile it’s cool that Overstock will accept Bitcoin, a lot of people in the U.S. have credit cards and can buy from Overstock with them, so they don’t need to get Bitcoin in order to buy from Overstock. Most mass adoption of technology doesn’t just go do something just because it’s cool. When you get mass adoption, it’s because it’s serving a need.\n\nRelated: Winklevoss Twins: Bitcoin Is Like a 'Child Taking Its First Steps' But Will One Day Win the Finance Marathon\n\nWhat is your advice to those considering investing in the Bitcoin space?\n\nRoughly speaking, it’s very much like a venture investment. What I tell people who are angel investors investing in it, even though I think that the likelihood that Bitcoin will go to zero is very low, I say don’t invest in something you’re not willing to lose, or lose a good portion of. Now, for portfolio management, like if you have $10,000 and you invest $500, that’s usually kind of an unsafe side bet.\n\nIf you’re interested in Bitcoin, if you believe it’s part of how you think the world should be, the way the world will eventually end up going towards and you want to participate in that, then it might be for you. Or, if you’re in some place where you have no real, good asset value store and you’re uncertain about the banks, you’re uncertain about the government currency, then Bitcoin can provide a useful asset store for you.\n\nRelated: 16 Startup Trends That Will Be Huge in 2015"", 'Samsung, the largest South Korean conglomerate, is not scared off by a consolidating Bitcoin price. Instead, the company, which is headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul, is forging ahead with research and development in the Bitcoin space, with particular focus on the block chain technology.\n\nIn conjunction with International Business Machines Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. is developing plans to use bitcoin technology for new applications.\n\nAs Bloomberg writes:\n\nWhile bitcoin’s price has almost halved in the past year and the prospects for the digital currency are uncertain, its underlying software is attracting companies like phone makers, carriers and banks. That’s because the technology can be tweaked to record changes in ownership of any asset in a public ledger using a distributed network of computers or mobile phones. It could help facilitate all types of online transactions.\n\nResearchers at Samsung Research America, based in Silicon Valley, has researchers looking at using the Bitcoin block chain to verify “that what you say is authentic is authentic,” said Steven Rahman, director of strategy at the research division.\n\nSamsung is known for electronics like Galaxy smartphones, home appliances and televisions, as well as music radio and video services and many apps.\n\n“The block chain technology is very interesting in general, and it can be applied in a lot of areas,” Rahman said.\n\n“Currency, it’s just the first use case. You could imagine that anything, like prescriptions, could be managed with the block chain technology.”\n\nAlthough usually tasked with developing technologies for commercial products in two to five years, it is unclear exactly what sort of research into Bitcoin the company has embarked upon.\n\nThe Bitcoin block chain has already proven to be an inexpensive way of transferring money, but the technology could be used for cheaper storage of files like songs and videos.\n\nSome Bitcoiners think Samsung could stand to be the biggest beneficiary of Bitcoin.\n\nAt a press conference in Daejeon, South Korea, then Bitcoin Foundation chairman Peter Vessenes speculated:\n\n“At least half a billion U.S. dollars, up from $10 million two years ago, will be spent on purchasing Bitcoin mining systems worldwide next year or in 18 months.”\n\nSamsung could innovate and create even more powerful chips for Bitcoin mining, he said.\n\n“Much of the money will go directly to foundries with the highest technology in the world, including Samsung, Intel and TSMC.”\n\nWith powerful influence on South Korea’s economic development, politics, media and culture, Samsung could be a driving force behind Bitcoin adoption in South Korea, and development on the global level. Samsung and its subsidiaries produce around a fifth of South Korea’s total exports, with revenue equal to approximately 17% of South Korea’s $1,0982 billion GDP.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""CoinDesk is pleased to announce the latest quarterly State of Bitcoin report, sponsored by Gem.co, a bitcoin platform for developers.\n\nThis article runs through some key findings from the new report, which focuses on events in the bitcoin ecosystem since the beginning of 2015.\n\nAll-time bitcoin startup VC investment reaches $676m\n\nThe first quarter of 2015 saw a record-breaking amount of venture capital invested in bitcoin startups: $229m.\n\nQ1's deal activity was led by 21 Inc and Coinbase, companies that received $116m and $75m respectively. These are the two largest bitcoin investment rounds made to date.\n\nWith a funding total of $121m, 21 Inc has now surpassed Coinbase as the best-capitalized startup in bitcoin. However, very little information is available about the firm beyond its confirmation that it meets the definition of a 'universal' bitcoin company* (Slide 27).\n\nSince 2012, a total of $676m (Slide 29) has been invested in bitcoin startups, with a 51% increase from the end of 2014.\n\nThe number of countries that received VC investment also grew from 18 to 22 in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nThe four new countries are Barbados, France, Kenya and Switzerland. Remittance platform BitPesa also became the first bitcoin startup based in Africa to receive VC funding.\n\nSince the start of our State of Bitcoin reports, we have aimed to quantify the well-worn statement that 'bitcoin is like the the early Internet' by comparing levels of VC interest between the two.\n\nOur last report indicated that total VC investment for bitcoin companies in 2014 well exceeded the $250m invested in first-sequence Internet startups in 1995.\n\nLooking ahead (Slide 30), this year’s total VC investment in bitcoin startups is currently projected to surpass the $638m invested in first-sequence Internet startups in 1996.\n\nBitcoin's price stabilizes after rocky start\n\nOverall, the bitcoin ecosystem showed robust growth in the start of 2015, despite the price plunge in the first half of January. Bitcoin’s price surprised many by breaking below $200, considered to be an important psychological marker.\n\nOn 14th January, the CoinDesk BPI dropped to $177, and is down 24% in 2015 (Slide 11).\n\nAlthough bitcoin saw a significant decline at the start of 2015, its price has since stabilized around $250. In turn, the upward trend in monthly trading volume has not been negatively impacted by bitcoin's price decline (Slide 12).\n\nThis could be a reflection of expanded opportunities to trade on both bitcoin's upward and downward volatility.\n\nBitcoin's price action appears to be attracting less attention. For example, the number of price-related stories in the 10 most popular articles on CoinDesk has dropped significantly, from seven in Q3 2014 to only two in this quarter (Slide 21).\n\nBitcoin struggles to gain mainstream consumer traction\n\nThe rate of growth in the number of bitcoin-accepting merchants continued to taper off this quarter (Slide 47). Discussions around the slowdown of merchant adoption suggest the fundamental problem is not a lack of merchant interest in bitcoin, but rather the lack of consumer adoption.\n\nThere were 1 million new bitcoin wallets created in Q1, representing 14% growth quarter-over-quarter. The total number of Blockchain wallets passed three million in February.\n\nThe pace of wallet growth is almost constant over the past year, leading to some concern about the credibility of these numbers and questions about how many wallets are actively used for bona fide transactions.\n\nCoinDesk is forecasting 12 million total bitcoin wallets by the end of 2015 (Slide 53).\n\nTechnology\n\nThe technology underpinning bitcoin is beginning to be deployed in many non-currency applications like property rights, smart contracts, notary services and voting.\n\nCompanies both in and outside these industries are seeking to understand how the properties of the blockchain could help reshape these services and improve efficiency (Slide 61).\n\nA new update to Bitcoin Core Protocol was successfully released this quarter with new efficiency-enhancing features, such as a consensus library and headers-first syncing (Slide 72).\n\nPositive signs from Wall Street and regulators\n\nWall Street's interest in bitcoin expanded this quarter as more financial services executives moved to bitcoin startups (Slide 77).\n\nLeading financial institutes like Citi and UBS are also starting programmes to explore the use of blockchain technology. These developments may have bitcoin companies secure partnerships with traditional finance.\n\nThe latest revision to the New York BitLicense regulations was released this February (Slide 80). While there were some positive developments, some of the requirements are still being viewed as ‘redundant and duplicative’.\n\nThe UK Treasury also announced a new cryptocurrency regulatory framework this quarter. The proposal is generally being viewed as positive and in-line with the UK's hallmark ‘light touch' approach to financial regulation.\n\nIf you found the 2015 State of Bitcoin report useful, you can view more of CoinDesk's Research Reports here.\n\nWe'd like to thank all our readers for making CoinDesk the world’s leading source of bitcoin news, analysis and perspective, and we welcome your feedback and ideas for our future reports.\n\nSincerely, the CoinDesk team\n\nNote: You can access CoinDesk’s full spreadsheet of all bitcoin venture capital deals here.\n\nDisclaimer: This article should not be viewed as financial advice or an investment recommendation.

From July 2010 to February 2014, its price was 26 times more volatile than the S&P 500, according to Matt Elbeck, a marketing professor at Troy University in Alabama, who co-wrote a recent study about bitcoin with a colleague, Chung Baek.\n\nIn addition, nearly a half-billion dollars worth of...', 'You might think that being the finance minister of one of the world\'s most economically damaged countries was enough work for anyone, but Greece\'s Yanis Varoufakis seems to have found time to star in a student\'s short documentary about Bitcoin.\n\nA news site called Greek Reporter ran an April Fool\'s joke suggesting Varoufakis would move the country to use the cryptocurrency, but this is definitely real.\n\nThe video is called Bitcoin and the Digital Economy and it\'s by Kostas Mouratidis, a journalism student in Thessaloniki.\n\nThe documentary titles him as the finance minister of Greece and it seems like it was filmed recently because if it was done before late January then he wouldn\'t have been in office yet. It was only uploaded on April 9.\n\nHere he is (from 0:45) — there\'s a transcript of Varoufakis\' comments below if you don\'t want to watch the whole thing:\n\nVaroufakis jumps in at about 0:45, talking about the benefits of Bitcoin (this is the translation provided by the person who uploaded the video):\n\n""There is no need to pay commission, there is no need to pay debt to any banker.""\n\nAnd then he\'s back in around 3:45:\n\n""Bitcoin\'s organisation became so that those who use it participate in a community where jointly they follow every Bitcoin\'s move. In other words, it\'s like all of us who participate in Bitcoin to be members of the central bank of Bitcoin.""\n\nAnd 4:27\n\n""There is an absolute democracy and those who are in fear of manipulation of money by the banks or the bankers feel involved in a monetary system which is released from these dangers.""\n\nAnd from about 9:18 again, he\'s talking about the flaws with money as it exists right now:\n\n""Each tool can be used for good and evil purposes. Let us not forget that in Europe the European Central Bank produces the €500 euro banknotes. I do not think that you and I have used them very often. They are the notes that drug dealers especially love.\n\nWhat does this mean? Does it mean that the European Central Bank created these notes for drug dealers? The solution of these specific problems needs to be found elsewhere.""\n\nThen he\'s back again after 10:30, being more critical about the cryptocurrency\n\nIt will never be able to replace the currencies that are controlled by a central bank. At least it will not be able to do it in a way that can be sustained...\n\nHow will the state control these transactions and how will it tax? So it creates major problems on the issue of taxation. To perform under the fantasy that each of us can function as a Robinson Crusoe in our own isolated island, and all together to be in this archipelago consisted of a Polynesia with small islands where everyone is the boss. I think that\'s a fantasy which ultimately leads to economic crises like the one we have right now.\n\nThere\'s a reasonable question to ask about whether this is the best use of Varoufakis\' time, but he\'s written blogs about Bitcoin a number of times, so it\'s clearly a pre-existing interest. And to be fair, it\'s very cool of him to have given an interview to a student for their work.', 'Jamie Dimon, chairman and president of JP Morgan Chase, says his bank can learn from disruptive payment systems like bitcoin.\n\nDimon, famously dismissive of the digital currency, made the comments in his annual letter to JP Morgan shareholders, noting:\n\n""You all have read about bitcoin, merchants building their own networks, PayPal and PayPal look-alikes. Payments are a critical business for us – and we are quite good at it. But there is much for us to learn in terms of real-time systems, better encryption techniques and a reduction of costs and \'pain points\' for customers.""\n\nThe letter, which flagged the bank\'s recent ""record results"" and incoming competition in the payments space, suggested JP Morgan would seek to monitor these competitors – and outpace them.\n\n""We need to acknowledge our own flaws ... Rest assured, we analyse all of our competitors in excruciating detail – so we can learn what they are doing and develop our own strategies accordingly.""\n\nBitcoin on the radar\n\nThe CEO has made headlines with his remarks on bitcoin\'s disruptive potential before.\n\nSpeaking on a panel at the Institute of International Finance\'s annual conference in 2013, he said: ""Bitcoin developers are going to try and eat our lunch and that\'s fine,"" adding, ""that\'s called competition and we will be competing"".\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin, Dimon also stated that the digital currency was ""a terrible store of value. It could be replicated over and over"".\n\nHe also expressed scepticism that the digital currency could face up to regulatory scrutiny, stating:\n\n""It doesn\'t have the standing of a government. And honestly, a lot of it — what I\'ve read from you guys [CNBC] — is being used from illicit purposes. And people who will get upset with it is governments. Governments put a huge amount of pressure on banks: know who your client is, did you do real reviews of that.

They are looking to expand to other retail companies that accept gift cards.\n\nSimilar to companies like Gyft, Fold allows you to buy gift cards supported by the International Coffee Lounge, through the great efficiency and minimal costs of Bitcoin. Simply load up with Bitcoin on the Foldapp website, and it will generate the magic code to get you Starbucks coffee, blueberry cheesecake, or whatever else you fancy, at 20% off.\n\nFold recently asked for feedback on ZapChain (the buzzing Bitcoin hangout), and the response from the community has been very positive. Within 24 hours Fold received over 100 reviews, and Bitcoiners are testing the tech all over the world. It reportedly works in the UK, US, Canada, Mexico and probably at any other Starbucks that accepts gift cards.\n\nMatt Luongo, founder of Fold, answered questions and rained tips reviewers. He said Fold is also not just sticking to Starbucks, or coffee for that matter. During the feedback session Luongo said, “We're also working on Target, Whole Foods, etc. I'd love to get Blue Bottle on here, as well as some others.” He later also mentioned Walmart, Home Depot and CVS. Target apparently has already been tested and may even offer similar discounts.\n\nSo how do they manage to offer such an amazing discount?\n\nLuongo is also behind CardforCoin, a service that (you guessed it) buys cards for Bitcoin or Dogecoin. In response to curiosity about how they can offer such discounts, he said:\n\n“Bitcoin is part of the magic. It offers us a competitive advantage when we buy cards - it's way faster than ACH, and more private - and accounts for a third to a half of the discount we're able to offer on Fold. The rest is the fact that we're using secondary-market gift cards in the first place.”\n\nAs far as price conversion goes, they use Coinbase’s spot price.\n\nNo app is actually needed, although they are working on iOS and Android apps. The service can be accessed on their website through any browser-enabled device, which makes it accessible cross platform, though not as easy to use as a native app.\n\nThe eager response from the community shows how hungry Bitcoiners are to drop their local national currencies and use Bitcoin everywhere. With discounts of this sort, it may be hard to go back to fiat.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Thank you, The Bitcoinist Team\n\nArticle by Sergio Schout\n\nA micropayment is a type of payment that uses relatively small amounts of money to purchase every day items, such as food and drink. Now that bitcoin’s user base is growing, it may end up being the “missing link” that makes micropayments a viable option for everyone.\n\nAlso Read: Thoughts on Bitcoin Blocksize Economics.\n\nThe micro-payment idea originated with banks in the early 90’s. It was a pretty solid idea; load around 150 dollars on a card to buy things you need, which is safer than using a credit card and more convenient than using cash. Around 1995, micropayments were put into practice in the US and Belgium. For this article, I will solely focus in on the Belgian space, since the micropayment system was recently phased out.\n\nOne of the most famous micropayment systems in Belgium was called Proton. It grew in popularity after 1996 but around 1998 there were some questions about the security of the card. If the amount that you wanted to charge up was small enough, you could do that without giving your pin number. The banks corrected that security flaw immediately. Nevertheless, the damage had been done to Proton’s image.\n\nIn a graphic, created by the Catholic university Brussels, we can see that Proton was used much more that Visa or MasterCard. The reason was that proton didn’t have any fees for a certain period of time. The fees depended on the issuing bank, but most banks kept them at a bare minimum. This graphic was built on 10.000 bits of data about transactions in the region of Brussels. This makes the graphic pretty accurate with only a + or – 1% mistake margin.\n\nAfter 2001, Proton’s popularity began to decrease, so banks began putting fees on the system. The card users were hit by fees as well as the surcharge for merchants and retailers that used proton terminals in their shops. This eventually led to the slow but certain death of Proton at the end of 2014.\n\nThough banks gave up on micropayments, other sectors didn’t abandon that idea so easily. The gaming sector picked up where banks left off and modified micropayments to suit their needs. These micro transactions were successfully introduced in MMORPGS and other MMO’s, and then spilled over to other games, like Assassin’s Creed Unity. Steam and PlayStation Network have integrated micro transactions as well. Some game reviewers ( skip to 26.39 for the part of micro transactions), and the gaming community in general, have commented on this recent development.\n\nThe core points of micro payments are: fast, easy and secure way to pay for everyday items that do not exceed the price of 125-150 dollars, euros or whatever other local currency. Bitcoin is fast, easy, secure and has extremely low fees — if any.\n\nFor businesses that use bitcoin in their business models, it is more profitable since the equipment is already available and much cheaper than any other payment option. A small business holder has to follow certain rules and have a certain amount of payments per day or week to be able to have a Visa or MasterCard terminal. If the business doesn’t generate enough payments, it will get fined by the issuer of the credit card terminal. That is one reason you will not see credit card terminals at many small, local stores.\n\nSo, if Bitcoin is such a great tool for micro payments, why isn’t it being implemented everywhere? Trust is one big issue that Bitcoin needs to overcome. There have been a lot of scams associated with Bitcoin in the past, like companies promising amazing products but never fulfilling pre-orders. Rumors of pending bankruptcy are floating around the Bitcoin foundation. If the rumors are true, then Bitcoin’s reputation will take another hit in the mainstream.\n\nAnother huge issue that we as a community need to address is education. This is an observation made by prominent members inside and outside the Bitcoin world. We need to educate the general public about the uses of Bitcoin and what the benefits are.\n\nRegardless of the troubles that Bitcoin has, it is still the best option for micro payments that is currently available. It is fast, secure, has low fees, and is advantageous for both consumers and business owners. There are already start-ups working to improve Bitcoin’s viability in every day industries like parking, vending machines, and laundry.\n\nHowever, some might point out that as Bitcoin’s usage grows, the wait time for miner confirmations will get longer. To make sure Bitcoin will remain a fast and reliable micropayment option, maybe it is prudent to create a separate blockchain or a sidechain that is linked to the main Bitcoin blockchain. Then, the blockchain no longer be a single chain, but a series of interlocking blockchains. In doing so, the pressure on the main blockchain will be reduced, making confirmations faster. Whatever the case, it will be quite interesting to see what start-ups will be come up with regarding micropayments.\n\nIs bitcoin a good currency for micropayments? Let us know in the comments below!', 'As financial institutions worldwide move to cut off relationships with industries that regulators consider risky, the few banks that serve these businesses are charging hefty fees for basic services.\n\nFor companies in the cryptocurrency and legal marijuana businesses \x97 two sectors that regulators now scrutinize most closely \x97 getting access to a bank account can cost thousands in monthly fees, if it can be done at all.\n\nMarijuana businesses routinely pay as much as $3,000 a month for basic checking accounts, people who work in the pot industry say. Additional fees \x97 for picking up deposits in armored cars or for audits required by a bank\'s regulators \x97 make the all-in costs even higher, they say. (For perspective: Most banks offer small-business checking with monthly fees below $50, if any.)\n\nFor crypto-currency companies, banking options are even more limited, and more expensive. Monthly fees for a basic checking account can range into the tens of thousands of dollars, say lawyers and consultants who work with these companies.\n\nThere\'s no question that banking these companies is expensive and risky for banks, given the due diligence required and the potential fines for lapses in anti-money laundering compliance. But many people who work in these industries think that banks are using risk as a cover to take advantage of the fact that companies in these industries have few other options.\n\n""The reality is that it\'s extremely difficult to get a bank account in this industry, so if you do find a bank you are highly incentivized to play by whatever rules they set for you,"" said Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Association.\n\nOffsetting Risk\n\nFrom banks\' perspective, higher fees are inevitable. Banking high-risk businesses requires extensive documentation and reporting, which would be unprofitable without charging more.\n\nCharging risky companies high monthly fees for bank accounts is ""absolutely reasonable,"" said Andre Herrera, executive vice president of banking and compliance for Hypur, a firm that helps banks serve challenging industries.\n\n""There are a number of legal, legitimate businesses that pay a higher price for their financial services,"" he said. ""Banks are looking at all the risk factors and saying, \'I have more on the line to bank this industry and we\'re going to bill them more to offset this risk.\'""\n\nThe risks of the pot and cryptocurrency industries are due in part to their cloudy regulatory status. No bank has been publicly censured or fined by bank regulators for working with either industry, and regulators have issued guidelines on how banks can legally serve these industries.\n\nBut for most banks the business isn\'t worth the risk. The result is that even as these industries begin to join the mainstream \x97 with legal cannabis now a multi-billion-dollar business and traditional financial institutions investing millions in Bitcoin companies \x97 basic banking services remain either off-limits or onerously expensive.\n\nThere are ""a lot of parallels between the marijuana-banking space and the crypto-banking space,"" said Andrew Ittleman, an attorney at Fuerst, Ittleman, David & Joseph who has published articles on both subjects.\n\n""Banks are trying to pick up fee revenue any way they can, and they\'re now seeing some of these fringe businesses as being desperate and willing to pay virtually anything to get an account,"" he said.\n\nIn the pot and cryptocurrency businesses, banks are extremely reluctant to make their relationships public, much less discuss their fees. No banks that serve the cannabis industry would comment publicly on their pricing structures, and West said that banks sometimes ask pot businesses not to disclose who banks them in order to avoid unwanted attention.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, Calif., is the only lender to publicly disclose that it works with Bitcoin companies. A spokeswoman for the $36 billion-asset bank would not say what range of fees it charges its cryptocurrency clients, but said they are comparable the charges imposed on ordinary money transmitters.\n\n""For any [money-service business] or money transmitter, banks incur overhead costs for onboarding, screening and closer transaction monitoring. Those costs are passed on to the [money-service business] customer, based on the nature of their business,"" Silicon Valley Bank spokeswoman Carrie Merritt wrote in an email.\n\n\'Only Game in Town\'\n\nFor many pot businesses, the problem is not finding a bank that will take them on; it\'s finding more than one.\n\nNationwide, there\'s no shortage of banks and credit unions serving the pot business: more than 100 as of last August, according to a speech by Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Treasury\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. (Fincen did not respond to a request for an updated figure.)\n\nIn practice, however, pot businesses often have few choices. Large banks won\'t take on marijuana companies, so they have to bank locally. And in many of the 23 states with some form of legal pot, there are only one or two banks taking on marijuana clients, leaving these businesses with little negotiation leverage over fees.\n\nHigh banking fees are due to ""a combination of the reporting and documentation that banks have to file and the fact that they\'re the only game in town,"" said Kris Krane, managing partner of 4Front Advisors, which handles operations and compliance for marijuana companies in many states.\n\n""It\'s expensive, but in most states there\'s just one bank, and that\'s your only option,"" he said.\n\nFincen released federal guidelines last year for banking marijuana companies, but state laws vary, and can be complex. This has further fragmented the pot-banking market by making it hard for banks to serve out-of-state clients.\n\nFurthermore, it\'s not clear that a bank could legally take on out-of-state pot businesses even if it wanted to, since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level.\n\nThe about-face by the Oregon community lender MBank, which announced this year that it would serve out-of-state marijuana businesses but quickly changed its mind, shows the huge unmet demand from pot businesses as well as the legal perils of serving them.\n\nThe $163 million-asset MBank started banking Colorado pot businesses in January but was so overwhelmed by the demand that it closed its out-of-state pot accounts a week later, according to reports.\n\nThat, at least, is the reason the bank gave publicly; but the Denver Post reported that federal banking regulators made it clear that they didn\'t want the company crossing state lines to serve businesses that remain illegal under federal law. MBank CEO Jef Baker did not respond to a call seeking comment.\n\nThere has been some movement in the past year toward resolving this legal impasse, and on Thursday marijuana business owners met with a top Federal Reserve official to discuss the problem.\n\nBut no solution appears imminent, and real competition in the pot-banking sector is not likely until state and federal laws are harmonized.\n\n""Banks aren\'t interested in a flashing yellow light,"" said Jeff Gard of Gard & Bond, an attorney for marijuana businesses. ""They need a green or red.""\n\nThe shortage of banks lets a few players ""gouge the hell out of"" a ""vulnerable industry,"" Gard said.\n\n""There\'s all kinds of fees that in a competitive banking environment you could never get away with,"" he said.\n\nBitcoin Is \'Not Our Place\'\n\nIf marijuana companies have limited banking choices, cryptocurrency companies have almost none.\n\n""I\'ve dealt with many banks over the years that are willing to take some risk \x97 say, to bank a money-services or remittances company \x97 but they\'re not going to do Bitcoin,"" said Judy Rinearson of the law firm Bryan Cave.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank is one of few banks willing to take the risk for select Bitcoin companies \x97 and the only one that has disclosed its involvement with the cryptocurrency publicly. It banks Coinbase, a Bitcoin exchange whose investors include the New York Stock Exchange, USAA Bank and former Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit. Coinbase would not discuss its relationship with the bank.\n\nOther banks that have taken on Bitcoin businesses have done so more quietly. Gemini, a digital currency exchange founded by the Winkelvoss twins (of Facebook fame), announced in January that it had secured a banking relationship with a New York State-charted bank, but did not name the bank or provide details on the relationship.\n\nPart of the difficulty for Bitcoin companies is that they are seen as a riskier version of money transmitters, which were already considered high-risk, since Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and the currency has been used for online black markets. Fincen ruled last year that all Bitcoin payments processors and exchanges need to be treated as money transmitters, which ""essentially took the problems that the traditional [money transmitters] have been dealing with for many years and transplanted them onto the cryptocurrency space,"" said Ittleman.\n\nFor more than a decade, banks have routinely charged money transmitters monthly fees in the thousands of dollars for basic banking services, said Juan Llanos, executive vice president of Bitreserve and a former compliance executive for MSBs. These fees have now migrated to Bitcoin companies.\n\n""In every bank they have a policy on [money transmitters], and if you add to that Bitcoin or cryptocurrency-related companies, it\'s very scary for internal or risk management,"" Llanos said.\n\nDan Myers, CEO of Bridge Bank, also based in Silicon Valley, said that not even charging for the risk would make him comfortable banking Bitcoin companies.\n\n""That\'s really not our place or the place for any highly regulated commercial bank,"" he said.\n\nThe $1.8 billion-asset Bridge banks tech companies investigating the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin, but does not bank money transmitters and has turned down many opportunities to work with Bitcoin companies. He thinks Bitcoin and banks make a bad match, at any price.\n\n""It\'s more to do with the inherent nature of Bitcoin than the cost of doing business with these companies,"" he said.\n\nBut Bitcoin startups that make an effort can minimize some of these extra costs, said P. Faisal Islam, managing director of pfi.io advisory, a boutique compliance and AML consultancy.\n\nFor example, he said, if a bank is unfamiliar with Bitcoin it may want an independent risk assessment of that industry and of the prospective client from an outside expert. The bank might charge $75,000 to have this done, but a business can order an assessment itself for $45,000 to $55,000, Islam said.\n\nAlso, some banks charge Bitcoin businesses upfront to pay for the bank to hire dedicated compliance staff. This fee is equivalent to a person\'s salary, close to six figures, Islam said. But a business with good in-house compliance staff can make a case to the bank that such hires are unnecessary.\n\nOne ray of hope: The latest AML examination manual from the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council was released late last year, incorporating guidance on virtual currencies for the first time. ""Examiners haven\'t already had one cycle of audits using the manual yet,"" Islam said, and after a year the fees charged to cryptocurrency startups should come down as ""more banks understand how to bank them better.""', 'In September 2014, eBay announced plans to separate eBay and PayPal. In a recent SEC filing, eBay confirmed that a newly formed corporation named PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal”) will take over the businesses that make up eBay’s payments segment. eBay, the existing publicly traded corporation, will continue to operate its marketplaces business.\n\nThe separation, which will provide current eBay stockholders with equity ownership in both eBay and PayPal, will be effected by means of a pro rata distribution of 100 percent of the outstanding shares of PayPal common stock to holders of eBay common stock.\n\n“As two distinct publicly traded corporations, eBay and PayPal will be better positioned to capitalize on significant growth opportunities and focus their resources on their respective businesses and strategic priorities,” reads the eBay announcement. “As independent companies, we expect eBay and PayPal will be sharper and stronger, and more focused and competitive as leading, standalone companies in their respective markets. eBay and PayPal also will benefit from additional flexibility and agility to pursue new market and partnership opportunities.”\n\n“Following the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of PayPal common stock by eBay Inc. to its stockholders, PayPal will be an independent, publicly traded company focused on making money work better for people and businesses around the world,” says Daniel H. Schulman, President and CEO-Designee of PayPal Holdings. “The access to and movement of money is an important market that affects the lives of almost everyone. Our mission is to increase our relevance for consumers, merchants, friends and family to access and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and through any device (e.g., mobile, tablets, personal computers or wearables).”\n\nIn the SEC filing, eBay and PayPal confirm that merchants with a standard PayPal account also can integrate with Braintree to begin accepting bitcoin payments.\n\nPayment processor Braintree, which was acquired by eBay for USD $800 million in September 2013, will be part of PayPal Holdings under the new structure. Braintree permits merchants to accept bitcoin payments seamlessly in partnership with Coinbase, allowing their customers to pay with bitcoin instantly and securely on any device without manually transferring bitcoin or scanning QR codes. The Braintree bitcoin payments service, currently in public beta, has zero transaction fees on the first $1 million in bitcoin sales and a 1 percent fee for cashing out bitcoin to a bank account.\n\n“Sell your products and services in the currency of your choice and let your customers pay with Bitcoin,” reads Braintree’s invitation to its clients. “We take care of the conversion, transfer, and transaction reporting that fits in with your existing Braintree workflow. Bitcoin transactions are confirmed in less than a few seconds, eliminating chargebacks, which reduces your exposure to online fraud.”\n\nBesides bitcoin, PayPal allows merchants to accept Apple Pay and Venmo payments via Braintree.\n\nThe separation of eBay and PayPal, which will take place in 2015 (no exact date is given in the SEC filing) will allow the two companies to more effectively pursue distinct operating priorities and strategies and opportunities for long-term growth and profitability. In particular, PayPal’s management will be able to focus exclusively on its payments business, and enjoy “increased flexibility to pursue new partnership and strategic opportunities that may have previously been unavailable for strategic or other reasons.”\n\nIt seems likely that the increased flexibility and exclusive focus on online payments could result in PayPal taking a more active role in the Bitcoin ecosystem.']"
04/11/2015,"[""The Internet is one of the most underestimated inventions. At the very moment when it seems it has come to a point beyond which it can offer something new, the new appears. It does not appear unexpectedly; it develops gradually. Suddenly, we realize that Wikipedia is the go-to source for information, we communicate using Skype, and without having to think about it, our computers no longer store our documents. We store them on Google Drive .\n\nWe start using a tool because it is interesting and promises something new. At some point, it becomes a part of our everyday life, and then it seems like it has always been there. I remember when I used to drive around the city using a paper map, and now I only use Google services. When did this happen?\n\nMoney started being ‘digitalized’ at some point. It evolved, drawing deeper into the net, until forms that are completely virtual appeared: cryptocurrency.\n\nThe transition from Visa and PayPal systems to cryptocurrencies, however, turned out to be more complicated than we thought. Traditional payment service providers and cryptocurrencies differ so much that some people cannot understand the essence of this new money and how it differs from the conventional fiat.\n\nJust as with Internet services, cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more prevalent. New crypto services are created, shops and retailers start using them in their trade. It is only a matter of time until we will start taking cryptocurrencies for granted.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nCryptocurrencies have created a mythology of their own in the six and a half years of their existence. It includes entities like the aura of secrecy surrounding the personality of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto; the historical pizza, which cost enough to buy out a government of a small African country; the rise and fall of bitcoin’s exchange rate; the cautionary tale of Mt.Gox; the great thefts and lost millions on discarded hard drives. Each culture consists of such stories, but these stories are not the history.\n\nIn this first part, we will have a look at history of cryptocurrencies, from the creation of Bitcoin to the crypto-boom that started in 2013.\n\nThe Birth of Bitcoin: 2009-2010\n\nJanuary 9, 2009 was the date when Bitcoin 0.1 was released. Bitcoin releases 0.1.0 up to 0.1.5 supported only Windows 2000, Windows NT and Windows XP. Right after the first release, Satoshi went into polishing the client. He corrected some minor network and node communication errors, and worked on improving the client’s usability with a few associates (for example, they prevented entering your own address in the address book and added some explanation text to transaction details for generated coins).\n\nBitcoin release 0.2.0 appeared in December 2009, nearly a year later. It supported Linux, and the community became more actively involved in the development. In addition, this release was able to use the advantage of multiple processors to generate blocks. Until then, it only started one thread. If you have a multi-core processor like a Core Duo or Quad, this will double or quadruple your production.\n\nAnother big step forward is development of JSON RPC API so third-party services could also communicate with Blockchain and network.\n\nDuring this time, Bitcoin was only known to a very small group of early adopters. In November 2009, a forum that was the progenitor of Bitcointalk appeared on bitcoin.org. This led to growing popularity of the currency. New people entered the online community; new ideas were created as teams formed on the spot to implement them.\n\nThis attracted not only praise, but criticism as well. When Bitcoin’s operating principles were analyzed, a few flaws were discovered. At the same time, the idea of transaction fees appeared, and people started discussing the traceability of bitcoins.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, the Bitcoin 0.3 was released. The number of users was growing along with the mining difficulty as well. At the same time, the idea of using one’s computer for mining more efficiently emerged. Using the graphic processor’s computational powers for mining was proposed as a solution. That summer, user ArtForz established an OpenGL GPU hash farm and generated his first Bitcoin block.\n\nOn August 6, 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions weren't properly verified before they were included in the Blockchain, which let users bypass Bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins. On August 15, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the Blockchain after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.\n\nMore and more miners competed for the limited supply of blocks. Individuals found that they were working for months without finding a block and receiving any reward for their mining efforts. This made mining something of a gamble. To address the variance in their income, miners started organizing themselves into pools so that they could share rewards more evenly.\n\nOn November 27, 2010, the first Bitcoin Pooled Mining (BPM), better known as Slush's Pool, appeared. It operated on a share strategy that involved an artificially low difficulty method that has since been determined to be vulnerable to cheating. The idea of pool-mining has evolved since that time, but the basis remains: mining together is more profitable than mining solo.\n\nIn December 2010, user doublec compiled bitcoind for the Nokia N900 mobile computer. The following day, user ribuck sent him 0.42 BTC in the first peer-to-peer bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe First Experiments – 2011\n\nAt the end of 2010, Satoshi released the ‘farewell’ version 0.3.9 and left the project for good. This departure of the creator was not critical for the currency, as community took over the development. Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) was established to increase the efficiency of communications within the community. This is the standard way of communicating ideas since Bitcoin has no formal structure. The first BIP (BIP 0001) was submitted by Amir Taaki on August 19, 2011, describing what a BIP is.\n\nBy that time, many notions about how to improve Bitcoin appeared, but not all of them could be implemented. Thus, some people from the community started their own projects. The first idea to be implemented was the one concerning binding Bitcoin to the DNS system, which led to creation of Namecoin. After that, developers started experimenting with block time, block reward, maturity period and other parameters, and GeistGeld, iXcoin, SolidCoin and others were created as a result.\n\nSince Bitcoin’s difficulty continued rising, people began migrating to FPGA and GPU farms. The public became concerned about the flaws of SHA256, which opened the door leading to new experiments.\n\nThe first coin to abandon SHA256 was Tenebrix, ‘cryptocurrency with solid GPU resistance.’ The proof of work (PoW) for this coin was based on ? scrypt. The algorithm, which appeared in 2009, was designed as a password-gen function, but never became popular. The GPU miner for scrypt appeared very soon afterwards.\n\nA bit later Litecoin was developed and was welcomed by the community with more enthusiasm than Tenebrix, which had pre-mine. Litecoin was mined with CPU, leaving GPU for the more expensive Bitcoin.\n\nIn summer of 2011, the Proof-of-Stake principle appeared as a reaction to unequal distribution of ‘voting power.’ Instead of your ‘vote’ on the accepted transaction history being weighted by the share of computing resources you bring to the network, it's weighted by the number of Bitcoins you can prove you own using your private keys. A year later, PPCoin (Peercoin) appeared with a hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake.\n\nThis period is also noted for the start of mobile development. In July 2011, Bitcoins Mobile, the first Bitcoin application for iPad, was released by Intervex Digital. The P2Pool, the first P2P decentralized pool emerged (in August 2011), as well as “An Analysis of Anonymity in the Bitcoin System,” the beginning of the first serious research on Bitcoin’s anonymity. Mike Gogulski operated the first ‘Bitcoin Laundry.’\n\nASICs appeared in the summer and autumn of 2011, playing a part in destabilizing the mining process. The problem with ASICs, however, is the resulting consolidation of processing power in the hands of individuals, which is antithetical to the philosophy of Bitcoin itself.\n\nThe idea that computational powers can be used for some valuable calculations became the basis of Primecoin (2013), which sought out prime numbers during the mining process.\n\nRipple also appeared in 2011. Ripple was first implemented in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, a web developer from Vancouver. In 2005, Fugger began to build Ripplepay as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network. By that time some people realized that Ripple, as an idea of chain-exchanging IOUs, can both take the best from cryptocurrencies and solve some of their issues (reliance on centralized exchanges, high use of electricity, and slow transaction times). This led to the development by Jed McCaleb of a new Ripple system in 2011.\n\nConcurrently, in May 2011, McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used in Bitcoin.\n\nBy the end of 2011, the BIP 0010 Multi-Sig Transaction Distribution was released by Alan Reiner. A multi-signature transaction is the one that sends funds from a multi-signature address, which is an address that is associated with more than one ECDSA private key. The simplest type is an m-of-n address, which is associated with n private keys, while the sending of bitcoins from this address requires signatures from at least m keys.\n\nThis proposal was implemented and tested in the older versions of Armory Bitcoin software for use in offline-wallet transaction signing. On March 30, 2012, multi-sigs were added to Bitcoin.\n\nDevelopment of Infrastructure – 2012\n\nAt this point, the Blockchain size became an issue and solutions to optimize it without losing important data were proposed.\n\nIn April 2012, Pay-to-script-hash (P2SH), as defined through BIP 0016, went live. P2SH was developed in order to transfer the responsibility for providing conditions required to redeem a transaction from sender to redeemer of the funds. The benefit lies in allowing a sender to fund any arbitrary transaction, no matter how complicated, using a fixed-length 20-byte hash that is short enough to scan from a QR code, or easily copied and pasted.\n\nAs the community grew, specialists from related fields joined the Bitcoin community, including economists, scientists and lawyers. Moreover, developers specializing in different programming languages also came onboard. This resulted in developing the BicoinJ. For Java developers, BitcoinJ was an entry point to developing applications that interact with the Bitcoin network.\n\nBy 2012, it became apparent that Bitcoin had too many principal setbacks, so some developers started working on currencies that would eliminate these issues. This was the year when the CryptoNote technology appeared. It uses ring signatures and one-time keys for conducting transactions, thus making them untraceable. Moreover, a different PoW principle made cryptocurrency ASIC-resistant. Bytecoin, the first cryptocurrency based on this new principle, also appeared in 2012. The currency initially garnered mostly academic attention due to its complex cryptography. Universities were the places where early CryptoNote forks appeared.\n\nIn August 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin.\n\nOpenCoin began development of the Ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. Of the 100 billion units created, the creators themselves, seeders, venture capital companies, and other founders retained 20 billion XRP. The remaining 80 billion were given to Ripple Labs.\n\nIn autumn 2012, the majority of the Bitcoin community focused on developing and improving the wallets. The idea of deterministic wallets appeared as early as in 2011. On November 5, 2011, Electrum appeared – the first lightweight Bitcoin client, based on a client-server protocol. In 2012, the goal to create a convenient and secure wallet was realized. This was the period when light browser-based wallets started to appear along with cold storage (the wallet is stored offline) to simplify the process of migrating and backing up data, as well as paper wallets that allowed storing a couple of keys on a piece of paper, and even physical Bitcoins that stored the keys in a nice wrapping.\n\nThe year 2012 prepared the grounds for the subsequent altcoin boom. The following year, 2013, would be very fruitful, with all revisions of Bitcoin’s foundations, and developers constantly searching for new ways of developing the cryptocurrencies. That year, Primecoin was developed, its PoW based on discovering the prime numbers. In 2013 CryptoNote’s core, originally developed in Java, was re-written in C++ and a few forks of it appeared. Dogecoin was also developed, which got spread thanks to image-boards, with all its forks. Quark appeared, which experimented with multiple Hash-algos. As earlier mentioned, Peercoin, the first cryptocurrency with PoS, also was created in 2013, as well as its forks. Beside it appeared NXT, another PoS currency with a brand new operating algo different from that of Bitcoin. And of course Ripple development continued.\n\nThe year 2013 involved a complete revision of Bitcoin’s principles. Brand new cryptocurrency-building technologies appeared and became popular, and that lead to the rise of new leaders. Naturally, Bitcoin as a standard-bearer holds the first place by a landslide, but there are alternatives. The second part of the article will provide more information on this subject.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

This time, it was the turn of hackers requesting ransom money to decrypt \'kidnapped\' data from various US police departments.\n\nLet\'s take a closer look.\n\nBitcoin in the White House?\n\nThe news of a bitcoin aficionado potentially entering the White House was extensively covered by media outlets, resulting in well over 2,500 online articles.\n\nSenator Rand Paul is probably the most high-profile American politician to accept bitcoin donations, as well as the latest in a string of state and national Republicans to turn to the digital currency in their fundraising efforts.\n\nPaul\'s announcement follows on from his public declaration that he was ""an outlier"" on the ""bitcoin thing"". The senator made his skepticism towards the digital currency clear during a panel discussion led by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington earlier this year.\n\nAt the time, he told Bloomberg News he had been fascinated by the concept, adding ""but I would never have purchased it myself. I\'m just a little bit skeptical"".\n\nWith this in mind, it\'s hardly surprising that Paul\'s decision to embrace bitcoin as part of his fundraising efforts has been branded ""a genius political move"" – rather than an indication of support – by the Washington Post.\n\nIn his article, Brian Fung, noted:\n\n""The GOP contender is the first declared candidate in the 2016 race to fund his White House bid with virtual currencies. It\'s possible Paul is the first presidential candidate in US history to do so, in the latest sign of how politics and technology now frequently overlap.""\n\nJeff Stone, writing for the International Business Times, has also taken notice that Paul\'s fundraising efforts include the digital currency. In this instance, Stone refers to how bitcoin is ""associated most frequently with libertarianism, a movement with which Paul\'s policies are often compared"".\n\nMatch made in crypto heaven? Stone doesn\'t think so. He said:\n\n""Both the moneybomb and the bitcoin donations are reminiscent of the failed presidential campaigns once launched by his [Paul\'s] father, former US Republican Ron Paul.""\n\nThe term \'moneybomb\' was coined in 2007 to describe grassroots fundraising efforts over a brief, fixed period of time, usually to support an election candidate by dramatically increasing, concentrating and publicising fundraising. The term was first applied to a supporter-led fundraiser on behalf of presidential candidate Ron Paul – Rand\'s father.\n\nTimothy B Lee\'s Vox piece also linked Paul\'s decision to accept bitcoin to his expected focus on monetary policy during his campaign.\n\nLee noted: ""Rand Paul is expected to make monetary policy and the malignant influence of the Federal Reserve a major theme of his 2016 campaign for president. These hard-money views, popularised by Paul\'s father in the last two presidential campaigns, are also popular in the bitcoin community. Many bitcoin fans see the decentralised virtual currency as an alternative to the dollar.""\n\nFinally, The New York Times contributed to the debate with its headline \'In Accepting Bitcoin, Rand Paul Raises Money and Questions\'.\n\nIn his piece, Eric Lichtblau questioned the ramifications of Paul\'s decision to accept a ""essentially untraceable"" currency. He said:\n\n""It also raises questions about whether illegal contributions could make their way into campaigns more easily.""\n\nLichtblau’s comments come almost a year after the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) concluded that bitcoin donators were required to provide the same personal information – including name and location – as those donating via other methods.\n\nAdditionally, recent investigations and convictions by various law enforcement agencies have proved that bitcoin transactions aren\'t as ""untraceable"" as some would think.\n\nBankruptcy on the cards?\n\nIt all started with a post by Olivier Janssens – a recently elected board member at the Bitcoin Foundation – which described the organisation as ""effectively bankrupt"" and persuaded readers ""not to fall for"" what he characterised as attempts to control the message regarding its finances.\n\nJanssens\' allegations were picked up by the realm of cryptocurrency-focused publications, as the mainstream media continued to play out Paul\'s announcement.\n\nDespite the initial lack of interest by some of the most well-known mainstream outlets, Janssens\' allegations caught the attention of Michael J Casey, a regular contributor to the bitcoin scene with his BitBeat series for the Wall Street Journal, written in conjunction with Paul Vigna.\n\nCasey\'s opening statement alluded to the already strained relationship between the Foundation and the wider bitcoin community.\n\n""... the factious relationship with the bitcoin community is again being tested after a disgruntled new board member declared the digital currency advocacy group to be effectively bankrupt and called for a membership rebellion against a leadership that he accused of acting in secrecy.""\n\nThe news, as we know, came a couple of months after the Foundation declared that it was going to focus on core development. Casey concluded:\n\n""How this is resolved may come down to the preferences of Mr Andresen, the leader of the bitcoin core development team.""\n\nA piece by Jerin Mathew in the International Business Times also relayed the controversy. Perhaps what is more – or less – surprising is the concluding statement, in which Mathew references two prominent bitcoin figures and links the Foundation to two of its founding members and now notorious crime perpetrators.\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation, he says, was formed in 2012 by a number of bitcoin enthusiasts, ""including Mt Gox\'s Mark Karpeles and Charlie Shrem"". The latter is currently serving a 10 month prison sentence for aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nMore bitcoin crime?\n\nBitcoin\'s links with criminal activity have always been relatively well documented by the media.\n\nIn this instance, a quick google search with the terms ""bitcoin"" and ""Massachusetts"" this week resulted in over 40 articles.\n\nOutlets from all ends of the political and financial spectrum jumped at the chance to cover the news of a small Massachusetts police station that had been attacked by criminals who infected its network with malware, demanding a $500 payment – in bitcoin, of course – to decrypt the files.\n\nIt is interesting to see that most publications ran with the bitcoin angle, rather than with the crime\'s high-level of sophistication, yet again fuelling the digital currency\'s association with illicit activities.\n\nThe Daily Mail, a relative newcomer to the bitcoin scene, ran with \'Small Massachusetts police department forced to pay $500 Bitcoin ransom after hackers held their computer system hostage\' as its headline this week.\n\nIn contrast, The Boston Globe refrained from mentioning \'bitcoin\' in its headline, but it still highlighted the currency\'s potential for perpetrating crime, noting:\n\n""... the attackers demanded payment in bitcoin, a digital currency that is much harder to trace than other forms of money.""\n\nSpring is upon us and, if these headlines are to be believed, the bitcoin space is blooming with crime, corruption and extortion aplenty.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This is her third in a series of Bitcoin puzzles, called “The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto.”\n\n“Scheming the artwork, the stories, the trail is probably as addicting as playing them,” Driscoll tells VentureBeat. “Mystery has always intrigued us, art on its own is a cryptic puzzle, but what happens when we combine art that literally conceals the patterns and data that lead to money? I wanted to find out.”\n\nAlso read: Bitsies P2P Content Network Allows Anyone Anywhere to Earn Bitcoins\n\nThis has caused quite the online sensation, at least in the Bitcoin community, as threads have been created on Reddit and BitcoinTalk about the completion of these puzzles. Getting to the bottom of this cryptographic rabbit hole is not something you accomplish on your own over a lazy Sunday afternoon. The current Bitcoin bounty total for this puzzle stands at $1149.32 USD, as of this writing.\n\n“The response has been astonishing,” she said. “I honestly wasn’t prepared for how many people took to it. It was staggering. I also didn’t anticipate how emotionally attached people would become to the puzzles. People made friends and formed teams; there was a range of personalities who morphed into characters within the pages of the forums. The puzzle evolved into an emotionally saturated adventure novel.”\n\nIs Driscoll just a lone savant, painting the inspired works of a cryptographic genius? Not quite. She creates these works with the help of three teammates. Rob Myers, an artist and programmer based in Vancouver, B.C.; Ruben Alexander, a graphic designer based in Massachusetts; and Matt deCourcelle, a nano-materials engineer based, like the 29- year-old Driscoll, in North Carolina.\n\nFortunately, there are no time limits on solving this puzzle, as Driscoll and her team work on their next masterpiece. So you so not have to have a lot of money or create products to earn Bitcoin. You just have to use your noodle.\n\nIf you want to get a better understanding of how this all works, you may want to check out the 32-page solution to one of her puzzles. This will either intimidate you or inspire you to crack “The Driscoll Code.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The company behind the consensus network and currency, Ripple, has announced a new office in Sydney, Australia as part of a push further into the large Asian and Pacific markets.\n\n“We are excited to formally unveil a presence in Asia Pacific — an area that has been aggressively pursuing faster payment technologies for both domestic and cross-border payments,” said Ripple Labs CEO and co-founder Chris Larsen.\n\nAccording to a Ripple Labs, the expansion is to meet a “growing demand” for the currency’s payment services in the region. Unlike Bitcoin, Ripple relies on intermediaries to work as gateways and exchange the ripple currency (XRP) for fiat currencies or intermediaries. The Ripple currency serves as way to send any form of value (fiat currencies, precious metals, etc.) across the globe quickly and cheaply.\n\nRipple has been able to find use cases as a money transfer service and seen adoption among small financial institutions. Fidor Community Bank, a banking startup, and the Bank of Weir, another experimental bank, became Ripple gateways last year.\n\n“I am thrilled to bring Ripple Labs to Sydney, where we can more effectively serve eager markets in India, Singapore, the Middle East and across APAC,” said managing director of Ripple Labs Asia Pacific, Dilip Rao. “Banks and enterprises can leverage Ripple to more efficiently service the exploding trade and remittance flows in this region.”\n\n“Dilip is a natural fit to lead this office because of his years of experience in the space and his deep, engaged network in the region,” Larsen added.\n\nRao will be leading Ripple Labs’ efforts in Australia and throughout Asia in his new role as head of the Asia Pacific subsidiary. The first Asia Pacific office will be opened in a large Australian city, but the company plans to expand to other parts of central and eastern Asia in the coming year.\n\nRao will bring more than 25 years of management and business development in the technology and payments sector to the digital currency company. He was the founder and CEO of Australia’s first peer-to-peer payments company, Paymate. More recently, he founded Woomera Labs, Inc., a business development firm that matches innovative startups with large companies.\n\nHe also holds degrees in physics and electrical engineering and an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India.\n\nRao will be in charge of the company’s business development and expansion in the region, as well as leading the company’s efforts with regulators, lending banks and central banks.\n\nThough this is the first official presence of Ripple Labs, numerous third-party Ripple gateways already exist in the region. Japan, Singapore, China, Israel, India and South Korea are just some of the countries with Ripple exchanges.\n\nThe new office and focus could mean more activity for the digital currency in the region.', 'Imagine a will/testament set on a timer so that it is executed automatically upon the death of its creator. No, it is not as crazy as it sounds. Thanks to the blockchain, it is now possible.\n\nBlockchain, one of the most important elements in Bitcoin technology is responsible for enabling Bitcoin transactions between peers. Blockchain is a glorified ledger in the Bitcoin network. Apart from playing a role in transactions, blockchain has other applications as well. Blockchain is extensively used in proof-of-existence platforms designed for various purposes. Some of the well-known platforms in this regard includes the namesake Proof of Existence, Bitproof, Astroblocks etc.\n\nBitproof and Proof of Existence are like public notaries that verify the authenticity of electronic files/documents. One can upload their documents on these platforms, once uploaded these documents are hashed and the information is included into the blockchain using OP_RETURN as a non-payment data. The hash generated will act as a reference tag that allows access to stored information. The similar concept is used in Astroblocks, but it is purposed towards scientific research and observation. Astroblocks includes additional features that enable review of scientific data by a panel of reviewers at a multi-sig address.\n\nBlockchain Apparatus, a company based out of Denver has found a new application of blockchain that works with data available with the federal government database (especially from the US Social Security Administration). This new product makes self-executing wills possible. The product is linked to Social Security Office’s Death Master File, which is a ledger of sorts that keeps records of verified death reports. Anyone can choose to create a digital crypto-will with particulars of beneficiaries, terms of execution etc. Once the person dies, and his records appear on Death Master File, the will gets activated to be executed according to his/her wishes as mentioned in the document.\n\nCrypto-will, being a new product still doesn’t have the whole process automated yet. Currently it works as a hybrid model involving technology and lawyers. Soon the company hopes to make it fully automated. As of now, Blockchain Apparatus as got one client who has signed up for the crypto-will service. There is no time limitations associated with crypto-will and the creator can set the will to be executed at any day and time of his choice.\n\nThe technology associated with Bitcoin is truly a game changer and we can expect more novel products based on it to hit the market soon. Meanwhile this crypto-will product stops the dead from turning in their graves in the near future.', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.Net\n\nArticle by JP Buntinx\n\nWhile several companies are trying to bring Bitcoin to mobile payment systems, one of the world’s biggest telecom providers has plans to invest in Silicon Valley’s Bitcoin startups. Orange SA, France’s leading telecom provider, and worldwide brand name, has grown fond of the technology powering digital currencies and wants to see how it can benefit its products in the future.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Can Revolutionize the Telecommunications Sector\n\nEarly Adopter Phase For Blockchain Technology\n\nOne of the things you have to admire is that a major brand such as Orange SA is looking past the Bitcoin’s volatile price and is focusing on the important bit. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts feel that the blockchain technology in general will bring digital currency to the mainstream, regardless of the currency attached to any one blockchain.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin is the leader in cryptocurrency, the interest by Orange SA is centered on Bitcoin. This does not necessarily mean they will start using Bitcoin itself as a payment option for any of their services in the near future, but that isn’t impossible either.\n\n“There’s something intriguing in this technology, so we want to be there as early as possible. This could be a digital platform of the future.”\n\nWhile Orange SA is based in Paris, the company has a California division as well. Orange Silicon Valley’s CEO Georges Nahon will be following the Bitcoin startup scene up close and keep tabs on what these companies can do for Orange SA.\n\nBitcoin is More Than Just Money\n\nBitcoin is often viewed as “just” an investment vehicle, and as a result of its speculative nature, and judge the currency by its wild volatility. But the true value of digital currency lies in the ideology presented by Satoshi Nakamoto, manifested in the blockchain payment mechanism. Recording changes in ownership, tracking of assets in a public ledger and facilitating transactions are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the blockchain technology is capable of doing.\n\nPicking The Right Bitcoin Startup(s)\n\nSilicon Valley is a breeding ground for startups in general, so Bitcoin startups are thoroughly enjoying the support and knowledge they gain from being part of the local community. As such, it is not easy to pick a Bitcoin startup that can suit one’s business needs, but Orange Silicon Valley has found a solution.\n\nBy hosting bitcoin events at its offices in San Francisco, Orange Silicon Valley has found two Bitcoin startups they are in talks with as of press time. The group has the option of investing up to US$20,000 per Bitcoin startup, with the global Orange SA team having the ability to spend up to US$3.2 million per startup.\n\nNahon told Bitcoinist, “Even though we have a large internal R&D organization, given the pace of innovation we need to compliment our initiatives and projects with what the outside world is doing.” As a result, Orange wants to support no less than 500 startup companies around the world by 2020.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nAll images courtesy of Shutterstock', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by Nuno Menezes\n\nBitlanders is a new social network that pays people for their content. With bitLanders, users that post blogs, videos, images, and share the best content will have an extra income paid by the social platform.\n\nAlso read: BitLanders: A Social Network That Pays You in Bitcoin\n\nLast week, Bitcoinist published an article review of this social network. This week, we decided have a conversation with the bitLanders Co-Founder and CEO, Francesco Rully.\n\nWhere did you get the idea for this project? What were the decisive factors that led you to develop bitLanders?\n\nSince 2005, our company had supported filmmakers and bloggers through the Film Annex network, paying content producers based on their BuzzScore, a proprietary algorithm that measures the quality of content, reach and influence of the user. Our main issue was sending payments to users in developing countries where traditional banks had high costs and Paypal wasn’t available. At the end of 2013, we realized that Bitcoin was resolving geographical limitations of traditional banks and Paypal, so we decided to switch our entire business to Bitcoin. In August 2014, we decided to rebrand our company to BitLanders, like the land of Digital Content and Bitcoin.\n\nFrom what I’ve found, bitLanders in the beginning was considered to be a bitcoin RPG game. What can you tell us about that?\n\nWe introduced the gamification of our social media platform to facilitate the understanding of Bitcoin and introduce quests and tasks to educate our new users about Bitcoin and the BuzzScore. Based on our experience in developing countries like Afghanistan, we also understood that asking users to post their pictures, and real names was dangerous and would make some of them targets (especially girls in conservative regions), so we introduced avatars and anonymous nickname registrations. This all contributed to a further gamification of the platform making bitLanders more and more an RPG.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about yourself and the team behind the development of bitLanders?\n\nI was born in Florence, Italy, and moved to the USA in 1990 at the age of 21 years old to open a fashion distribution company in LA. I lived in LA and Atlanta until 1992 and moved to NYC to further continue my import-export business. In 2002, John Malkovich and I started a fashion line called Uncle KImono. In 2005, I started Film Annex for online film distribution that developed into BitLanders in 2014.\n\nI am a strong believer in what Spiderman says: “with power comes responsibility.” In 2012, I reached out to Roya Mahboob in Afghanistan and with her, we built 13 internet classrooms and connected 55,000 girls to the World Wide Web.\n\nThis project developed into Women’s Annex Foundation, now called Digital Citizen Fund, and our mission is educating women and young men in Digital Literacy and with this also Digital Currency. I am a 4th degree black belt in Judo and Judo has been my school in life. I approach life and business like a Judo match, where within 5 minutes; you have a winner and a looser and where decisions must be taken in a split of a second. Two weeks ago, we sponsored the New York Open Judo Team Tournament, and this was our 5th year.\n\nMy “intellectual passion and inspiration” goes back to the Renaissance and I see people like Bicci de Medici, Lorenzo il Magnifico and other figures of that time as great role models to a point that an NYC-based writer is writing a novel inspired by some of my old friends.\n\nbitLanders has offices in Florence and Taiwan where Lorenzo Meriggi, Francesco Carignani, and Maurizo Ranaboldo are our head of development and design. This is an incredible team whose creative qualities have made bitLanders’ success. Maybe the fact that we are a “true Italian” team scattered all over the world gave us that extra motivation to extend what the Medici family was doing 600 years ago and triggered the Renaissance through arts and banking. We are doing it with web applications and Bitcoin. In our offices in NYC is Jennifer Bourne, who directs our editorial team. I define her as my boss as she is the eyes and ears of the company while I am spending time in meetings or talking in Italian with our teammates in Italy and Asia. Another important person for our work is Thomas Courtney of See International. He is a very inspirational member of our team, with his experience in trading and arts bringing an independent perspective on our projects and inspires us towards new directions. Also in NY is Elaha Mahboob, who is in charge of BitCharities, explaining charities from all over the world why Bitcoin is an important technology for them and inviting them to join the BitCharities platform on bitLanders.\n\nDid you have any kind of support from investors or the community to keep bitLanders up and running?\n\nNo, we are our own VC. I am proud of this, but it’s also my limitation as it’s hard for me to seek financial support. We are now conscious that we have a great marketplace well exceeding the 1 billion dollar mark, a true team that can pivot and develop very fast, and our ideas have proven successful. In essence, we have what investors want. What we need is the time to seat down and see if we can host new people in our tight circle. I usually ask people if they are Judo players or Wrestlers, this facilitates my decisions…\n\nBitlanders was launched last year and already counts with huge number of members. What do you think were the main reasons it became that popular?\n\nIt is a good platform and innovative approach on Bitcoin and gamification, but keep in mind that bitLanders is our testing ground for applications like the BuzzScore, BitGoodie and BitCharities that we are developing as independent platforms and API’s/Applications.\n\nBesides organizing donations for charity, you also have a big sports sponsorship program. Can you tell us more about this?\n\nAs I mentioned above, I am a strong believer in sports, especially contact and Combat sports like Judo and Wrestling. It is now the 5th year that we have been sponsoring the NY Open Judo Team Tournament at the New York Athletic Club. This year, i am very very very very proud that we were able to have three incredible Women’s Olympic and National teams from Cuba, France and the USA, with 5 Olympic medalists out of the 15 Athletes fighting, and with Cuba as the first Olympic team to come to the USA since the lift on the embargo.\n\nUsers on the bitLanders platform earn bitcoin by participating; can you explain how the whole system works and how do you get funds to pay for the users content?\n\nWe created a bucket of Bitcoin that we distribute daily. Each user competes with the other 500,000 on the BuzzScore ranking. The higher the ranking, the more bitcoin you win. It’s a constant competition to publish better quality content and have a stronger influence on other users. At the same time, this allows each user to better understand Bitcoin and its qualities.\n\nYou claim be the first social network to have developed a fun way for users to earn bitcoin. Many people compare your platform to Facebook. In your opinion, besides the bitcoin earning feature, what are the main differences between bitLanders and any other regular social network?\n\nWe love social media, and FB is a social media platform that we use to promote our work. We introduced avatars to make our platform entertaining and to preserve our users’ privacy, as well as nicknames and anonymous registration to further preserve our users privacy and anonymity. We introduced bitcoin to empower our users to a free and global payment system so that a 13-year-old Afghan girl can be on the Blockchain and the same ledger as Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson. We educated about 500,000 users and incentivized them to educate their extended network of 180 million friends and fans about Bitcoin and Crypto assets. We introduced a platform to define Digital Citizenship, especially for users who are located in countries where there are limited opportunities or it’s dangerous to leave their own homes or schools.\n\nCan you talk about bitLanders Roadmap and future developments and events?\n\nWe are building a series of satellite applications that will make it easier for users to select their specific interests and further educate them on the applications of Bitcoin. In particular, we are developing a nice network of opportunities with BitCharities and BitGoodie. I can anticipate that we will be using Bitcoin combined to a proprietary Loyalty program. Keep in mind that bitLanders is not a social media network using Bitcoin, but a Bitcoin company using social media and gaming to educate people about Bitcoin and Cryptoassets.\n\nWhat are your expectations for the cryptocurrency Industry for 2015/16?\n\nI am very optimistic in its growth in terms of users and number of transactions. My focus is on educating people about what Bitcoin is as I know that this will lead to an organic growth in the application of this great technology.\n\nBitLanders can be very profitable, but it can’t be considered as a main source of income. The whole idea is for users to share constructive content, spread knowledge and most of all to promote digital currencies.

Let us know in the comments below!\n\nImage Source: 1, 2, 3, 4', 'Bitcoin-purchasing BTCGAW Inc., not to be confused with GAW Miners (which is facing a $346,000+ lawsuit), has recently gone on an all-out media blitz. They advertise, “BTCGaw is Paying 11% more for bitcoins than Blockchain official rate”, in a manner very consistent with previous scams. An Australian on Reddit claims to have confronted BTCGAW Inc. with evidence that their offer is a scam, and he claims he was threatened and attacked by BTCGAW operators in retaliation.\n\nBTCGAW Inc. is a bitcoin-buying scam. After being confronted with evidence that BTCGAW’s offer was a scam, a BTCGAW operator allegedly began attempting to intimidate the accuser. When the accuser indicated that he would be posting the evidence on Reddit, a BTCGAW Inc. operator allegedly threatened to initiate a DDoS attack. (We reached out to the Reddit poster for additional information and evidence, but we have not yet received a reply).\n\nSerious Threats\n\nThe poster on Reddit indicated that shortly after, he was indeed the target of a DDoS attack. Additionally, the Reddit Poster indicated that the BTCGAW Inc. operator threatened to plant incriminating evidence of child pornography and stolen credit card information. If true, BTCGAW Inc.’s operators have committed some very serious crimes in a bungling effort to hide a relatively obvious scam.\n\nIn response to our request for comment regarding the Reddit Post, an unnamed individual using [email protected] claimed, “our customer support center don’t talk like that.” The unnamed individual also alleged that the entire Reddit post was fraudulent and that the images are “modified”. The individual also claims to have transcripts showing that the Reddit poster was indeed the intimidating party but that the transcripts could not be sent to us until his or her manager arrived. We will update this article if transcripts are provided to us.\n\nAll of this fall-out supposedly circles around evidence that suggests BTCGAW Inc. is a scam. The specific evidence in question is the allegation that BTCGAW repeatedly uses the same receiving address for all of its clients deposits. This practice has the potential to make it very difficult to link specific transactions with specific customers. There is plenty of other evidence that indicates BTCGAW Inc. is a scam, too.\n\nIn their press releases, BTCGAW Inc. claims to have been founded in July 2014. However, a simple WHOIS search reveals that btcgaw.com was only registered last week. BTCGAW Inc.’s operation reeks of similar scams that continue to crop up every time another is shut down. Additionally, BTCGAW Inc.’s website claims they are located in Delaware, but their website was registered in Norway.\n\nBTCGAW Inc. is nearly certainly a bitcoin buying scam, but if the allegations against them are true, getting outed as a scam may be the least of their problems.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '???????? ?? ???? ??? protothema.gr ? ???????? ??? ???????? «???????? ???????» \xad ??? ????????? ??? ????? ??? ???????? ???????????\n\n??????????? ?? email ??? ??? ?? ????????? ??? ??? ??????? ???????????? ??????!

In einer Einreichung bei der U.S. Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC) sagte das Unternehmen es “unterstütze Unternehmen in allen Größenordnungen beim Wachstum durch Mehrwertdienstleistungen um den Cash-Flow zu managen, Kunden abzurechnen und durch die Aufbewahrung von sensiblen Kundeninformationen.”\n\n“Händler haben zudem durch die Integration von Braintree die Möglichkeit, Kreditkartenzahlunge, PayPal, Venmo und jetzt auch digitale Währungen wie Bitcoin zu akzeptieren,” steht es weiter.\n\nIm September letzten Jahres gab PayPal zudem die Braintree-Partnerschaften mit Coinbase, BitPay und GoCoin bekannt. Durch den Braintree-Hub können Händler jetzt eine individuell angepasste API nutzen und Bitcoin zu den möglichen Zahlungsmethoden hinzufügen.\n\n“PayPal übernimmt die Rolle des Zwischenhändlers, aber die Kosten werden vom Onlinehändler bzw. dem Zahlungsabwickler übernommen,” so Scott Ellison, Senior Director vbei PayPal.\n\neBay und PayPal bleiben nach der Trennung weiterhin “enge Freunde”\n\nAus der Einreichung bei der SEC geht zudem hervor, dass sich PayPal und eBay Ende 2015 voneinander trennen werden. “Durch die Trennung der beiden Unternehmen werden eBay und PayPal in ihren Märkten noch stärker und wettbewerbsfähiger agieren können. eBay and PayPal werden durch die neue Flexibilität besser voneinander profitieren können und weitere Märkte erschließen, sowie neue Partnerschaften schließen können.”\n\nPayPal Inc. ist es verboten einen eigenen Marktplatz für physikalische Güter zu schaffen während eBay versprochen hat, kein eigenes Zahlungsabwicklungssystem zu integrieren. eBay hat sich zudem dazu verpflichtet, in den nächsten 5 Jahren 80% der Zahlungen weiterhin über PayPal abzuwickeln. Sollte eBay dieser Verpflichtung nicht nachkommen, muss der Onlinehändler eine Entschädigung an die Tochtergesellschaft zahlen. Im Gegenzug zahlt PayPal eine Provision an eBay, sollte die Marke von 80% überschritten werden.\n\nDer derzeitige eBay CEO John Donahoe wird mit der Abspaltung der zukünftige Geschäftsführer von PayPal werden. Er sagt beide Unternehmen werden durch die Trennung mehr Flexibilität erlangen: “PayPal wird es frei gestellt sein, mit welchen Händlern eine Partnerschaft geschlossen wird, somit ist eine Partnerschaft mit Amazon und Alibaba denkbar,” so Donahoe. “eBay hingegen kann weitere Zahlungsmethoden auf der Online-Handelsplattform integieren.”\n\nIm Jahr 2002 hat eBay den Zahlungsawickler PayPal übernommen und wurde damit eines der erfolgreichsten Silcon Valley Unternehmen. Vor sechs Monaten jedoch und auf Nachdruck des Investors Carl Icahn sagte eBay es würde sich von PayPal als eigenständiges Unternehmen trennen. Die Trennung soll vor allem den Investoren zu Gute kommen und wird vermutlich zum Ende des Jahres besiegelt werden.\n\n[wysija_form id=”2?]\n\nBTC-Echo\n\nImage Source: Flickr Photo: Ruth Glass; PayPal']"
04/12/2015,"['As a decentralised currency, bitcoin has been both criticised and celebrated for its lack of regulatory supervision.\n\nUnlike credit cards – or other traditional payment methods – bitcoin\'s transactions are final by design, with almost no recourse for consumers in cases of fraud.\n\nThis, in addition to the semi-anonymity afforded by the digital currency, has led some to question how participants in a bitcoin transaction can be trusted.\n\nOne bitcoin startup, Bitrated, thinks it may have the answer.\n\nThe Israeli-based company, founded in 2013 by software developer and bitcoin enthusiast Nadav Ivgi, is a trust platform that aims to provide fraud prevention and consumer protection mechanisms for bitcoin.\n\nThe team has spent the last year upgrading the service, which Ivgi describes as a ""complete rewrite from the ground up"".\n\nBitrated now operates on three different, albeit complimentary levels: a reputation management system, a multi-signature payment system and an arbitrated marketplace which allows for payment reversibility.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe Bitrated reputation system is based on three primary components: reviews, a \'web of trust\'– itself modelled on a social graph of trust relationships between users – and the consumers\' online presence.\n\nAccording to the website, the basic concept is simple.\n\nIf I trust Bob, and in turn Bob trusts Alice, then I should also be able to trust Alice. By analysing how well the two users are connected within the graph, Bitrated is able to extract metrics to help it determine just how trustworthy they are.\n\nThe system also rates users based on their Bitrating – a trust score – achieved thanks to an algorithm which aggregates information from the users\' social media profile, taking into account metrics such as Reddit Karma, Twitter followers and LinkedIn connections.\n\nIvgi said:\n\n""Our goal with the linked accounts system is to allow users to leverage their pre-existing internet persona and past internet activities into a measurable reputation.""\n\nHe added: ""Some of that information is about identifying throw-away sockpuppet accounts, some is about verifying the user identity – by leveraging the fact that services like PayPal and Coinbase already verify the user\'s identity and expose it via their API – and some is more likely related to trustworthiness.\n\nReversible transactions\n\nRegistered users can use Bitrated\'s payment system to make reversible e-commerce transactions using 2-of-3 multisig smart contracts in its arbitrated marketplace. To do so, the buyer and seller must nominate a trust agent to act as an arbitrator for their transaction.\n\nIf the transaction goes smoothly, the buyer and seller agree and release the funds to the seller without the trust agent\'s intervention.\n\nTrust agents will only intervene if a dispute arises. In this instance, they would be required to review the case and decide which party to side with, either refunding the buyer or releasing the funds to the seller.\n\nCommunity feedback\n\nPerceived by many as an open and transparent alternative to the native escrow and reputation systems of other specific bitcoin marketplaces, Bitrated is essentially a public arbitration service with a crowd-sourced reputation management layer.\n\nThe service seems to be a welcome addition to the growing bitcoin ecosystem, with almost 2,000 registered users.\n\nAccording to Ivgi, transaction volume on the site\'s arbitrated marketplace had reached approximately $80,000 (310 BTC) at press time.\n\nUser Eric Martindale, who is also a developer at BitPay, spoke about a need for this kind of service:\n\n""I am currently ranked the number two most reputable user on Bitrated (whatever that\'s worth remains to be seen), and I\'m pretty excited to see this next layer of the infrastructure develop. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ... decentralise money, but identity is the next big problem in the space.""\n\nHe continued: ""Bitrated has the most polished experience around the complicated technology required to have decentralised identity, and I think they\'ve got a real chance at at being massively successful in providing the answer the industry needs.""\n\nNotably, Bitrated does not operate an escrow system. This is considered a benefit by some members of the bitcoin community.\n\n""The major attraction for me is that the trust agent has no direct control over neither the funds nor the goods that are being traded, making it safer than most attempts at escrow services,"" said user Walid Daniel.\n\nElichai Turkel, another Bitrated user, said his experience with the service was ""pretty good"", praising the fact that choosers could choose their desired trust agent.\n\nCompetition, future plans\n\nBitrated is not alone in this market, with Ivgi citing OneName and Bonafide as its main competitors.\n\nOneName sets out to facilitate bitcoin payments between users, by replacing lengthy bitcoin payment addresses with sleek, social handles. Once a user has registered, asking for payment is as easy as adding a plus sign to your user name (+yessi_belloperez_, for example).\n\nBonafide, which set out to build a reputation system for the bitcoin industry, raised $850,000 in February funded by Quest Venture Partners, Crypto Currency Partners and the AngelList Bitcoin Syndicate, among others.\n\nIvgi is confident that his startup can compete in this area, however:\n\n""The main thing that sets us apart is that we\'re providing a very comprehensive solution for the trust issues the cryptocurrency economy is faced with, which we then provide as a base layer for other services in the ecosystem to build on top of.""\n\nThe CEO is also optimistic about Bitrated\'s future.\n\n""In the long term, we anticipate that Bitrated will cease being an application that users interact with directly, and become the platform that powers up the identity and reputation across the ecosystem, as well as a payment processor for when recourse and buyer protection is needed,"" he noted.\n\nRon Gross, a Bitrated user, echoed Ivgi\'s thoughts, saying:\n\n""I think the service will be a critical component as an integration point in other services eg marketplaces and exchanges. Instead of each of them having to come up with reputation from scratch, it makes sense to rely on one key rating system. Bitrated API will fill in this spot.""\n\nAlthough trust agents may decide to charge for their services, Birated does not currently do so. However, Ivgi said the service may incur fees in the future ""both as a way to sustain the platform and as a protection mechanism against sybil attacks"", notes the website.\n\nThe website also notes that it plans to integrate additional cryptocurrencies in ""the near future"".\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

One of those groups were gamers, as they were able to put their powerful GPUs to work mining bitcoin in the early days. And as we have seen over the past year so, video gaming and Bitcoin still seem to go hand in hand.\n\nAlso read: Xapo Releases New Comments on BitLicense\n\nBitcoin And Gamers: Two Peas in a Pod\n\nMost people still look competitive gaming as a niche market. In a way, they are right, since there are far more casual gamers compared to the number of players taking their games more seriously.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is still trying to gain a foothold in the world of mobile games, advancements have been made in the “mainstream” gaming area. Thanks to ChangeTip and Twitch.tv partnering up late last year, we can now send bitcoin tips to players who livestream their gaming sessions on the Twitch.\n\nXapo, CEVO and Leet Form Bitcoin Gaming Platform\n\nXapo, a popular bitcoin debit card provider, has decided to take advantage of the natural attraction between bitcoin and gaming. The company has partnered with CEVO — a global eSports company — and Leet — a Bitcoin-based gaming service — in order to combine the best that bitcoin and gaming have to offer.\n\nDue to this partnership, we will see a platform that offers a bitcoin-enabled competitive gaming experience to players already using the CEVO platform. Seeing how CEVO runs several competitive tournaments with lots of prize money up for grabs, this partnership could be a huge deal for bitcoin adoption around the world.\n\nNow that CEVO users will be able to earn Bitcoin by playing the games and challenging friends, it will be interesting to see what kind of an impact digital currency will have in the world of competitive gaming. Popular games such as League of Legends, TF2 and Counterstrike could become the next big thing for in-game bitcoin transactions.\n\nLeet offers a similar service to CEVO, hostimg games and tournaments — allowing players to win a monetary prize. Winnings can be withdrawn to a Xapo wallet, where they will be stored as a bitcoin balance. Leet takes a 2% fee on League of Legends earnings.\n\nBitcoin: A Good Fit for In-game Transactions\n\nIt is no secret that Bitcoin could become a major player in the world of in-game transactions, due to its very low fees on micropayments. Xapo has dedicated a lot of resources to figuring out how bitcoin could improve in-game engagement, a mystery that no Bitcoin-related company had been able to solve just yet. In order to help game developers on their way, Xapo has rolled out new APIs dedicated to building in-game functionality for Bitcoin.\n\nWhat do you think about Xapo’s partnerships with CEVO and Leet?

You have to know how Bitcoin works, have a way of getting paid in bitcoin, and have a way of paying taxes for your bitcoin transactions. You have to find bitcoin consumers of your goods and services, which is not a massive pool to swim in. And you’ll need banking services. This might be the toughest part of your journey to becoming a future Bitcoin business mogul. Expect to find many torches and pitchforks held in your path to mainstream legitimacy.\n\nBitcoin Bank Account tougher than a Marijuana Bank Account\n\nHaving previously worked in banking on Wall Street, I know first-hand that regulations and compliance are kings in the established banking industry. If there are no clear regulations, that’s a red flag, and nothing gets done out of fear of the unknown. If there are too many regulations, things get done, just very slowly. Banks are like children. You have to tell them exactly how to do things, down to the smallest detail, or else it never gets done. And with the government, influential corporations, and central banking elite setting the regulations, industries like cannabis and Bitcoin are swimming upstream. High-risk assessment scores, more regs, and plenty of bad mainstream press will put you behind the 8-ball. American Banker spoke to those working with banks and Bitcoin to see what the issues are that affect new Bitcoin businesses today.\n\nThere are “a lot of parallels between the marijuana-banking space and the crypto-banking space,” said Andrew Ittleman, an attorney at Fuerst, Ittleman, David & Joseph told American Banker. “Banks are trying to pick up fee revenue any way they can, and they’re now seeing some of these fringe businesses as being desperate and willing to pay virtually anything to get an account.”\n\nSurprisingly, starting a bank account in a Marijuana-related business is usually easier than working within the Bitcoin space, at least within the United States. While an average business can get an account for $100 a month or less, plus initial deposit, one in the cannabis industry often sees fees increased into the thousands, based on their risk assessment. Bitcoin business monthly account costs can commonly start in the thousands, as they now have the highest risk assessment (see exchange risk.)\n\n“For any [money-service business] or money transmitter, banks incur overhead costs for onboarding, screening, and closer transaction monitoring. Those costs are passed on to the [money-service business] customer, based on the nature of their business,” Silicon Valley Bank spokeswoman Carrie Merritt\n\nAlso read: U.S. Regulators Battle Bitcoin Businesses for Control\n\nTraditional banks have a lot of leverage in these situations, with few banks working with these companies at all. Less competition always means higher costs of doing business for the consumer. The small pool of banks can name their price. There may be one bank in your area that will even talk to you. There may be none. The few banks that are willing to do business see it as a nice way to make a juicy profit. Banks live off of fees and interest rates of their customers, the more, the better. And they’re always looking for new and creative ways to charge consumers. It doesn’t get any more or any better in the profiteering department than a Bitcoin business for a banker.\n\n“I’ve dealt with many banks over the years that are willing to take some risk. Say, to bank a money services or remittances company, but they’re not going to do Bitcoin,” said Judy Rinearson of the law firm Bryan Cave.\n\nThis is not indigenous to the U.S., a generally liberal Bitcoin market. We have reported that China has made opening a Bitcoin bank account very hard through more direct means. The People Bank of China is owned directly by the government, so the government has a more direct hand in who gets accounts and who does not.\n\nPersonally, I believe that every industry that appears in the mainstream for fiat currency should be created in the Bitcoin community. You may need to build your organization online in a jurisdiction that is more indifferent than one that is anti-competition for the establishment like regulators are in the United States. People are trained to believe they have to have a traditional bank account to do business domestically, and that may not be the case. Look into working with Bitcoin financial companies like Circle to help with your Bitcoin finances. Support companies in the Bitcoin community that are trying to give you an option within Bitcoin. IMO, Bitcoin should run parallel to the establishment, and use the successful establishment’s history as a model for future growth within Bitcoin. Merging commercial banking services and Bitcoin directly is not recommended.\n\nYou can do it, but you will pay a hefty price, and is it worth it? Think about keeping it in the family.\n\nHow would you finance your own Bitcoin business, and handle the accounting?

Already in 2015, we have seen many attempts at regulating new forms of digital currencies by various governments and jurisdictions, and we’d like to highlight the general trends and outlook for the readers.\n\nBelow is the second half of the report that focuses on business compliance, consumer protection and the general trends for the future.\n\nSummary A visual history of cryptocurrency regulation The status of cryptocurrency regulation around the world Regulatory compliance for business BitLicense: a test case for cryptocurrency regulation Cryptocurrency and consumer protection Conclusion: a note on regulation and the future\n\n4. Regulatory compliance for business\n\nA lot has been said regarding regulation of money service businesses (MSBs) across international jurisdictions. While often seen as a threat by cryptocurrency community, a substantial part of any legislation is nonetheless involved in security, particularly that of the consumer.\n\nThe adopted measures, which involve MSBs and therefore could implicate cryptocurrency, generally target areas such as fraud protection (from rogue companies and organizations), and prevention of criminal activity such as terrorism and money laundering from being financed. These broad practices are adhered to throughout major markets. As we’ve seen, however, the ways in which they affect cryptocurrency industry do vary between states.\n\nCompanies operating in major markets such as exchanges and trading outfits as of 2015 strictly adhere to best practice measures. These either allow them to operate legally within their chosen jurisdictions, or act as ‘future-proofing,’ which will allow them to operate with cryptocurrency in the future if they do not already do so.\n\nIn the US, the steps described below have become mandatory for new and existing businesses with regard to regulatory compliance.\n\nDespite divergences, it must be remembered that cryptocurrency-based operators impose new challenges for policy makers, and that teething problems (such as those witnessed through the creation of New York’s BitLicense scheme, for example) are to be seen as a natural stage on the path to suitable regulatory environment.\n\n5. BitLicense: a test case for cryptocurrency regulation\n\nBitLicense is notable in being an advanced ‘test case’ for how regulation of cryptocurrency could progress globally. While having a set of rules focused on one small jurisdiction is disadvantageous, the highs and lows of the development period have provided useful insights to be taken on board by other authorities looking to deal with the issues surrounding lawful business use of cryptocurrency.\n\nBitLicense was created by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and was a major effort of its Chief Superintendent, Benjamin Lawsky. From its inception in late 2013, Lawsky has been the main proponent of the scheme, and accompanied many of its major milestones. Public reaction, particularly from within the cryptocurrency industry, has been notorious, and Lawsky has had to adapt the proposals considerably since the first draft was made available in August 2014.\n\nBelow is a timeline of the main events surrounding BitLicense.\n\n6. Cryptocurrency and consumer protection\n\nWhen considering the issue of consumer protection, what is immediately conspicuous is that the nascent state of the cryptocurrency industry means that it still differs considerably from traditional finance in this respect. Whereas strict rules have governed businesses in the latter sector for decades, cryptocurrency remains an area where there is a major impetus to engage in consumer protection compliance, but little enforcement of it. This results in an uneven environment full of risk to consumers. However, as technology improves and best practice procedures gain popularity, the landscape is quickly changing.\n\nA current standard (as of March 2015) for cryptocurrency businesses is the use of multisignature technology as a way to secure funds and user information. This has been shown to greatly decrease the ease with which assets can be compromised by third parties (and, indeed, internally), but more recently it has been proven not to be entirely effective.\n\nBy contrast, other industry operators are proponents of alternative methods such as cold storage, but this comes with its own risks and necessitates placing additional trust on those in charge of assets.\n\nWhat is the regulator’s role in consumer protection?\n\nAs with any area of cryptocurrency, the current climate dictates that regulators attempt to strike a workable balance between suitable protection, which is in line with accepted standards, while allowing room for innovation and experimentation on the part of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nSimilarly, in this area as in others, governments are taking various stances, with some seemingly open to the above approach, and others either presenting extensive, possibly premature guidelines (e.g. New York State) or banning development altogether.\n\nIn addition to the attitudes of regulators themselves, it is interesting to consider the consumers’ perspective when gauging an overall impression of public opinion in a certain jurisdiction.\n\nThe above infographics display the results of a survey by CoinDesk of consumer attitudes towards regulation in selected major markets.\n\n7. Conclusion: a note on regulation and the future\n\nWhile the international community is currently in a state of flux regarding cryptocurrency regulation, it is a widely held belief – even a foregone conclusion in 2015 – that regulation is a certainty in the future. It is this belief which has resulted in the many calls for a balanced solution from senior figures within the cryptocurrency sphere.\n\nAs has been seen with the BitLicense proposals as a test case for the regulatory process, the need for transparency and ample public consultation is particularly conspicuous. While such an approach can lead to protracted drafting periods and a raft of differing perspectives, as well as feedback which is not always constructive, it is the principal method by which cryptocurrency can make legitimate inroads into mainstream consumer society.\n\nFor the moment, however, the rate at which this could occur, as well as the regulators’ role in assisting this, remains inconsistent across the globe. While cryptocurrency is making progress in many countries, it is notable that in those with no formal legislation its practical application is being quickly realized, examples of this being Kenya and Botswana. It is thus notable that cryptocurrency development is currently occurring in two spheres: one with regulation, the other without it. In each case, different sections of society are benefitting from the effects of this new technology.\n\nSources: CoinTelegraph, Blockchain.info, CoinDesk, European Digital Currency and Blockchain Forum, CoinOutlet, Coinmap.org, CoinATMRadar, Bitcoinpulse.

Police chief Somyot Poompanmoung said:\n\n""We looked into its business and found it was in fact a pyramid scheme. We revoked its corporate licence on April 8 and sought eight arrest warrants for its shareholders and directors, three of whom are Thai.""\n\nUFun, which essentially operates an e-commerce website, made money by persuading people to contribute to various investment plans that varied in cost from US$500 to US$50,000.\n\nMembers were also asked to persuade others to join by buying UToken, a virtual currency issued by the company and used to buy products on its website.\n\nSomyot stated:\n\n""We found the company did not mention products it registered to sell in its sales pitches. Instead, it urged clients to expand their teams by offering in return high-value items such as cars or gold bars. That way, the money it made mainly came from new members rather than from selling the products.""\n\nThe police seized money transfer slips of hundreds of thousands of baht each, banknotes, luxury cards, brand-name bags and around 40 luxury watches from the suspects. Thailand\'s Anti-Money Laundering Office also seized 250 million baht (US$1.67 million) of the company\'s assets.\n\nThe suspects included Rittidej Warong, a lawyer by profession and police-sub lieutenant, who holds 51% of the company.\n\nOther suspects on arrest warrants are three Malaysians — Tae Kim Leng, Lee Kuan Ming and Wong Ching Hua — and a Thai, Arthit Pankaew. The four are believed to be the masterminds of the scheme, according to assistant police chief Suvira Songmetta, who led the raid on Saturday morning.\n\nSurfing on the crypto buzz\n\nUToken, a digital medium of exchange created by UFun that ""provides investment growth opportunity,"" is allegedly issued by UToken Reserve Limited, ""a group of established international body representative[s] from the Internet Technology, Business, Banking, Investors and Networking Industries,"" according to the website.\n\nUToken currently has six committee members from Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, Vietnam and Guinea, with six bureaus throughout Southeast Asia, and the committee is looking to expand.\n\nA history of Utoken suggests that the digital token was founded in Hong Kong in 2013, and has created plenty of affiliated products and services throughout its existence, including UBonuss, UBarter, UFun Gold and UToken Mutual Fund.\n\nThe company allegedly signed a joint venture for development of a project called Bangkok Marina Resort and Spa.\n\nBina Puri Holdings, a construction company that was collaborating to develop the property in Bangkok, issued a ""letter of protest"" to UFun Group Ltd. in July 2014, asking the company to ""refrain from informing all your customers that our Company is your joint venture partner for the \'UToken\' promotion.""\n\n""We do not participate in any of your promotions for \'UToken,\' and we are at no material times your joint ventures partners for the \'Utokens,\' which you or your related Companies are promoting. [...] Please take notice that we are only collaborating to develop a Property in Bangkok, Thailand under the Project name of \'Bangkok Marina Resort & SPA\' [...] Please note that there is no Partnership being created.""\n\nUToken Reserve claims to have signed a strategic agreement with UDBP Bank, BDG Bank SA and Nico Financial in March 2014 to launch a payment settlement via UDBP card system, resulting in a US$10 million transfer to BDG Bank.\n\nAn English non-official presentation of UToken mentions Bitcoin\'s success stories, its growth and millionaires, before pitching that ""UToken growth is much faster than Bitcoin,"" and that unlike the cryptocurrency, UToken ""has a main office/management/global offices.""\n\nWhile local authorities are cracking down on UToken and the so-called UFun Club, other crooked projects might be in development as well. These products are similar in the way that they all surf on the Bitcoin buzz to lure people to ""invest"" money into some alleged lucrative plan.\n\n""If you really understand Bitcoin and crytocurrencies, you could see how scammy UToken was,"" David Moskowitz, founder of Coin Republic, a bitcoin brokering and consulting business based in Singapore, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n""Promising returns, pushing for the recruitment of new members, and a supposed bank in Africa backing them were all red flags to me.

Some of the new companies like Astroblocks and Bitproof are building Proof-of-Existence platforms (there is also another platform by the same name) over the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThese Proof-of-Existence platforms provides a smart tamper-proof way of storing encrypted information on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each file stored on the blockchain will be associated with a unique irreplicable transaction hash. These transaction hashes will act as a reference to the documents stored on the blockchain. Anything once written on to the blockchain will be stored forever, without any way of deleting it and that is what makes it an ideal electronic system to certify and store documents.\n\nWe can safely say that intellectual property is the most valuable asset any individual or company can have. The process of obtaining protection for your intellectual property is still a cumbersome process.

Blockchain based Proof-of-Existence platforms provides an alternate way for both individuals and companies alike to document their creations or discoveries and handle IP disputes more efficiently.\n\nWhether it is a new scientific invention, design, artwork, screenplay, story or anything. The creator can record his works on these Proof-of-Existence platforms. In case of any dispute, the inventor can always contest any claims by using the transactional hash of the concerned document.

Good luck!', 'Edwin Heathcote APRIL 12, 2015 0 Moira Gemmill, who has died aged 55 in a London cycling accident, was a leading figure in architecture and design and one of the capital’s most influential and discerning patrons. She was en route to a job specially created for her, and which she had taken up only in January, as director of capital programmes for the Royal Collection Trust. Gemmill had been charged with the vast task of modernising facilities at Windsor Castle and Edinburgh’s Palace of Holyroodhouse — apparently handpicked by the Queen. Before that, at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum she implemented an ambitious £150m (so far) “Future Plan” to update its galleries. Gemmill worked with a succession of (usually young) architects and designers to create a varied and stimulating series of gallery spaces, the aesthetic and stylistic variety of which chimed with the eclecticism of the Victorian building. The V&A was transformed by interventions that opened it up, including a new entrance by Eva Jiricna, the John Madejski Garden (the central courtyard that had been used as storage space) and Amanda Levete’s entrance courtyard and exhibition space. The museum was established to educate manufacturers and the public about design, Gemmill said last year. “But through the 20th century it became seen more as an art museum. Future Plan is partly about its rehabilitation. At the V&A the building came first and the collections came later. The museum was designed to embody new materials and techniques.” Gemmill made it her mission to restore this idea of the building as a didactic tool, practising what it preached about the value of good design. She also oversaw the extension of the V&A beyond its Kensington site, opening the Clothworkers’ Centre for textiles and fashion in Olympia, a satellite museum in Dundee designed by Japan’s Kengo Kuma and planning a new centre on the London 2012 Olympics site. “She was convinced”, V&A director Martin Roth told the Financial Times on Sunday, “that good design could change society.” Gemmill was born into a farming family in Kintyre, western Scotland, in 1959 and is survived by her parents. She studied graphic design and photography at the Glasgow School of Art, joining the Aberdeen Art Gallery and later the Museum of London where she was responsible for a series of exhibitions. At the V&A from 2002 she became a patron of young practices and also of women architects. Her achievements are embodied in their most visible form in the V&A, an institution back into which she was so instrumental in breathing life and purpose. As Mr Roth puts it: “The V&A style that we see today, that is Moira. It is her work.” Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'APRIL 12, 2015 3 Sir, I was surprised at the intensity of the FT’s opposition to the Loi Florange (editorial, April 9), a 2014 French law that makes it easier for long-term shareholders to gain additional voting rights. It is a stance that will undoubtedly be popular with the UK asset management industry. Indeed, a vocal campaign by institutional investors recently led to a U-turn by the Italian government when it sought to implement a similar measure. However, it is one thing to identify the flaws in a policy that can potentially be exploited by large shareholders to entrench their power over a company (such as Vincent Bolloré at Vivendi). It is altogether another to offer a credible alternative that will address the short-termist business orientation of many institutional investors. As the Kay and Cox reviews emphasised, this is a serious issue for listed companies due to its knock-on effects on corporate investment, research and development, product innovation, and human capital development in the real economy. The mantra of “one share, one vote” is typically adduced by the asset management industry to ward off efforts to incentivise more long-term company ownership. But this principle is only of value to the economy as a whole if a significant body of investors are willing to actively use their votes in the interests of long-term capitalism. Too often this is not the case. The high profile activist campaigns being waged by hedge funds at Alliance Trust and Vivendi seem to be less about debating alternative long-term strategic visions for the two organisations than finding ways of generating short-term boosts to the share price through share buybacks and other balance sheet manoeuvres. To address these issues, the UK asset management industry is still pinning its hopes on the UK Stewardship Code as a means of promoting better, more long-term ownership behaviour. But although a worthy initiative, there is scant evidence after five years of operation that the code has delivered a fundamental improvement in investor stewardship. The business model of most asset managers still has a performance time horizon of 12 months and not 12 years — the Stewardship Code has done nothing to change that underlying reality. Consequently, before dismissing such measures as the Loi Florange as the dirigiste meddling of a Socialist French government, the investor community should give some thought to the alternatives. What can they suggest that will better align their interests with the long-term success of UK plc rather than the zero-sum outperformance of their peer group?

04/13/2015,"['Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has grown in size and scope. Developed as a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency and payment system without a central authority to regulate it, it has garnered worldwide interest. Groups as diverse as computer geeks and cryptographers, to anarchists and hippies, to venture capitalists and the suits on Wall Street have all shown a keen interest in the so-called cryptocurrency.\n\nToday, one Bitcoin exchanges for approximately US $250–$260, and has a market capitalization of nearly $4 billion, with approximately $50 million a day in notional transaction value. Companies and merchants large and small are now accepting Bitcoin for goods or services rendered, including Microsoft (MSFT), Dell Computer, Overstock.com (OSTK), NewEgg, Virgin Airways, and many more.\n\nWhile the value of Bitcoin as a virtual currency and payment system is certainly valuable, novel applications using its underlying technology –\ufeff known as the blockchain – are promising to be much more valuable than Bitcoin in and of itself. (See Also: Basics for Buying and Investing in Bitcoin.)\n\nAn Overview of Bitcoin and the Blockchain\n\nThe notion of a digital money has been around for decades, however Bitcoin was the first to solve the major problem that faced its predecessors: the double-spending problem. Specifically, how does one prevent a money form that exists in purely digital form — just ones and zeroes — from being copied and spent more than once at the same time?\n\nTake the example of a digital photograph. This can be attached to an email and sent to hundreds of recipients, with identical copies of the original photograph along with it. These multiple copies of the same photograph undermine its value. If it were a unit of money, it could be counterfeited at will. Bitcoin prevents double-spending by utilizing a public ledger whereby each and every transaction is recorded and remains a permanent fixture. Not only that, but each and every node in the distributed Bitcoin network has a copy of the public ledger that can be compared against the other copies for fidelity. While the ledger itself is public, the individuals transacting in Bitcoin remain anonymous, represented by an alphanumeric string and no other identifying information. (See also: Ways to Earn Bitcoins.)\n\nFor example, say person A sends 5 BTC (the abbreviation for Bitcoin units) to Person B. Person A\'s account, known as a \'wallet\', is debited -5 BTC while person B\'s account in the ledger is credited with +5 BTC. This transaction is recorded in the blockchain, but only the string of letters and numbers that serve as unique identifiers for the wallets of A and B are revealed. (See also: Bitcoin May Be the Currency of the Future.)\n\nBut that still does not preclude double-spending. The public ledger is the first step; verification and validation of the ledger\'s contents is the second. New Bitcoins are produced, or \'mined\', without a central monetary authority by solving a difficult cryptographic algorithm based on encryption built by the NSA. Computers trying to solve this puzzle compete to do so and the \'winner\' — the first to do so — is rewarded with a block of newly minted Bitcoins. Hard-wired into the Bitcoin source code, which is open source and in the public domain, is a rule stating that a new block of Bitcoins will be \'mined\' on average once every ten minutes. If a lot of computational effort is directed towards solving this puzzle, it is likely that new blocks will be discovered sooner than the targeted ten minute interval. In response, the system will adjust the mining difficulty upwards — making that difficult puzzle even harder to solve — until the ten minute target is restored. (For more, see: What is Bitcoin Mining?)\n\nMining has a dual purpose. It spurs the creation of Bitcoins and increases the supply, but it also keeps the blockchain secure and solves the double-spending problem. By solving this encryption problem, Bitcoin miners worldwide serve to ensure the validity and fidelity of the public ledger, making it impossible to alter. Any attempt to change, copy, or counterfeit a past transaction will immediately ripple through the blockchain, causing the attempt to immediately be recognized and disregarded. The more aggregate mining effort the network has, the more difficult it is to undermine. Today, the aggregate computing power in the distributed Bitcoin mining network is more powerful than all the world\'s supercomputers put together. (See also: Can Bitcoin Be Hacked?)\n\nBitcoin 2.0 — Using the Blockchain\'s Power in New Ways\n\nSo, why could Bitcoin stand to change the world and disrupt finance as we know it? While the mining work done to secure and validate internal Bitcoin-to-Bitcoin transactions is valuable, recent enhancements to the core Bitcoin source code now allow for the mining network to secure and validate external non-Bitcoin transactions. These so-called Bitcoin 2.0 applications could perhaps be even more valuable than Bitcoin in and of itself. Anywhere that validation of trust, proof of ownership, or a record of an event are required, the blockchain can provide an ultra-secure, cost-effective, decentralized solution that can persist even if one or more nodes go down due to outage or hacking attempts.\n\nAlready, Bitcoin-related start-ups have received venture capital funding exceeding the pace of that invested in the dot-com days of the late 1990s. Although much of that investment has been deployed to augment the \'traditional\' Bitcoin ecosystem, a growing amount is being directed at Bitcoin 2.0 companies.\n\nFor example, financial transactions can be settled and cleared via the blockchain and validated for a fraction of the cost that a clearing house or stock exchange could offer. Furthermore, asset transaction could be settled in just a few minutes, rather than a few days. Currently, a company wishing to IPO shares to the public needs to use investment banks to underwrite the deal and a stock exchange to list and trade the shares. But, it is possible to IPO directly and securely via the blockchain for a fraction of the cost of the current method. Shares could be issued entirely overlaying the Bitcoin backbone without fear of theft or fraud. Transfers of shares would be unambiguous and immutable. If this system were to supplant investment banks and asset exchanges, it would disrupt the way financial markets operate. Global investment bank UBS (UBS) recently announced that it will be opening a division with the express function of leveraging this technology. (See Also: Medici, The Blockchain Stock Exchange.)\n\nRetail banking could also be disrupted. Depositors could use the public ledger to maintain a record of bank account balances, record money transfers, and confirm transactions worldwide — all without the banking customer having to deal with Bitcoin directly or worry about its market price.\n\nTitle registry records and deed transfers for land ownership or for high value items, such as automobiles, boats and motorcycles, can be recorded and transferred to new owners without the need for title search, departments of motor vehicles, or other government entities to ensure the trust and validity of the transaction. Proof of ownership via title can be transferred with the click of a button, without any chance that the title is fraudulent. In South America alone there is more than $9 trillion in un-tapped land values that landowners cannot access because they cannot get a hold of title records. A blockchain-based solution could be used to unlock that value without risk of corruption.\n\nContracts can be confirmed and verified through the blockchain, including employment contracts, leases, purchase agreements with the ""signatures"" embedded in the blockchain. This may prove to disrupt the legal system, requiring expensive lawyers and courts to confirm, verify, and validate contracts.\n\nDigital certificates of authenticity and proof of ownership embedded in the blockchain can be a powerful anti-counterfeiting tool, putting a dent in the $250 billion a year the economy loses to counterfeiting. Whether it is fake pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, or electronics devices, using the blockchain to validate their authenticity is of great value. Art and collectibles could also be authenticated in a such a manner, preventing forgery and sale of stolen goods.\n\nIntellectual property can also be time stamped and recorded, replacing traditional copyrights and patents. A person taking a digital photograph to sell to a blog may find their material copied and duplicated without credit or proof that they were the original owner of the photo. The same goes with a piece of text or other creative work. By time stamping the digital file in the blockchain, there is no ambiguity as to who the original owner is and when the work was created.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin has evolved to allow its powerful mining network, which is essentially a gigantic validation engine, to validate and record external non-Bitcoin transactions. The value of these services — a system of \'trustless trust\' — can prove much more valuable that Bitcoin itself as a digital currency. The entire financial, legal, and record-keeping industries can be disrupted using this decentralized, secure, and inexpensive method. Even if only a securities exchange application is brought online, the real-world value could be on the order of billions of dollars each and every year.\n\nWhy would Bitcoin miners do all this validation work for \'free\'? Because they are mining to earn new bitcoins. It is plausible that the value of Bitcoins earned in the future will embody some value commensurate with the validation work being performed. If that is the case, the dollar price of Bitcoins could rise as a result. Either way, Bitcoin 2.0 applications leveraging blockchain technology will prove to be a powerful technology that is already starting to be implemented.', 'Veteran bitcoin activist Bruce Fenton has been named the Bitcoin Foundation\'s newest executive director.\n\nElected by a 5-to-1 vote, Fenton succeeds interim executive director Patrick Murck and outgoing executive director Jon Matonis, the latter of whom resigned on 30th October amid financial turmoil and ahead of staff cuts at the industry’s top trade organization.\n\nIn interview, Fenton stressed that his greatest asset to the Bitcoin Foundation would be his ability to serve as a “bridge” between the organisation’s individual and corporate members. He cited his full-time position as CEO of Atlantic Financial and involvement in bitcoin as a technology enthusiast as factors.\n\nFurther, Fenton did his best to express his desire that, with his appointment, the organization and its divided board would be able advance on the challenge of finding yet another new direction, less than six months after a pivot to focus solely on core development.\n\nFenton told CoinDesk:\n\n”I am going to do everything I can to make sure it stays in the black. Certainly we are not in the situation we were in when [the price of] bitcoin was much higher. I’m not going to second guess past decisions, I’m sure there were mistakes made.”\n\nThe executive director said he expected to receive “a full picture” of the organization’s financials in the coming days, but focused on what he believes is its bright future ahead.\n\n“I believe bitcoin is going to be very, very important in our world. I think the Bitcoin Foundation can and will have a valuable role in that process in terms of being an important part of our industry,” he added.\n\nNotably, Fenton indicated he would be serving in the formerly paid executive director role as a volunteer.\n\nConfirmation process\n\nThough the foundation’s formal announcement was short on details about the process, Fenton suggested he was one of a limited list of prospective candidates for the position.\n\nFenton did not divulge other contenders, saying only that the foundation’s board had “looked internally”, a development confirmed by the release of its latest board meeting minutes last week.\n\nThe publication of these documents, though contested, provided evidence that board members Olivier Janssens and Jim Harper had sought to position themselves as potential candidates for the role in meetings. Also considered during this time was BitPay head of non-profit outreach Elizabeth Ploshay.\n\nFenton did suggest that one board member will be elevated to the position of board chairman to work in conjunction with him on foundation goals.\n\nNo details were provided as to how this process may move forward.\n\nDivided board\n\nThroughout the interview, Fenton suggested that he hopes to quell the recent arguments that have colored the wider conversation about the foundation even while recognizing that the ramifications of certain past decisions are still playing out.\n\nFenton indicated that core development, for example, is still expected to continue under a new entity, a proposal first put forward by Murck in March.\n\n“The main focus [for the foundation] going forward will be things like education and advocacy,” Fenton continued. “Working on education, educating the public about bitcoin.”\n\nFenton stated his belief that much of the debate surrounding core development had been colored by the perception that the organisation is in control of this process.\n\n“That’s the nature of the way development works,” Fenton said. “When you’re dealing with individual developers, you can only offer them a paycheck. They may accept it, they may want to do their own thing. Even if the board had unlimited capital, the most it could do is offer to pay.”\n\nActive community member\n\nThough his most high-profile industry position to date, Fenton has long been an outspoken, if sometimes controversial, member of the bitcoin community.\n\nPerhaps most contentious have been his staunch opposition to attempts to regulate the bitcoin industry, as well as his spearheading of a secretive conference held in the Dominican Republic this February. Known as the Satoshi Rountable, the event’s limited guest list caused debate in the community given its long-time struggles with transparency.\n\nFenton is also acting president of Bitcoin Association, an alternative trade group to the Bitcoin Foundation, that he said he would be handing over to other members. The process of this transfer of leadership, he said, is already underway.\n\n“I will remain in a more passive role,"" he added.\n\nBoard meeting image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Big firms, like Samsung, IBM and UBS, are already researching what to do with the underlying tech for things like storage. But what about gaming?\n\nCan games make use of the blockchain?\n\nIn itself, a blockchain is just a distributed ledger, a database of sorts. Being simplistic, games can be thought as a database too, one with a very fancy UI. Why would any game need the blockchain? They already are a database.\n\nNot only that, every game is a fast database. The blockchain is far from it, a game needs an update every time the engine ticks; which might range from 1/30th of a second to several orders of magnitude less (for physics, AI, etc). How could a blockchain help here? Bitcoin gets a block every ten minutes.\n\nMoreover, P2P in gaming is not new. Although many of today’s online gaming passions reside in centralized servers, the technology for LAN (and dial-up) multiplayer exists since the 90s, every old school DOOM player can attest to that. Where would it help to use a blockchain here? The problem is already solved.\n\nAnyone thinking about P2P distribution is overlooking the fact that not long ago 12.6 million IPs were downloading tens of gigabytes of pirated content through the BitTorrent protocol each month. The blockchain is now a mere ~31GB while any big release by a triple-A game studio is well over 20 GB. Who would change torrents for this? Blockchains are redundant here.\n\nCheating in games is as old as games themselves, and there are decade-old counter-measures to it such as Punkbuster, Blizzard’s Warden, Valve Anti-Cheat, and others. There should be nothing a blockchain could do here. Well, actually, it is the domain of Bitcoin to be pretty much unfalsifiable. So it’s not unfeasible to use the tech behind it to implement something similar. When will the blockchain be used for this? I don’t know, go ahead and steal this idea. Now.\n\nThe blockchain as intermediary\n\nSince 1994 there have been online casinos in the world, and not surprisingly even the first was secured cryptographically. It was only natural that with the advent of Bitcoin a new form of online venue would emerge: the Bitcoin Casino. These casinos are different in the sense that people no longer play with “chips” or “credits”, they play with bitcoin; which is much more like money, but lacking the “store of value” attribute.\n\nThese games do not integrate the blockchain in their insides as some of the previous comparisons would suggest; but they rather interact with the blockchain, and that is where its power resides: as an intermediary.\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain is a great intermediary, one that does not depend on any company whatsoever; it is not chained to any specific provider apart from its chosen few developers and their holy code. Messages in the chain will be protected by its voracious miners and their virtual hashing pickaxes.\n\nAt a cost, any game can record entries in the ledger. For a Casino, they are just plain bitcoins to be played with instantly; for an MMO they could represent a virtual item such as a sword, a hat, or even a character… so then why not the game’s data itself?\n\nStoring games in the blockchain\n\nPeople have already stored arbitrary data into the blockchain by using a hacky method where one sends Bitcoin to fake address, which by themselves encode the needed data. Since finding the private key for such addresses ranges from astronomically improbable to impossible, those coins are irremediably lost forcing clients to register them into the UTXO set (unspent output set).\n\nDon’t get confused, that arbitrary data is not the public notes blockchain.info can assign to bitcoin transactions; although blockchain.info used to store that data into the blockchain. Since those days and because of the bloat it generates, it was decided that up to 80 bytes of data could be embedded into a transaction.\n\nWith 80 bytes of data, a simple game like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past could be compressed to 630,589 bytes with 7z and embedded into the blockchain in about 7,883 transactions, whose cost could range from 7883 satoshis (with zero fees) to a perhaps reasonable 0.78837883 BTC (including a fee of 0.0001) or at the current price is just about US$200, which is perhaps not a bad price to store something ad infinitum all over the world; and certainly not good news for Nintendo if someone decided to do this. (However, other encoding schemes can increase this to 20000 bytes per transaction, reducing the cost to almost a dollar (US$0.80008), although its reliability is menaced by the possibility of blockchain pruning.)\n\nCan Nintendo roll this back? No. Can they sue, send cease-and-desist letters or try to indulge in profits? No, it’s not a youtube channel. It is a cryptographically secure globally distributed database.\n\nThis is one of the magic qualities of the blockchain: It’s like a vault, once something’s in it the knights templar of mining will keep it secure as long as they can.\n\nHowever, this is not what Bitcoin was thought for; this is a hack – a useful one, but still a hack. Given the ever dropping costs of storage and the high efficiency that a dedicated decentralized solution can surely provide, people would be far better off with something like storj.io or MaidSafe.\n\nMaking games store things in the blockchain\n\nThis is an interesting approach that might seem to contradict the early rhetorical statements that games did not need databases. It turns out that for some use cases, it might be a good idea to store user data in the blockchain.\n\nThink about it. Small things such as accounts could be stored in it. Picture someone buying a game and getting a token on the blockchain; part of this token, which is actually an asymmetric pair of encryption keys, could be easily used as a login by having a user sign with their private key and letting the owner verify it, which would constitute enough proof of ownership for the user to be validated.\n\nSince bitcoin addresses are just hashes of public keys and can’t be really seen until they’re spent, it would work wonders. The game client could be cracked to only validate a known payment, but hey, small steps first.\n\nIn the same vein, it could be used to credit purchases such as DLC or in-game items or cosmetic improvements. Don’t be surprised if EA starts “researching” Bitcoin tech. Jokes aside, this is good news for indies who have no dedicated servers to store immutable user data. So far, a collectible card game owner (Deckbound) is taking this approach to store and generate trading cards for its games.\n\nBitcoin for crowdfunding\n\nBefore Bitcoin, Indie game developers have never had so much freedom to collect money. Let’s face it Kickstarter is the place to go for indie game funding, there’s no denying that indiegogo is flexible and great, but KS stats are very likely to still dominate it; and it is really not accessible for anyone outside the handful of eligible countries.\n\nWhile some bitcoin-exclusive crowdfunding sites have emerged, none of them has really taken off. The Latin American “Kickstarter”, idea.me, is perhaps the most well known crowdfunding site that accepts bitcoin; but it is even dwarfed by indiegogo.\n\nIf there’s a reason any of these bitcoin kickstarters haven’t had any success, it is because they’re really not needed at all. Why use a middleman when you’ve already got the best impartial intermediary available? Sure, KS “all or nothing” approach won’t work without one, but indiegogo’s flexible funding translates transparently to direct bitcoin funding.\n\nIf an indie game developer is clever enough to write a game, it should be a no-brainer for him or her to set up a mock KS page with a different bitcoin address for each reward tier.\n\nBitcoin for e-sports\n\nHere again gambling comes into the scene, it is currently possible to bet bitcoin on e-sports by accessing traditional sports betting sites; and there’s services like leetcoin which allow players to bet between themselves.\n\nSadly, there’s not much to do with Bitcoin here. With little organization and services like challonge and twitch, it is really easy to setup a tournament. It is only a matter of community management.\n\nBitcoin micro-transactions for indie game developers\n\nAgain, bitcoin strikes a liberating blow to free indie developers from the clutches of payment processor fees; with a handful of code and the proper APIs, it is really easy to implement micro-transactions on video-games.\n\nThis will allow many game developers to implement business models like F2P with even less friction than before. Generate a QR inside your game, communicate with the blockchain via bitcoind or any blockchain API you prefer, and there you go.\n\nThe only “drawback” might be the fact that a minimum transaction fee has to be paid in order for miners to pick the block relatively soon, at current prices the recommended minimum transaction fee (0.0001 BTC) is about 2.3753 cents of a US dollar.\n\nBlockchains for game company IPOs\n\nConceivably, this might be the option that has the largest friction of all the non-gambling gaming uses of Bitcoin tech; as the legislation for initial public offerings and incorporations is deep and varied. Yet, if properly executed it might be one of the most radical amongst them.\n\nOnce more, the ironically named blockchain, will liberate developers to create corporations whose stock can be represented digitally in a decentralized manner. While the words “corporation” and “indie” might seem extreme opposites, it is a feasible way of raising funds and sharing profits.\n\nReddit had tried to do this with its “reddit notes” but as of February this year it has desisted in doing so, as the new leadership is not interested in cryptocurrencies.\n\nMaybe reddit is in no hurry to raise and share, but can indies afford not to? With Epic Games and Unity Technologies announcements early this year, together with platforms such as Steam Greenlight and Desura, it seems game development is getting so much more democratical. Why not share ownership?\n\nConclusions\n\nWhile much can be said about possible innovations in gaming with blockchain tech, many aspects of it are not really needed by the gaming industry. Modern games are currently on the forefront of many technologies and constitute the main source of demand for billion dollar gpu companies like nVidia and AMD.\n\nThe prospects for Bitcoin interaction with games are really bright, as it feels like a niche that was previously not properly filled. In addition, the low legal friction that exists between most of its non-gambling uses should accelerate the adoption of the practices and techniques that will surely keep emerging.\n\nUnless really innovative solutions are developed, the playing field is now more inclined towards small producers and indie developers as there is a new very low-cost middleman at their service.\n\nYour feedback is very welcome.

Then, it invests that spare change into Bitcoin. If you buy $3.25 cup of coffee, for example, Lawnmower will round up to $4 and take the extra 75 cents and buy Bitcoin. Over time, the money will add up and appreciate in value, at least in theory.\n\n“We’re promoting these tiny little purchases every day,”co-founder Alex Sunnarborg told Fortune. “It’s really for the saving, investing side” of Bitcoin’s growing uses, he added.\n\nLawnmower is part of a growing trend of personal finance tools aimed at young professionals. They have no minimum amount that their users must deposit, which lowers the barriers for investing, and feature designs that appeal to a generation that spends more time on their smartphones than any other device.\n\nThe new apps and services include Digit, which automatically funnels small amounts of money from your checking account into a savings account based on spending habits, and Robinhood, a no-fee app for that lets users track and buy public stocks. Acorns, the original inspiration for Lawnmower, automatically invests its users’ change into exchange traded funds, or ETFs, instead of Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition to this personal finance niche, tech entrepreneurs have, in the last few years, pushed a related category of tools for investing and managing personal wealth. Wealthfront and Betterment, for example, automate customers’ investment decisions by using algorithms instead of giving the job to human investment advisors. And apps like Mint help people manage their spending and saving more efficiently.\n\nLawnmower doesn’t charge any fees for its current service although users are still subject to those of Coinbase, the Bitcoin wallet users are required to sign up for and which stores the Bitcoins they amass.\n\nSunnarborg expects Bitcoin enthusiasts to make up most of Lawnmower’s early users, and that twenty-somethings could be next. “It’s definitely going to be easier to convert a 25 year-old.”\n\nLawnmower’s co-founders also hope that the app’s easy auotmated approach to Bitcoin investing will help it appeal to more mainstream users without overwhelming them with Bitcoin’s complexities. The app positions Bitcoin to its users as yet another investment opportunity, just as Robinhood does with stocks and Acorns does with ETFs.\n\nBitcoin, first proposed in 2008, is an entirely digital currency that supporters hope will someday take the place of traditional currencies. Its value has fluctuated widely, from being worthless when first introduced, to hitting a peak price of $1,242 per Bitcoin in late October 2013 and stands at around $225 today. Despite growing support from financial institutions, Bitcoin is still a controversial investment for many, mostly due to its volatility, unflattering incidents like the bankruptcy of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox in last year, and some people’s belief that Bitcoin is a fad that will eventually die out.\n\nBut Sunnarborg isn’t very worried. Just like stocks, real estate and commodities, he said Bitcoins are prone to market forces, and the investments are in such small increments that most Lawnmower users won’t jeopardize huge amounts of their money.\n\nSunnarborg founded Lawnmower with Pieter Gorsira and Patrick Archambeau in late 2014, and their start-up is currently being shepherded along at Boost.vc, an accelerator program specifically helping Bitcoin startups get their businesses off the ground.\n\nLawnmower, which launched on iOS last week (with Android slated to launch in the next few weeks), is an easy way to get people started with Bitcoin, according to co-founder Alex Sunnarborg.\n\nAlthough it’s not making money at the moment, Lawnmower will eventually offer additional investing options and management services to generate revenue. Referral fees from sending users to outside services are another revenue stream Lawnmower could easily implement.\n\n“Essentially the spare change was our first little quirk” Sunnarborg said.\n\nFor more about Bitcoin, watch this Fortune video:', 'BitTorrent Inc. released a new version the popular BitTorrent client uTorrent this week. The release aims to make it easier for users to avoid a highly criticized Bitcoin miner which was bundled with the previous 3.4.2 version. The company understands that the controversy ""eroded"" the trust of some users, but hopes to keep them on board.\n\nLast month many uTorrent users were surprised to see that their favorite BitTorrent client came bundled with the “Epic Scale” Bitcoin miner.\n\nWhat made things worse was that, according to some, the application was installed silently without asking for explicit permission. uTorrent’s parent company BitTorrent Inc. denied these allegations but took the complaints seriously.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner was quickly suspended until further notice. Based on the negative backlash from users it was recently announced that the “offer” would not be reinstated.\n\nThe uTorrent team offered a public apology and said it misjudged how users would respond.\n\n“We acknowledge again that we misjudged how this offer would be received, and we apologize to users who have objected to it or who had trouble uninstalling that software. We understand this has already eroded some users’ trust in ?Torrent,” BitTorrent Inc. Jory Berson said.\n\nTo further clarify the situation the uTorrent development team decided to release a new version this week. The bump from 3.4.2 to 3.4.3 should help to steer people away from the tainted version.\n\n“This new release is in part to make it easy for our users to identify which version of ?Torrent to pursue,” Berson notes.\n\nWhile the official site no longer offers downloads that include the bundled Epic Scale Bitcoin miner, BitTorrent Inc. warns that third-party sites may still include it with the older release.\n\n“It is important to note that if you are not downloading ?Torrent software directly from us, that some third party distributors may have the older version with the Epic Scale offer, Berson says.\n\n“This would only be a very small number, but to be sure you are installing the version you want, look for 3.4.3 or download directly from us,” he adds.\n\nThe BitTorrent mainline client, which included the same Bitcoin miner, has been updated from version 7.9.2 to version 7.9.3. The latest releases of both uTorrent and BitTorrent can be downloaded through the official sites.', ""A host of local companies are looking to disrupt the remittance market in Africa by undercutting traditional money transfer operators while also offering businesses new ways of accepting payments on a continent with low credit card penetration and an over-reliance on cash.\n\nThe likes of Igot, Beam, BitPesa and BitX have spotted an opportunity to build Bitcoin businesses in Africa. Though stolen bitcoins, the collapse of the Mt.Gox exchange and drastic digital currency value fluctuations have made Bitcoin a byword for controversy in much of the Western world, they feel it can find a true home in Africa, the land of mobile money.\n\nThe problem they are looking to fix is a big one, though the opportunity is also enormous. Remittances to and within Africa are big business. There are more than 30 million Africans living in the diaspora, sending home US$40 billion per year, an amount which is steadily increasing. This amounts to an average per migrant of US$1,200.\n\nYet the cost of these transaction is hurting those sending and receiving money. Total annual fees amount to US$1.4 billion. Western Union and MoneyGram dominate the field, with 50 percent or more market share across most of Africa, but charge an average of 12.3 percent to send just US$200. Acceptance of payments by merchants is also an issue, with less than three percent of Africans owning credit cards, bank transfers as expensive as remittances and PayPal not yet widespread.\n\nMajor impact\n\nTimothy Stranex, chief executive officer of African Bitcoin exchange BitX, says the digital currency can have a major impact on international remittances, in terms of both speed, efficiency and cost. Most Bitcoin remittance firms charge fees of around three percent on transactions, seriously undercutting the more traditional players.\n\n“International wire transfers take several days to settle because they are processed using legacy batch systems. In contrast, Bitcoin payments are fully settled within minutes. This enables much faster international payments. Existing remittance companies can use this technology to streamline their backend operations and save costs by maintaining less float,” he said.\n\n“One of the difficulties in remittances is the ‘last mile’ problem: getting money to the final recipient. Because recipients often don’t have bank accounts, the money is typically paid out in cash, which is expensive and inefficient to handle. In the case of Bitcoin, it’s almost effortless for the recipient to setup a Bitcoin wallet on their phone even if they don’t have a bank account. The final leg of the remittance can then be handled electronically.”\n\nStranex sees a huge opportunity in Africa for Bitcoin remittance firms due to the low rate of credit card adoption, the high cost of international remittances and the fact Africans have already proven they are willing to adopt alternative forms of sending money, as with mobile money services such as M-Pesa.\n\nLeapfrogging the legacy\n\n“As people adopt electronic payments, they have the opportunity to leapfrog legacy payment methods and go straight to cheaper and easier online technologies like Bitcoin,” he said.\n\n“Africa is the first mobile-first continent and Bitcoin is very well suited to mobile. The success of mobile money in Kenya has shown that mobile-based payments and wallets can work very well in Africa. Bitcoin is also useful in unstable countries where local banks and local currency may be untrustworthy.”\n\nRick Day, of Bitcoin exchange Igot, which has recorded 200,000 transactions since launching and went live in Africa earlier this year, says Bitcoin offers a unique solution to the rates charged by the likes of Western Union.\n\n“It’s peer-to-peer and it’s almost instant,” he said. “The receiver can simply exchange Bitcoins for their local currency using a Bitcoin exchange. This means the cost of sending remittance is minimal and cash is available to the receiver within the same day, in most cases.”\n\nNikunj Handa, chief executive officer (CEO) of Ghanaian Bitcoin remittance firm Beam, believes whether or not Bitcoin disrupts the remittance market depends on if it can gain widespread merchant adoption and become a currency that can be used readily without being exchanged in the future.\n\n“If this were to happen, Bitcoin will be an excellent way for people to send money directly, without intermediaries, in a fast and extremely cheap manner. This is when Bitcoin will truly ‘disrupt’ remittances,” he said.\n\n“Bitcoin does not have the acceptance that a Visa or MasterCard does, but it is increasingly becoming a great way for African merchants to accept payments from a global consumer base.”\n\nConcerns over security could be a hindrance to this uptake, but Handa said Bitcoin as a protocol was very robust and safe.\n\n“I would say that security concerns with regards to the protocol and Bitcoin itself are overblown,” he said.\n\n“Almost all security lapses take place when companies utilising the Bitcoin technology fail to secure themselves properly. If one is careful in picking a company that is reputable and is known to take its security seriously, they should be safe. This is the same level of protection one should have in mind when they are picking traditional payment processors.”\n\nExperts agree there are strong possibilities for Bitcoin in Africa, which could pose a threat to the market dominance of Western Union and MoneyGram.\n\nGilles Ubaghs, financial services analyst at Ovum, says in the case of Africa and other emerging markets Bitcoin can also provide the benefit of offering a standardised infrastructure between emerging markets and helping increase money flows.\n\n“There’s a huge diaspora of money shifting around within Africa across nations already so this could really be a bit of a leapfrog,” he said.\n\nRead next: Why success in African e-commerce is all about scale and biding your time\n\nThis post is part of our contributor series.

The company formally announced the news in a press release and Twitter confirmation Monday.\n\nSatoshi Citadel Industries acquires Bitcoin exchange BuyBitcoin t.co/RG41AqBUXP pic.twitter.com/3pZ8LjhfD8 — Tech in Asia (@Techinasia) April 13, 2015\n\nCo-Founder and CEO of BuyBitcoin.ph, Sam Kaddoura, meanwhile said about the decision:\n\n“The biggest technical roadblock for widespread Bitcoin adoption in the Philippines are the same roadblocks for widespread adoption elsewhere. Our main goal is still to increase awareness and adoption of the technology. By joining SCI, I am confident that we can achieve this.”\n\nThe bolstering of SCI’s product portfolio, which also includes Merchant services provider Bitmarket.ph, fellow exchange Coinage and remittance service Rebit, comes in tandem with Kaddoura’s appointment as the startup’s chief financial officer. Olesen will focus on European relations, while fellow BuyBitcoin.ph co-founder James Florentino will continue to head product operations.\n\n“This acquisition brings us closer to our goal of completing the Bitcoin ecosystem in the Philippines,” SCI CEO John Bailon stated in the press release. “BuyBitcoin.ph is a great first-touch product for consumers, and even more valuable is the addition of great minds in Sam, James, and Lasse.”\n\nOlesen’s Coinify project in Europe meanwhile continues to progress apace. Having secured considerable backing in a much-discussed funding round last year, the merchant service has expanded to include integration with brands such as Shopify and Hungry.dk in its native Denmark.\n\nIn an interview with Danish newspaper Berlingske published Monday, Olesen remained bullish on Bitcoin’s future as the cryptocurrency of choice. “There was suddenly much hype about bitcoin and media coverage, and this affected the price,” he explained. “The fall back is not surprising. You need to bear in mind that bitcoin is young, and that the market is young… It's a bit like newly listed shares versus old, established securities.”\n\nOlesen also hinted at cross-border expansion being central to Coinify’s future, with plans to take on players outside Europe. “Our main competitors are foreign. Our main competitors in the payment Part Two US companies also are looking at Europe. We are the largest European bitcoin payment provider, and we certainly have international ambitions,” he said. “It’s also part of what we raised money for. We're going to cement our position as the strongest bitcoin payment provider in Europe – we’re about to start campaigns in Germany, Holland and England.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

However, it’s nice when the technology behind the world’s first cryptocurrency gets some respect in traditional banking sector.\n\nTop Banking Software Vendor Utilizing Block Chain\n\nToday it was announced that one of the top banking software providers, Infosys, is considering the implementation of the block chain into its core product, Finacle. Finacle is the front-end to bank databases used by employees to manage accounts, open accounts, and so forth.\n\nLast year, the company was rated as having the best online banking suite in terms of customer experience. Presumably, the integration of blockchain technology into the back-end will make the company more efficient, producing faster, more accurate results than traditional database technologies have been able to produce.\n\nThere have widely been murmurings throughout the financial world, now that it appears Bitcoin is here to stay, that the real value of the technology is the block chain. Many Bitcoiners feel sullen about such sentiments, believing them to be counterintuitive, since the reward in bitcoins is what promotes the securing of the block chain by the miners.\n\nAlso read: Swiss Banking Giant to Open Bitcoin Block Chain Lab\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nIt is unclear at present what a private implementation of a block chain would look like, or how it would be secured sans mining. It can be assumed that if the only goal is to keep the ledger as it is meant to be, this can be done without the massive effort that is required to mine bitcoins. Simply having all the computers in the network agree that amounts and totals are correct could be all it would take.\n\nBitcoin is open-source software, so unless Infosys builds their block chain set up from scratch, their implementation will be available to the world after they implement it later this year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency that can be instantly transferred to anyone in the world. It was designed using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money as opposed to relying on a central authority.\n\nSince Bitcoins operate without a central authority, supply is regulated by software as well as agreement by the network, and cannot be manipulated by any government, bank, organization or individual.\n\nThe original software was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym, under the MIT license and is open source. Some advantages of the currency include cheaper costs of sending money overseas, fast transactions (faster than any inter-bank transfer), inability to commit chargeback or credit card fraud (as there is no physical number to steal), no risks associated with inflation and ability to mine your own Bitcoins if you have enough computing power.\n\nBitcoin saw a huge rise in trading volume with a 57 percent increase from $15 billion in 2013 to $23 billion in 2014. The number of active Bitcoin wallets, a place to store BTC, has also more than doubled from 3.19 million in 2013 to 7.95 million in 2014.\n\nThe rise in trading volume can also be attributed to large merchants as well as several small businesses using the currency in 2014.\n\nThere are different types of merchants who accept Bitcoin:\n\nOnline marketplaces such as Amazon, Rakuten’s US site, Fiverr.com, TigerDirect and many vendors on Etsy.\n\nPayment and funding services worldwide including Square, Paypal, Holland’s PSP Mollie and Nigeria’s Simplepay.\n\nSocial services like OKCupid, Reddit and 4Chan. Although these services are free to use, the premium services or paid accounts accept Bitcoin.\n\nMedia sources including TechCrunch, Bloomberg and Chicago Sun Times.\n\nTravel companies – Bitcoin.travel is a site aggregator for Bitcoin accepting travel-related merchants. Another major name that accepts BTC is Expedia, which recently merged with Orbitz.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of merchants, but it shows the currency is widely used and accepted by a diverse variety of retailers in different industries.\n\nIt’s not just users and merchants that have an interest in Bitcoin\n\nWall Street players have started to take note of some of the advantages that this new currency might bring. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers expressed that Bitcoin may bring much needed disruption to the financial world to help benefit buyers and sellers rather than the financiers and middlemen.\n\nThe technology behind Bitcoin could potentially slash costs, cut settlement times and reduce default risks. Unfortunately, there are still hurdles to overcome before the technology can be scaled to a global and mass level of consumption. Security, criminality and price volatility concerns are major issues that must be carefully addressed.\n\nLet’s revisit BTC digital wallets. Simply put, it is a piece of software that can send, receive and store BTC.\n\nHowever, since Bitcoin doesn’t rely on financial institutions, users have complete responsibility including security over their money. Therefore, it is common to have two different wallets. The first one can be called a ‘hot wallet,’ which is connected to the Internet and used primarily for transactions and daily activity.\n\nThe second one can be called a ‘cold wallet,’ which is not connected to the Internet and is consequently less vulnerable to hackers. Many BTC users utilize cold wallets to store savings.\n\nTo fill the wallets, one can go to a Bitcoin exchange to convert money for BTC or vice versa. Most exchanges would require you to connect with a bank account and the process could take a few days.\n\nIt is also worth noting that once a payment is sent, it is irreversible and can only be refunded by the person who received the funds.\n\nBecause of this, hackers may exploit vulnerabilities within wallets and exchanges to steal Bitcoin. A redditor claimed that he lost around $70,000 worth of BTC after it was transferred to another account, which he didn’t authorize.\n\nIn the post, he also laments that he forgot to enable two-factor authentication for the specific wallet which stored the Bitcoins.\n\nSimilarly, customers of another digital wallet called Coinbase experienced Bitcoins being stolen from their accounts. Coinbase has then implemented additional security measures including requiring two-factor authentication when sending money.\n\nSafeguarding your Bitcoin\n\nUnfortunately, once Bitcoin is stolen, it is almost impossible to recover. There is also no central clearing house who can take responsibility and refund or guarantee against fraudulent charges.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin theft is usually performed at the platform level, e.g., exchanges or wallets rather than at an individual account level, leaving the user unable to prevent these attacks. To secure your Bitcoins from theft, enabling two-factor authentication is strongly recommended.\n\nUsing phone number verification is ideal as a form of two-factor authentication. This involves sending a one-time password (OTP) to a user over a separate communication channel (SMS or voice) than the IP channel (Internet) used by the Bitcoin exchange or wallet.\n\nIf payments can only be made after the user has correctly entered the OTP in the Bitcoin exchange or wallet, this will effectively prevent unauthorized transfers unless the fraudster is also in possession of your mobile phone.\n\nAside from sending payments, phone number verification can also be required for registration, login, resetting passwords and authenticating changes made to your Bitcoin exchange or wallet account.\n\nBitcoin theft might be irreversible, but you can prevent it with an extra layer of protection.\n\nRead next: 5 types of social spam (and how to prevent them)\n\nTop image credit: Shutterstock', 'Save the Children is thinking ahead when it comes to the ages of its donors -- that\'s why it decided to go digital.\n\n“We want to remain contemporary and relevant to current and future generations,” Ettore Rossetti, director of social media and digital marketing at the organization, told The Wall Street Journal. “We don’t only want to be your grandmother’s charity, we want to be your grandchild’s charity. One way to do that is to accept Bitcoin.”\n\nThe international aid organization is one of a handful of nonprofits that now accept Bitcoin -- a form of global, decentralized, digital currency that exists online and can be exchanged for U.S. dollars and euros, among other currencies.\n\nAs Rossetti noted and Forbes reported last December, more and more charitable groups are accepting donations in the currency, including the American Red Cross, the Wikimedia Foundation, Greenpeace and United Way Worldwide -- the largest charity in the U.S. in terms of public donations, according to Forbes.\n\nElizabeth Ploshay, an account manager at BitPay -- a company that converts Bitcoin donations to dollars for nonprofits -- told the Wall Street Journal that Bitcoin is gaining interest among ""charities that are older and want to rebrand themselves or tap into a younger pool of donors.""\n\nA survey conducted last year by researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found the average age of a Bitcoin user is 33 years old.\n\nPloshay also noted the digital currency can benefit organizations that accept small donations from individuals, as Bitcoin doesn\'t charge transaction fees.\n\nLast year, donating to nonprofits using Bitcoins became more enticing for donors, too: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled virtual currencies should be treated and taxed as property, which allows donations to be deducted from a donor\'s income tax.\n\nAlthough Bitcoins may be becoming increasingly popular among nonprofits, accepting them won\'t make an enormous difference in their fundraising -- yet -- according to Joe Garecht of The Fundraising Authority.\n\n""Right now, accepting or not accepting Bitcoin donations is not likely to be a make-or-break decision for you,"" he wrote on the website.

04/14/2015,"['Paedophiles are using the digital currency bitcoin to buy child sexual abuse images online, according to the Internet Watch Foundation.\n\nIn its annual report for 2014, the group, which is tasked with attacking the problem of child abuse images online, said a number of the “most prolific commercial” child sexual abuse websites started accepting the currency as a payment for images last year. It discovered 37 websites selling the images for bitcoins between January and April 2014.\n\nThe group said that illegal content was being sold in folders on legitimate websites which had been hacked, and that URLs for the websites were distributed via spam emails.\n\nBitcoin has a number of properties which make it well suited for trading illegal material such as child sex abuse images. The cryptocurrency is completely decentralised, which means that no single authority can prevent trades from being made, or blacklist buyers and sellers.\n\nIt is also largely pseudonymous, and there is nothing inherent to a bitcoin wallet that links it to any real-world individual. When the currency is used with care, it can be nearly impossible to discover the people behind online trades – a fact which was responsible for bitcoin’s first major real-world use, underpinning the online drugs marketplace the Silk Road.\n\nBut while the currency is often described as “anonymous and untraceable”, there are a number of elements to its design which law enforcement authorities have been able to use to track down people attempting to use bitcoin illegally. The decentralised nature of the currency means that every single transaction is made in public, and in order to convert bitcoins into a conventional currency, they must typically be bought and sold through a bitcoin exchange. Those exchanges are often legally required to keep detailed records on customers, in order to comply with money-laundering regulations.\n\nThe IWF said it was working with several of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges to share intelligence and develop strategies for preventing the currency being used by distributors of child sexual abuse images.\n\nEmma Hardy, the IWF’s director of external relations, said: “One area we look at in particular is the commerciality of child sexual abuse images and videos – people who want to buy and sell this type of content online.\n\n“We noticed for the first time ever last year that cryptocurrency or bitcoin was being used.\n\n“We need to ensure we engage with those who run bitcoin services but also other ordinary payment mechanisms, financial providers, to ensure we can help prevent them being abused by criminals.”\n\nThe IWF report also revealed that the number of web pages found with images of child sexual abuse soared by 137% last year.', 'UPDATE (17th April 2015 10:36): Kaspersky Lab has added a further 711 decryption keys to its database.\n\nKaspersky Lab has released a new tool to help free computer files \'held hostage\' by bitcoin ransomware.\n\nCoinVault, which has infected around 700 computers in the Netherlands, is a strain of malware that demands a rising amount of bitcoin to unlock files it has encrypted.\n\nThanks to Kaspersky\'s ransomware decrypter, certain victims can now access their files free of charge.\n\nThe tool was created after Dutch authorities shared a database of CoinVault\'s information (including IVs, keys and bitcoin wallets) with the firm as part of an investigation in the country.\n\nJornt van der Wiel, a security researcher at Kaspersky\'s global research and analysis unit, told CoinDesk that the company hopes to add more decryption keys to its database. He said:\n\n""We have uploaded a huge number of keys onto the site, and together with the National High Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands’ police we are continuously updating the information.""\n\nTo pay or not to pay\n\nThough Kaspersky and the Dutch authorities uncovered a sizeable chunk of data, users whose keys are not on the list or those who have been targeted by a different strain of ransomware remain locked out.\n\nWhen faced with this dilemma, some victims – including police departments – are choosing to pay up and hope for the best.\n\n""As there are few ways to get files back without paying, users often just give in. This is the wrong strategy, but it’s often the easiest for the user,"" Van der Wiel said.\n\nAdditionally, police in the CoinVault investigation argue that payment doesn\'t always mean you\'ll get the files back. Rather, this behaviour perpetuates the problem. A translated statement from the department reads:\n\n""[Paying] motivates the criminals to continue to use this payment method, and furthermore does not always lead to actual release.""\n\nIndeed, a 2014 study from security firm ESNET showed that of the 39,760 people who did pay the ransom of a similar virus, Cryptolocker, only 570 were given access to decryption software after making their payment.\n\nAs files can be retrieved only if tools like Kaspersky\'s are created, the best choice, Van der Wiel says, is protection. Users should keep their anti-malware suite updated and make a habit of backing up their most important files, he added.\n\nAbout CoinVault\n\nCoinVault first came to the attention of Kaspersky Lab last November. The virus, which has targeted more than 20 countries, usually gains access to victims\' machines via phishing emails or links to malicious websites.\n\nUnlike other strains, including Cryptolocker, CoinVault lets victims decrypt one file \'on the house\' – perhaps to alleviate worries that documents will remain locked after a payment has been made.\n\nAfter 24 hours the ransom starts to rise. As the bitcoin address CoinVault provides is ""dynamic"", it is very complex to trace the funds it receives, said Van der Wiel. CoinVault\'s creators are keen to protect their product too, he added:\n\n""In terms of functionality we have seen similar malicious applications in the past, including \'TorrentLocker\' and some PowerShell ransomware. In fact, the amount of effort invested in protecting CoinVault’s code shows that the cybercriminals are leveraging previously developed libraries and functionality in order to avoid reinventing the wheel.""\n\nAuthorities have not made any arrests in connection with CoinVault, but say they still investigating the perpetrator, who is believed to be in the Netherlands.\n\nUsers can find the decryption tool at Kaspersky\'s website, which also features the company\'s decryption app and \'how to\' guides on the subject.\n\nKeyboard image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The full video compilation from our first event, Bitcoin & the Blockchain, is now available.\n\nThe vision for bitcoin and the blockchain is unabashedly optimistic, though already it is being realized. More and more technologists, venture capitalists, financial institutions, and even regulators are seeing its long-term potential to transform industries, from financial services to data management to the Internet of Things. In the medium term, there remain hurdles to overcome before blockchain technology can offer sufficiently compelling solutions for the complex financial and technological world we live in, but there is progress to date — and it’s promising.\n\nBlockchain-based remittance vehicles offered by Coins.ph, BitPagos, and BitPesa, though early stage, aim to take a chunk of the $450 billion remittance industry by offering speedier, more efficient, and cheaper alternatives to traditional solutions. BitPay offers bitcoin/fiat payment processing for merchants as well as bank integration. Increasingly, private investors are diversifying their portfolios by purchasing bitcoin alongside traditional assets. Most recently, Coinbase even received funding from a group of blue-chip investors, including the New York Stock Exchange, and launched its own exchange, signaling both greater acceptance by the financial services industry as well as confidence in its future value. Ripple Labs has taken a very different approach with its protocol, permitting the decentralized transmission of practically any currency type — cryptographic or fiat — like an SMTP for money, and circumventing traditional payment networks. And to this end, it’s already inked agreements with Cross River Bank (New Jersey), CBW Bank (Kansas), and Fidor Bank (Germany), with more on the horizon.\n\nWhat’s more, the U.S. regulatory regime is warming to digital currency. New York’s Department of Financial Services has been engaged and is using its BitLicense to chart a path for regulating — and ensuring public trust in — the industry. The same attitude has been reflected by both FinCEN and the SEC as well. California recently lifted its “bitcoin ban” and has followed New York’s footsteps by proposing its own (albeit problematic) BitLicense. Since last spring, the Federal Election Committee has allowed limited donations in bitcoin to political candidates. And in response, the digital currency industry has been more than cooperative, working hard to protect consumers, abide by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) laws, and iterate quickly following security snafus. We still await good federal legislation to replace the unwieldy state-by-state regulatory pastiche that seems to be forming, but it’s coming — the regulatory picture is becoming clearer. For potential investors, clients, and business partners, the assurance that digital currency companies are legitimate is an important step.\n\nOn the horizon: non-monetary applications of the blockchain\n\nThese developments undoubtedly portend a promising future, though we still have a long way to go. Perhaps surprisingly, the non-monetary applications of bitcoin’s technology might be the most interesting thing about it. The “coin” itself, after all, is merely a cryptographic asset whose content specifications and applications can be retooled for a range of purposes. Companies like Filament and IBM, for example, have begun exploring how the specially designed decentralized ledgers can be used to enable devices to communicate service needs and other information among their owners and vendors for household, commercial, and industrial purposes. Similarly, Factom, Maidsafe, and Storj are solving how the blockchain can be used to cryptographically secure, store, and update data — not only to improve the protection of data from loss or theft, but also to protect owner privacy. The range of use cases and benefits is hard to overstate: connected automobiles or industrial equipment that could report repair needs and schedule maintenance, washing machines that can order more detergent when levels are low, more standardized and secure electronic medical records systems, and more.\n\nMoreover, existing digital currency protocols are evolving to become properly useful to the financial services industry, though there is progress to be made, too. Remittance, payments, and exchange services are important; however, financial instruments such as complex debt instruments that depend upon mortgages and fractional reserve lending are financial services’ lifeblood, yet today are technically impossible. “Blockchain 2.0”-type projects like Ethereum and Ripple’s Codius hold real promise in this regard, but they are still under development. And once these developments can be readily deployed, they should offer a truly unprecedented range of new financial, legal, and commercial possibilities fueled by vast libraries of decentralize apps (“DApps”), including self-executing smart contracts, smart oracles, and more.\n\nIn getting there, the digital currency world and established industries need each other now more than ever. On the one hand, older industries undoubtedly have much to gain by actively participating in the ongoing blockchain development process. IBM, mentioned earlier, has most definitely realized this with the contribution of its ADEPT protocol; MasterCard has kept its options open in this direction, too, with the inclusion of digital currency in its proposed Global Shopping Cart. Banks, telcos, home electronics companies, shipping companies, and auto manufacturers should all follow suit. All have something to gain by not only investing in new blockchain technologies, but helping new companies understand and navigate their landscapes more effectively in order to produce truly transformative products.\n\nIt behooves many in the digital currency community to seek out financial relationships early on to bridge the knowledge gap.\n\nThe blockchain and digital currency worlds, in turn, have much to gain from better understanding the deep needs and inefficiencies of the sectors they’re entering. Finance is one looming example. A common and disconcerting refrain among the financial services professionals I interact with is that, although there are certainly exceptions, many developers don’t sufficiently understand a number of the financial processes they intend to disrupt — e.g., how credit cards work, how and why the Federal Reserve moves interest rates, how derivatives work, how equities trades are cleared, why fractional reserve banking is essential, etc. That’s hardly surprising given finance’s complexity, but it ultimately means that some innovations either aren’t as useful as some hope or they create more problems than they solve. For that reason, it behooves many in the digital currency community to seek out financial relationships early on to bridge the knowledge gap and invent even more disruptive products and processes. Mutatis mutandis, the same could be said for any other industry.\n\nAll told, these first chapters of bitcoin and the blockchain are riveting, but there are more to write. The story invites all to contribute — not just coders and investors, but engineers, bankers, and especially innovators. And the more that contribute, the better and faster that story will be written. So let’s keep writing it.\n\nCropped image on article and category pages by Hiroyuki Takeda on Flickr, used under a Creative Commons license.', 'If you use uTorrent for your torrenting needs, there’s a good chance your client is also mining Bitcoin without you even realizing it, and gobbling up your computer’s processing power.\n\nThe good news is, roughly a month after quietly rolling out the feature, uTorrent has finally stopped bundling bitcoin-mining software into its torrenting client. But there’s a catch.\n\nRegardless of where you originally downloaded the software, you should probably go straight to uTorrent’s website and download the latest version. This is the version that does not have the Epic Scale bitcoin-mining software. However, if you download or update the software from a third party client, it’s highly possible that you’ll get a version that will still mine Bitcoin. So start fresh.

These units will be delivered in batches of five and placed in several major cities including Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.\n\nIn 2014, CAVIRTEX attempted a similar rollout of BitAccess bitcoin ATMs, installing them in Gateway Newstands across Canada. The experiment was far from successful, and the company shut down the endeavor a few months later. They ended up selling off their machines at a substantial loss.\n\nWhile the locations gave the CAVIRTEX bitcoin ATMs high visibility, their failure has been attributed to the fact that they were inadequately staffed and prone to malfunction, with little to no troubleshooting support.\n\nQuadriga said this new rollout will be different.\n\n“We are excited to finally be bringing some functional and beautiful two-way bitcoin ATM machines to Canada,” said Cotten.\n\nHe explained that the new BitXATM devices are among the most reliable, intuitive and user-friendly bitcoin ATMs on the market. It features an industry-leading 17-inch touch screen that promises to promote ease-of-use. Furthermore, the rollout will happen in small batches, allowing for time to ensure that each new machine is supported and operating properly from the outset.\n\n“We’ve done our research,” says Cotten. “We know the owners of every major bitcoin ATM company. We have used many of them and spoken to previous owners. We have conducted extensive due diligence and feel as though our track record with regard to bitcoin ATM distribution across Canada will allow us to continue to provide a superior service.”\n\nQuadrigaCX has beenresponsible for installing the first Lamassu and Skyhook units in Canada. Since then, they have placed more than 40 machines across the country.\n\nThe world’s first bitcoin ATM, the Robocoin at Waves, was launchedby Bitcoiniacs in Vancouver at the end of 2013. Quadriga installed the second bitcoin machine, Canada’s first Lamassu, three months later. The company went on to purchase and install more than a dozen additional Lamassu machines across Canada last year, as well as Canada’s first Skyhook.\n\nLike most other independently owned bitcoin ATMs across Canada, these machines will trade on the Quadriga CX platform. These new BitXATM machines also will be modified to allow for direct cash deposits and withdrawals from customers’ Quadriga CX balances.\n\nCotten expects to launch the first of the new machines in the heart of downtown Vancouver in early June.

04/15/2015,"['0\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañolLately, financial analysts have taken to repeating the same phrase when it comes to bitcoin: “The technology is interesting, but not so much the currency or its utility as a store of value.”\n\nTo understand what they mean, let’s break bitcoin up into two parts:\n\nFirst, bitcoin as currency is the digital unit that users transfer to each other. It can be used for payments or savings, and the price is determined by supply and demand. These days, one bitcoin trades for around US$235. The digital currency is characterized by its decentralized nature, independent of government and corporations, but also highly volatile compared to traditional currency.\n\nBitcoin as technology is the blockchain. It is a transparent distributed database, or ledger, initially designed to keep track of bitcoins moving across accounts. However, it has a great potential for other purposes, such as a registrar for tangible goods (e.g. real estate, cars), multi-party contracts, patents, timestamps, and proof of content. Thanks to its decentralized nature, no trust is required from those who update and maintain the blockchain; it’s easy to verify, and difficult to falsify.\n\nThis dichotomy may appear valid and reasonable at first glance, but there’s a problem with viewing bitcoin this way. As it turns out, maintaining the database comes at a cost, not only to keep it online and accessible but to audit and prevent falsification. And that requires considerable computing power.\n\nIn order for the blockchain to function and process changes, there’s an incentive scheme in place whereby people who contribute processing power — the “miners” — receive bitcoins. Therefore, both sides, money and technology, are intimately connected and rely on each other.\n\nIf the miners were incentivized or paid with something other than bitcoin, the system would cease to be truly decentralized. Bitcoin would no longer be self-sustainable, and its operation would hinge on external factors, such as national jurisdictions, special permits, traditional currencies, government regulation, etc. Privacy and easy entry into the market would be jeopardized, and censorship would become a very real possibility.\n\nAlternative Ledgers Can Work\n\nWhile the bitcoin as a currency cannot be separated from its blockchain without losing its unique features, that does not mean more limited, less decentralized alternative ledgers cannot exist.\n\nBanks, for example, could create a simpler version of the blockchain, without a currency to replace their clearing system or the Swift network. In fact, existing solutions like Ripple and Stellar are headed in that direction.\n\nIn the future, we may end up with an array of alternatives, with varying functions and limitations. On the other hand, perhaps we’ll find it is enough to have a single decentralized solution like bitcoin, which anyone can access, be they Pakistani farmers or multinational banks.\n\nWe can’t know for sure, but it’s very likely that the technology bitcoin inaugurated is here to stay.\n\nTranslated by Daniel Duarte. Edited by Guillermo Jimenez.', 'Technology that makes it easier and cheaper for money to move around the world could have many implications.\n\nThe total value of the digital currency Bitcoin is now approximately $3.4 billion, and many companies and investors are working to prove that the technology can make financial services cheaper and more useful.\n\nBut Stanford professor David Mazières thinks he has a faster, more flexible, and more secure alternative. If Mazières is correct, his technology could make digital payments and other transactions cheaper, safer, and easier—particularly across borders. He released the design for his system in a white paper last Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin transactions rely on software run on thousands of computers linked up over the Internet. That distributed network uses a set of rules and cryptographic principles to reliably verify transactions even though no one person or organization is in control.\n\nThe system was introduced to the world in 2008 in a technical paper released under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Its design was significant for showing a way for a pool of contributors that don’t necessarily trust each other to collectively create a system to verify transactions. But the way Bitcoin achieves this makes it slower and less secure than is ideal for a system meant to become part of the world’s financial infrastructure, Mazières says.\n\nMazières’s new cryptocurrency protocol, called SCP, is being adopted by a nonprofit called Stellar to replace a Bitcoin-inspired system meant to make financial services cheaper and more widely accessible in the developing world (see “Bitcoin-Inspired Digital Currency to Power Mobile Savings App”). Stellar’s original system was modeled on one developed at the startup Ripple Labs, which is using it to help banks and other financial organizations move money faster (see “50 Smartest Companies 2014: Ripple Labs”).\n\nLast year Stellar’s system unexpectedly “forked” into two networks that disagreed on which transactions were valid, and several hours’ worth of transactions got rolled back. Mazières says his new system avoids the part of the design that caused that problem. (Ripple maintains that its design is safe if used correctly.)\n\nMazières is taking leave from Stanford to work four days a week on the project as Stellar’s chief scientist. Stellar’s backers include the payments company Stripe (see “Increasing the GDP of the Internet”).\n\nBitcoin’s design rests on a process called “mining,” in which people run software that races to solve mathematical puzzles. Solving a puzzle verifies recent transactions made in Bitcoin and earns the solver some newly created bitcoins or some transaction fees (see “What Bitcoin Is and Why It Matters”). The distributed calculations also protect against fraud: you would need to gain control of more than half the total computing power working on mining to be able to, say, spend one bitcoin twice.\n\nHowever, it currently takes around 10 minutes for a new transaction to be confirmed by the miners, and mining is very energy intensive (Bitcoin miners together consume as much electricity as Ireland, researchers estimated in 2014). Mazières says that using mining to enforce trust and security also has limitations. “Bitcoin is good, but we wanted to start from scratch and address some of these additional properties,” he says.\n\nThe new SCP system also relies on people running software that communicates over the Internet, but trust is not enforced through mining. Instead, each person running the software must identify a few other trusted participants to correctly apply the cryptographic rules used to validate transactions. Each instance of the software will recognize transactions only once a certain majority fraction of its trusted partners have also signed off. And the trust relationships are all public.\n\nMazières says the math shows that those rules will allow his system to reliably verify transactions much more quickly and with less energy.\n\nDan Boneh, a Stanford professor who did not work on Mazières’s system but has reviewed it, says that SCP avoids some security limitations of Bitcoin. “The security proposition of Bitcoin is that the people who invested in mining infrastructure can be trusted, but that may not be true,” he says. “Here I can choose for myself who to trust.”\n\nSCP also allows use of stronger cryptography, says Boneh. Bitcoin’s cryptography can only be so strong, because it needs to remain possible for miners to solve the puzzles. “By design, you can’t crank up the hardness of Bitcoin to the point it’s infeasible for a well-resourced attacker,” says Boneh. “With this you can.”\n\nEmin Gün Sirer, an associate professor at Cornell University, agrees that SCP seems to have advantages over Bitcoin. He says it also seems to resolve what he considers a gap in the Ripple protocol that led to Stellar’s “forking” problem last year. “The protocol looks sound,” says Sirer.\n\nIt is, however, theoretically possible for SCP to break down if participants choose trusted partners in such a way that there aren’t enough overlaps to tie the network into one whole—or if an attacker orchestrates that situation, says Sirer. Just how unlikely that is will depend on the actions of the people who adopt SCP. “This is a social thing, not a technical thing,” says Sirer.\n\nMazières acknowledges that possibility but says it’s unlikely. He imagines that certain large organizations, perhaps banks, will emerge to anchor the SCP network. Still, he acknowledges, “people are always a weak point.”', 'It’s going to unshackle us from the oppressive dungeon of fiat currency! But also criminals and rogue cops use it to do nefarious drug stuff! Digital currency is often defined by its volatile hype cycle. And yet its most promising feature is incredibly mundane-sounding: a bookkeeping system called “the blockchain.”\n\nSo what the heck is it?\n\nThe blockchain basics\n\nThe blockchain is a simple digital platform for recording and verifying transactions so that other people can’t erase them later — and anyone can see them. “You can think of the blockchain of an ‘append-only’ ledger. You can only write to it, you can’t delete it,” Peter van Valkenburg, the director of research at Coin Center, told Gizmodo.\n\nBut it’s what the blockchain doesn’t have that makes it controversial, and prone to giving venture capitalists greedboners. Bookkeeping tools generally require a bookkeeper, but with the blockchain, there is no head honcho bookie. It’s a decentralized, crowd-powered spreadsheet, relying on cryptography instead of a central authority.\n\nFervent crypto-enthusiasts, never ones for ambivalence, say the blockchain technology Satoshi Nakamoto created to fuel Bitcoin has genuine potential to tip power dynamics in banking, politics, the internet, and everywhere authorities, well, authorize things. Critics see it as either hopelessly impractical or a fast-track to a merciless, anarchic hellscape.\n\nBut how does it work exactly?\n\nThe blockchain is designed to make transactions safe and reliable even if the people doing them don’t trust each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNakamoto’s blockchain math is a solution to a famous game theory puzzle called the Byzantine General’s Problem, in which old-timey army officers are planning an attack, but they’re worried about traitors lurking in their midst. Trust no one! But, of course, an army needs to communicate to launch an attack. So the General needs to find a way to pass a message along that cannot be sabotaged.\n\nThis is where the blockchain comes in. Every single time you make a transaction on the blockchain, that transaction is sent out to many nodes in the Bitcoin network. Basically, everybody participating in the Bitcoin process also has copy of that ledger and can check it for inconsistencies. It’s a distributed ledger. The order of transactions is also verified by a cryptographic process that relies on the combined computational power of the crowd. So if you try to pass off a fake exchange, you’ll get caught — because your fellow Bitcoin users can trace every alteration and exchange that goes down.\n\nBitcoin.org sums this up nicely in their introduction to Bitcoin:\n\nThe blockchain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography.\n\nThere are different kinds of blockchains, with varying degrees of complexity, so the math underlying the crypto is always different. But the general principle—a decentralized group of machines capable of verifying transactions—is the same.\n\nThe greed of crowds\n\nThe idea of a distributed ledger is not new, but Satoshi put a spin on it — community members are incentivized to verify transactions because they earn Bitcoins for their efforts. People who are already “mining” Bitcoin are selected to have their machines join the blockchain and verify that nothing fishy is going down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin “miners” use computer power to solve puzzles; if they correctly solve a puzzle, they get Bitcoin as a prize. To make blockchain technology work, the Bitcoin community needs Nakamoto’s clever incentive program. If you want to mine Bitcoin, you have to use a sliver of computational power to verify the blockchain when your turn comes up. The rules of the blockchain are baked into the mining software to make sure miners will check the ledger when it’s their turn.\n\nIt’s the perfect kind of crowdsourcing for libertarian fans of crypto-currency, because it’s entirely based on self-interest.\n\nTransactions get verified frequently, and once they’ve been verified they’re set in a sort of digital stone. People have found all sorts of different ways to use Bitcoin for devious schemes, or hack cryptocurrency platforms. But none of them have involved destroying its foundation, the blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s foolproof. Interpol and Kaspersky Labs recently presented research about how people could theoretically insert malware into blockchain transactions. That’s brutal news for blockchain supporters, since the whole point is that the cryptography is solid enough that you don’t need to trust anyone.\n\nFrom Satoshi to Samsung\n\nWith Bitcoin, blockchain technology is used to transfer money. But it has the potential to do a lot more: it will work for any process of verification, really, and can even be used as a communication tool. This is why companies, investors, and crypto diehards are starting to see potential uses for blockchains all over the place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue believers say blockchain technology could revolutionize voting systems and make notaries and banks redundant, although they’re still in the theoretical stages of spinning their ideas into reality. The tech is nowhere near ready for such widespread and intense application. But companies are working to steering this technology away from the crypto fringe.\n\nIBM and Samsung are already developing a blockchain-powered backbone for Internet of Things products called ADEPT. These companies are taking the core ledger concept and spinning it out into a way to help devices communicate cheaply. Other projects, like Ethereum and Ripple, take the idea of the blockchain and also spin out the concept for a wider array of applications.\n\nEnthusiasts rattle off a vertiginous list of spin-off uses: microfinance, vehicle registration, gun permits, wills, genome data, report cards, DRM—all bandied about as stuff that’d be more secure if blockchains were used to verify them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nADEPT is still in very early stages, and it uses a more complicated cryptography than the OG blockchain, but it’s an example of how established corporations are attempting to capitalize on the concept.\n\nAnd, as with all new technologies with grand intentions, there are plenty of startups hovering. Namecoin is basically a blockchain-powered alternative to ICANN’s (crappy) domain registry system, and it plans to provide notary services in the future. Van Valkenberg especially likes BitMesh, a blockchain startup that wants to help people sell their extra bandwidth by establishing mesh networks that’d serve as local marketplaces and alternatives to only using big ISPs, and it’s easy to see why: If BitMesh can make its concept a reality, it’d give people a better, cheaper way to share internet costs.\n\nChain of fools or chain of gold?\n\nThere is a reason why people use banks, hire lawyers, and get notaries to make sure their documents are legit. Society is organized around the idea that there are authorities that can be trusted. And yeah, people are fallible and companies regularly have huge security breaches using current models. But evacuating authority from central figures and relying totally on a mathematic solution developed by a pseudonym who is more a symbol than a person is also rather terrifying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat isn’t to say that the projects blockchain supporters are working on can’t succeed, or shouldn’t succeed. They are looking for better ways to make things known to be true; in the idyllic blockchain-managed world, we would inhabit a world where fraud was impossible. But it’s just important to note how much faith that world places in machines over humanity.\n\nArt by Tara Jacoby', 'As Bitcoin edges ever closer to mainstream consumers, its interface is changing to provide maximum convenience to those who transact. Like the evolution of Internet payments 15 years ago, the Bitcoin ecosystem is quickly shifting towards ease of access and effortless use when it comes to attracting prospective users.\n\nThe changes are happening apace. Already gone are the days of multi-step, unintuitive exchanges and unreliable processes. Now, Bitcoin businesses who deal in customer funds are obliged to have in place a raft of security and compliance measures in order to appeal to the mass market. They must also be as simple as possible to use and crucially offer all the flexibility of use that makes Bitcoin appear as ‘useful’ a transaction medium as cash or a credit card.\n\nBitcoin Universal Services\n\nEnter Bitcoin universal services (BUS), those businesses providing not just an exchange or not just a wallet, but merchant payment processing services and even add-ons such as debit cards linked to their own infrastructure.\n\nWhile still less common than the vast number of operations offering such services separately, BUSs are unique in offering a one-stop shop for users and merchants and in so doing have a vital role to play in ‘closing’ the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nPerhaps the best-known operator in the BUS field is Coinbase. With a global presence and reliable tools backed by a conspicuous amount of investment from its big-name supporters, its ability to provide a consumer exchange, wallet and merchant acceptance solution is continuing to prove immensely popular.\n\n“Our goal is to become the world’s largest exchange,” CEO Brian Armstrong said upon the release of Coinbase’s exchange facility, the first fully-licensed operation in the US.\n\nThe advantages of having an integrated multi-tool solution are of course clear. The user has a wallet and exchange in one place, with the specialized processes ensuring funds are handled securely despite the high profile of the host. Both user and business also benefit from the security of having the same operator deal in all stages of the B2C transaction process.\n\nThere is, however, a drawback. With much power comes much responsibility, and it is the way in which Coinbase, as a form of ‘test case’ for the major go-to service in Bitcoin, has handled issues of customer data and centralization which has become the subject of mounting criticism.\n\nThe company’s regulatory stance has also caused friction with the cryptocurrency community. Cases such as the recent altering of its terms and conditions to allow retention of user credit histories led commentators to treat Coinbase with suspicion rather than encouragement. Fears of a ‘too-big-to-fail’ company, in the wake of Mt. Gox and the threat of 51% mining attacks, are still present in the Bitcoin community.\n\nSmaller scale for the greater good\n\nWhile the dust continues to settle, other providers are stepping up to provide the same and even more comprehensive user and merchant packages on a smaller scale. Hong Kong-based ANX has been offering an exchange, wallet and associated debit card for the past year.\n\nIn Europe, UK-based startup SpectroCoin has been offering the same features since 2013, recently with the interesting addition of non-bitcoin spending; users can pay in bitcoin using funds from their wallet stored in fiat currency (euros).\n\nThe move is designed to address volatility issues, which can cause unexpected results during PoS transactions.\n\n“If Euro wallet is chosen, an exact amount of bitcoins required completing the transaction is exchanged and the transaction is sent to Bitcoin network,” a press release from SpectroCoin released this week explains about the new payment format.\n\nCEO Vytautas Karalevicius believes that in future, there should be around twenty BUS operators around the globe, each with a 5% share of the market. A setup such as this would maintain the health of the ecosystem, instead of having a single dominant player like Coinbase creating more centralized conditions, much like PayPal in fiat payments. SpectroCoin, which has sustained its own growth without VC funding, is hoping to strike this balance.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to Karalevicius for his take on the developing BUS model, its advantages and challenges facing key industry players in the current environment.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Bitcoin universal services are less numerous than those offering just one or two products such as wallets or exchanges. What do you think the benefits for consumers and businesses are of using an overarching company rather than several different ones?\n\nVytautas Karalevicius: Firstly, the answer is based on a misconception of bitcoin being a free method of payment. Yes, it is cheap and quick, and it is absolutely dominant to other payment methods if we compare by speed/price ratio, however the more blockchain transactions are involved (from exchange to wallet, from wallet to merchant), the more expensive use of bitcoin becomes. Therefore, using the universal service provides a number of transactions are done off the chain, so clients can achieve cost savings.\n\nAlso overarching companies like SpectroCoin can offer better rates as they have both buy and sell sides inside the house, while solely merchant service providers are dependent on third parties to exchange bitcoins to fiat on behalf of their clients, which adds additional costs.\n\nCT: Coinbase is a good example of such an operation, but they have faced criticism about data handling and centralization. What do you think about that? Can you have a company control many facets of the transaction process without users giving too much trust away?\n\nVK: The answer cannot be universal, as it extremely depends on the domicile of the service provider, for sure a company in US will have stricter data handling requirements than practically any company registered outside USA. For sure, Bitcoin companies as any financial company should secure the privacy of their clients as a ""bank secret."" However, using universal service providers is not a take it or leave it option. Clients can only use one or couple of services service provider is offering and diversify his trust among several different service providers.\n\nRegarding centralization, the beauty of Bitcoin is its decentralization and it has to be decentralized at every level of its ecosystem: mining, exchange, wallets and etc. If there would be only one dominant mining pool, bitcoin would not be decentralized anymore, also if there would be only one dominant exchange such as Coinbase, it will become more like PayPal with having a lot of off chain transactions and become a closed payment system. Eventually that kind of exchange would be too big to fail, that\'s why there has to be several small-medium size bitcoin service providers globally, so even if one or two of them fails, Bitcoin as a concept would not be affected.\n\n“[P]eople should use other email service providers not only Gmail in the same way people should use different Bitcoin service providers.”\n\nOn the other hand I see Bitcoin as a protocol, like an email and the service SpectroCoin provides are Bitcoin web client with additional features such as exchange it is very similar to a thing Gmail does for e-mail. So as for email to stay decentralized people should use other email service providers not only Gmail in the same way people should use different Bitcoin service providers.\n\nCT: Can you tell us more about the future plans for SpectroCoin as a universal provider?\n\nVK: Our key future plans are introducing additional currencies both fiat and digital, so we could follow our idea of allowing our clients to split three fundamental properties of money apart (to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, Euros as method of account and some other asset class as a store of value).\n\nWe are also aiming to become first European BUS with debit cards issued for clients. Currently our project, Spectrocard, is in a beta stage without bitcoin offered as a deposit option as we are testing our debit card system with more typical users at the moment. We are working for additional cash deposit options in the near future.\n\nElsewhere, we are expanding our merchant network both by ourselves and through partners, so soon there will be a wide network of locations accepting bitcoin in our region. Also, we have introduced vouchers, which can be used for non-digital off chain transactions among people.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

This includes major firms and organisations like Microsoft, Dell, Wikipedia, Twitch, Greenpeace, Expedia and PayPal.\n\nOf these 100,000 companies and organisations, 53% accepted bitcoin using BitPay\'s payments platform, totalling more than $150m (£102m) worth of bitcoin in 2014.\n\nThe latest data from BitPay, which was gathered from some of the largest worldwide bitcoin merchants, also revealed that North America remains the largest bitcoin market, accounting for 57% of global volume.\n\nOnly 3% of worldwide transaction volume takes place in South America and Africa, however, the top emerging country in 2014 was Brazil, with 406% merchant signup growth from the previous year.\n\nThe Latin American and African markets are expected to be key growth areas for bitcoin in the future due to a large migrant population and the relatively large proportion of people without access to traditional financial services.\n\n""We see bitcoin being used in emerging markets as a supplement to the current banking and monetary systems,"" Vonk said. ""Bitcoin breaks down the barriers to financial tools that many people in emerging countries are facing.""\n\nResearch highlights have been compiled in an infographic:', 'Since early in 2013, Darkcoin has been a permanent fixture in the daily digital currency news. From Darkcoin’s initial meteoric rise, quickly reaching a USD value of $15, to the level of security and innovation it provides for privacy seekers, to the failures and triumphs of the “Masternode Network”, Darkoin has been almost as interesting and intriguing as Bitcoin itself. And 2015 is shaping up to be a year of rebirth for Darkcoin, which is now Dash. We discuss the state of Dash, and the digital currency industry, with core developer Evan Duffield here on CCN.\n\nInterview with core developer Evan Duffield\n\nYou recently made some sweeping brand changes, going from Darkcoin to Dash. Can you tell us about your strategy behind that? Is Dashcoin the correct term, or just Dash?\n\nThe goal of this project has always been to try and create a technology as similar to digital cash as possible. We decided to change the name to Dash because we believe it better represents our new vision, to create a medium of exchange that is both private and instant for the masses. Dashcoin is a separate project though; we’d prefer to be known simply as Dash.\n\nFor readers who might be somewhat new to digital currency, what separates Dash from Bitcoin, if you can briefly go over two or three key differences.\n\nDash is built on the same technology that made Bitcoin successful. In addition, it employs a secondary network known as the Masternode Network. Master Nodes are a new concept in digital currency, where users are incentivized to run full nodes and provide extra services to the network such as Darksend and InstantX. Put simply, they allow us to add features to Dash that are impossible in Bitcoin.\n\nOver the last year, there has been quite a serious issue with exchange risk in the digital currency industry. Either exchanges are getting hacked and losing currency or closing altogether with user’s funds inside. What would you do to stop this scourge from turning people off to digital currency, considering the potential investment unsafe? What do you suggest for the digital currency industry as a whole when it comes to managing exchange risk? Insurance? Oversight? Regulation?\n\nIt’s a shame that many new users get burned this way, but I don’t believe that regulation or insurance is the answer. There’re a few different routes to fixing this issue; first we have plans to add 2-factor authentication to the reference client. With this implemented, even exchanges could use the 2-factor authentication on their cold/hot wallets, limiting their exposure to theft.\n\nHaving heard you speak on Bitcoin before, you seem very sure you have a better currency than Bitcoin itself and seem dedicated to competing more directly with Bitcoin. Is that your goal? To knock Bitcoin off of the mountain top, per se?\n\nEventually, I believe Dash will position itself as a direct competitor to Bitcoin. In the meantime, Bitcoin enjoys a monopoly more or less on the space, which is unhealthy. For example, if the only crypto-currency in use is Bitcoin and it has an issue, the entire crypto-economy would be affected, burning the vast majority of it’s users. However, if there are 5 or 10 crypto-currencies in common use, it will reduce the systemic risk on the sector as a whole and make it safer for everyone.\n\nWhat metrics do you use to judge the success of your work? What do you monitor daily or weekly to monitor your progress in the market? Is US Dollar value important to you and your currency?\n\nI try to avoid looking at the price too often, I think it’s mostly noise unless you’re looking at longer term charts that look very healthy. The statistics that I find the most informative are website traffic statistics, including which countries are interested in Dash (China and Russia are the biggest sources currently). Also the amount of core team members that are active on a day-to-day basis.\n\nWhat is one feature that Dash maintains that would surprise people? Some trick that Dash can do that even seasoned digital investors may not know about?\n\nThere’s a really interesting way to pay people using the Masternode system and donation feature. Say you want to settle a 20DASH debt, youcan configure your node, which receives payments periodically for the services it does for the network, to tell the network to pay that personinstead of yourself. The money is effectively being created by the blockchain and sent directly to them, instead of you.\n\nAny new features you’re looking to add in 2015 that you can reveal to our audience. What can we look forward to in the short-term from Dash?\n\nCan we do another article about this? I have something, it’s giant and could be a standalone article if you’re interested. It could solve the lack offunds for development in a completely decentralized way, while involving the main stakeholders in the decisions.\n\nTeaser received. Any advice for new digital currency investors, besides investing in Dash? What do you tell people about getting into digital currency when you first meet someone new to the concept? What do you tell your friends and family when they ask about getting started?\n\nCrypto-currency is still new and dangerous. It is still “The Wild West” right now, and you’ve got to be very careful about who you trust. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. And do lots of research. Also, don’t store coins in exchanges.\n\nEvander Smart: That’s what Andreas told me last week. Do not use exchanges as wallets. Do your trade and remove your funds expeditiously. Hopefully, people are heeding the advice of industry experts.\n\nFinal question: Five years from now, where will Dash be in 2020?\n\nBy 2020, we should have a completely working Masternode system and 100% decentralization. Also mobile wallets for sending and receiving money instantly, in a secure way, without having to wait for block chain confirmation. With all of this technology implemented, the goal is to get many small businesses to take Dash directly through mobile devices. This allows customers to buy something in person and walk out 10 seconds later after InstantX confirms the transaction is valid and locks it.\n\n\n\nOne thing he said really resonated with me is that Bitcoin does need some competition within the marketplace. Monopolies are always bad for the consumer, and Dash has many innovations that can only make digital currency better going forward. Bitcoin can improve, and that’s what competition does. It makes you step up your game and improve. If all of digital currency’s eggs are in Bitcoin’s basket, that is not a great long-term strategy.\n\nWe at CCN cannot give investment advice, so do your own due diligence, but I haven’t seen a better altcoin on the market than Dash. If you want increased privacy and innovative technology that really provides value in an altcoin, Dash is where I’d start looking. I believe Litecoin‘s days as the silver to Bitcoin’s Gold are numbered. From what I’ve seen, Dash is just a better currency. And isn’t that what we really wanted all along?\n\nTo me, it is simply the best altcoin on the market. In a world where privacy and freedom are becoming four-letter words, this is the right currency at the right time. I believe there will come a day when everybody needs a little Dash.\n\nImages provided by Dash and Medium.com\n\nWhat is your favorite altcoin on the market today?

Thank goodness Bitcoin exists.”\n\nIt is its criticism of Bitcoin, in addition to issues of user anonymity, which has seen Ripple raise suspicion from commentators in recent months. At a California Assembly Banking & Finance Committee hearing on Bitcoin in March, CEO Chris Larson and Chief Compliance Officer Karen Gifford even suggested that Ripple’s ability to track user accounts made it an improvement on Bitcoin.\n\n“We actually don't think the world needs a new currency; there’s plenty of currencies,” Larson stated regarding bitcoin, “We think the big problem is moving those currencies around efficiently.”\n\nGifford subsequently added that “One of the differences between the Ripple technology and… the Bitcoin technology in terms of transparency just happens to be that the way the Ripple technology tracks information is by account,” going on to explain tools developed by Ripple to track specific transactions more easily.\n\nThe issue of anonymity as cryptocurrency payments become more mainstream is one which has become an inevitable obstacle for major industry players, regardless of currency. Coinbase, which was also present at the California hearing, in January caused a furor when its terms of use were altered to include the ability to examine user credit rating histories.\n\n“We’ve… been at the forefront of regulation when it comes to Bitcoin,” co-founder Fred Ehrsam told the California hearing, adding that in terms of regulation already extant in the US for the issue of money laundering, there is “already a great set of federal guidelines… ultimately, I think it’s best if that’s left at the federal level.”\n\nMeanwhile, a conspicuous statistic highlighted by one Reddit respondent demonstrates that around 20% of Ripple’s trade volume is with bitcoin, indicating that the current consumer trend is to deal in both assets.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

That means the company will receive euros in their bank account and will not directly own any bitcoin.\n\nUphof told CoinTelegraph that the company’s decision to accept bitcoin for premium payment was informed by messages they were receiving from members of the local bitcoin community.\n\nPart of a Global Group\n\nUphof:\n\n“I met and talked to some members of the local bitcoin community and they said there were willing to take insurance for their smartphones, tablets and other devices if we included bitcoin as one of our payment methods”\n\nWhile CoverYou is a brand covering only two countries in Europe, it belongs to an international insurance group called the QSX Insurance Group that operates worldwide.\n\nWhether this will be taken up by more insurers in Europe and the rest of the world is something time will tell.

04/16/2015,"['Editor’s note: David Berger is the CEO of the Digital Currency Council (DCC), an association of professionals in the digital currency economy.\n\nOn October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed “a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.” Yet, it can be fairly argued that trust, or a lack thereof, has been at the heart of the troubles in the bitcoin ecosystem since that day. While the technology has been and continues to be robust, the failure of a few individuals to meet their fiduciary or legal obligations has maligned bitcoin’s image and damaged its relationships with consumers.\n\nIt’s unfortunate but true that while entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have been focused on the technology, the media and therefore the public has been focused on the bad actors building criminal or negligent enterprises on top of that same technology. We’ve all see the headlines:\n\n“The Inside Story of Mt. Gox, Bitcoin’s $460 million disaster” (Wired, March 3, 2014); “Texas Man Charged with Running Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme” (Wall Street Journal, November 6, 2014); “Ross Ulbricht Convicted of Running Silk Road as Dread Pirate Roberts” (Bloomberg, February 4, 2015); “2 Former Federal Agents Charged with Stealing Bitcoin during Silk Road Probe” (CNN.com, March 30, 2015); “Board Member Olivier Janssens Leaking Damning Facts about Bitcoin Foundation” (CoinTelegraph, April 5, 2015).\n\nHeadlines with words like “disaster,” “ponzi,” “pirate,” “stealing” and “damning” don’t particularly make bitcoin something you want to introduce to your mother.\n\nTempering risk and establishing trust\n\nWhile bitcoin the technology turns the risks associated with transactions on their head, bitcoin the community and economy is inextricably tied to the integrity of the individuals within it.\n\nAs organizations grow, professionals from across disciplines support different aspects of their mission. The bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, and the businesses and regulators within it, are experiencing this today. On every metric, the ecosystem has grown exponentially, yet with that growth comes the increased likelihood that bad or incompetent actors (not bad technology) will lurk in its midst.\n\nWhile there is risk in every part of the wider economy, to temper that risk and to restore trust in bitcoin, the community ought to consider and adopt:\n\na broad set of professional competencies, supported by tools to facilitate their achievement, which reflects capability and qualification for professional participation;\n\na minimum, yet clear, barrier to entry that does not restrict opportunity but does signify a commitment commensurate with the responsibility one has to the ecosystem;\n\na designation indicative of achievement in the core competencies that enables valuable professional differentiation; and\n\nA set of common standards or best practices for conducting business, including a code of ethics.\n\nTrust and the international remittance use case\n\nInternational remittances are thought by many to be among the first commercially viable applications for bitcoin. Large fees charged by the incumbents in the industry allow for new firms, leveraging the bitcoin Blockchain, to severely undercut the pricing structures to which customers had become acclimated.\n\nBut fees are not the only criteria a consumer considers when sending an international remittance. Trust is perhaps the more central consideration. This should not be a surprise to any student of money transmission, as trust and honor have been at the center of Hawala – an informal money transfer system that has been popular in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia – since the Middle Ages. While Hawala’s network of brokers must trust in the system – a trust that has been built over generations – the transmission won’t commence unless the sender of the funds has trust in the original broker with whom he interfaces at the start of the transmission.\n\nData shows a lack of trust in bitcoin for remittances\n\nIt is this original interaction between consumer and professional – before the bitcoin network has even been engaged – where bitcoin’s challenges lie. According to a recent study, bitcoin is trusted for international remittances by a very small percentage of American consumers (perhaps due to the media reports noted above) when compared to incumbent service providers.\n\nNotably, those seeking to build businesses transmitting money across the globe on the bitcoin network have an ample market of prospective customers who don’t trust any of the traditional options – a proverbial green field.\n\nI’d posit, similar to bitcoin, consumers don’t understand the technology underlying these other means of international money transmission.\n\nPutting the postal service aside, international money transmission from the U.S. to recipients abroad has utilized two primary technologies over the past 40 years – wire transfers and Automated Clearing House (ACH) transactions (which to be clear are received outside the U.S. by ACH equivalents). Both technologies are offered by Western Union, founded in 1851, and MoneyGram, founded in 1940 – the dominant players in this lucrative yet highly regulated and mostly staid industry.\n\nThese firms, along with a handful of others, skimmed (or perhaps a better word is shoveled) $16 billion dollars off fees as high as 29 percent, predominantly in developing economies, while facilitating the transfer of approximately $438 billion in 2014, according to the World Bank.\n\nA wire, typically processed by clearing solutions like SWIFT, the Federal Reserve Wire Network, or the Clearing House Interbank Payments System, is a real-time method of transferring funds and supporting account information between financial institutions. Wires are typically high fee yet near immediate (as long as the institutions on each end of the transaction are open for business).\n\nAn ACH, commonly used for payroll and other domestic purposes, is based on an over 40-year-old standard overseen by the Electronic Payments Association and is typically less costly to the consumer than a wire transfer, as it is processed in batches along with other ACH transfers. An ACH transfer is typically received within a few business days or fewer. While there have been private sector attempts to improve the speed and cost of ACH, the technology and bureaucracy underlying it remain unchanged.\n\nThe bitcoin technology is much more elegant, leveraging the open ledger known as the Blockchain and a distributed network of computers to confirm transactions. These computers, known as miners, compete for the right to make these confirmations and gain the associated rewards by solving complex mathematical problems, typically within 10 minutes and at a de minimis cost to the transacting parties.\n\nConsumers consider trust in people and benefits of technology\n\nRegardless how elegant or exciting the breakthrough for computer science, consumers don’t care. They aren’t considering the technical differences between ACH and wire transfers. They certainly aren’t differentiating between the different wire transfer services. And I highly doubt they’re thinking about the sorting machine that the postal service will utilize to get their package of cash from point A to point B.\n\nTo the contrary, they are focused on the benefits of each method and, more importantly, whether they trust the people behind the door they must walk through when handing over their hard-earned cash. And, at least for myself, the site of the average Western Union storefront – dilapidated and positioned next to a giant “checks cashed here” sign – prompts a quick tap on the back pocket to confirm my wallet is still there.\n\nThe company’s terms and conditions page is longer than something you’d be forced to sign before going skydiving or on a trek up Mount Everest. It’s not the technology used by these transmitters that Americans don’t trust; it’s the people who operate them (and the lawyers who write their terms and conditions).\n\nPeople are not algorithms\n\nYet, according to the data, the people associated with bitcoin, or to be clearer, a minority of people who were the focus of a majority of the media attention over the past two years, have fostered distrust.\n\nThe bitcoin community has recognized the obstacles this presents and chosen to either combat it with public relations initiatives; remove any mention of bitcoin from their marketing and branding; or ensure that its use is not relevant to the beneficiaries of the service provided as do the so-called “last mile” remittances applications. Each of these strategies are understandable, but insufficient.\n\nI’m confident that in the future the core technological advances represented by bitcoin can enable far greater transparency and consumer protection than currently exists in the traditional financial system, but consumers today choose to work with people and businesses they have confidence will deliver as promised. A professional framework, such as that proposed above, will mitigate the human risks atop bitcoin and establish the trust necessary for consumers to more broadly adopt the technology.\n\nWhile Satoshi Nakamoto launched a technology “completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust,” on top of the bitcoin network, the people building enterprises and interfacing with customers are just that — people, not algorithms.\n\nFeatured Image: Blablo101/Shutterstock', 'The former bitcoin trading division at SecondMarket has relaunched as the Digital Currency Group\'s (DCG) latest subsidiary, Genesis Trading.\n\nAdvertising itself as the first regulated broker-dealer in the US to specialize in bitcoin, Genesis is the latest development at Barry Silbert\'s increasingly active organisation.\n\nThe trading firm offers institutional and private investors a way to buy and sell large blocks of digital currencies such as bitcoin, litecoin and ripple, a specialty its team honed sourcing bitcoins for SecondMarket\'s private investment vehicle, Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nGenesis CEO Brendan O\'Connor suggested that the launch represents more of a rebranding than a formal market debut, given Genesis Trading\'s established history in the space.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""We have been trading since 2013.

Forde will work with researchers across the institute and leading experts at other universities around the world to address some of the most critical challenges to creating a safe, stable and secure digital currency.\n\n“As a technologist, there’s no more exciting place to work than the MIT Media Lab,” said Forde. “The innovations that come out of the Media Lab have made a truly global impact. I look forward to working with the faculty and students and collaborating with developers, academics, entrepreneurs, governments, and nonprofits to help us get closer to a more robust and viable digital currency that could have tremendous benefits around the world.”\n\nAt the White House, Forde was responsible for determining how the Obama administration would leverage open data and emerging technologies to address the president’s national priorities.\n\n“While at the White House, Brian led extraordinary initiatives to leverage the power of tech and innovation to make the future of America ever brighter,” said Todd Park, White House adviser for technology.\n\n“We are fortunate to have Brian join the Media Lab to help organize an important research agenda to get cryptocurrencies right,” said Ito. “Brian’s experience mainstreaming emerging technologies from the rural mountains of Nicaragua to the White House will be invaluable as he tackles the challenges of digital currency – one of the most promising emerging technologies for the next 10 years.”\n\nIn a Medium article, Forde gives more information about the MIT Digital Currency Initiative. He is persuaded that we are at a pivotal point for the digital economy.\n\n“Getting digital currencies right and realizing the projected impact, present daunting challenges that will require significant research and development to overcome,” he says.\n\nSeveral renowned MIT experts of economy, cryptography and system security, mentioned in the Medium article, will actively participate in the Digital Currency Initiative together with interested companies, developers, and forward-thinking policy makers. The MIT student community, including Jeremy Rubin, the undergraduate who launched the MIT Bitcoin Project, also will be involved.\n\nAccording to Forde, the goals of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative are to:\n\nConduct research and engage more students on digital currency topics that address questions about security, stability, scalability, privacy and economics.\n\nConvene governments, nonprofits and the private sector to research and test concepts that have high social impact.\n\nProvide evidence-based research to support existing and future policy and standards.\n\nThere is an overlap between these terms and those of the Bitcoin Foundation. It seems likely that, in view of the troubled history of the foundation, the Bitcoin community could welcome MIT as an alternative, prestigious venue for leadership and coordination of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nForde hopes that the MIT initiative will provide the support needed for the digital currency community to help realizing the “tremendous opportunities to increase access to critical financial services for all, create more transparent democracies, and develop services that dramatically reduce barriers for global commerce,” and looks forward to connecting with anyone who has feedback or new research.\n\n“MIT Media Lab (E14)” by Sayamindu Dasgupta– Modified / CC BY-SA 2.0', 'Not many healthcare entrepreneurs can reference negotiating $2 billion oil service contracts in Iraq on their resume, but Cyrus Maaghul is a little outside of the box.

Those that do tend to focus on home health services.\n\nPointNurse recently became the first healthcare startup and one of five companies to join Swarm, an incubator/crowdfunding group based in Palo Alto that uses BitCoin technology. Swarm raised $1 million last year and set up an incubator for startups using blockchain technology.', 'CoinDesk managing editor Emily Spaven interviews director Alex Winter ahead of the release of his new documentary film Deep Web.\n\nLibertarian ideals, crime and citizens\' rights in the digital age – there are many themes running through Alex Winter\'s latest documentary film, Deep Web, but by far the greatest focus is the story of Ross Ulbricht and his involvement in the online drugs marketplace Silk Road.\n\nWinter, best known for his role as Bill Preston in the Bill and Ted franchise, has long since proved his worth on the other side of the lens, having sat in the director\'s chair on five films since 1993.\n\nHis latest offering begins with a rousing speech by British libertarian and cypherpunk Amir Taaki, warning of corrupt fascists masquerading as ""white knights"". Taaki enthuses that now is the time for the technological classes to take back their sovereignty.\n\nThe movie goes on to explore the mysterious underbelly of the Internet – the hidden layer called the Deep Web and its anonymity-rich area: the Dark Net.\n\nIt\'s here that illegal drug marketplaces exist and where Ulbricht\'s story begins.\n\nThe film focuses on the arrest of Ulbricht, the charges made against him for his involvement in the creation and operation of Silk Road and the court case centred on these allegations.\n\nAlong the way, Deep Web introduces a number of people, ranging from Ulbricht\'s mother, a childhood friend and a former law enforcement professional, to his defence lawyer, an anonymous Silk Road drugs vendor and an anti-prohibition campaigner.\n\nThe human angle\n\nWinter explained the film was initially to be centred broadly on bitcoin, the Dark Net and the revolutionary ideas behind cryptography, encryption and cryptocurrencies, however this soon changed.\n\n""As the Silk Road story and Ross’s story evolved, it became really clear that the human story was the most important – he put his life on the line,"" he said, adding:\n\n""The guy is facing the rest of his life in jail. I think it\'s important to think about Ross Ulbricht – whatever you think about his guilt or innocence – you have to reflect on this human being\'s life.""\n\nThe film speaks of Ulbricht\'s libertarian leanings and suggests Silk Road was much more about affording people the freedom to buy and sell whatever they wish (so long as it didn\'t cause harm to others) than about drug dealers making a quick buck.\n\n""The people I got to know in this world didn\'t make a lot of money. These weren’t people who were driven by money, they were driven by ideals,"" Winter said.\n\nThese people aimed to exercise their freedom and create a safer alternative to the existing drugs market, which is plagued by death and violence.\n\nIn Deep Web, Neill Franklin, the director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition describes how he experienced this first-hand when working as a Maryland State Police major.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, he came to the realisation that policies on drug prohibition were ""counterproductive to public safety"" and gradually became opposed to the War on Drugs.\n\nHe believes moving the drugs trade from street corners to online services would lead to a dramatic decrease in the number of shootings and homicides.\n\n""It removes the buyer from the back alleys and the street corners and those dangerous places [where people are] dealing with the seller. Buying over the Internet … removes that scenario.""\n\nHe emphasised that, after four decades of the War on Drugs, it\'s clear it isn\'t working, so it\'s time to try a new approach.\n\nLaw enforcement tactics\n\nThe actions of US law enforcement are also called into question elsewhere in the film. Wired tech journalist Andy Greenberg and Berkley computer scientist Nicholas Weaver discuss the mystery surrounding the seizure of the Silk Road servers, which were at a data centre in Iceland.\n\nThe physical location of these servers was protected by Tor, which defends against traffic analysis and network surveillance, so the mystery as to how this was obtained remains unsolved.\n\nAlthough the FBI asserts it did not use illegal techniques to obtain the server, many suggest illegal hacking methods were used.\n\n""We still don\'t know how the Silk Road server was found, we don\'t know whether Ross\' fourth amendment rights were violated and whether this case will set precedence for the violation of any citizen\'s rights in the digital age,"" said Winter.\n\nAs for whether the authorities are scapegoating Ulbricht for his involvement in Silk Road, Winters isn\'t sure. The 49-year-old said it\'s clear Ulbricht is not entirely innocent – he admitted to founding the site – but there are some things he is likely being unfairly lumbered with.\n\nWinter believes the authorities will choose to make an example of Ulbricht and hand out a harsh sentence, but he doesn\'t feel this will hamper the creation or progression of online drugs marketplaces.\n\n""There are more and more market places popping up every day – it\'s certainly the beginning of this era, not the end.""\n\nThe true significance of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin plays a big part in this film, as the payment method used to buy goods on Silk Road, and Winter is a long-time fan of digital currency.\n\nHe first become aware of bitcoin in 2009 while working on his previous film Downloaded, about the controversial file-sharing site Napster, which rocked the music industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIt wasn\'t until 2011 or 2012 that he realised the ""true significance"" of bitcoin, and that was when he came across Silk Road.\n\n""Silk Road combined bitcoin and Tor in a way that was so powerful that it created a movement and the mechanics for a new marketplace – a new way of using bitcoin. It popularised bitcoin in such a way that there’s really no going back,"" he said.\n\n“I think bitcoin is very threatening to various established systems because of the community component.”\n\nAccording to Winter, the true power of bitcoin lies in its supporting community.\n\n""I think bitcoin is very threatening to various established systems because of the community component,"" he explained.\n\nHe\'s also adamant that bitcoin\'s use on illegal marketplaces such as Silk Road will not do, and has not done, the cryptocurrency any harm. The director believes bitcoin wouldn\'t be where it is today if it wasn\'t for Silk Road.\n\n""Silk Road put bitcoin on the map, just like Napster put peer-to-peer communities on the map.""\n\nAlso a fan of bitcoin is the movie\'s narrator, Keanu Reeves, of Matrix and Point Break fame and Winter\'s co-star in Bill and Ted.\n\n""Keanu has been watching my cuts since the early days of this project, he\'s very very interested in this story, so that\'s why he got involved. He\'s also into bitcoin,"" said Winter.\n\nBlack, whites and greys\n\nWhen asked about the film\'s main message, Winter insists there isn’t just the one. The issues raised in the film are so complex and intertwined it\'s impossible to walk away with one resounding message in mind.\n\n""I don\'t want people to get trapped in the black and white,"" he said.\n\n""The human brain has this impulse to side on one side or the other, but I think it\'s a big mistake not to live in the greys. You need to get out of the black and whites.""\n\nDeep Web premieres on 31st May at 20:00 ET on EPIX.

The Sumerians of ancient Babylon invented it about 5,000 years ago, the Greeks banned it, the Hindus worshiped it, and the Church branded it as demonic figure that implied the negation of God.\n\nRehabilitation started in northern Italy in the 13th century. Zero became the most important tool in mathematics. It enabled the merchants of Venice to create modern finance: they invented the double-entry bookkeeping system. In her book ‘Double Entry’ author Jane Gleeson-White states that double-entry bookkeeping is ‘one of the greatest advances in the history of business and commerce’. She argues that ‘the process of recording profit and loss was nothing short of revolutionary: it fuelled the Renaissance, enabled capitalism to flourish, and created the global economy.’\n\nJacob Soll, the author of ‘The Reckoning’, states that basic accounting tools not only form the basis of modern capitalism but also of ‘the nation-state’. Our present is the outcome of this innovative system of accounting.\n\nThe acceptance of the double-entry bookkeeping system didn’t happen overnight. One of the main obstacles was the Church. Pope Leo the Great forbade charging interest on loans by canon law. In his eyes banking was sinful. It was prohibited to profit from money ‘without working’. Soon various ways around the prohibition were devised. Christianity and Judaism generally ban usury, but allowed usury towards heretics. Thus Christians could lend to Jews and vice versa.\n\nHistory repeats itself\n\nWith the introduction of the binary number system, the base-2 internal machine language of computers, we are now seeing the dawn of a new system for double-entry accounting. Instead of using a centralized ledger — that is controlled by banks, notaries and insurance companies — the Bitcoin Blockchain proposes a new distributed bookkeeping system, where every node in the network maintains its own copy of the ledger. The ledger is completely transparent, everybody has the same view on reality. There is an excellent video that explains it further over on Khan Academy.\n\nThe blockchain is a shared single source of truth. Or as Alex and Don Tapscott explained it: ’It basically enables a global spreadsheet — an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value and importance to humankind: birth and death certificates, marriage licenses, deeds and titles of ownership, educational degrees, financial accounts, medical procedures, insurance claims, votes, transactions between smart objects, and anything else that can be expressed in code.’\n\nNo wonder that the popes of our modern economy find it hard to grasp how Bitcoin and blockchain technology works. A new Renaissance might be at the horizon. The blockchain not only radically transforms the way we do commerce, but it basically redefines the nature of the firm and has the potential to fundamentally shift the way in which our society is hierarchically organised.\n\nA supercomputer for any kind of reality\n\nMelanie Swan, author of ‘Blockchain: Blueprint for a new economy’ says that ‘in some sense, blockchain technology could be a supercomputer for reality.’\n\nIn his upcoming book ‘The Blockchain: Mapping the future of decentralization’ author Simon de la Rouviere builds upon this idea. He argues that the blockchain can even support ‘alternate realities as legitimate avenues to “live” in several ways’.\n\nUsing a combination of decentralized finance, property, trade, organisations, artificial intelligence and law, it not only creates a decentralized basis for our current reality, but any other one.’ So the blockchain is basically a supercomputer for every kind of reality we can imagine. It’s a ‘computational universe with true time dimensionality.’\n\nThe possibilities are endless. At the moment we are only scratching the surface of what alternate realities blockchain might enable. Just think of all the virtual realities that the blockchain can support: Minecraft, the massive multiplayer online game EVE Online, just to name a few. And what about Oculus Rift? Last year Mark Zuckerberg acquired the company for $2 billion. During his keynote session at the F8 conference he showed the above picture that summarises his vision for Facebook neatly.\n\nFacebook moves from simple text messages to realtime virtual reality experiences. In the near future billions of people will communicate, interact, play and trade with each other in the virtual reality that Facebook displays on their eyeballs.\n\nThe blockchain might be the ultimate protocol to support this kind of global digital nation. With bitcoin blockchain there are no borders or limits. Blockchain cracks Pandora’s Box. It’s a rabbit hole inside of a rabbit hole inside of a rabbit hole…\n\nRobocorps and robosociety\n\nIn his book ‘Sapiens’ author Yuval Noah Harari tells a brief history of humankind. He explains that one of the things that separates us humans from animals is the fact that we can imagine things. ‘Fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively.’ One of the greatest figments of our collective imagination are corporations.\n\nHumans have invented corporations to overcome the boundaries of Dunbar’s number, the ‘cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.’ Over the last couple of centuries these companies have become the main players in our economic arena. Measured by their generated income, some of these structures are even bigger than nation states!\n\nNow, with the invention of the bitcoin blockchain, the idea of corporations is evolving. Blockchain removes all kinds of friction. In doing so, it enables leaderless organizations. Companies whose mission statement is encoded into the blockchain and can thus operate completely autonomously. These so called Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs) aka Robocorps are a new economic entity, next to people and corporations, that are entering and participating in our economy and society.\n\nWrong Side of History\n\nFor centuries, ‘capitalism’s basic institution‘, the corporation, has remained relatively unchanged.\n\nHierarchy, vertical integration and bureaucracy — hallmarks of the industrial age — still reign. We now stand at the edge of a new digital revolution. The internet is beginning a new phase of decentralization. As I’ve explained at the beginning of this article, the decentralized ledger removes all kinds of friction and thus the need for intermediaries. It therefore creates an alternative future that enables a new kind of company, a new kind of economy and a new kind of democracy and society. The future is the reverse of the centralized 20st century.\n\nIn a recent interview, former U.S. treasury secretary Larry Summers, one of the world’s most influential economic thinkers, made the following statement: ‘The people who rejected the internet as a curiosity for scientists were on the wrong side of history, the people who rejected digital photography as really an artificial thing were on the wrong side of history, and the people who felt that nongimmicky tennis racquets were made with wood were on the wrong side of history.\n\nSo it seems to me that the people who confidently reject all the innovation here [in new (blockchain-based) payment and monetary systems] are on the wrong side of history.”\n\nIt’s time for companies to wake up . Don’t fight the new system, but experiment with it and try to innovate. Embrace the possibilities of the bitcoin blockchain. It’s Digital Darwinism: adapt or die.\n\nRead Next: Why Bitcoin is changing how banks do business\n\nRead next: Fiverr Faces lets you order custom designed portraits based on your selfies', 'If you’re a citizen of Finland, this weekend presents you a chance to vote in favor of the Pirate Party of Finland (Piraattipuolue) in the Finnish Parliament election, which occurs on Sunday. The party is a member of Pirate Parties International, and has long accepted Bitcoin donations.\n\nLast month, the party received more than 10,000 euro in bitcoins (the party received 4,000 euro in donations through all channels in 2014.)\n\nThe Pirate Party has included cryptocurrencies in their party program, and, in spite of its incipience, has grown to become the biggest party outside of Parliament at the moment.\n\nWhile pre-election date votes have already been cast, there’s still time to place votes before the actual election date, April 19, when approximately 50% of the votes will be cast.\n\n“The Pirate Party is a young party, we’re seven years old now and the parliamentary elections next year will be our second chance to get someone in. We almost got a candidate elected the first time with almost non-existing budget and a lot of enthusiasm,” wrote the party member and political blogger, Sebastian Maki.\n\nParty History\n\nIn June 2009, the party collected the 5,000 supporter cards needed to officially register in Finland as a political party. The party was officially registered on 13 August 2009, and, in October 2009, participated in the special municipal election of Loviisa with 1 candidate, winning no seats.\n\nThe first major election in which the Party took part was the Finnish Parliamentary election in 2011, with 127 candidates in 11 constituencies, gathering 0.5% of the votes, becoming the largest party without a single seat in Parliament. The 2014 European Parliament election saw the party gather 12,378 votes (0.7%).\n\nParty Politics\n\nThe party aims to develop democracy, safeguard civil rights and promote transparency in politics. Wishing to free information and culture from government restrictions, the party pledges to review the usefulness of the patent system, as well as increase privacy and freedom of speech. The party supports a basic income and wants to abolish daylight savings time.\n\nIn terms of Bitcoin promotion, the party will have to wait for broader acceptance of the nascent cryptocurrency before making it a central part of the party’s operations and platform.\n\n“Sadly we’re not yet at the point where almost anything can be paid with Bitcoin in Finland. Namely ads and rent,” Sebastian Maki stated in answer to a Reddit user.\n\nBitcoin Climate In Finland\n\nFinnish Parliament announced that value added tax (VAT) does not apply to Bitcoin, an atypical stance on Bitcoin from a European government.\n\nFinland has also warned the Pirate Party of the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAuthorities have informed The Pirate Party that “they have little idea on how bitcoin donations should be handled.” Finnish law states that a party can collect up to 1,500 (PPFI) euros annually in anonymous donations.\n\nIf you are from Finland, or are ideologically aligned with the Pirate Party yet internationally located, you can donate here. Finand’s 2015 parliamentary election takes place Sunday, April 19. Advanced voting ends April 14.\n\nSweden is also home to the Bitcoinparty.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'The bitcoin-fiat exchange market has exploded over the last year, but it isn’t alone. In 2015, amid currency swings in the Russian ruble and the Euro among others, an increasing number of traders are looking to gold as a natural fit for their bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe debate surrounding the relative merits of bitcoin and gold as a store of value has been passively continuing since the first trading options appeared several years ago. On paper, the similarities between the two assets are easy to see: a finite amount, almost infinite divisibility into smaller amounts, a mining process to make them usable.\n\nAs cryptocurrency trading has opened up, however, investors who had previously had nothing to do with the gold market have found themselves in possession of a gold-like commodity – Bitcoin. In the face of bitcoin’s volatility, decreasing as it may be, they have been looking to secure their wealth in a way which does not make them vulnerable to the pitfalls of bitcoin-fiat trading: constant market tracking or trusting a third party to track it for them, declaration of profits (jurisdiction-dependent) and others.\n\nThe advent of bitcoin-gold trading options – not just professional platforms but simple merchants allowing purchase of precious metals with bitcoin such as Amagi Metals and DigitalTangible – has meant that investors have unprecedented easy access to the gold market. More than this, bitcoin allows for considerably less paperwork, money transfer fees and the ability to trade a lot more flexibly which goes along with these benefits.\n\nA new type of gold investor\n\nWhile DigitalTangible was the first operation in the world to create a 100% online Bitcoin-gold marketplace, customer reserves being stored in a Swiss bank vault and recorded using Counterparty, the one-stop-shop approach for gold acquisition has been expanding considerably. As of February 2015, it is even possible to purchase gold and silver from a Bitcoin ATM.\n\nJoshua Scigala, whose company Vaultoro became the first real-time bitcoin-gold exchange on launching in February 2015, says the ease with which bitcoin can be used for wealth security should make it an infinitely preferable option to investors as time goes on.\n\n“When I first started trading gold I would see an opportunity and want to buy, then would have to fund my gold trading account with dollars, taking 4 – 5 working days because it was an international transfer. I remember paying around US$30 in transfer fees for a US$2000 transfer and to top it all off there was a relatively large minimum buy. Talk about aggravating,” he told CoinTelegraph. “Then when I needed the cash again you would have to go through the whole expensive and time-consuming process in reverse. With bitcoin, we can do it within 1 hour for an unlimited amount of money and the cost of around 2 cent miners fee.”\n\nScigala created Vaultoro, which also stores user funds in Swiss vaults – even in their own name – not only to target lay investor but as a way of empowering those for whom fiat trading is out of the question. Specifically, the strain of adhering to stringent anti-money laundering requirements faced by fiat exchanges all but shuts down unbanked users in developing countries from benefiting from Bitcoin security.\n\n“I see gold as a great way to hedge against the volatile bitcoin market without the massive KYC regulatory burden that comes with fiat trading,” he continued. “Try getting KYC compliant documents from some unbanked person in south Saharan Africa! They need to hedge but can’t, and this is where Vaultoro steps in. For the first time the unbanked in developing countries have the opportunity to hold gold in investment-grade Swiss vaults.”\n\nThe Vaultoro model could well become a pervasive one. While many options exist for traditional investors in the developed world, to empower those untouched by the banking system would take the significance and prevalence of gold investment to a uniquely personal level. Like mobile remittances, it would also provide another method of funds control completely separate from banks.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to Scigala for more information on his background and the Vaultoro project.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What do you think about the idea of Bitcoin becoming more popular for gold trading? How and why do you see growth expanding in this market?\n\nJoshua Scigala: We see people that got into Bitcoin because they wanted to be part of an alternative economy. The problem is that the alternative economy we all enjoy is priced and hedged in the debt-based centrally-controlled fiat currency that we all wanted to leave behind.\n\nGold compared to bitcoin is relatively stable and it’s also a great place to park your wealth when sleeping. I have heard from many traders (and their partners) that bitcoin trading really disrupts sleep because you never know what you’re going to wake up with; with gold the price might move a little but you know you will wake up with a similar amount than when you went to sleep.\n\nMoving away from fiat is generally a good idea and something like gold has stood the test of time for a good store of value to trade in and out of. Time is money and money is bitcoin and gold, I like to say!\n\nCT: The bitcoin/ gold argument is one which is often discussed. Do you think bitcoin has the ability to become a store of value which rivals gold?\n\nJS: Maybe one day, once bitcoin has found its “fair price” but currently people still find it hard to quantify bitcoin’s value. I feel that bitcoin is worth a lot more than where we are now but the volatility really means the market has no clue yet and is still figuring it out.\n\nThroughout history Gold has mostly been used to back currencies because it’s too heavy to carry around and every day I hear more and more traders wanting to back their bitcoin value with physical gold. Why? Because it’s another private asset that is globally recognized as value, and just like bitcoin, it’s borderless.\n\nCT: What made you get into this sector and start Vaultoro?\n\nJS: I have been obsessed with Bitcoin since it reached parity to the dollar, for me Bitcoin represents a peaceful evolution out of the crazy global financial mess the world has found itself in. I instantly saw the potential and threw myself down the rabbit hole.\n\nIn late 2013 I got smacked with the closure of Mt. Gox (or ‘Empty Gox’ as I like to write it). It infuriated me because I saw this beautifully elegant way of revolutionizing the global financial order and instead we got uneducated news story after news story about how the CEO of Bitcoin had taken everything and run or that Bitcoin had been hacked. None of it was true of course; we simply had an exchange with no transparency steal or incompetently handle its liabilities.\n\nThis inspired me to create the most transparent exchange in the industry, an exchange that would show the world how to have radical transparency while keeping user privacy in check. I wanted an exchange that would be both publicly and privately auditable; I wanted an exchange that would be inclusive to the whole world and an exchange that was bank and fiat independent for its users.\n\nWe raised some money and started work, and one year later I am proud to say we’ve launched the world’s first real-time bitcoin-gold exchange and after two short months have had 600 members sign up and more than 3,000 grams of gold traded. The gold is secured in their name in vaults within Switzerland, which means that even if something were to happen to Vaultoro.com, they can always get access to their gold.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

04/17/2015,"[""Let's cut right to the chase: the 17-month-long Bitcoin price drop has not spelled the slow death of the currency. Quite the contrary.\n\nThe price fall has coincided with a literal doubling of the network's transaction volume. This means that Bitcoin is no longer a speculative investment, but is becoming an everyday payment method.\n\nOr so says the BitPay team, who recently spoke with IBTimes UK on why the currency's price drop is a natural and even predictable result of Bitcoin's serious growth.\n\nEarly on in Bitcoin's timeline, there was hardly anywhere to spend it, so users bought far more than they spent. But now that bitcoins can get you a hotel, flight, shoes, and an apartment in San Francisco to boot, they're being spent – that is, sold – at a much higher rate.\n\nAnd BitPay would know. At the beginning of 2015, over 100,000 merchants around the globe accepted Bitcoin for payment, and over half of them used BitPay to do so. Though many of BitPay's merchants keep a portion of these payments in bitcoins, most of them convert a good portion of it to fiat. This accounts for the massive downward price swing, because there's just more bitcoins going around.\n\nBut the next bitcoin reward halving is set to take place in 2016 – from 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes to only 12.5. At this point, the number of new and available bitcoins will decrease substantially. If transaction volume is still increasing in 2016, we can expect Bitcoin's price to go up as a result.\n\nHere are some highlights from the infographic that BitPay shared with IBTimes UK:\n\nThe full infographic, which contains more interesting statistics, can be found here.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Five hundred years later, bitcoin could be just as important, standing as it does on the threshold of global digital adoption.\n\nThis was the theory outlined on Friday by an American academic who noted that the potential of bitcoin had its most powerful comparison with events in the middle of the 16th Century and their “centrality in the history of world trade and global currency”.\n\n“New World silver [created] a global social universe, connecting the entire planet for the first time in recorded history in a networked economy,” said Zac Zimmer, an assistant professor of Spanish at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\n\nThe Spanish Dollar or Piece of Eight became the world's first global currency\n\nSpeaking at the Theorising the Web conference in New York, he added: “These global flows of labour and accumulation were tied together by an extractive economy, and it is that extractive economy which bitcoin seeks to reproduce in the digital universe.”\n\nThe battle by bitcoin adherents for its acceptance and adoption continues, but almost every day there are both anecdotal and fixed signs of its progress. There are currently 14m bitcoins in circulation, worth around $3.1bn at the current exchange rate of around $220 per coin.\n\nReuters reported that last month, the British government announced plans to regulate digital currency exchanges in order to prevent their use in money-laundering, and to help to develop a set of standards for cryptocurrencies. The move was praised by backer of bitcoin for lending legitimacy to the currency.\n\n“London has been the home of financial innovation for hundreds of years,” Nicolas Cary, the co-founder of Blockchain, which provides bitcoin data and virtual wallet software for storing the currency, told the news agency.\n\nThe exploitation of Potosi helped the development of the world's first global currency\n\n“It would be a historical mistake not to make this the home of digital currencies. There's an incredible amount of talent and experience here.”\n\nAnd just last week, Republican Rand Paul triggered more debate when he became the first US presidential candidate to announce he would accept bitcoin contributions towards his campaign costs.\n\nThe New York Times reported the move would likely “highlight his edgy appeal to other libertarians, tech-savvy voters, young people and others who favour bitcoins”.\n\nDr Zimmer said much had been written likening bitcoin to a digital gold standard. But he said a more apt comparison was with the Silver Piece of Eight, the circulation and adoption of which became possible because of the exploitation of the Potosi mine and the development of the so-called patio process, which used mercury to recover silver from ore and replaced traditional smelting.\n\nRand Paul has said he will accept campaign contributions in bitcoin\n\n“The Piece of Eight solidified a global trade network, it reoriented hierarchies of power the world over, and, during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, most of it came from one single mountain deep in Peru,” he said.\n\nHe added: “The Potosi discovery, the arrival of the patio process and the silverisation of the Chinese economy all occurred within a few generations. It is the nexus of these global events - political-economic, technological, and geo-political - that provide such an apt comparison with the bitcoin moment.”"", 'The former bitcoin trading division of SecondMarket, has relaunched under the new name Genesis Trading in bid to become ""the partner of choice for large institutional buyers and sellers"" in digital currency trading, while creating an identity of its own from this specification.

Now the app can be used with roughly 4,000 Polish ATMs.\n\nChip Chap connects prepayment systems with cryptocurrencies. The Android app supports a range of payment systems and vouchers, like Bitcoin, Ukash, HalCash, PaysafeCard, and many others. These vouchers don't require a bank account or a credit card. Users can trade their currency for bitcoin, and then convert their bitcoin into the vouchers. It works in Spain, Poland, France, England and Mexico. The conversions are all done by smartphone.\n\nUsers can also cash out the vouchers into cash at participating ATMs. The team claims the app works with a network of over 10,000 ATMs on Spain's Telepay network, ranging from ING Direct to Euronet ATMs. Although, remember, now it works in Poland too.\n\n“With this app you can withdraw your bitcoins in the ATM for now,” the home screen of the app reads, “and much more in the future.”\n\nThere are many uses for this, one being pseudo-privacy. Users select their country on the blue Chip Chap app, punch in their phone number and withdrawal amount, and send bitcoin to an address. Then they receive a code that they can punch into an ATM to redeem their cash.\n\nThe Chip Chap team is intent on edging cryptocurrencies into everyday use. Users can send money to friends and family via social networks. Because the app connects bitcoin with vouchers systems across the world, it has global appeal.\n\nThey also have ambitions of a “global exchange” and of leveraging cryptocurrencies to build a new economy. The app is the brainchild of Entropy Factory, a bitcoin incubator located in the town of Les Coves de Vinromá in Castellón, Spain. Entropy Factory wants to reduce the influence of intermediaries, like banks and governments, in order to empower people. They want to build a new socio-economic model.\n\nWith such lofty ambitions, it only makes sense that they partnered with Dark Wallet. The wallet, currently in alpha 8, aims to ensure that bitcoin transactions are private, and uses Chip Chap so that users can withdraw their bitcoin in cash at the ATM network in Spain, and now in Poland.\n\nSurprisingly, the app is compliant with global Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financial Terrorism laws. Bitcoin companies spend time and money navigating the uncertain regulatory climate. But since Chip Chap does not store third-party funds—it simply facilitates conversions—it is compliant with financial laws.\n\nA paper from Dark Wallet on the partnership sums up their thoughts:\n\n“We believe the future should be easier for every citizen to cash-in and out.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

In this post, I’ll get to the question of the discrepancy between theory and practice. As I pointed out, even though there are many theoretical weaknesses in Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism, none of these ever appear to have been exploited.\n\nA blunt way to explain the discrepancy is to entirely reject the ability of game-theoretic models to predict practice. For example, some people argue that since miners don’t know any game theory, game-theoretic analysis of their behavior is not meaningful. This objection is easily dismissed — animals know even less game theory than miners, and yet their behavior is one of the classic applications of game theory. And most pairs of prisoners facing a dilemma have never heard the term prisoner’s dilemma. Knowledge of game theory by agents is not a prerequisite for the applicability of game theory.\n\nA related objection is that deviating from the default strategy is hard, from the miners’ point of view. After all, it’s not as if Bitcoin Core comes with deviant strategies built in that can be enabled with the flip of a command-line switch. What’s a miner to do? While superficially plausible, I think this objection gets the cause and effect exactly backwards. In reality, no one’s bothered to implement non-default strategies because they didn’t think there were profits to be made from it. Otherwise there would likely be a flourishing ecosystem of patches — or replacements — to bitcoind that would execute these deviant strategies, just as we see with mods to video games.\n\nA more sophisticated objection, and perhaps the most frequent one, is that it’s not in miners’ interest to employ non-default strategies, because it will cause people to lose confidence in Bitcoin’s stability, tanking the price of bitcoins. A drop in the exchange rate is bad for miners it will devalue their investment in mining hardware.\n\nThis is a valid argument, but things get tricky. We do know that miners launch denial-of-service attacks against their competitors; does a similar worry about Bitcoin’s stability and the exchange rate not apply? Besides, it seems that even though it’s phrased as an objection to game-theoretic reasoning, the argument actually co-opts game theory: essentially, it says that non-default strategies are a losing move because they will be met by a certain response from other players, namely investors selling off their bitcoins.\n\nSimilarly, consider the argument that attacks on consensus won’t work because developers will notice and push out an update that defeats it. This is also a game-theoretic argument; the set of participants has now expanded to include developers, and perhaps people running Bitcoin nodes, in addition to miners and investors (an investor being anyone who’s holding bitcoins).\n\nSo we have one kind of game-theoretic argument — that miners could earn more bitcoins by changing their mining strategy — being met with another kind of game-theoretic argument, one that expands the strategy space to reach a different conclusion.\n\nNotice that we’re talking about two very different kinds of strategy here. Mining strategy is executed by software, happens at the time-scale of minutes, and can be analyzed as a “closed” system where the strategy space can be formally described and analyzed mathematically. On the other hand, movements in price and pushing out updates to software involve human decisions, are typically much slower, and are hopeless to try to precisely model mathematically.\n\nIn other words, we seem to have a nested game, a game within a game. The inner game is played by automated agents according to the way they’re programmed. On the other hand, moves in the outer game consist of human operators changing the agents in response to what’s happening on the block chain as well as making moves that are not available to the automated agents. Many moves in the inner game happen between consecutive moves in the outer game, which is one reason that we’re forced to treat the two levels separately.\n\nIf we start looking for this nested-game structure, we find it everywhere. Malware and malware-detection mechanisms are in a constant cat-and-mouse game. In this game, malware must make instantaneous decisions such as where to spread next and whether to attack or wait. But both malware and anti-malware tools are under the control of their respective operators who evolve them over time in response to each others’ moves. Similarly, packets are routed instantaneously but routing policy evolves over time based on traffic patterns.\n\nMy central claim is that for game-theoretic models of Bitcoin mining strategy to better model practice, we must recognize the existence of this two-level structure. The surprising results I talked about in the previous post can all potentially be explained by analyzing the nested game and concluding that it isn’t profitable for miners to deviate after all. Nested games seem to be a popular method for analyzing the behavior of politicians who’re under the influence of voters. It hasn’t been used so far for analyzing Bitcoin.\n\nThis research direction is likely to yield dividends beyond cryptocurrencies. Computer scientists are mechanism designers, from ad auctions to routing protocols. Any of these situations can be seen as a nested game since the creators of the software that plays these games regularly modify it in response to strategies employed by others. The question of which elements of strategy should be programmed into the machines and which ones left to human judgment is relevant to every such scenario.\n\nIn the next post, I’ll present a simple illustrative example of how a nested-game analysis of mining strategy can result in an interesting and non-obvious prediction. Specifically, I’ll look at what happens if a fork-and-double-spend inner game strategy is met by an outer game strategy of the developers deciding to kill the forking chain even though it’s longer.\n\nThanks to Joe Bonneau who suggested the nested game formulation.', 'Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.\n\n\n\nWhilst last week\'s reporting was heavily US-focused, the coverage this week was more far reaching, with outlets from India and Russia mentioning bitcoin – even if in a negative light.\n\nIndeed the biggest lightning rod of interest this week was perhaps bitcoin\'s alleged propensity for enabling illicit activities, with the use of the payment method in online child pornography transactions capturing the lion\'s share of the media\'s headlines.\n\nInterestingly this focus, however, did deflect from other negative coverage.\n\nFor example, bitcoin\'s relative price drop – usually a hot topic among the mainstream press – went mostly unnoticed.\n\nChild porn for bitcoin\n\nAllegations that paedophiles are now buying sexually abusive imagery on the web first surfaced this week following the release of the Internet Watch Foundation\'s annual report.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it did not take long for the media to seize the opportunity to report on the link between the disruptive digital currency and the horrendous activities carried out by some alleged bitcoin users.\n\nA Google news search with the terms ""paedophiles and bitcoin"" brought up more than 80 results, significantly less than previous stories highlighted in this series, but still this week\'s most widely covered topic.\n\nIn his Guardian piece ""Paedophiles sell child abuse images for bitcoin"", Alex Hern commented on how the digital currency\'s inherent characteristics make it a suitable tool for illicit activity.\n\nHern said:\n\n""Bitcoin has a number of properties which make it well suited for trading illegal material such as child sex abuse images. The cryptocurrency is completely decentralised, which means that no single authority can prevent trades from being made, or blacklist buyers and sellers.""\n\nThe Metro\'s Harry Redhead, finished his piece on a questionable conclusion:\n\n""Bitcoin is notoriously hard to trace as all transactions are encrypted. There have been a number of reports linking its use to illegal activity.""\n\nNot entirely the case, as evidenced by recent investigations and convictions carried out by various law enforcement agencies, which proved just how traceable bitcoin transactions can be. Hern agreed, noting that while the currency is often described as anonymous and untraceable, ""there are a number of elements to its design which law enforcement authorities have been able to use to track down people attempting to use bitcoin illegally"".\n\nThe Guardian\'s journalist goes one step further, adding:\n\n""The decentralised nature of the currency means that every single transaction is made public, and in order to convert bitcoins into a controversial currency, they must typically be bought and sold through a bitcoin exchange. Those exchanges are often legally required to keep detailed records on customers, in order to comply with money-laundering regulations.""\n\nInterestingly, the news also caught the attention of The Times of India and Russian outlet MK-London, although both fell somewhat short in their coverage, as they perhaps mischaracterized the fact that bitcoin was easily used to embark in illicit activities.\n\nSky News pointed out that bitcoin was not without controversy, adding that ""there have been numerous reports of it being used for illegal activity"".\n\nPrice fails to capture\n\nBitcoin\'s price has previously managed to capture a sizeable amount of the media\'s attention, especially when it declines.\n\nIn January, the price of bitcoin dropped from $224 to around $175 (a decline of approximately 22%) in just a matter of hours, before rebounding again.\n\nAt the time, the decline in value sent shockwaves that spread far beyond the bitcoin community. The New York Times spoke of a possible market squeeze.\n\nFT Alphaville\'s report, on the other hand, read like a bitcoin obituary and The Sydney Morning Herald described bitcoin\'s entry into 2015 as ""appalling,"" claiming that the currency appeared to be in free fall.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk\'s bitcoin price index, the price of bitcoin dropped from $236 last Friday to $216 on Tuesday this week, reaching its second lowest value since January this year.\n\nDespite many commentators, such as the The Wall Street Journal\'s Michael Casey previously saying that bitcoin\'s price doesn\'t matter, the truth is that the digital currency\'s value has been hotly debated topic among the media.\n\nIt seems that, at least for now, mainstream journalists left the reporting on the price to the bitcoin press, though even here it was greeted with a lukewarm response.\n\nAs for whether this marks any change in how media outlets will potentially report on future declines, however, remains to be seen.\n\nNewspaper image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Organizers want to make Bitcoins more popular here by teaching people how to use the digital currency.\n\nAndrew Hayes is getting a haircut at Gino’s Classic Barber Shoppe in Dunwoody.\n\n“I’m getting a crew cut with a taper, short on the sides, and trying to keep as much as I can on the top,” Hayes says.\n\nAnd on his way out, he uses his smartphone to pay with Bitcoins. Another customer paying with Bitcoin, Dustin Farist, explains how it works.\n\n“They have the QR code here that has the amount of the charge in it as well as the tip that I added in Bitcoin,” Farist says. “So now I just hit send and now I have paid and so they’ve verified that transaction just like that.”\n\nThe barbershop then gets the Bitcoins converted to cash through the processing system Bitpay.\n\nThere aren’t a lot of places that accept Bitcoin in metro Atlanta. Besides Gino’s Classic Barber Shoppe, there are a few smokeshops, restaurants and fitness clubs.\n\nJason Cronk is one of the organizers of the Bitcoin Consumer Fair. Around 100 people have registered for the fair.\n\n“Unlike some technologies, Bitcoin is going to grow slowly until it reaches a critical mass, and then you’ll see widespread use,” Cronk says.\n\nOne reason Bitcoins are slow to catch on is that the currency is not very stable.\n\nOne day in 2013 prices fluctuated between $105 and $250.', 'Name of product: Lawnmower\n\nWhat it is: Bitcoin\'s take on the popular investment app Acorns, Lawnmower rounds traditional bank card purchases up to the nearest dollar and invests the change in bitcoin.\n\nMade by: Lawnmower.io\n\nWho’s behind it: Three University of Florida classmates Pieter Gorsira, Patrick Archambeau and Alex Sunnarborg and strategic backers Boost VC.\n\nCost: Free\n\nDate launched: 9th April\n\nBasic summary: Lawnmower provides a painless way for users to start saving bitcoin in incremental amounts.\n\nCoinDesk rating: 3.5/5\n\nThe basics: Available as an iOS app and currently in Android beta, Lawnmower creates a Coinbase wallet for users, connecting the address to a bank account or credit card. Lawnmower monitors the user\'s traditional purchases, rounding transactions to the nearest dollar, or in the case of a $3.00 transaction, the next dollar, converting this ""change"" to bitcoin.\n\nUsing the service\n\nTo install the service, iOS users download the app to their preferred device. From there, sign-up is broken down into a three-step process.\n\nThe app is currently limited to users of one of five traditional banking partners, all of whose services can be accessed via financial API platform Plaid. Available banks currently include Bank of America, Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo and US Bank.\n\nOnce selected, users must correctly answer security passwords used in conjunction with their account. Unlike when accessing online banking, users must correctly answer all questions before moving forward. Lawnmower then displays a screen indicating that it has yet to detect any transaction activity, one that is eventually populated with a history of its purchases.\n\nThe app requires a minimum of $4 be collected in clippings from purchases before it purchases bitcoin on behalf of the user.\n\nPros\n\n- Easy signup process for Coinbase users\n\n- Straightforward user interface shows bitcoin accrued, the dollar equivalent and a history of recent purchases at a glance.\n\nCons\n\n- Limited currently to USD investors\n\n- Requires Coinbase account\n\n- Stats page yet to be developed\n\n- Users currently limited to one investment option.\n\nSecurity\n\nAs for security, Lawmower outsources most of the responsibility to its related third-party providers. Banking transaction data is stored outside the app by API provider Plaid, while users can only sell or send bitcoin through their Coinbase accounts.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the overly ambitious aims of many companies in the space, Lawnmower should be lauded for its success at delivering on a simplistic vision. Further, it provides what is most likely the easiest way to purchase bitcoins, requiring only that users to opt in to a program and go about their normal business.\n\nAs for how it ultimately delivers on its value proposition to investors, however, that depends on the point of view of the user. Alternative apps, like Acorns for example, offer a wide range of investment options, from government bonds to real estate stocks, diversity that isn\'t yet available in the Lawnmower app.\n\nLawnmower\'s ultimate usefulness as an investment tool may be dependent on the wider success of cryptocurrency as an asset class, though whether bitcoin will be enough to attract a large target market of investors looking to grow their savings, and by extension, Lawnmower as a company, remains to be seen.\n\nDisclaimer: This article represents the experience and opinion of the reviewer.

( Rachael Myrow/KQED )\n\nBitcoin has been around for six years now, but most of us are still unclear on just what it is, let alone why it matters. The digital currency has been flying under the radar, appealing to a group of die-hard fans, like libertarians who want freedom from government control, and illegal drug traders — who also want freedom from government control. But that Wild West world is giving way.\n\nIf you work in Silicon Valley, as Ryan Singer does, you can appreciate what it feels like to be excited about something much of the rest of the world has never heard of. Singer’s startup, Domus Tower, is developing Bitcoin technology that will speed up stock trades.\n\nHe understands that Bitcoin sounds new and strange and possibly scary, and ticks off some frequently heard concerns: “Are your identities safe on it? Are children safe on it? Is it a method for spreading pornography? That was basically all anyone said about the Internet until suddenly it became normal.”\n\nBitcoin is hardly “normal” – yet. Lots of people have reasons to distrust it, thanks to a string of high-profile scandals.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin’s value has careened wildly from north of $1,200 at the top (in 2013) to less than $230 now.\n\nScams and scandals aside, people are curious. Bitcoin was the No. 4 Google search question last year in San Francisco and Oakland. As in, “What is Bitcoin?”\n\nSo: What is Bitcoin?\n\nIt’s money, tradable like dollars or gold, but there’s no central bank, no controlling institution. A distributed network of computers keeps track of who owns what and where. And these days, you can buy a lot more than illegal drugs with Bitcoin, like a Tesla Model S or a new couch at Overstock.com. The more Bitcoin catches on, the more it attracts the attention of people who want to see just how far it can go. Namely, venture capitalists.\n\nTim Draper has invested in 35 Bitcoin startups to date, and he’s just one VC. A couple others include the famous Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron. Draper says it’s not just Bitcoin the currency that has lots of possibilities. It’s also the way that a distributed network without middle men makes all kinds of financial transactions cheaper and faster.\n\n“Bankers are nervous,” Draper says. “Every time you buy something at the store with a credit card, the bank’s taking 2½ to 4 percent. The bank takes somewhere between 8 and 16 percent when you’re sending money to another country. Those businesses are going to be flattened by Bitcoin.”\n\nOr banks and the like will get in on the game, too. Already, regulators at the state and federal level are crafting laws. One bill in the California Assembly would establish the first guidelines for people and companies keen to use virtual currency here. New York’s moving even faster, because Wall Street is already getting in on the Bitcoin boom.\n\nJerry Brito runs Coin Center, a Bitcoin research outfit in Washington, D.C., which reported last month that 6.2 percent of U.S. survey respondents say they’ve used Bitcoin.\n\n“For example, there are now Bitcoin derivatives and Bitcoin derivative exchanges (approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) where you can trade Bitcoin options of different kinds. And if you wanted to invest in Bitcoin, you would not have to hold the Bitcoin itself. You could simply invest in a fund.\n\n“There needs to be greater regulatory certainty,” Brito adds. “Right now, we’re getting there. At the federal level, the Treasury Department has issued guidance that explains how Bitcoin businesses must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, with anti-money-laundering and Know Your Customer regulations, and there are companies today that are venture-backed, that are run by serious people, and are complying with those regulations.”\n\nBelow: Venture capitalist Tim Draper talks about Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n', 'A group of two dozen people (and growing) represented by Advokatfirman Rise & Co AB (Stockholm) is bringing a class action lawsuit against Swedish Bitcoin firm KnCMiner, the one-time premier manufacturer of Bitcoin mining hardware.\n\nThere are a range of issues for the court to consider, but the one CCN is most intimately familiar with is the one that our source, a member of this class action lawsuit, who told us about his experience with KnC. Here is a pruned (moderately edited) version of his lengthy story:\n\nI read in the local papers that a Swedish company was going to make an ASIC. I called the number listed, but thought it might be another scam. Then they delivered the Jupiter (October batch) and I was cursing my luck. That machine was awesome! I immediately got in line for the next machine, the Jupiter (November batch) and loved it, I only regretted not ordering more of them. I made my money back on that plus then some! I eventually bought 6+ more machines.\n\nI had nothing but praise for KnC, they were from my town and they were the darling of the bitcoin industry, actually making machines and delivering on time while people like Butterfly Labs were still cheating customers.\n\nWhen they announced their next batch of miners, things turned sour, and KnC started to show their true colors. A lot of customers decided to take the “Super Jupiters” instead of waiting and we (on the forums) were shocked when the pictures hit of what the “Super Jupiters” actually were: second hand machines that were running in KnC’s data centers, coated with dust, barely working.\n\nI was thinking of cancelling my order (like a lot of folk on the forums) but then KnC announced the “Hash while you wait” as well as the bonus machine so I, and a lot of folk on the forums stuck it out. Finally got my hands on my Neptune miner (delivered past the due date) and had a few problems. KnC worked to resolve them (although not as fast as before, now we had to wait weeks for KnC to first “analyze” what was wrong and then send a replacement). It was better than what those poor people got with their “Super Jupiters” anyway.\n\nRemembering how well they delivered when they first came to market, I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 5 minutes of when they announced they were going to make a Scrypt miner, I bought into the Titan.\n\nI was one of the first to get a Titan, and had probably the most problems. It would not hash over 30MHs, well below the 300 promised, with constant restarts as a bonus. I remember getting it on a Friday, it sat in the corner, powered down, till Monday when I started calling KnC and writing on the forums. […] What KnC sent us was a miner that was clearly not even half-baked, the software was pre-alpha (I’m a programmer myself). […] It was not till two weeks or so later that KnC released an update and I could finally hash a bit without the constant restarts, but still well below the 300MHs promised.\n\nMy miner was so bad, and I made so much noise about it, that KnC eventually remote connected to my computer and made a few software changes to get my miner not to shut off and even start to hash a bit.\n\nI was still one of the lucky ones, as I had signed up in the first few minutes for the Titan, my machine had a 1 year warranty […] for a clearly less-than-half baked machine.\n\nAfter a while with the firmware updates and over-clocking the machines I started to get the promised 300MHs, or close enough (290MHs-295MHs) so when I saw the offer to change to a Batch 2 Titan or stick with the Neptune as the bonus machine, I figured by Batch 2 (remembering the old Jupiter machines) they would have fixed everything. I chose a Batch 2 Titan for my bonus machine.\n\nAll the while we were having huge problems with their machines (fires, burnt out cores, random shutdowns, etc.). [At the same time], KnC was making press/twitter etc releases about how happy their customers were with the junk they had sent them. A bit after that they took away the option for a Batch 2 Titan, but I, and others have emails that we sent KnC asking for confirmation that we were getting a Batch 2 Titan, and always got a reply saying, yes, its confirmed.\n\nThen I finally got the infamous email telling me that due to “technical issues” I was not going to get my Batch 2 Titan, take a Neptune or take 3 BTC. That was the final straw. Do KnC value their Titans at just 3 BTC now after [charging] 10,000 USD for them? (The price of BTC was around $230 when we got the “offer”, so a total of ~700 USD.) This was such a blatant bait and switch and I (and quite a few others) were furious. KnC was only doing this because they had gotten so used to cheating people and getting away with it. I was determined that I was going to do something about it.\n\nAfter more than 48 hours, KnC had failed to provide comment for this article. However, the law firm did confirm to CCN that the case was active. Magnus Daar, a partner at the firm, said:\n\nI can confirm that there are three pending class action suits against KnCMiner and at least 24 individual actions.\n\nThe lawyer also confirmed for us that our contact was indeed a client.\n\nAlso read: Is KnCMiner Finally Issuing Titan Refunds?\n\nThe Big Deal\n\nWhat’s the big deal, some might wonder. At least they didn’t send nothing, or essentially offer nothing, as was the case with Butterfly Labs. The answer is simple: the big deal is that if a company charges someone $10,000 for something and then doesn’t deliver, it is in their best interest (if they don’t want to get sued) to return that $10,000. By whatever means necessary.\n\nOur contact was not the only one to have a horrible experience with KnCMiner who reached out. Another had no problem with us using his name for this article. He is Chandra Das and he resides in Florida. He has not yet joined the class action suit against KnC, hoping, as he said to this writer, “KnC would get their act together soon.”\n\nBut, to be blunt, that seems unlikely. KnC is presently offering Chandra 6.5 Bitcoins to refund him for an order he placed last June. As he put it:\n\nThe price of bitcoin last summer was about $600. US dollar price for a Mini Titan with shipping to the US was $3,897.60. On June 17, 2015 payment of this US dollar amount in bitcoin would be about 6.5 bitcoin. […] KnCMiner now proposes to repay 6.5 bitcoins as a “full refund” for an order totaling $3,897.60. Current price on Bitstamp at time of this message is $216. A refund of 6.5 BTC would not be a full refund, but would be about 36% of the amount paid ten months ago.\n\nIt may be hard to believe that a company that has been so enriched by this community is simultaneously so willing to treat its members with such disregard. It seems that somewhere along the way they lost sight of their mission of “securing the world’s most trusted blockchain” and moved on to “securing the linings of KnCMiner’s pockets.”\n\nKnCMiner Going Strong\n\nDespite having no less than 24 customers dissatisfied enough to involve the courts, KnCMiner has not cut and run in the sense that they are still doing business. While they failed to respond to CCN’s requests for comment on this article, even insofar as giving us a bland piece of advertising jargon, last month on the 11th of March they updated their news category with an explanation of why they had removed their web store.\n\nWe’ve finished shipping most of the hardware we’ve had on order and the final deliveries of the Titan and other bonus offers will ship over the next few weeks. […] As we’re moving away from mail-order sales we’ve removed the web shop from our domain and we’re switching systems for support, accounts, log-in, mobile access and more.\n\nThis last bit will be interpreted by the burned customers out there in only one way: they’re trying to delete the past and move forward. Fortunately, Bitcoiners are savvy record keepers, by and large, and those who have been done wrong have all the evidence they’ll need to successfully bring suit against KnC.\n\nIn the case of Chandra Das, it seems a matter of time before he decides to join in the case against KnC. He had the following advice to offer to newcomers who might cross paths with KnCMiner:\n\nKnCMiner has thankfully moved out of the mining hardware business to offer their cloud mining services. Taking the decision to purchase cloud hashing requires due diligence and a degree of trust in the service provider. The customer’s trust is an invaluable commodity. KnCMiner would be wise to salvage their early customers’ trust, if they have hopes of returning on investments from the venture backers of their cloud hashing.\n\nSwedish law indicates that prison sentences up to six years long can be imposed for the crime of fraud, and presumably in situation with this many victims, this could translate into a lot more time, depending on how the case were pursued. It would seem that Swedish authorities might take more interest in the doings of KnC if and when the class action suit against them is successfully won.\n\nImages by Shutterstock and Pixabay.\n\nIf you are a victim of KnC’s business practices or, conversely, a satisfied customer, and you feel this story has left something out, please contact the author right away at [email protected] CCN will be happy to do follow-ups on this matter as needed.\n\nAdditionally, those interested in joining the class action suit against KnC may contact the advokat, Magnus Daar, at [email protected] / +46 (0)708 86 81 61.

04/18/2015,"['Last Friday we released our quarterly State of Bitcoin report, which aims to provide a snapshot of events across the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nWith 87 slides of data, it\'s a hefty read. Here, we\'ve cherry-picked some of the most surprising insights gleaned about the cryptocurrency space this year.\n\nTo view the full presentation, visit Slideshare. For all of CoinDesk\'s previous State of Bitcoin reports, head here.\n\nJournalists are writing books, but not articles\n\nBack in March, Fortune journalist Daniel Roberts gave mainstream media coverage of bitcoin a Kulber-Ross spin. Mirroring the five stages of loss, he suggested, journalists\' approach to the cryptocurrency has typically morphed from \'ignore\', \'dismiss\', \'cover\' and \'hedge\' to the fifth and final stage: \'write a book\'.\n\nAmazon\'s ever-growing bitcoin section, with titles from CNBC, MoneyWeek, CNN Money and The Wall Street Journal reporters, puts weight behind this theory.\n\nYet, the State of Bitcoin (Slide 22) indicates that the recent boom in bitcoin books wasn\'t mirrored in three of the top financials this quarter, with bitcoin-related articles seeing a dip across the The Wall Street Journal (18.6%), The New York Times (3.9%) and Chinese publisher Sina.com (23.4%).\n\nWhile this isn\'t the full picture, the Financial Times saw a 90.2% increase for example, a rudimental search for \'bitcoin\' in Google News mirrors this trend, showing 27 pages of results for Q1, while the previous quarter totals 34 pages.\n\nBitcoin users buy legal (and boring) things, too\n\nAlthough bitcoin has been linked to nefarious activities – most notably due to its use as the de facto currency for defunct drug marketplace Silk Road, data from top bitcoin merchant Overstock (Slide 46) indicates it\'s also used to buy legal, and somewhat mundane, items.\n\nAt the top of bitcoin spenders\' lists ... bedsheets. Other homeware items such as rugs, mattresses and coffee tables also made the top 10, alongside the more predictable consumer tech accessories like headphones and cables.\n\nThe second bestseller on Overstock\'s list may also come as a surprise to some: non-profit donations. A far cry from deep web hitmen and deadly substances.\n\nWallet use is rising as merchant interest wanes\n\nBlockchain\'s February announcement that it hit 3 million bitcoin wallet downloads illustrates the product\'s continued rise in popularity, (14%) this quarter (Slide 8). The total number of bitcoin wallets has almost doubled since last year, closing Q1 at 8,457,207.\n\nSo, does this mean over 8 million new consumers are buying and spending bitcoin? Well, not exactly.\n\nGoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard notes that merchants have been ""widely disappointed by the number of transactions they see in bitcoin"" (Slide 50). According to the report, mainstream users simply don\'t have a compelling reason to try a volatile currency over its alternatives, yet.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by that fact that the growth rate of new bitcoin-accepting merchants is declining (Slide 47), continuing the downward trend from previous State of Bitcoin reports.\n\nBut what about the wallet numbers? Well, it remains to be seen whether these statistics have any meaningful correlation with real consumer interest. It\'s easy, and free, to open a wallet account and it\'s unclear how many from Blockchain\'s growing total actually contain funds or whether existing users are not simply opening more accounts for other purposes.\n\nIn addition, while the number of unique addresses in use is up 29% (Slide 8), the State of Bitcoin also indicates that the majority of Q1\'s bitcoins were spent in trades, not transactions (Slide 15).\n\nBlockchain data even suggests that USD exchange volume outnumbered transaction volume nearly every day this year.\n\nBitcoin startups have better luck in America\n\n22 nations around the globe are now home to a VC-backed bitcoin startup. However, your best bet raising funding is still in North America – Silicon Valley, to be precise.\n\nThis quarter the US and Canada received 73% of all bitcoin funding (a figured that includes Coinbase and 21 Inc’s mammoth rounds). However, the 103 startups in Silicon Valley saw their share of all-time bitcoin funding rise from 45% to 59%.\n\nThey also scored 87% of the quarter\'s funding – despite the fact they only made up 29% of total bitcoin startups around the world.\n\nFunding for US bitcoin companies is nearing the $500m mark, while its next competitor, the UK, is yet to reach $100m. At the bottom of the table for Q1 was Africa, with $1.1m invested in one startup, remittance platform BitPesa.\n\nNo one knows what bitcoin\'s biggest startup does\n\n21 Inc rocketed into the spotlight this March with news of its $116m raise – a figure that made it the most well-capitalized bitcoin startup to date.\n\nBut what exactly does this startup do?\n\nWhile we know it has its roots in mining, having raised $5m to attack this sector in 2013, how the project has evolved since then is less clear.\n\nBesides its all-star backers and cryptic job postings, as with bitcoin itself, what will be revealed in the future is anyone\'s guess.\n\nImages via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Inna couldn’t open any of them.', 'The growing popularity of Bitcoin as a powerful transaction tool and its ability to bank the unbanked has finally started making enough noise to wake up the traditional banking giants. Banks and financial services companies have been enjoying monopoly over the “money-moving” business for a long time, since its inception. Their only competition so far has been other companies delivering similar services. Not anymore, as the impact of Bitcoin on the banking sector is now being openly acknowledged by Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase in his recent letter to shareholders.\n\nBanking the Unbanked\n\nIn the letter, while discussing the strategy and outlook, Jamie has outlined the challenges posed by Bitcoin along with startups working on banking alternatives, merchants developing their own networks, PayPal and services similar to PayPal to traditional banking business. It is not possible for traditional banks like JPMorgan Chase to provide real-time payment processing and there is a cost involved in moving money through traditional banking systems. Newer technologies like digital wallets and Bitcoin protocol have an inherent advantage over these things. With bitcoin, transactions happen in real-time and money can be transferred to anywhere in the world within minutes. In addition, the cost of transactions over the Bitcoin network is negligible in comparison to traditional options.\n\nThe Banking Industry’s Worst Nightmare\n\nWhile Jamie expresses his annoyance and pledges to fight the odds to stay on top of the competition, the message of this letter clearly showcases the banking industry’s fears. He had expressed his concerns over the emergence of new age alternatives to the investors over a year ago, since then the threat has grown in size, causing panic in the banking sector. In order to stay in business, banks will have to innovate fast and push the countries to adopt digital currency. In this fight between David (Bitcoin services) and the Goliath (Traditional Banking), we have to see who will emerge victorious.', 'Imagine a world where the currency is not made more and more worthless every day by a private company and a government out of control. Imagine a place where private ownership is respected, above all else, by citizens as well as by the government itself. Imagine a land where your digital currency is not regulated out of existence, or double-taxed to fund the coffers, but is indeed the currency of choice. If you long for such a place of such simple, honest values, welcome to Liberland, a haven for your digitally-encrypted, libertarian dreams\n\nWhat is Liberland?\n\nLiberland is a remarkably small country, all of seven square kilometers, making it the third smallest country on Earth (after Monaco and The Vatican). It lies nestled on the Danube River on an unclaimed parcel of land between Croatia and Serbia. And it is exactly five days old, as of this writing, so it may not have an impressive heritage, but it sure has loads of potential, based on the declarations of their founders in an official statement this week:\n\n“The objective of the founders of the new state is to build a country where honest people can prosper without being oppressed by governments making their lives unpleasant through the burden of unnecessary restrictions and taxes.”\n\nAlso read: Reactivate Launceston, Australia, with a New Bitcoin Economy\n\nGiven the fact that the country is only a few days old, it lacks a few of the frills we’ve come to expect from what passes for normal statist governance. No working post office, or even a place to receive “snail mail” (they do have an email address). Yes to a Twitter and Facebook account. No to an airport or national military force. As for the citizenry, they do have four strict requirements for the people to meet before being granted legal entry:\n\nHave respect for other people and respect the opinions of others, regardless of their race, ethnicity, orientation, or religion\n\nHave respect for private ownership that is untouchable\n\nDo not have communist, nazi or another extremist past\n\nYou were not punished for past criminal offenses\n\nSounds fair enough. Registration and application for the new country are going just swimmingly, as over 20,000 people have already applied, with over 100,000 expected overall by week’s end. They only have seven volunteers, so processing is only promised “in due time.” Only three to five thousand will be granted citizenship in the near future, and a similar constituency to Liechtenstein (country of about 35,000 people) is expected. And don’t expect a private printing press of fiat currency to bury the nation in debt to the banking cartels, oh no. Bitcoin and other decentralized digital currencies will be the money of the land.\n\n“We have been dissatisfied with our government. It takes money out of people’s pockets and sends it to rich oligarchs through the system of subsidies. Elections cannot change this because the media are now under the control of the oligarchs. So we decided we want out. We decided to start a country of our own in Terra Nulius.

And many – if not most – Popcorn Time users have never heard of Bittorrent.\n\nSound like a predecessor for Bitcoin's killer app? Swap out a few words and see:\n\n“Fill-in-the-blank-Bitcoin-app has exploded over the last year as a free and likely illegal alternative to state-sanctioned banking, with no fees, more payment options, and in some cases built-in merchant discounts.”\n\nPeer-to-Peer Brings the Fear\n\nThe evolutions of Bittorrent and Bitcoin closely mirror one another.\n\nBittorrent was launched in 2001. Over the years, it's weathered tiresome attacks by Hollywood's political wing, the MPAA – attacks that were pushed all the way to the ISP level. Internet service providers began attempting to throttle torrent traffic, largely in response to legal threats from the MPAA. End users were even “fined.”\n\nThe company that maintains the Bittorrent protocol, Bittorrent, Inc., went so far as signing a legal document with the MPAA. They essentially agreed to demolish the content search engine of their own website (though people were already using better alternatives).\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, was launched in 2009. At one point, the most popular bitcoin wallet in the world – Blockchain.info – was suddenly removed from Apple's app store. People who simply sold their bitcoins for dollars started getting kidnapped and caged by U.S. police. Brilliant young crypto entrepreneurs started fleeing the U.S. after businessman Charlie Shrem was attacked by government workers as a criminal.\n\nThe Waiting Is the Hardest Part\n\nFrom 2001 to 2013, the primary users of Bittorrent were tech-savvy. They knew about VPNs, hash checks, The Pirate Bay, and how to be a good seeder. They frequented sites plastered with weird porn advertisements and pop-ups. In other words, they were not a mainstream group.\n\nBut in 2014, Bittorrent got its killer app: Popcorn Time. Torrenting finally hit the mainstream, and most Popcorn Time users still don't know how the app works (much less the protocol that underlies it). They only know one thing: they don't have to use Netflix anymore.\n\nThis is crucial, because Netflix sucks, and so does fiat. The difference is that many people already know that Netflix sucks, while they've yet to verbalize the same judgment for fiat. But they will.\n\nAnd Bitcoin's killer app may take just as long as Bittorrent's did – 12 years – or perhaps longer. Because Bitcoin isn't just going up against greedy, lawsuit-happy Hollywood Luddites. It's going up against the very idea – a long-held idea – that some people are allowed to create money, while others are not.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

With this newfound freedom, we want to exercise our rights to make Paycoin the people’s money and do what is necessary to help the coin thrive,” the Paycoin Foundation wrote on its site.\n\nIn an open dialogue, many of the parties to be a part of Paycoin going forward—save for Josh Garza—talked about what their goals are for Paycoin and what’s going to happen to the current environment.\n\n“By the sounds of it, all three nonprofit organizations are working together to look at the original documents, both published and unpublished, regarding the structure of the coin to see if a rebranding is necessary,” said Jonah, a manager, in a video posted online.\n\n“From my seat, and the reason why we’re here, is to truly make it a community-driven project. That’s why I got involved in the beginning. I was like, hey, one entity was going to launch this thing, how was it ever going to become a decentralized currency. That’s really what this whole thing is; it’s about decentralization, not centralization,” said Adam Matlack, president and chairman of Paycoin Foundation, in the same video.\n\nBut Where is GAW?\n\n“We have advised that this call not happen to give us an opportunity to speak with each party in private so we can figure out a compromise and solution,” said Josh Garza, CEO of GAW, posting under the name MrCEO.\n\nWhile the details of the agreement are unknown, posts on the Hashtalk forum indicate that GAW agreed to give Paycoin to this consortium as long as certain rules were kept in place.\n\n“The Paycoin foundation was gifted the controllers with the agreement that the whitepaper would be delivered on. They have breached that agreement with this, and will force the investment group that came in at the beginning to bring legal action against them,” said Garza in another thread.\n\nHowever, this consortium doesn’t appear to have much concern pertaining to the potential lawsuit. Multiple times, parties in the conversation agreed that they were looking to go forward, not in reverse.\n\n“I would say that we are aware of some of the things that have been said, but honestly, but from our position, there is legal documentation in place that clarifies this issue,” said Adam Matlack in a video interview.\n\nThis jockeying back and forth clearly has many in the community concerned. Members continue to post, talking about how people’s money is at stake and how the two parties need to figure out what to do going forward.\n\nThis schism in the community is especially worrisome for Paycoin investors, as each faction holds exactly 50 percent of the Prime Controllers, which govern Paycoin’s codebase. This means that Paycoin could have two incompatible blockchains: one controlled entirely by GAW that is currently compatible with exchanges and one that is supported by the consortium and referred to as “Paycoin 2.0.”\n\nPaycoin 2.0 does not have exchange support at this time, so users currently have no options to buy or sell the coin.\n\nWhere to Go From Here\n\nNow that the consortium has control, there are many steps the parties are looking to take in an attempt to continue keeping Paycoin going.\n\n“What’s being looked at is how to actually implement all the technology that does and does not exist involved with the coin and developing the coin to that original spec to make Paycoin what it was designed to be,” said Jonah.\n\nAnd more importantly, according to Matlack, the whitepaper doesn’t accurately reflect the technicalities of Paycoin.\n\n“At the end of the day, the whitepaper was a marketing document. And we need to get to a place that it is actually a cryptographic document and we actually implement those things. We can’t implement words into a code base. We need actual code,” said Matlack (emphasis added).\n\n“However, a lot of what was initially built by the primary coin development team were specs that were not completed,” said Jonah.\n\nBut on top of that, according to GAW employee Matthew Eden, team members knew there was no way that GAW could guarantee a base $20/XPY that was promised to investors. Eden, the ex-Interim CTO, Interim Chief Information Security Officer, Interim IT Manager, and Director of QA at GAW gave an interview to Bits of News.\n\n“The initial plan for XPY was that it would never be traded on an exchange. Many people made it known that if the coin hit an exchange they would never hold a $20 price floor. Making the only people who had it the users who had been mining hash-points with their hashlets. The excess was going to be sold off on the websites (Paybase/Zencloud.) Once it hit the exchange, all plans were changed. Dumping it became the primary method of obtaining funds for the company,” Eden explained in the interview (emphasis added).\n\nZenCloud and PayBase Are Being Decommissioned\n\nIt gets worse, though. People who signed up for ZenCloud as what’s called “immortals” were promised consistent payouts. And as new members joined, those payouts became possible. However, now ZenCloud is being shut down.\n\n“ZenCloud has been transitioned out to a third-party company that will be managing it and PayBase through end of life,” said Eden in the video. “PayBase will be operational until at the end of the month, and ZenCloud will be operational until the last immortal hash staker has effectively expired,” said Matthew Eden, one of the developers of the Paycoin Core Development Organization.\n\nDespite the fact these members were called immortals and believed themselves to have the potential to generate payouts, that doesn’t appear to be the case. On top of that, the developers appear to have always understood that it couldn’t run forever despite promises to the contrary.\n\n“ZenCloud cannot be run forever,” said Eden. “It cannot continue to sit there and manage payouts. If you haven’t activated your hashstaker, activate it. There will be a point in time when we will probably actively turn them on for you if you don’t activate it because we can’t leave the system on forever.”\n\nUsers paid for lifetime Bitcoin miners and are instead being given Paycoin miners that are essentially worthless.\n\nIs GAW Doomed?\n\n“Very few employees still work at GAW Miners. One support rep is left, and there is Josh. His in-laws still work there, I believe,” said Eden in the interview. He explained that his reason for leaving was “the realization that GAW Miners LLC had not honored the requirements of the Acquisition Agreement and merger documents that were part of the LeaseRig.net / GAW merger and also ethical reasons.”\n\nThe interview ended with Eden giving his most poignant description of Garza when talking about the transition of Paycoin.\n\n“You mean the lack of foresight?” Eden asked. “I’d say it was pretty much in line with his past actions. He doesn’t really think things through all the way before acting.”\n\nBetween the lawsuit from the power company, the potential investigation by the SEC, the implosion of Paycoin, and employees leaving the company, GAW’s future is uncertain.\n\n“I’d say he [Garza] had moved on,” Eden said in the interview. “And then came back to move more of the intellectual property over to off-shore corporations.”', 'In a world where we are all going digital more and more every day, for shopping, entertainment, and now finance with Bitcoin, the law is looking to combat new digital criminals every day. Just like with the Internet over twenty years ago, criminals usually get the jump on the law through new, innovative technologies before they go mainstream. Sometimes, it can take a decade for the authorities to catch up. Now, with the latest technologies at their fingertips, the long arm of the law is looking to cut down that learning curve, starting in Singapore.\n\nInterpol Global Complex for Innovation\n\nWelcome to the new Interpol Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI) in Singapore, a state-of-the-art anti-crime facility designed from the onset to train its people to collar today’s digital criminal. The complex, newly operation this week, houses the International police’s first digital crime centre and the latest cybercrime research and development facilities.\n\nAt this week’s biennial security trade event, Interpol World, held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, IGCI director of cyber innovation and outreach Madan Mohan Oberoi spoke about the progress already made at IGCI. With over thirty officers, including men from the Singapore Police Force, they have been developing in-house forensic tools. IGCI has even gone so far as to create its own crypto-currency, in order to better understand and combat cyber crimes involving virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin. The agency uses their own digital currency in a specially designed simulation-based training game to create scenarios where crypto-currency can be used for good and evil.\n\n“It’s a virtual world that we have created, and personnel can come and operate these things and learn by operating them,” said Dr Oberoi, a former inspector-general of police with India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, told The Straits Times. “We felt that these things if you try to teach people from a policing background through PowerPoint presentations, it doesn’t make too much sense. Let them play around and learn more.”\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Free From Government Interference in Singapore\n\nIGCI has also identified weaknesses in the market’s digital currencies that can be used for many forms of computer mischief, like mass posting of malware. Oberoi’s team supervised the development of a tracking device that could help find the users of such devices. Cryptocurrencies are changing so fast with newer applications all the time; new challenges emerge as they become more widely used. The search and seizure of virtual currencies, securing them, and actually presenting them in court are some of the ideas IGCI is currently working on.\n\nHere’s another example of the influence and velocity of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Nations are seeing a new technology as a threat and are redesigning their law enforcement around it’s advanced capabilities and criminal potential.

If this really happens, then it would write history since Liberland would become the first country to conduct everyday transactions in bitcoin.', ""In August 2014, the Ethereum team held a crowdsale of their blockchain's “crypto fuel,” Ether, and received US$18 million in bitcoins in return. Buyers were told they could expect the network's first launch sometime in late 2014 or early 2015.\n\nWith eight months gone by since that crowdsale, some have begun to wonder: was Ethereum just vaporware?\n\nBut a glance at the Ethereum Github page (which was last updated only three hours ago) or a scan of the Ethereum blogroll (which is chock-full of regular and detailed updates) would suggest non-vaporware status.\n\nVinay Gupta is Ethereum's release coordinator. In a blog post entitled “The Ethereum Launch Process,” he says that the team is just not concerned with deadlines, writing:\n\n“Because the network is valuable, and the network is only as secure as the software we provide, this is going to be a security-led not schedule-led process.”\n\nThough the team seems to feel that they're far enough along in the “security-led” process to have modulated, named, and described each release stage.\n\nFrontier - The first stage will be usable through a computer's command-line only. It will allow mining at 10 % the normal rate, and contracts will be uploadable and executable. This is basically the time that people can begin to experiment with uploading their own DApps (decentralized applications) onto the network. Periodic “checkpoints” will also be performed by the Ethereum team to check network accuracy, causing a 12 hour latency period each day. Homestead - At this point, mining will be bumped up to 100 % the normal rate. Checkpoints may or may not be removed. Operation will still be in the command-line only. Metropolis – The third stage is when the user interfaces come out, including a DApp store, and non-technical users should feel comfortable joining at this point. Serenity – The fourth stage is where things are going to get fancy: the network is going to change its mining process from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. Gupta writes:\n\n“Switching the network from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake is going to require a substantial switch, a transition process potentially much like the one between Frontier and Homestead. […] Proof-of-Work is a brutal waste of computing power.”\n\nThe Ethereum team is also actively seeking paid input from outside programmers, both for bug bounties and through an incentive program called DEVGrants.\n\nSo Ethereum isn't vaporware. But for the crowdsale investors, that probably doesn't make the waiting any easier.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

04/19/2015,"['Mt Gox\'s missing bitcoins were stolen from the exchange over a period of time beginning in 2011, according to a new report released today by a group investigating its collapse.\n\nThey were gone long before the company\'s collapse in February 2014, the report said. Gox had therefore been operating on a fractional reserve basis for most of that time, either knowingly or unknowingly.\n\nThe stolen bitcoins had been withdrawn and sold off on various exchanges including Mt Gox itself, and given the timing probably at prices far below the 2013-14 highs.\n\nTokyo-based bitcoin security firm WizSec, which produced today\'s update and a previous one in February, has been conducting an unofficial investigation into Mt Gox\'s collapse based on data pieced together from various leaks, hacks and other sources.\n\nBankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi and his police team have still not made all transaction data available, including a list of all the bitcoin addresses Mt Gox used.\n\nWizSec\'s report says its team has assembled a list of over 2m bitcoin addresses related to Mt Gox by comparing leaked data with blockchain records and performing clustering analysis on addresses used at similar times.\n\nHuge discrepancy\n\nThe resulting chart shows a dramatic difference between the number of bitcoins Mt Gox should have held, and what it actually held.\n\nThe company held little or no more than 100,000 BTC from May 2013 onward. Interestingly, neither the ideal nor actual totals includes the 200,000 BTC \'found\' in cold storage after the collapse.\n\nOne key question (until now) has been whether Mt Gox\'s bitcoins were stolen or whether they ever existed at all, and records of their deposit faked.\n\nReport author Kim Nilsson notes that the coins did in fact leave Mt Gox, meaning they definitely were deposited there at some point.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, he said the WizSec team was ""happy to finally have this breakthrough out in the public"", but noted that there is still a lot of investigative work to be done by those with access to more complete data.\n\nHow many bitcoins did Gox have?\n\nAfter a prior security breach in mid-2011, CEO Mark Karpeles performed a transaction proving the company controlled at least 424,242.42424242 BTC.\n\nUsing that figure as a baseline, Nilsson measured changes in total BTC held since that day, arriving at 950,000 BTC on the day of Gox\'s collapse in February 2014.\n\nThis matched total holdings stated elsewhere in leaked data, he wrote.\n\nNot Willy\n\nOne surprising revelation from the latest report is that the bitcoins likely disappeared long before the appearance of Mt Gox\'s infamous trading bot, nicknamed ""Willy"".\n\nSpeculation surrounding Gox\'s dying days in 2013-14 had implied Willy was related somehow to the theft, though WizSec\'s report says that is no longer considered possible.\n\nThe bot may, however, have existed to convert the missing bitcoins into missing fiat currency amounts instead.\n\n""The possibility exists that this kind of manipulation may have been the main purpose behind Willy as a way of coping with the practical problems caused by such a massive bitcoin shortage. This is left for later investigations to clarify.""\n\nCold storage not monitored\n\nThat nearly all Mt Gox\'s bitcoins disappeared raises several questions about the nature of its cold storage system. How \'cold\' was it?\n\nThe company was known to keep paper wallets stored under lock and key, which it added to and subtracted from as required. The cold storage system was also reportedly not monitored with any degree of scrutiny, meaning the thief was free to either compromise them or wait for the funds to be moved to a \'hot\' wallet.\n\n""A reminder to all bitcoin businesses out there: Always.

Bitcoin is here to stay.""\n\nBitcoin, his talk suggested, is on a similar trajectory, regardless of any issues facing the network.\n\nSrinivasan went as far as to predict that society is fast moving toward a future where everyone can transmit value as easily as information, meaning anyone with an Internet connection will by extension be connected to the financial system.\n\n""Bitcoin is like tulips,"" he said. ""They\'re like tulips you can send anywhere in the world in arbitrary quantities.""\n\n\'Here to stay\'\n\nOverall, the presentation seemed designed to impart the impression that the bitcoin network is growing at an unstoppable pace, with Srinivasan rifling through a series of topics and talking points that seldom lingered for close inspection.\n\nSrinivasan suggested that bitcoin is now moving to a stage of institutional acceptance, noting his belief that organisations are reaching the point where they need to adopt bitcoin strategies due the momentum of adoption and the fact that ""VC investment [is] perhaps poised to break $1bn this year"".\n\nSrinivasan suggested he believes bitcoin will prevail over models in the existing financial system because of its open-source model, using examples from the early Internet to support his view.\n\n""Bitcoin is to PayPal as Linux is to Windows. It is open-source, decentralized and programmable. We went from landline to IP addresses. We\'re going from personal bank accounts to machine bitcoin wallets,"" he said.\n\nThis portion of the talk included time spent attacking what he characterized as one of the ecosystem\'s most common ""memes"", that there can be blockchains without bitcoin, or distributed open ledgers without a token that incentivizes use.\n\n""One way to understand mining is that in return for doing transactions you get to add a direct deposit to yourself,"" Srinivasan said. ""For a blockchain to exist, that token introduction needs to be there at least under the paradigm that we had.""\n\nShould such a system be capable of existing, he said, it hasn\'t been discovered.\n\n""We think it\'s going to be bitcoin or nothing at the present time,"" he added.\n\n\'Bigger than Google\'\n\nOne of the more oft repeated talking points was Srinivasan\'s assertion that ""bitcoin is bigger than Google"" in terms of its network footprint, a point that dominated the early part of the presentation.\n\n""All of Google today would represent less than 1% of mining. The sheer degree of what is happening in mining hasn\'t been appreciated in the press,"" Srinivasan said in one of many suggestions that 21 Inc may still be focused on transaction processing as rumored around the time of its original 2013 fundraising.\n\nSrinivasan went on to make the assertion that, based on estimates from last publicly available data, the bitcoin mining network is now bigger than Google in terms of computing power and power consumption.\n\n""If we assume there are 10 million Google servers and each of these servers is running. You can multiply that through and you get about one petahash. If they turned off all their data centers and pointed them at bitcoin, they\'d be less than 1% of the network,"" he continued.\n\nSrinivasan encouraged the audience to think of bitcoin as the world\'s ""largest supercomputer"", one that he inferred perhaps needed to be tapped for opportunities, if only for its sheer size.\n\n""Many metrics are up across the board. There\'s now more than five million wallets, long-term transactions are up. There is a roadmap for scalability. It is likely we\'ll be able to handle more than seven transactions per second,"" he said.\n\nInevitable solutions\n\nConsistent throughout the talk was Srinivasan\'s implication that problems with the bitcoin network will be solvable due to the distributed nature and collaborative development that is occurring globally.\n\n""Bitcoin is open source. Ten-minute confirmation times can be changed,"" he said.\n\nSrinivasan dismissed the idea of a 51% attack, whereby malicious miners take control of or otherwise corrupt the ledger, as ""overblown"", suggesting that technical solutions have already been proposed.\n\nLegal issues were also dismissed via the notion that ""the technology as a whole can\'t be banned"".\n\n""Are there legal issues? I think that was a reasonable concern in 2013, [but] I don\'t think that\'s a reasonable thing today,"" Srinivasan said.\n\nHe further characterized the US government\'s sale of confiscated bitcoin at auction as ""implicit sanction"" and a sign of institutional acceptance.\n\n""A lot of people thought there was going to be a crackdown on bitcoin. Now, neutral to positive things are being said. Since the [US Senate] hearings in late 2013, there\'s been a real turn around,"" he continued.\n\nPrice problems\n\nDespite the presentation\'s focus on issues of network health and infrastructure development, the talk ended by addressing what Srinivasan categorized as the biggest issue facing bitcoin, the sagging value of the currency itself.\n\nPart of this issue, he contends, will be solved by the network\'s own built-in incentivization process whereby miners are rewarded with bitcoin for processing transactions.\n\nStill, Srinivasan suggested that there was work that could be done to increase the price further, suggesting that bitcoin\'s value will stabilize when the network begins to integrate a new third key party beyond consumers and merchants – vendors.\n\n""If you\'re giving bitcoin and getting back dollars, this is not good for the price,"" he continued. ""If you have closed loops, you have something where you\'re getting value out of bitcoin without selling it.""\n\nTo further stress the point, Srinivasan evoked the phrase ""buidl, not hodl"" (sic), an expression he suggested was meant to equate holding value in bitcoin as an action that was not purely speculative, but rather, beneficial for the network.\n\nFittingly, Srinivasan\'s talk ended with perhaps the most direct assertion as to what the company is currently developing, concluding:\n\n""This is the most important question of bitcoin, can we build those closed loops.""\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article indicated Balaji Srinivasan was CEO of 21 Inc, a position held by Matt Pauker.\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It uses a phone’s trusted execution environment (TEE), which is a secure operating system (OS) running on an enclave of the application processor, directly inside the smartphone, to store the private keys and generate signatures.\n\nWith new discoveries and technologies, Bitcoin is not only becoming more user-friendly, but it is also becoming more secure to use. Mobile apps such as Mycelium and Blockchain strive to change people’s mindset about bitcoin, from a technical and difficult-to-use service, to a more easy-to-use one that requires few clicks to transact. Although usability and simplicity in bitcoin are necessary, concerns over security of hot wallets, such as those kept on mobile phones, still exist.\n\nSince mobile phones are connected to the Internet and are used for different purposes, their operating system is not designed to be super secure. It cannot handle possible attacks on a wallet over the Internet’s network. Hence, due to security risks, generally having a large amount of bitcoin on a mobile phone is not recommended.\n\nTEE is a secure, isolated environment in the main processor of the smartphone that guarantees secure and protected execution of the codes. TEE provides higher security levels than a rich mobile OS, since it creates an isolated environment and is never updated automatically. Additionally, neither Google nor anyone else can snatch the keys using baseband or superuser Play Store permissions.\n\nLedger has been working on this promising secure wallet on smart phones for a while. The video from Eric Larcheveque, the CEO of ledger, explains how LedgerOS TEE integrates with GreenBits. The user interface is neither neat, nor sleek, but they are working on it.\n\nFor now its lack of usability, coupled with a poor design may let its users down. The technology itself, due to its high security nature, might not be so user-friendly. Consequently, it may not be so appealing to users, but we will see how the final released version looks.\n\nAccording to the ledger team, LedgerOS is the world’s first real-life application running on a trusted execution environment. Most mobile apps run on a phone’s rich OS, which can be found on Android, iOS, Windows Phones, etc.\n\nTEE, however, offers higher protection, with functionalities and features that enable software to run concurrently with the rich OS. Another secure area on the phone is called secure element (SE). It is composed of software and tamper-resistant hardware. It allows high levels of security and can even work in tandem with the TEE. SE offers few features and functionalities for dealing with bitcoins, but it can be considered in future implementations for an even higher security.\n\nTEE in mobile phones offers a quite secure environment that can be used parallel with current bitcoin services to store and sign transactions. With the right implementation, it could assure an equilibrium between security and usability in bitcoin wallet services. Depending on one’s use of bitcoin, even hardware wallets in some cases could be replaced with such technologies in the near future.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The founding post of /r/rBitcoin reads that it was created due to the “overwhelming presence of trolls” in its predecessor. It further states:\n\n“It got to the point that some topics were more troll controlled than not. In fact it became so blatant that they were basically joking about the fact they had total control of the forum, including moderators. Here we can sit back, relax, and have some real discussions.”\n\n/r/rBitcoin\'s sidebar explicitly states that merely having a different viewpoint from the writer of a post does not count as trolling. To mark yourself a troll, you must be making “personal attacks, causing cognitive stress, and making fallacies.” Users who prove themselves trolls will be banned from the subreddit immediately.\n\nBut /r/rBitcoin\'s differences from the primary Bitcoin subreddit don\'t stop at troll banning. A trending quote from a pseudonymous BitcoinTalk user is placed prominently on its sidebar:\n\n“Inviting regulation when there was an opportunity for gaining the moral high-ground through legitimate civilian disobedience against the prevalent government push towards ubiquitous financial surveillance is a major error and missed opportunity.""\n\nBitcoin users who prefer the “moral high-ground” of financial privacy – as opposed to the surveillance that comes with state regulation – may have found their new favorite subreddit.\n\nAnd lest anyone forget that incentives matter, /r/rBitcoin also gives 1,000 bit tips both for making “insightful comments” and for becoming a new subscriber.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

This area along the west bank of the Danube river is not claimed by Croatia, Serbia or any other country. It was therefore terra nullius, a no man’s land, until Vít Jedli?ka seized the opportunity and on 13 April 2015 formed a new state in this territory. Vit Jedlicka, settled the country on this territory and has established Bitcoin as the national currency.\n\nThe state already has its own national flag, coat of arms, and official website and Wikipedia page. The new government form of Liberland will be a republican type of direct democracy where all the citizens have a direct participation and are allowed to propose new rules to be voted by the community.\n\nIt is not the first time Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency has become the official currency of a separate territory. For example, it has already happened in Lonseston, Australia. Lonseston planned to build the world’s largest local Bitcoin-based economy in the city, with support from local businesses and even government. The project team and supporters thought that Launceston would make a good high-density testing ground for Bitcoin.\n\nThe official acceptance of Bitcoin will not only allow the new country to avoid spending money on launching of state typography, but will also will prevent a lot of funds being spent in designing and producing the banknotes and protection means.\n\nEven if Liberland does not come to succeed, it will most certainly deliver a major contribution to the practical understanding of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Besides this, and in case it succeeds, the new European country will surely become the holy ground for Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nAll interested in becoming Liberland citizens can visit the country’s homepage to retrieve the requested information.\n\nLink to Source\n\nImage Source: 1, 2', 'QuadrigaCX, the current largest bitcoin exchange in Canada has announced their plans to install two-way bitcoin ATMs developed by BitXatm in major cities throughout Canada, including Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.\n\nThe company has completed an extensive research on all BTM (bitcoin ATMs) manufacturers in Canada. The CEO of QuadrigaCX, Gerald Cotton, stated:\n\n“We’ve done our research. We know the owners of every major bitcoin ATM company. We have used many of them and spoken to previous owners. We have conducted extensive due diligence and feel as though our track record with regard to bitcoin ATM distribution across Canada will allow us to continue to provide a superior service.”\n\nMr. Cotten said that the BTMs of BitXatm are the most efficient, reliable and user-friendly bitcoin ATMs currently available on the market. He also highlighted the significance of the 17-inch touch screen and the multiple-layered security system of the machine.\n\nApart from the advantages in the user interface, the bitcoin ATM of BitXatm accepts payments in any cryptocurrency and any fiat currency. Since the BTMs will be installed in the centers of major cities, tourists will greatly benefit from these features, as they wouldn’t need to convert cash to Canadian dollars before purchasing the bitcoin through the BTMs.\n\nThe Failure of Cavirtex and the Solution of QuadrigaCX\n\nQuadrigaCX clearly states that over-complicated bitcoin ATMs with unnecessary features are irrelevant, and explains that this was one of the major factors in the failure and the inevitable bankruptcy of the country’s former largest bitcoin exchange, Cavirtex.\n\nCavitex, the largest bitcoin exchange in 2014, attempted the same project with a different approach. The bitcoin exchange partnered with BitAccess to install paper-wallet generating and multicurrency BTMs in popular tourist spots in Canada, such as Niagara Falls. They also partnered with Gateway Newstands to install the BTMs in franchise stores. However, the BTMs of BitAccess were removed after a few months, and the BTMs were all sold at a substantially low value.\n\nAccording to Cotton, QuadrigaCX understands the reasons and the factors that led Cavirtex to fail, and they know exactly how to maintain the services of BTMs in major cities of Canada in the future. QuadrigaCX, the world’s first publicly traded exchange, has plans to install the BTMs of BitXatm in batches of five in major cities in Canada to first test the machines’ operations and efficiency.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Users can self-publish anything they'd like, and they — only they — have complete control of how their works are published.”\n\nAlthough Alexandria is promoted as a library, it should be noted that the Alexandria software does not technically store any media itself. Instead, it uses blockchain technology to store and distribute magnet links, which in turn link to the popular peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol BitTorrent. As such, Alexandria is perhaps better understood as a decentralized version of torrent sites like The Piratebay, but with several additional features, such as streaming functionality and built-in payment options.\n\nThe main advantage of Alexandria over regular torrent sites, of course, is the absence of central servers, which means that the service cannot be shut down or blocked — as has happened with various torrent sites over and over again. As long as someone is mining Florincoin, Alexandria will continue to exist.\n\nRead said:\n\n“The goal here was basically to give everyone on the planet the right to free speech. Not by passing laws which can be repealed, watered down or just ignored, but by baking it into the Internet itself. With Alexandria, a citizen can share cell-phone video of police brutality, a whistle-blower can release evidence of corruption, a wiz kid can share her innovative idea for a solution to global warming, a war widow in Syria can share her independent documentary about life in a warzone and use its proceeds to help rebuild her village, and Cody Wilson can share his 3D printable fire arms, and no one can censor them.”\n\nAdditionally, Alexandria attempts to replace the dominant ad model many content creators on the Internet have come to rely on, with various forms of direct payments from the audience. Currently Alexandria offers optional tips and a “pay-what-you-want wall” as the two options, but the team plans to implement several other choices in the future, such as micro subscriptions and an innovative peer-to-peer digital rights mechanism for purchases.\n\nRead explained:\n\n“I personally hate web advertisements, and they really aren’t very effective. Artists make US$1 or less from every 1000 streams of their content these days. We think that direct micro tipping and other cryptocurrency-based payment options can provide a lot more value to artists, and a better experience to audiences.”\n\nWhile most types of payments in Alexandria can be done with bitcoin, the actual software is built on top of Florincoin, an altcoin that was launched in 2013. Florincoin resembles Bitcoin, and especially Litecoin, in many ways, but this alternative cryptocurrency distinguishes itself through the ability to attach 528 bytes of information to each transaction. Alexandria uses this option to store magnet links, as well as additional data on the Florincoin blockchain. This means that content uploaders need to own some florincoin in order to pay for the mining fees, which can be bought with bitcoin inside of the Alexandria app itself.\n\nRead does leave the option to move Alexandria to another blockchain open, however:\n\n“At this moment in time, it makes the most sense for us to use Florincoin as our database layer, and I do expect that this will continue to be the best solution for Alexandria for the long run. But if it becomes obvious that side chains or Ethereum or something else proposes a better solution, we are open to changing our plan.”\n\nThe development of Alexandria is currently in its alpha stage. The Blocktech team hopes to be able to raise US$36,000 with a crowdfunding effort in order to complete a private beta in six weeks time, and wants to raise an additional US$42,000 to release an open-source public beta six weeks later. Additionally, the team released a development plan to lay out the features that additional funds would go toward.\n\nDonation addresses can be found on Blocktech's website.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

SatoshiTango (ST) is one of Argentina’s most popular digital currency marketplaces. In the early days, the exchange allowed consumers to obtain bitcoin via prepaid cards that were redeemable on their platform. Since then, ST has expanded its payment option offering to include several funding methods (e.g. PagoFacil, RapiPago, BaproPagos).\n\n“You can now buy and sell bitcoins with Argentine pesos, safely and easily.” – satoshitango.com\n\nMatías Bari, CEO of SatoshiTango, took a keen interest in digital currencies in early 2013. He was so impressed with the concept of cryptographic digital money, that he and a close friend decided to launch their own cryptocurrency exchange. Running a bitcoin exchange in Argentina’s battered economy is not for the faint of heart. Frustration and technical obstacles, were just a few of the issues Bari had to deal with in his quest to build a fully functioning and secure platform.\n\nArgentina, like many other countries, does not currently have any explicit rules/legislation regarding digital currencies. Such an environment has created very favorable conditions for bitcoin-related ventures such as SatoshiTango, but that will not last forever. Bari understand this fact, but is hopeful the authorities in Argentina will see bitcoin as a job-creator and an economic stimulant, rather than as a threat that must be squashed.\n\nGoing mainstream\n\nBari also sees great potential in bitcoin in the remittance market. Clients of SatoshiTango have the option of sending international cash transfers via Coinnect, a payment network that uses Bitcoin’s blockchain to transfer value. Coinnect essentially gives ordinary folk a cheap and quick way to send cash without needing any understanding of bitcoin technology. The Coinnect system is currently operated by SatoshiTango and Volabit, a Mexican bitcoin exchange. SatoshiTango has big plans for expanding the Connect network to other countries in Europe and Asia.\n\nDespite the rapid growth of bitcoin use and awareness in Argentina, the majority of the population is still in the dark about the benefits of digital currencies. However, Argentinians harbour a very skeptical attitude towards the established financial system, following the numerous currency crises the country has had to endure over the past several decades. This inherent distrust of the legacy financial system is what Matías Bari believes will propel bitcoin into a mainstream phenomena in Argentina.\n\nSatoshiTango is currently one of the top bitcoin exchanges in Argentina by volume, and Matías Bari has big plans for the addition of many other services that will place his exchange at the forefront of Argentina’s ballooning digital currency economy.', 'If you have been following us closely, then you might have come across my previous article where I have mentioned the startups spearheading the Indian Bitcoin revolution. One among them is Unocoin. Unocoin, known among the Indian Bitcoin community as the Coinbase of India is a Bangalore based startup. We decided to take a trip to their office, where we met their whole team and spoke at length with Sunny Ray, the President and COO of Unocoin. We started the lively interview by taking some time off to explore Periscope, an application that Sunny Ray has recently fallen in love with and he made us love it too! Guess what, the interview was live on Periscope for the first few minutes and we had about 40 people from different parts of the world watching us. Once we were done exploring the application, we got down to business.\n\nNewsBTC: What made you get into Bitcoin?\n\nSunny Ray: It all started three years ago when I began asking questions about money and why people use gold etc. I came across Bitcoin on Twitter. As I understood more about Bitcoin, I became more obsessed with it.\n\nSoon I started organizing Bitcoin Meetups, starting with Bangalore while I was still working for a robotics company. I gradually realized that Bitcoin might be the solution to all humanity.\n\nNewsBTC: Your profile says that you were working with a Bitcoin related venture in Canada. Can you tell us a bit more about it?\n\nSunny Ray: I was working with ButterCoin; a Google Venture backed Bitcoin Company in Canada.\n\nNewsBTC: How did Unocoin Start?\n\nSunny Ray: Unocoin was a product of our regular meetups. While hosting these Bitcoin meetups, we decided to have a Bitcoin resource site where people can learn about Bitcoin. It started as a WordPress blog and gradually evolved into a trading platform.\n\nNewsBTC: How is the awareness about Bitcoin among the people who attend the Meetups?\n\nSunny Ray: Awareness about Bitcoin is slowly increasing among Indians. Many people attend our Bitcoin meetups, most of them come with the same set of questions regarding the security, volatility and legality of bitcoins. When it comes to fundamentals of Bitcoin, many find it hard to understand.\n\nNewsBTC: You were involved in Bitcoin mining during the early experimental days. Do you still do it?\n\nSunny Ray: We were mining bitcoins earlier, but not anymore. Even though we invested a lot of money and the returns weren’t profitable, we learnt a lot about Bitcoin, how it works etc. Unocoin is now focused on buying, using and accepting Bitcoin. We enable merchants with online Bitcoin payment collection.\n\nNewsBTC: When did you start Unocoin?\n\nSunny Ray: About a year and half into organizing meetups, Sathvik, the CEO came up with the plan. He started the project and I played a supporting role. We started making physical bitcoins, organizing Bitcoin conferences and a lot more until we discovered what makes sense in the long term. That’s how we zeroed in on the trading platform. He assumed the CEO’s position and developed the web platform. Mow we have 20 employees and over 12000 users. I am the COO and President at Unocoin.\n\nUnocoin has been around for about a year and 4 months.\n\nNewsBTC: What do you feel about the regulations regarding Bitcoin in India?\n\nSunny Ray: Bitcoin is not yet regulated in India. Reserve Bank of India has made it clear that it will wait and watch for now. In the wake of various scams and the absence of regulations, we started exploring ways to self-regulate. A law firm, Nishith Desai Associates has conducted an extensive techno-legal analysis of Bitcoin for over a period of two years. They have concluded that Bitcoin is not illegal in India, but what you do with bitcoins is a different issue altogether.\n\nWe at Unocoin have studied and adopted KYC and AML regulations from the banking and finance sectors into Bitcoin business. This will help us know whom we have onboard, we conduct document and telephone verification for all our customers. At Unocoin, we treat Bitcoin like real money. In the future, if there are any Bitcoin regulations, we will be prepared and in a position to set the ground for that.\n\nNewsBTC: How are the relations between Indian Bitcoin startups? Is it collaborative or competitive?\n\nSunny Ray: It is mixed. When it comes to regulations and the whole Bitcoin ecosystem, we collaborate and work with the government by educating them about Bitcoin. On the other hand, when it comes to user acquisition and other day-to-day operations, there is competition.\n\nFrankly, we don’t think much about competition among domestic Bitcoin businesses.

It is definitely not as easy as WhatsApp or other applications. Countries like the US have a faster adoption rate compared to India. But, it has started to pick up here too.

04/20/2015,"['Bitcoin claims that “It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen.” That lack of central authority is the primary reason governments are afraid of the cryptocurrency. To understand this fear, it is important to know a little bit about governments and conventional currencies.\n\nIn What Do We Trust?\n\nFiat is a term used to describe the conventional currencies that are issued by governments. Fiat currencies have value because governments say that they do. To an increasing number of people, that promise means nothing. After all, fiat currencies are not backed by any tangible assets. You can’t return the currency to the government in exchange for a bar of gold or silver, a can of beans, a pack of cigarettes, or any other items that might have value to you. Fiat currencies are backed by the full faith and credit of the government that issued them and nothing more. If you want gold, silver, beans, or smokes you need to exchange your fiat currency with a person or entity that possesses the item that you want.\n\nWhy Control Matters\n\nGovernments control fiat currencies. They use central banks to issue or destroy money out of thin air, using what is known as monetary policy to exert economic influence. They also dictate how fiat currencies can be transferred, enabling them to track currency movement, dictate who profits from that movement, collect taxes on it, and trace criminal activity. All of this control is lost when non-government bodies create their own currencies.\n\nControl over currency has many downstream impacts, perhaps most notably to a nation’s fiscal policy, business environment, and efforts to control crime. While each of these topics is broad and deep enough to fill volumes, a brief overview is enough to provide insight into the general concept.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nWhile the potential for crime captures the public’s attention, the role currency plays in a nation’s monetary policy has the potential to have a far greater impact. Since governments intentionally increase or restrict the amount of money circulating in an economy in an effort to stimulate investment and spending, generate jobs, or avoid out-of-control inflation and recession, control over currency is an enormous concern. It’s also an extraordinarily complex topic. (For a good primer on monetary policy see How The US Government Formulates Monetary Policy, A Look At Fiscal And Monetary Policy, How do central banks inject money into the economy?, The Federal Reserve: Introduction)\n\nBusiness\n\nBitcoin users don’t need the existing banking system. The currency is created in cyberspace, when so called ""miners"" use the power of their computers to solve complex algorithms that serve as verification for Bitcoin transactions. Their reward is payment with cyber currency, which is stored digitally and passed between buyers and sellers without the need for an intermediary. On a smaller scale, airlines reward miles function in a similar way, enabling travelers to purchase plane tickets, hotel rooms, and other items using airline miles as virtual currency.\n\nIf bitcoin or another cryptocurrency become widely adopted, the entire banking system could become irrelevant. While this may sound like a wonderful concept in light of the recent behavior of the banking industry, there are two sides to every story. Without banks, who will you call when your mortgage payment gets hacked? How will you earn interest on your savings? Who will provide assistance when a transfer of assets fails or a technical glitch occurs? While the financial crisis gave bankers an even worse reputation than they already had, there is something to be said for institutions that oversee timely, effective, and trustworthy asset transfers and their associated recordkeeping. There’s also the issue of the fees banks earn for the services they provide. Those fees generate a lot of revenue and a lot of jobs across the global banking industry. Without banks, those jobs disappear, as does the tax revenue those banks and their employees’ paychecks generate. Money transfer business would also disappear in a virtual world. Nobody needs Western Union or its competitors if everybody is using bitcoin.\n\nCrime\n\nSo much has been written about virtual currency and crime, that it is enough to recap the issue by stating that untraceable financial transactions facilitate crime. Drug trafficking, prostitution, terrorism, money laundering, tax evasion and other illegal and subversive activity all benefit from the ability to move money in untraceable ways. The now defunct Silk Road online drug market is a case in point. Its founder credits Bitcoin for its success.\n\nThe Other Side of the Bitcoin\n\nAside from headline-grabbing fact that virtual currencies can and are used to engage in a wide range of illicit activity (it should be noted that cash is used for many of these same transactions), there is a legitimate theoretical argument in favor of their use. It is based on the reality that central bank tinkering with the money supply has induced recessions, exacerbated unemployment, and given rise to a global banking system based on profiteering and corruption. We need look only as far as the mortgage-market shenanigans underpinning the financial crisis of 2009 for insight into why disaffected consumers everywhere would support the efforts of anonymous programmers in subverting a system that has done them no favors. These ideas are not new. The Austrian School, a school of economic thought founded in 1871, holds among its core tenets the idea that economic manipulation by central banks is not beneficial.\n\nBefore You Buy In\n\nBefore you convert your national currency to bitcoin, you want to consider a few additional facts. Bitcoin was created by an anonymous computer programmer or programmers (there’s no consensus on this and identities are still unconfirmed). Mt. Gox, the largest exchange service converting dollars to bitcoins, failed in spectacular fashion when hackers allegedly stole bitcoins valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. An earlier alleged hacking netted $8.6 million dollars. Other bitcoin exchanges have also blamed hackers for losses. (Read more Bitcoin Mass Hysteria: The Disaster That Brought Down Mt. Gox)\n\nThe currency is digital, so there’s nothing you can touch or hold. Its value fluctuates in a highly volatile manner. It is created by anonymous programmers through a methodology that it too complex for most people to understand much less participate in. (Read more Why is Bitcoin’s Value So Volatile?)\n\nSince bitcoins are stored on users’ computers, “users face the risk of losing their money if they don’t implement adequate antivirus and backup measures” according to Virtual Currency Schemes, a research paper released by the European Central Bank. Hardware failure aside, tossing an old computer in the trash without first removing your bitcoins is also an easy way to lose your digital fortune.\n\nIn summary, if you use bitcoin, you are trusting your money to a complex system you don’t understand, people you know nothing about, and an environment where you have no legal recourse. In the traditional world of investing, this would raise enough red flags to make it a bad idea. On the other hand, the European Central Bank reports that Bitcoin is just one of over 500 digital currencies now in circulation around the world. Even it Bitcoin ultimately fails or is relegated a minor role on the world stage, one of its successors could radically alter the way the world thinks of currency.\n\nBitcoin for Your Thoughts\n\nSo what does the future hold for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies? It is safe to say that they are here to stay. You can use virtual currency to make purchases in a wide variety of video games and some retailers like overstock.com and tigerdirect.com. You can also also use bitcoin to safely purchase giftcards for hundreds of business like Home Depot, KMart, and amazon.com. However, the Bitcoin website notes that “Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction.” And based on the regulatory and enforcement actions of major governments, including the United States and Russia, that status in unlikely to change anytime soon.', 'Investors were left millions of dollars out of pocket when Mt. Gox died, but was the exchange\'s hoard of virtual currency long gone before the abrupt closure?\n\nAccording to a new analysis and results of an investigation conducted by WizSec, Mt. Gox\'s stolen bitcoin reserves -- worth over $300 million at the time\'s trading rates -- were taken from the virtual currency exchange\'s hot wallet systematically over time. However, the theft did not take place in 2014; rather, WizSec lead investigator Kim Nilsson alleges that the funds were taken from late 2011 onwards.\n\nThe bitcoin security specialist firm says ""most or all"" of the missing bitcoins were stolen over time, leaving Mt. Gox ""knowingly or not"" working on a fractional reserve -- which was basically depleted by 2013. The report says:\n\n""A significant number of stolen bitcoins were deposited onto various exchanges, including MtGox itself, and probably sold for cash (which at the bitcoin prices of the day would have been substantially less than the hundreds of millions of dollars they were worth at the time of MtGox\'s collapse).""\n\nMt. Gox closed its doors without warning in February 2014. At the time, it was believed that 650,000BTC had been stolen, although 200,000 were later ""recovered"" from an old-style wallet. However, the closure left many investors out of pocket, and Mt. Gox has filed for bankruptcy in both the US and Japan. Former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles said the closure was due to ""weaknesses in the system"" and apologized to users, but refunds are yet to be issued, if ever.\n\nSince Mt. Gox shut down, rumors have surfaced claiming the theft was an inside job and the result of fraud, and the police are investigating whether the bitcoin exchange had links to the now-defunct online black market, Silk Road.\n\nWizSec has conducted an ongoing, informal investigation into Mt. Gox, and the latest release shows the match-up of logged deposits and withdrawals from leaked transactions together with blockchain activity. Beyond matching up records, the company also attempted to deduce ownership through clustering analysis, pairing addresses owned by individual entities and using insider sources to fill in data gaps.\n\nOverall, WizSec sourced over two million Mt. Gox addresses and plotted the holdings of these addresses over time. Before the security breach, Karpeles performed a test transaction which proved the exchange had at least 424,242.42424242BTC under its control. Using this figure, the firm estimates that in February 2014, Mt. Gox should have held approximately 950,000BTC -- 200,000 of which in the old wallet, and roughly 100,000BTC belonging to Mt. Gox -- which leaves 650,000BTC belonging to customers missing.\n\nHowever, the graph below shows discrepancies between how much virtual currency Mt. Gox should have held, and what WizSec estimates was actually the case.\n\nThe gaps in the chart above are caused when coins went through cold storage -- and in addition the 200,000 recovered bitcoins have been excluded.\n\n""By the end of 2011 we are past most data gaps, but we are seeing a clear discrepancy of several hundred thousand BTC between expected holdings and actual holdings,"" WizSec says.\n\n""Furthermore, if we look closely, this discrepancy seems to be growing over time. By the middle of 2013, there are practically no bitcoins left at all. ""\n\nNilsson notes that there was one recurring pattern in Mt. Gox transactions during the time period shown above. Without withdrawal log entries, a few hundred BTC at a time would be sent to new non-Mt. Gox addresses -- which would later be pulled together, holding up to a few thousand bitcoins each. This virtual currency would then be deposited in trading exchanges, such as Mt. Gox itself, BTC-e and Bitcoinica.\n\nThe firm believes the virtual currency was sold off for cash in these cases.\n\nAnother interesting facet of the report relates to ""Willy,"" the Mt. Gox automated bitcoin bulk buying bot. While some former investors claimed the bot was linked to the bitcoin theft, WizSec does not believe this to be the case -- as by the time Willy came along, ""most of MtGox\'s deposited bitcoins were already long gone.""\n\nNilsson says the company is unwilling to release its data at the moment, as their goal is to aid law enforcement and the release of bulk data could prove problematic to the investigation.\n\nRead on: In the world of security\n\nRead on: Fixes and Flaws', 'BitSIM is a thin, flexible card that can be stuck on any existing SIM card as an add-on hardware layer. BitSIM converts the SIM card into a fully encrypted bitcoin wallet compatible with a wide range of cell phones, including cheap and unsophisticated feature phones.\n\n“BitSIM puts bitcoins on any SIM, on any mobile phone, for mass adoption and frictionless ecosystem uptake,” claims the BitSIM website. Users will be able to pay locally with NFC-enabled phones, but also send and receive bitcoin with a simple SMS to other users anywhere in the world.\n\nThe BitSIM website notes that this simple application can disrupt the $1 trillion remittance market, which is poorly served by companies such as Western Union.\n\nBitSIM seems tailor-made for sending remittances to developing regions of the world where the adoption of cell phones is booming, but most users have only cheap-feature phones. And remittances are just the first application: The BitSIM technology could add a simple bitcoin payment layer to the Internet of Things (IoT), the upcoming pervasive network of smart, connected devices.\n\nBitSIM, based in Hong Kong, is funded by Seedcoin, a seed-stage Bitcoin and blockchain startup virtual incubator.\n\nIn a video interview titled “BitSIM: Bitcoin Between SIM and Phone,” the startup’s founder, Leon Gerard Vandenberg, shows how, by slipping a zero-footprint SIM between the carrier’s SIM card and the phone, BitSIM “up-techs even ancient feature-phones with a new technology stack.” Providing NFC and fully-encrypted Bitcoin transactions over SMS, even a smart-contract-capable JVM runtime, BitSIM is “a stealthy technology injection that routes around the carrier monopolies without their permission.”\n\nAn interesting feature of the BitSIM add-on sticker is that it doesn’t require the authorization of the phone manufacturer, or of the carrier that provides the SIM.\n\n“The hardware is called a ZSIM,” explains Vandenberg. “It’s a zero-footprint SIM that sits between the original SIM and the carrier’s cell phone and interposes SIM commands between the original SIM and the phone. So the phone thinks there is a SIM there, and the original SIM thinks there is a phone there.” (See this trending discussion on Reddit for explanations of how the BitSIM technology works.)\n\nBitSIM’s ZSIM is a “thin SIM” (also known as “overlay SIM”), a chip embedded into a thin plastic sheet that sits on top of an ordinary SIM card, making available to the user services that were not foreseen by the carrier or the phone maker. Thin SIMs have been denounced as a security risk by phone carriers, but that is likely due to their potential to disrupt the carriers’ business models more than to an actual risk for consumers.\n\nIn a September 2014 interview with Brave New Coin, Vandenberg noted that, with the globally adopted use of SMS technology, BitSIM can literally bank the unbanked overnight by giving power back to users, effectively allowing anybody with a cell phone to be their own bank. “Anything running on top of the Bitcoin protocol is also within the reach of bitSIM users,” he said, and noted that bitSIM is a platform supported by a developer community.', 'A recent survey from ING aiming to gain better understanding of retail customers\' banking and spending habits, suggests that Turkey is the country where digital currencies have the highest acceptance rate.\n\nThe ING International Survey, conducted by Ipsos between January 16, and February 2, surveyed some 14,000 consumers from 15 countries on their views and habits towards mobile banking and payment.\n\nThe results highlight the emergence of a cashless economy and an increasing use of mobile payment apps, with the Netherlands leading the way as the ""most developed"" mobile banking market, followed by the USA and the UK.\n\nHowever, Turkey and Poland are two promising markets that currently offer the highest adoption rates of mobile payment apps, surpassing the USA, Australia and Europe.\n\nTurkey as the future mobile banking hotspot\n\nAmong the key findings, Turkey, which currently holds the largest share of mobile banking users among Internet users (65%), is expected to be one of the fastest growing markets in terms of mobile banking and payment.\n\nNot only is Turkey set to embrace the mobile banking era at a faster pace than the USA or the UK, the country is also home to the largest share of digital currencies enthusiasts.\n\nWhile the vast majority of respondents are rather pessimistic about the future of digital currencies, 45% of respondents from Turkey believe that ""digital currencies, such as bitcoin, are the future of spending online,"" against a slim 16% from Australia and 28% from the USA.\n\nTurkey is followed by Italy (43%), Spain (33%), and Poland (31%).\n\nWhile the media hype might have put bitcoin under the spotlight, awareness and use are still low, according to the survey.\n\nWhen asked if they have used bitcoin in the past 12 months, 26% of people in Europe say they have not, and 49% say they don’t know what bitcoin is.\n\nOnce again, Turkey is home to the highest share saying they’ve used bitcoin in the past 12 months, followed jointly by the United States and Italy, then Poland and Spain.\n\nING Group is a Dutch multinational banking and financial services firm that serves over 48 million individuals and institutional clients in more than 40 countries.\n\nIn December 2014, ING, along with ABN Amro and Rabobank, shared their interest in blockchain technology, stating that they were all investigating on the merits of Bitcoin\'s blockchain for their payments systems.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The introduction of the terminal, named “The Handheld,” is the latest step in BitStraat's ongoing effort to establish Amsterdam as the “Bitcoin capital of the world.”\n\nBitStraat, which serves as a middleman linking bitcoin accepting merchants and bitcoin payment processors such as BitPay, was founded by Amsterdam residents Max Barendregt and Kasper Keunen in 2014.\n\nAdding to “The Countertop,” which is more suited for - well - countertops, BitStraat now has two different types of payment processors in its range.\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, Barendregt said:\n\n“We listened closely to the feedback our customers were giving us on our first payments terminal. Several of them told us they preferred a terminal that was better suited to carry around. So we created a version that is easy to handle, has a battery life of up to a week, and is very durable.”\n\nApart from the design, The Handheld is improved on a technical level compared to The Countertop as well.\n\nBarendregt explained:\n\n“The Handheld has both a conventional keyboard as well as a touch screen. It also has a motion sensor and is shock and water resistant. Bitcoin payments can be conducted by showing a QR-code on the display, but it also has NFC-capability and Bluetooth built in.”\n\nBitStraat has teamed up with payment processor BitPay, which has its European headquarters in Amsterdam, to turn the Dutch capital into the Bitcoin capital of the world. This “Amsterdam Bitcoin City” project was launched in November of 2014, and currently has 21 brick and mortar locations signed up to the initiative.\n\nLike The Countertop, The Handheld will be included in BitStraat's payments plan at no additional cost. This plan costs a total of ten euro's per month, and apart from the terminal includes installation, payment processing through BitPay and – if required – maintenance.\n\nAs opposed to The Countertop, however, The Handheld will not be given away for free to the first 100 brick and mortar merchants in Amsterdam that agree to accept bitcoin in their stores. This specific promotion – which is still running – is financed by BitPay, while The Handheld is not.\n\nThe Handheld is currently being tested in Pakhuis de Zwijger, the venue that hosts the monthly Bitcoin Wednesday meetup in Amsterdam. BitStraat will further roll out The Handheld in Amsterdam establishments in May of this year while it is also for sale for €180.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The exchange hopes to be a safe and reliable way for Chileans to access and invest in bitcoin.\n\nChile is right next door to Argentina, a country well known in the Bitcoin industry. Argentina’s high inflation and strict capital controls have created conditions many believe will ignite Bitcoin adoption in the country. But unbeknownst to most, Chileans have had a growing interest in digital currency as well.\n\nThe country has been home to a small-but-growing Bitcoin community. There are more than 200 registered members in the Santiago, Chile Bitcoin Meetup, as well as numerous businesses that accept the digital currency. But Chileans have few ways to buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nBy being the country’s first Bitcoin exchange, SurBTC hopes to provide a safer and easier way for people to acquire the digital currency.\n\nGuillermo Torrealba, CEO and co-founder of SurBTC, told Latin America tech news outletFayerWayer, “[…] for this technology to fulfill its promise to transform the way that much of global finance operates, you must first fill it with responsible companies that offer products and services that not only seek returns, but which will help to develop this emerging industry.\n\n“We are interpreting this ‘responsibility,’ offering a very transparent, secure exchange and open to other entrepreneurs to connect and develop their own solutions,” Torrealba said. “This is the only way that people can forget the scams that have been.”\n\nThe process to launch the exchange started nearly a year ago. SurBTC wanted to make sure the exchange was fully complaint and had strong banking relations. After being rejected from 6 major banks in Chile, they finally found a banking partner willing to work with a Bitcoin company.\n\nAccording to Torrealba, banking relations is the primary reason the exchange has taken so long to launch.\n\n“These are the necessary steps that new Bitcoin companies have to go through in order to erase the bad reputation some left behind,” he said.\n\nAlong the way, the startup did find support from an unlikely source, the Chilean government. The Bitcoin startup received $40,000 from the Chilean government equity-free, as part of one the state’s startup initiatives.\n\nAccording to a press release, the SurBTC team felt it was “extraordinary validation,” as it was the first time the Chilean government had given money to a Bitcoin startup.\n\nSurBTC was co-founded by Chilean businessmen Torrealba and Augustine Feuerhake. A former business professor, Torrealba previously worked for a Latin American business consultancy firm before co-founding Baltoro, a seawater desalination startup.\n\nFeuerhake is a four-time startup founder with more than eight years of experience in mobile development.\n\nThe company launched its exchange late last month, but according to Torrealba, SurBTC is already seeing a lot of traction. SurBTC is also looking to accommodate more traders by adding more services and adding U.S. dollars to the platform soon.\n\nSurBTC has ambitions of expanding throughout Latin America and being the primary exchange for the whole region. Torrealba said the company will be expanding to other countries very quickly in 2015.', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by Evan Faggart\n\nBitcoin mining centralization has been a point of concern in the community for a while now. People are worried that the growing size of mining firms will continue until one of them attains 51% or more of the network’s hashing power. Although a firm holding the majority of the hashing power would not inherently compromise the network, it would certainly centralize the creation of bitcoin and the confirmation of transactions. Such centralization opens the door for a 51% attack, in which a nefarious actor initiates a double spend. This particular attack is highly feared in the Bitcoin community, because a successful double spend would ruin Bitcoin’s reputation for being a trustless monetary system.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Mining vs Gold Mining: A Comparison\n\nBecause of the dangers associated with bitcoin mining centralization, community members have demanded a solution to growing mining firms. They say that, of course, the most ideal solution would be a change to the Bitcoin protocol that would place some kind of limit on the size of mining firms. However, there has not been a viable solution presented thus far. In the meantime, community members have been urging individual miners who use large mining pools to contribute their hashing power to decentralized pools, such as P2Pool.\n\nThe first — and arguably most important — step to finding a solution to bitcoin mining centralization is identifying the economic forces in play that cause the centralization. This article identifies these causal forces as those that make up the concept of “economies of scale.”\n\nEconomies of scale occur when a firm increases its scale of operation in order to produce outputs more efficiently and reduce costs. Each firm has an empirically optimal size; once a firm reaches this point, growing any further will actually create higher costs, as the costs of producing an additional unit of a good will go up for various reasons.\n\nWhat does this concept have to do with bitcoin mining centralization? Essentially, miners experience economies of scale as they are forced to deal with rising electricity costs, which occur as difficulty increases. Thus, in order for a miner to stay profitable, he makes his operation bigger so that he can mine more efficiently, and produce more bitcoin, to meet the growing costs of electricity. The miner will continue to grow the size of his setup until he reaches his empirically optimal point, where the cost of adding another rig (the price of the machine plus the cost of maintenance and electricity) is greater than the value of the bitcoin mined by that marginal machine.\n\nTo keep in line with the reality of the mining industry — in which mining pools are dominant — small-to-medium sized miners will lend their power to a pool in order to minimize their costs and maximize their revenue. These pools will grow until the cost of adding an additional miner (server space, website bandwidth, etc.) outweighs the revenue that the marginal miner gives to the pool operators.\n\nThis process of firm growth will continue until the miner, or mining pool, reaches its empirically optimal size, which may be at a point where the individual or pool controls 51% or more of the network’s hashing power.\n\nFortunately, as long as mining pools remain the primary avenue for taking advantage of economies of scale, there will be a sort of “built in” check on hashing power centralization. Miners know that the Bitcoin community will begin to lose confidence in the network once a single pool reaches 51%, and will start to sell their bitcoin holdings. This liquidation will force the bitcoin price down, thereby decreasing mining profitability. Taking this into consideration, individual miners will pull out of the large pool and direct their miners at smaller pools.\n\nWe saw this happening in the summer of 2014, when GHash.io attained 51% hashing power. Almost immediately after GHash reached 51%, there was a massive selloff on the exchanges and the bitcoin price went down considerably. This price decline — combined with some aggressive encouragement from the community — led miners to connect their rigs to smaller pools. Consequently, GHash’s hashing power fell by approximately 20%-30%.\n\nEver since the panic over GHash in the summer of 2014, bitcoin mining pools have had a relatively safe distribution of hashing power. This distribution is an example of rational economic incentives at work; members of mining pools do not want a pool to have a large share of the networks’ hashing power for too long, because it could lead to decreased profitability due to panicking bitcoiners. Thus, miners are encouraged to contribute to smaller pools in order to take power away from the larger ones. As a result, the distribution of hashing power becomes more even across the various pools.\n\nThis “built in” aversion to mining centralization relies on the existence some very strict empirical conditions that are not likely to persist forever. Therefore, the community prefers that a more permanent solution be found.\n\nSome people think that a strong solution would be to keep the 1MB block size limit in place forever. Supporters of the current limit argue that it would keep miner fees high after all the bitcoin has been mined, which would subsidize smaller miners and protect them against larger firms that could absorb lower fees. However, as I have argued elsewhere, keeping the current block size limit will not stop mining centralization. The cost minimization brought about by economies of scale will tend to increase firm size in times of increasing mining profitability, and will place those large firms at an advantage when profitability falls. Either way, mining will tend to centralize regardless of miner fees.\n\nThe solution, then, must come from something that decreases the overall cost of bitcoin mining. I can think of two possible forms in which this solution could present itself. First, the Core developers could switch Bitcoin’s hashing algorithm from Proof-of-Work to something that uses less electricity. Second — and more likely in my opinion — bitcoin mining hardware technology could improve in a way that allows rigs use electricity more efficiently, diminishing the cost.\n\nWhether or not a solution will be found depends on the market. If people truly want to see centralization diminish, they will invest resources into the improvement of bitcoin mining hardware. On the other hand, if people would rather see merchant solutions, or other things that make spending bitcoin easier, then mining will likely continue to centralize. It all depends on what people want Bitcoin to ultimately become.\n\nHow do you think Bitcoin mining centralization can be solved? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nThis author’s views do not necessarily reflect those of Bitcoinist.net\n\nGHash.io logo courtesy of CEX.io.', 'Stanford “Professor” David Mazières believes he has developed a faster, more flexible, and more secure alternative (altcoin) to Bitcoin, and he released the design for his new protocol in a white paper last week.\n\nBitcoin’s distributed network – thousands of computers connected over the Internet – is a key component to that system’s design, but the eccentric Mazières says that makes Bitcoin slower and less secure than the world’s financial infrastructure should be.\n\nMazières calls his new cryptocurrency protocol SCP, and the project is being adopted by a nonprofit called Stellar, whose original cryptocurrency project was developed by Ripple Labs. After Stellar’s system “forked” into two networks last year, changes were needed. Mazières’s new design avoids that issue altogether, leading top computer scientists to approve of the Stanford Computer scientist ‘s overall design.\n\nTaking leave from Stanford to work on the project four days a week as Stellar’s chief scientist, Mazières will enjoy the backing of major payment startups like Stripe.\n\nInstead of mining, which is key to the Bitcoin infrastructure, each person running the SCP software must identify a few other trusted participants to correctly apply cryptographic rules for validating transactions. As Technology Review writes:\n\nEach instance of the software will recognize transactions only once a certain majority fraction of its trusted partners have also signed off. And the trust relationships are all public.\n\nMazières says the math shows that those rules will allow his system to reliably verify transactions much more quickly and with less energy.\n\n“The security proposition of Bitcoin is that the people who invested in mining infrastructure can be trusted, but that may not be true,” Dan Boneh, a Stanford professor unaffiliated with Mazières’s work, says. “Here I can choose for myself who to trust.”\n\nBoneh also says SCP enables use of stronger cryptography, while Bitcoin’s cryptography has limitations.\n\n“By design, you can’t crank up the hardness of Bitcoin to the point it’s infeasible for a well-resourced attacker,” says Boneh. “With this you can.”\n\nEmin Gün Sirer, an associate professor at Cornell University, agrees with the other researcher’s assessment that SCP holds some advantages over Bitcoin.\n\n“The protocol looks sound,” says Sirer.\n\nSCP could be compromised if, for instance, participants in the system chose trusted partners so that too few overlaps were created, thus failing to connect the network into a unified vector. An attacker could theoretically create this situation, implies Sirer. He argues, however, this does not hold implications for the technology, but, rather, for people.\n\n“This is a social thing, not a technical thing,” says Sirer.\n\nMazières claims the possibilities alluded to by Sirer are possible, yet unlikely. He foresees large organizations – like banks or other financial institutions – securing the SCP network. Still, the perceived problem remains, he admits.\n\n“People are always a weak point,” he submits.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'On February 1st 2015, I bought 0.4091 BTC ($119 at the time) from Coinbase to purchase a Trezor.

I sent the payment and waited.\n\nTrezor is a bitcoin hardware wallet produced by SatoshiLabs. It is a physical product designed to protect bitcoin wallet private keys so that they are not stored on a potentially vulnerable computer and to provide access controls so that only the authorized user can effect transactions from the protected bitcoin wallet.\n\nIt took two weeks for the product to finally ship, but noting where the package is from it makes sense it took so long to reach me in the United States.\n\nI unboxed the Trezor, took some lovely photographs, initialized a wallet, sent it bitcoins, and sent them back out of it. See below for my review of the product and how I feel about its ease of use and security.\n\nAs a hardware wallet, the Trezor stores the private keys used to sign bitcoin transactions. As such it does a fairly good job and has some interesting security features designed to stop easy practical tampering and it does not share the keys with the platform it is connected to. All transaction signing happens on the device itself and it processes inputs and outputs as well as requires intervention from the user (via the buttons) before the device completes transactions.\n\nUnboxing\n\nThe Trezor arrived in an inconspicuous, if a little bit beaten up, package from the U.S. Postal Service. The from address is in the Czech Republic, making this the first parcel I have ever received from there in my entire life.\n\nThe packaging is shrink-wrapped and has a tamper-resistant sticker on the side of the box that I did have to cut through in order to open and pull out the device and the contents. Inside, I found a set of instructions on a piece of paper, a blue USB cable, and the Trezor set into molded padding. Outside of the box (seen in the photos) I also received a longer black USB cable, see below.\n\nThe device itself is small and extremely light. It is made out of a smooth plastic material. The device itself seems to have no tamper-proof sticker or other indications that would let me know if it had been opened after shipping. The device also arrived with two USB cables, a blue one and a black one; the black cable came with a note asking me to use it first if I was “experiencing an issue with my TREZOR device.”\n\nAt first glance, the Trezor looks like an oddly shaped clicker for a car. It has a small screen—which I would discover lights up—and two small buttons for interaction. The bottom of the Trezor tapers to a point where there is a micro-USB slot for connecting it to a PC.\n\nThe screen on the TREZOR is luminous and has a fairly good resolution for how small it is. I chose a black TREZOR so the illumination from the screen really stands out. I also discovered that the short USB cables get in the way more than they’re useful. You may want to buy a longer micro-USB cable to make it easier to interact with the TREZOR’s buttons when it requires input.\n\nSetup\n\nGetting the Trezor set up became an interesting experience but once my own technical difficulties were swept aside, I was able to quickly get it done.\n\nFirst caveat, absent a standalone app, Trezor’s use the website MyTrezor.com and a browser plugin to load and interact with the device. I’ve noticed that when plugging the Trezor in, the website doesn’t always notice that the device is attached. It can take a few unplugs and re-plugs and refreshes of the website before it notices. However, once that dance is out of the way, the device works extremely well.\n\nTo get started, I had to download the Trezor plugin, which is compatible with the most recent versions of Firefox and Chrome, both browsers that I use on a regular basis. The MyTrezor.com website, which is accessed via SSL and https://mytrezor.com runs the code necessary to trigger the Trezor wallet plugin. Users who want an experience that’s more secure may want to look into a bitcoin wallet that supports the TREZOR instead (see wallet testing section of this review below for more information.)\n\nMy problems with the Trezor arose in that I run a lot of script blocking software on my web browsers. This constantly conflicted with the MyTrezor.com approach and caused a lot of pain when attempting to get the device running and set up. I needed to deactivate the script blockers entirely in order to prevent them from interfering with the website.\n\nTo begin, I named my device: “Kyt’s TREZOR”. These words appear on the Trezor’s screen beneath a glowing lock symbol when the device is plugged in. Useful if I had more than one Trezor and wanted to be sure which one I was looking at.\n\nFirst, I had to initialize the device and set up my PIN. The interesting thing that Trezor does is that a 3×3 set of tiles is displayed on the Trezor device’s glowing screen with the numbers 1-9 randomly placed. The PC screen displays another 3×3 grid and asks me to press the tile matching the one on the Trezor screen to enter the PIN. The PIN can be up to 10 numbers and the longer the better.\n\nThis will come up later when signing transactions using the private keys stored on the Trezor. It’s an interesting take on security that makes it difficult to brute force the PIN because the 3×3 random tiles changes each time the device is accessed.\n\nOnce a wallet was prepared, the Trezor then took me through the long, tedious (but absolutely necessary) process of setting up the recovery seed. This consists of 24 words displayed sequentially on the Trezor device (and not on the PC) that must be copied down and verified. Once copied, the device took me through them again to verify them. Each time the device required that I press a button to acknowledge.\n\nIf I were to lose or have my Trezor destroyed, this would act as my backup seed to rebuild the address database and give me access to the private keys stored on the device. As a result, I simply saved the 24 words in a plain text file within an encrypted volume on my computer for safekeeping.\n\nReceiving bitcoins\n\nThe MyTrezor.com web page produces addresses on demand to receive bitcoins. It displays the addresses one at a time (more can be requested) as well as a QR code. The QR code follows the current selected on the page and the selection consists of the entire address, which makes it easy to use the “copy” function without worrying about missing any element of the address.\n\nTo test this, I sent some bitcoins from my Coinbase wallet to the Trezor address produced. The transaction went just as smoothly as every other bitcoin transfer I have ever run.\n\nSending bitcoins\n\nWith the Trezor plugged in, sending is easy: click on the “Send” tab, enter an address, and enter an amount.\n\nThe sending page calculates the fee, and lists the inputs address and outputs.\n\nTo sign and broadcast the bitcoin transaction, the MyTrezor web page popped up the 3×3 PIN dialogue– with the randomized numbers displayed on the Trezor itself. I entered my PIN according to the randomized tiles and that set the device in motion.\n\nTo finalize, the device required that I confirm twice. First it asked me to confirm the bitcoin address I intended to send to by displaying it on the PC screen and displaying the same address on the Trezor. The first button became “CANCEL” the second “CONFIRM”. The second time it asked me to confirm the amount.\n\nAfter that the transaction popped up on the MyTrezor wallet interface and showed that I’d sent my bitcoins.\n\nI needed only wait a mere few seconds for me to see the transaction appear on my Coinbase wallet account; and a few minutes for it to go from pending to confirmed as the Bitcoin network crunched the transaction.\n\nSign and verify\n\nThe MyTrezor.com wallet site also permits using the private keys stored on the Trezor to be used to sign messages and to verify messages signed by others. The signature and verification uses a bitcoin address in order to sign or verify said messages.\n\nThis is accessible via the MyTrezor.com wallet via the “Sign & Verify” tab (on the far right.) In both cases of signing and verification the beginning of the message text is displayed on the Trezor device for the user to confirm. Conceivably if the message displayed on the Trezor differs from the one input into the form on the wallet site this would be a sign that that something went wrong.\n\nSecurity\n\nFirst, if the Trezor is lost or stolen, the user need only use the recovery seed (mentioned earlier in the article) to restore access to the private keys in the wallet and move the bitcoins. Any user keeping track of their Trezor who discovers it lost or stolen in a short period of time would likely be able to recover their coins without much fuss.\n\nBut how secure is the Trezor if it falls into the hands of a determined attacker?\n\nWhile SatoshiLabs claims strong security, it was recently discovered that Trezor’s are susceptible to certain attacks that allow for private key discovery via side channels. Blogger and cryptographer Johoe, best known for intercepting bitcoins during a Blockchain.info security exploit and returning the funds, posted an example of this attack and assisted SatohiLabs in firmware update 1.3.3 that helps mitigate many of these problems. However, as noted in the Reddit thread on the topic, there may still be some potential holes that need to be plugged.\n\nIf your Trezor is running on firmware earlier than 1.3.3, it is highly recommended that you upgrade. This update adds PIN protection when generating the public key which helps mitigate some of the side-channel attack vulnerability.\n\nHardware device security is a little hard to test and I don’t have the equipment or software to attempt brute-force or other tricks like johoe above, however, a look at the FAQ regarding Trezor’s security gives a quick idea of what users can expect the security on the device should be.\n\nAccording to SatoshiLabs, brute forcing the PIN could take a very long time as even a 4-digit pin would have 6541 possible permutations—this would only increase in complexity for the maximum of 10-digits. The Trezor also places a hard wait on each entry with a wait time increase of a power of 2 each time a failed entry is made.\n\nEven power-cycling the Trezor will not shorten the wait time as the Trezor itself stores the number of failed attempts in its memory.\n\nAlso according to SatoshiLabs, attempting to change the firmware will result in the Trezor displaying a warning.\n\nFinally, advanced users into security can verify SatoshiLab’s firmware is good. The security FAQ itself includes a section holding out hope that a few advanced users will in fact regularly verify that the Trezor firmware has not been tampered with, adding an extra layer of consumer security to the device.\n\nSoftware Wallet Support\n\nThe Trezor hardware wallet works with a few software Bitcoin wallets, and I got a chance to test it with one of them: MultiBit HD. This review will be updated with additional wallets as they become available or when they can be loaded up.\n\nMultiBit HD\n\nTesting the Trezor with MultiBit HD turned out to be extremely easy. After using the Windows installer, launching and setting up a local wallet, the rest came fairly organically. First I found “Trezor” under the Tools menu, and I was able to use “Verify Trezor” after a few attempts to get my machine to recognize that the Trezor was connected, MultiBit noticed the Trezor and asked if I wanted to add it.\n\nThen it started with “Requesting Trezor unlock,” which did not go as planned. It took a few more tries (mostly plugging and unplugging) for the unlock to succeed, and it used the same PIN sequence as the setup did with the randomized pad displayed on the Trezor. After entering my PIN, the Trezor itself required a physical button press to acknowledge.\n\nThen I just needed to wait for synchronization. This took four to five minutes maximum.\n\nMultiBit HD’s UI changed slightly to show that I was using my Trezor now including adding “Kyt’s TREZOR” to the program’s name in the taskbar. And, mousing over the shield icon at the bottom, it reads “Using Trezor device to manage private keys for greater security.”\n\nAfter the synchronization finished, I could view my test payment in the wallet. And the actions to send/receive via the Trezor wallet became active. MultiBit otherwise acts like any other wallet.\n\nJust to see what would happen, I yanked the Trezor off the USB while MultiBit was running and it did not seem to notice it was disconnected. To its credit, however, in order to send any bitcoins it did need to confirm with the Trezor (which is a physical button press on the dongle) so the wallet confirmation dialogue could not send without the device connected.\n\nElectrum\n\nInstalling Electrum on my system did not go very well and I was unable to test Electrum integration at this time.\n\nArmory\n\nMy software wallet of choice in Windows is Armory. Unfortunately, Armory does not currently support Trezor; however, the FAQ does imply that this functionality is being worked on but no release date is given.\n\nConclusion\n\nSatoshiLab’s Trezor is one of the first hardware wallets to hit the market. It claims a great deal of security and has a proven sense of ease-of-use. The wallet looks good out-of-the-box, the instructions are not difficult to understand, and although there’s certainly some friction when it comes to individual users, it still managed to be a smooth install for me.\n\nAs with any hardware and software combination, there will be security issues, and SatoshiLabs makes a good show of attempting to stay on top of it. The revelation of the side-channel attack on Reddit and the apparent lack of PIN protection at launch, have both been patched with firmware updates. New security issues will appear and SatoshiLabs’ strong support will be needed to stay ahead of it.\n\nThe lack of support for common wallets, especially Armory, is a bit of a downer when it comes to the Trezor, but there are not very many software wallets in the wild yet so MultiBit HD and Electrum feels like a good start. The promise of adding Armory could be a selling point for fans of that client.\n\nOverall, the Trezor is a solid product, with functional software, it stores the private keys inside itself and does signing on device with user interaction enforced between the Trezor and the machine running the client. Since the keys are never exposed to the world this reduces the chances that a hacker who gains access to a computer (or phone) can steal bitcoins, which is a major selling point, and at $119 it feels like a good price point for an early adopter.', 'Digital currency startup NeuCoin’s 60-day crowd pre-sale aims to raise the additional funds needed to prepare for the company’s public launch this summer.\n\nOne hundred million NeuCoin will be up for sale April 28 in exchange for bitcoin. The price will start at 25,000 NeuCoin for 1 Bitcoin (approx. $0.01 per NeuCoin) and increase by 1 percent each day. The pre-sale will end after 60 days or after all coins have been sold.\n\nThe Paris-based NeuCoin startup has already raised $2.25 million from a group of investors.\n\nCo-founder Dan Kaufman is confident about the launch of NeuCoin and told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“We’ve been getting thousands of emails and feel there’s a lot of interest and anticipation for the pre-sale. People seem to appreciate our solid angel investors and consumer-friendly micropayments approach. Since there are no daily caps, the 100 million NeuCoins may sell out very fast.”\n\nIn addition, the company will be distributing its “freemium” model free to consumers who just want to try it out, and there will be more for customers who recruit other new customers. Businesses that promote NeuCoin and accept micropayments in NeuCoin will also receive “freemium” coin.\n\nWhat is NeuCoin?\n\nNeuCoin is a digital currency that is easy to use and ideal for online tipping and micropayments. Co-founder Dan Kaufman says he made the consumer his first priority and his goal was always to develop the most user-friendly of all the digital currencies.\n\nNeuCoin uses a similar model to Peercoin and is often referred to as a peer-to-peer coin. It is based on proof-of-stake (PoS), rather than proof-of-work (PoW) and pays interest to owners as the coin is staked (as opposed to miners).\n\nNeucoin says that its high PoS rates reward early NeuCoin adopters and address a key security issue by rewarding PoS miners to stake numerous NeuCoins and operate many nodes.\n\nWhy NeuCoin instead of Bitcoin?\n\nAccording to Dan Kauffman, the real motivator for developing NeuCoin was the inaccessibility and techie nature of Bitcoin – a great idea but too hard for consumers to access and use.\n\nKaufman, with his partners Johan Sandstrom, Ophélie Pubellier and Scott Walker, recently released a whitepaper arguing that Proof of Stake (PoS) is superior to Bitcoin’s Proof of Work with its high costs, mining centralization and the ever-increasing costs of Bitcoin mining hardware.\n\nKaufman maintains that Bitcoin suffers from too much centralization, particularly in the area of mining, with fewer companies owning more and more mining equipment.\n\nAnd he says it is more than likely that Bitcoin transaction fees will go up in the future.\n\nEarly Investors\n\nMajor angel investors include Emil Michael, SVP of business at Uber, Henrik Kjellberg, president of Hotwire, Patrik Stymne, co-founder of King (Candy Crush Saga), Rob Goldman, head of growth at Facebook, Ted Rogers from Xapo, and dozens of other top tech and media executives.\n\nStrategic advisers to the startup include Spotify’s Alex Norstrom, Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer and Brock Pierce, entrepreneur and Bitcoin Foundation board member.\n\nThree Nonprofit Foundations designed to decentralize NeuCoin\n\nThree nonprofit groups located on the Isle of Man will develop and support NeuCoin, each with their own focus – core development, growth and utility.\n\nEach foundation has different council members, budgets and priorities and is ultimately controlled by all the people who own NeuCoin (one coin equals one vote).\n\nAbout 2.4 billion of the total NeuCoin supply has been placed in the hands of these three independent foundations, and they are responsible for distributing these coins to developers and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe NeuCoin team is planning a public launch for July and has said they will guarantee that if the NeuCoin platform isn’t up and running by September they’ll return the pre-sale funds, which will be held in escrow until the coin is issued.\n\n“With the funding from our angel investors…we already have all the money needed to finish the code, the super easy online wallet, the consumer on-boarding site and more,” Kaufman said. “The proceeds from the pre-sale will go to NeuCoin’s nonprofit foundations and fund later consumer marketing and development of micropayment platforms with MondoMedia, a video content producer with the largest animation channel on YouTube, to develop and Jango.com, a streaming music service with 8 million monthly listeners.”']"
04/21/2015,"['A group of Swiss students have avoided jail as police have ""freed"" the Random Darknet Shopper bot that was buying illegal items including drugs and fake branded goods at random from the dark web.\n\nWebsites that are only accessible through the Tor anonymity network are known as the ""deep web"" or the ""dark web"".\n\nUnsearchable by regular internet search engines, cybercriminals put thousands of goods and services for sale on secret underground marketplaces, which include illegal drugs, chemicals, firearms and counterfeit goods, as well as adverts for services such as hacking, gambling and sports betting.\n\nThe items can only be purchased using bitcoins and police around the world, such as the FBI in the US, have spent a lot of time shutting these marketplaces down and prosecuting their creators, such as the notorious Silk Road and Ross Ulbricht, who was found guilty of running the website in February.\n\nIn 2014, the technology artists, who call themselves !Mediengruppe Bitnik, programmed a bot and gave it a budget of $100 (£67) in Bitcoins a week to automatically logon to the Agora market place in the deep web and randomly choose and purchase one item. The item was then mailed to the students and the next week the bot would buy something else.\n\nThe items that the students received came from all over the world and varied from fake Nike shoes, Diesel jeans and a Louis Vuitton handbag to the scan of someone\'s Hungarian passport, a decoy letter made to look like it was from a bank and a baseball cap with a hidden camera.\n\nThere was also a Sprite can with a secret hiding place, master keys to open a certain type of communal gates, credit card details and 10 ecstasy pills vacuum-sealed in aluminium foil and placed in a DVD case to avoid detection if passed through an X-ray scan.\n\nThe students decided to display everything they received in an art exhibition held at the Kunst Halle St Gallen art museum for three months but the day after the three-month-long exhibition closed on 12 January, Swiss police arrived and seized the items and the bot.\n\nThe police also initially wanted to prosecute the students for purchasing the ecstasy but later changed their minds and returned all the items on 15 April, although they destroyed the ecstasy.\n\nThomas Hansjakob, a spokesperson for the Swiss St Gallen police, told CNBC: ""We decided the ecstasy that is in this presentation was safe and nobody could take it away. Bitnik never intended to sell it or consume it so we didn\'t punish them.""\n\nHansjakob added the police had only found out about the project through the media and they had not been informed in advance.\n\n""In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition,"" Bitnik wrote on its website.\n\n""The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts, even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited.\n\n""We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges.

Think of Taringa! as a combination of Facebook and Reddit for Latin America. Based in Argentina, Taringa! claims a unique user base of 75 million, second only to Facebook itself in the region among social networks. And they have caught the bitcoin bug, with the help of Xapo, the California-based Bitcoin wallet and service provider.\n\nTaringa! sees the economic value in Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s innovations solve a very important economic problem for Taringa! and many other growing businesses outside of Western society. Many people in Latin America do not have bank accounts or are “unbanked”. The infrastructure for widespread credit card account usage and payments lacks as well. Taringa! management sees the mainstream economic system as limiting to their growth potential, and Bitcoin can help fill in these huge gaps.\n\n“We have had this on our mind mainly because we think we can bring more people to create great content. And also because we think that it’s fair, given that all this that we have is just because our users are creating the content,” Mr. Botbol told the Wall Street Journal. “But we never were able to do that because the infrastructure is horrendous – even if you send someone a check, [without sufficient banking services] they don’t know what to do with that.”\n\nIn partnership with Xapo, Taringa! will look to incorporate a revenue-sharing program similar to what YouTube offers users and members who generate viral content. If your content is really generating revenue, you will receive Bitcoin as an incentive. The company hopes this will grow the network’s user base, and the Argentinian market is already well-versed in Bitcoin, and many use it due to major economic problems with the current economic system. The service is used far beyond Argentina, and can eliminate the flaws in the current economic paradigm, and provide a global currency that doesn’t require ID, cards, or bank account. I spoke with Tiburcio de la Cárcova, head of platform at Xapo, about this project and the goals of this collaboration.\n\n“The overarching goal for the project is to allow Taringa to share its revenue stream with its users. Top contributors to the network will receive a portion of revenue in the form of bitcoin from Taringa as part of new additions to its business model. The partnership will also enable Taringa’s 75 million users to accept, trade, and tip each other in bitcoin for the content posted to the platform. Using the Xapo wallet to facilitate bitcoin transactions on Taringa’s platform has the potential to impact millions of lives. Much of Latin America does not have access to a bank account, but do have access to a smartphone and thus access to bitcoin and Taringa. The ability to exchange in bitcoin is an exceptional alternative to traditional means of money transfer.”\n\nAlso Read: Xapo Launches The Ability To Purchase Bitcoin Through Wire Transfer\n\nAs a side note, Xapo made news last year in regards to their debit card program for Bitcoin, starting to ship cards to consumer last summer. Xapo’s debit cards began shipping in July 2014, and the program is still in beta, which means we’re still perfecting all aspects of it. According to Mr. Cárcova, Xapo has been advised by its card program manager that it cannot currently issue debit cards in the U.S., India, and a few other countries. So, Xapo Bitcoin debit cards are not currently usable/available in some countries due to regulation issues that are still pending.\n\nCountries and business platforms playing to win still see the Bitcoin glass as half full while others who are not ready to get ahead only see a glass half empty. Know any people like that? Business imitates life in many ways.\n\nInnovations like Bitcoin may allow countries and systems hamstrung by the flaws in current financial systems to leap frog ahead of many of the top networks in Western society, not out of greed, but out of necessity. There are many limitations in 20th century systems that people who use Bitcoin effectively will never encounter again. This may be the start of a new level of international business adoption for Bitcoin. For Taringa!, bigger, more established economic systems aren’t better. Better economic systems are better.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Although bitcoin has slowly been gaining mainstream acceptance among the online community and businesses, it seems that most governments are opposed to the cryptocurrency. For one, the lack of a centralized body or monetary authority overseeing bitcoin exchanges and transactions is seen to be the culprit for the lack of security and the rise in hacking incidents.\n\nIn line with this, governments are also wary that the absence of any code of conduct or regulations governing the bitcoin industry could result in an unstable financial system. There are plenty of gray lines in this particular industry that even criminal activities and lawsuits take a while to resolve.\n\nEstablishing Trust in Bitcoin\n\nApart from that, there is no asset backing the value of bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s value is simply determined by supply and demand, unlike fiat currencies which are based on gold or other precious metals.\n\nHowever, some say that it is the decentralized nature of bitcoin that gives it a higher potential for more secure transactions. These are logged in a public ledger called blockchain, which keeps track of the transactions between parties.\n\nFor businesses though, the use of bitcoin in transactions offers lower costs compared to other forms of payment such as credit or debit cards. There is no need for a middleman financial institution to verify the payments, as the bitcoin can easily be converted to cash. In some countries, bitcoin ATMs have already been installed to make withdrawals from online bitcoin wallets more convenient.\n\nTo resolve this issue, governments can come up with regulations to govern the cryptocurrency sphere, although some bitcoin enthusiasts say that this can destroy the viability of the system. Bear in mind, however, that some bitcoin startups have already added some high-profile former government officials to their strategic board in order to figure out how to increase trust in bitcoin and boost its international presence.', 'A new bitcoin exchange has launched in Perth, the largest city and capital of Western Australia, a rural state with roughly one inhabitant per square kilometer.\n\nCalled Digital World Ventures (DWV), the bitcoin-only exchange will aim to target consumers across the country who want trade between the Australian dollar (AUD) and bitcoin by leveraging exchange software provider AlphaPoint.\n\nDWV director James Clarke and co-founder Ian Davies suggested that despite his company\'s location, he believes it has much offer a market he characterized as lacking a strong approach to customer service or technology.\n\nDavies told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'ve got a lot of people coming into the exchange space that either have a heavy technical focus or we\'ve got the finance guys coming in and running exchanges. Because we\'ve experienced both sides, we\'re able to bring that together.""\n\nDavies previously worked as a support technician for IBM and boasts experience running service desks, while Clarke was formerly a systems analyst for Barclays Bank.\n\nTrading fees will start at 0.70% on BTC trades of $AUD500 or less, a figure that decreases to as low as 0.08% on trades of $AUD200,000 or more. The exchange will also charge goods and services tax (GST) on transaction fees paid by buyers and sellers.\n\nExchange consolidation\n\nClarke and Davies also addressed the ongoing consolidation in the bitcoin exchange and marketplace space, which has seen former market leaders such as Buttercoin, Cavirtex and Vault of Satoshi close in recent months. DWV said its business account with Westpac Bank and the liquidity provided by AlphaPoint\'s global exchange network would help mitigate this risk.\n\n""We\'re all about stability and building brand awareness,"" Clarke said. ""That starts with finding that banking partner.

In some ways to TechCrunch’s Disrupt awards, the event is meant to highlight regional businesses who have pioneered new territory in their space.\n\nLiving Room of Satoshi was one of the first companies to achieve the goal of enabling Bitcoin bill payments, and its user base has steadily grown since its launch about a year ago. Within a few months, they had done $150,000 in bill payments, charging no fees to the customer.\n\nThe company won two awards at the event last night – “Best New Startup in Australia” and “Best State Startup” for Queensland. (Living Room of Satoshi is based in Brisbane.) CEO Daniel Alexiuc was excited to be recognized by the wider business company, saying:\n\nWhen I announced in my acceptance speech that our major competitor BPAY was owned by the Big 4 Australian banks, there were sympathetic boos and jeers. But it soon turned to thunderous applause when I warned the bill payments behemoth to ‘Look out! This plucky little startup from Queensland is coming for you!’\n\nDespite not having the backing of major banks and traditional finance companies, the bill pay facilitator seems to be winning the arms race for enabling Bitcoin users to participate in the normal economy. Offering a no-fee service model, potentially more everyday people will consider them as time goes on because paying bills comes with a small fee to the person paying his or her bills.\n\nLiving Room of Satoshi is an internet start-up that enables payment of any bill using Bitcoin. This includes phone bills, electricity bills, school fees, credit card and tax payments. Users can pay bills up to $1,000 AUD at no charge.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Following its 2015 election bid, the Pirate Party of Finland has revealed unprecedented Bitcoin support since its initial decision to accept the cryptocurrency for its campaign.\n\nThe party, whose aims include wider use of Bitcoin at state level, was unexpectedly inundated with donations following a blog post by member Janne Paalijärvi on Finland’s main exchange Bittiraha in March.\n\nDespite the April elections having come to a close on Sunday, almost 5,000 euros worth of BTC was deposited in the party’s wallet following publication, making for a total of 10,000 EUR for 2015. In contrast, donations from all channels for 2014 came to 4,000 EUR, a press release issued today states. Paalijärvi wrote in a follow-up post:\n\n“We were positively surprised by the considerable electoral donations, but despite this now is not the time for showing off.”\n\nHe added that the funds would be used to further the party’s campaign work.\n\nFinnish election rules state that parties may not accept more than 1,500 EUR in anonymous donations per year. However, since Bitcoin is not officially recognized, nor has been explicitly mentioned in the ruling, the party’s donations are presently something of a gray area and a cause for legal concerns.\n\nWhile the Pirates remain the largest party in Finland outside parliament following the weekend’s elections, its young age compared to many of the other parties coupled with the impressive funding demonstrates an interest in radical innovation, which is swiftly marking Finland out as a land of opportunity.\n\nThe country’s open stance on bitcoin trading, as well as its tax-free VAT policy, have helped ensure a lively infrastructure including BTMs and even a well-documented revival of physical bitcoins in addition to names such as Bittiraha.\n\nOfficial feedback from the Pirates meanwhile, following the end of the campaign, is still forthcoming, with official election statistics due to be published April 30.', '', 'Denarium’s “low-cost” physical bitcoins could revolutionize not only the industry of physical bitcoins, but perhaps even Bitcoin itself. The Finnish Bitcoin startup’s main goal is to promote Bitcoin adoption by offering coins totalling 1/10th and 1/100th of a bitcoin in value.\n\nCasascius once dominated this Bitcoin niche, having launched in 2011. However, due to the increasing stresses of regulation and compliance, the company ceased selling bitcoin-loaded coins in 2013.\n\nCryptocoins News discussed the new physical coin with Denarium co-founder, Henry Brade.\n\nDenarium has an open crowdfunding round at Nordic equity crowdfunding service Invesdor. For more information, click here.\n\nWhat was the goal in launching a range of “low-cost” physical bitcoins?\n\nWhat we hope to achieve is to allow everyone to have an easy-to-understand gateway to the world of Bitcoin. Our first product is a simple, low-cost product that anyone can afford. We want the coins in the hands of Bitcoin enthusiasts all over the world so they can use them as gifts to friends & family and while doing that they can explain what Bitcoin is about. It’s also a great gift for company employees if one is a company owner or executive.\n\nCasascius ran into problems with regulators in the US. How is Denarium in a position to avoid such issues?\n\nThe regulatory environment here in Finland is clear in regards to manufacturing and selling physical bitcoins, so we are in a good place to start. We foresee a positive regulatory future in Finland, however we are also prepared to move our operations in case there are problems. Many of the other physical coin manufacturers have been hobbyist projects, we are a real business. We already have a warehouse in Singapore for the logistics needs of the Asian market, so we could easily move more of our operations there in case there are issues in Finland.\n\nWhat are the physical bitcoins composed of?\n\nDenarium coins are composed of three main components. There is the physical coin itself, which is made of brass. Then there is the hologram sticker which is a security seal that protects the coin from counterfeiting. Then there is the private key paper slip which is between the coin and the hologram. The private key is what protects and stores the actual bitcoins and the key printed in both plain text and QR code format.\n\nWhere does the name Denarium come from?\n\nThe name is based on the ancient Roman currency system Denarius. We simply switched the end because Denarius is commonly used already.\n\nWere you interested in precious metals before you were interested in Bitcoin?\n\nI can’t speak for everyone in our team, but I think most of us were and still are interested in precious metals. My personal view is that one of the best ways to describe Bitcoin is “digital gold.” It obviously doesn’t yet have the historical reliability as a store of value that gold has but it is technically way more advanced than gold and bitcoins are arguably even more scarce than gold.\n\nAfter Europe, North America, Australia and Asia, what are your goals for Denarium?\n\nThe goal for Denarium in terms of physical coins is to continue to spread them everywhere and release new types of products. We are looking at manufacturing premium coins, collector coins and other specialities. However it is important to note that our company is not only working on physical coins. We currently run the largest Bitcoin exchange in Finland (Bittiraha.fi), the largest Bitcoin ATM network in the Nordics (Bittimaatti) and we have multiple exciting new international projects in development. In the future Denarium could be the home for a wide variety of Bitcoin services, a complete Bitcoin ecosystem. That’s the long term goal.\n\nAll very interesting, Henry. We really appreciate your time.\n\nMy pleasure, thank you!\n\nYou can visit the Denarium website here.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Remittances – sending cash overseas – has always been bitcoin‘s killer app. Now the guys at Robocoin have made it more killer. Their new product, called Romit, is basically a way to send cash through a Robocoin ATM to another ATM or merchant account at fees far lower than other remittance providers.\n\nRobocoin runs 20 ATMs around the world including systems in Hong Kong, Romania, Italy, and the United States (including Vegas). To send money you simply slide it into your local ATM and enter the recipient’s phone number. The recipient can then pick it up at a nearby ATM or merchant.\n\n“Romit enables unprecedented low-cost global money transfers by leveraging Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology, while also removing bitcoin from the customer experience,” said CEO Jordan Kelley.\n\n“Romit lets Robocoin’s operators scale their businesses – not by buying more kiosks, but by onboarding partner stores with the Cashier app. For example, our partners in Romania and Italy, a $1.1bn remittance corridor, have their sights set on market penetration and are looking to scale from three kiosks each to hundreds of Romit-enabled human and machine locations before the end of 2015,” he said.\n\nThere are currently a few bitcoin-only remittance plays including Rebit in the Philippines. By partnering with these and creating their own channels Robocoin may just be able to beat Western Union at their own game.\n\nDon’t expect to be sending your cash to Aunt Matilda in wildest Tuscany just yet, though. The system is still growing and they were working with local merchants to exist as ad hoc ATMs. The plan is to offer 4% fees vs. 25% and more at other providers. They will also support micro-remittances, namely those under $200, thereby allowing the unbanked to send cash home.']"
04/22/2015,"['There’s positive news for customers of Mt. Gox, the once industry-leading bitcoin exchange that blew up in spectacular fashion last year, after its creditors began accepting bankruptcy claims.\n\nA notice issued today instructs customers to log-in into their Mt. Gox account at claims.mtgox.com, from where they can make their attempt at reclamation. (There is also an offline option for those who prefer mountains of paperwork.)\n\nAnother avenue is to lodge a claim via Kraken, the Korea US-based bitcoin exchange that was last year selected by Mt. Gox’s creditors for reimbursements. Kraken is sweetening the deal a little too by offering up to $1 million of free trades for any Mt. Gox customers who go via its service.\n\nEither way, those filing will need to sign up to, or already have, a Kraken account since any returned coins will be deposited via the service. On that note, returns will be calculated at a rate of $483 per BTC with an additional 6 percent per annum. That’s higher than the current bitcoin price, but Mt. Gox customers should expect to see a partial return on their holdings, as users on this Reddit thread lamented.\n\nIf you were a Mt. Gox customer with bitcoin inside the service, you have until May 29 to file your claim. The company’s creditors plan to make a decision on returns by September 9 this year.\n\nMt. Gox closed off its website and halted transactions in February 2014 after losing (at least) 850,000 bitcoins and generating an outstanding debt of about $63.6 million.\n\nThe Tokyo-based company filed for bankruptcy at the end of February, but a recent report suggested that most of its coins were stolen between 2011 and 2013. There have been plenty of accounts of how the team frantically tried to revive its pool of coins — including the apparent use of a trading bot — but, regardless of the reasons, the company’s collapse marked a line in the sand.\n\nThese days bitcoin has matured. Times of maverick businesses like Mt. Gox appear to be over. Today’s top exchanges like Coinbase and BitPay are backed by venture capital firms and reputed institutional investors as the industry moves from being strange, new technology to a payment system that could have mainstream appeal and legitimacy.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'Lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, has announced that he and other Bitcoin Core developers are joining the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.\n\nA few days ago Bitcoin Magazine reported that the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab announced the launch of a Digital Currency Initiative, to be directed by former White House senior adviser for mobile and data innovation Brian Forde.\n\nThe MIT Digital Currency Initiative will integrate researchers across the institute and leading experts at other universities around the world to address some of the most critical challenges to creating a safe, stable and secure digital currency.\n\nPreviously, MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito had hinted at the forthcoming initiative.\n\n“I’m offering MIT as a neutral academic home for some of the conversations and the technical coordination,” he said, “which I think will give a lot more stability to Bitcoin, which right now is a little bit fragile.”\n\nThe Bitcoin Magazine article noted that there is an overlap between the terms of reference of the MIT Bitcoin Initiative and those of the Bitcoin Foundation, and speculated that, in view of the troubled history of the foundation, the Bitcoin community could welcome MIT as an alternative, prestigious venue for leadership and coordination of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nRecently, Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens wrote that the foundation had been undermined by “two years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought-out decisions” and was “effectively bankrupt.”\n\nIt now appears that MIT is beginning to assume leadership in the Bitcoin development space.“I\'m pleased to announce that I’ve joined the MIT Media Lab’s newly launched Digital Currency Initiative to continue my work on the Bitcoin project,"" Andresen said earlier today. ""I\'m looking forward to working with all the amazing people associated with the initiative,” he says. “Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields, both formerly of the Bitcoin Foundation, have also decided that MIT is the best place to continue their work on Bitcoin Core and have joined the Media Lab as well.”\n\n“Over the last couple of months [it] became obvious that the foundation wouldn\'t be able to raise the funds necessary to continue supporting Wladimir, Cory, and me,” notes Andresen, and adds that MIT hasn’t taken over from the foundation as the center for core development, because “the Bitcoin Foundation was never the center of development.”\n\nAndresen concludes by thanking Ito and Forde for their leadership and support of the Bitcoin community through the Digital Currency Initiative.\n\nForde, MIT Digital Currency Initiative director said he hopes that the MIT initiative will provide the support needed for the digital currency community to help realizing the “tremendous opportunities to increase access to critical financial services for all, create more transparent democracies, and develop services that dramatically reduce barriers for global commerce,” and looks forward to connecting with anyone who has feedback or new research.Bitcoin Magazine will continue to follow this story and publish updates shortly.\n\nImage via Web Summit / CC BY 2.0', 'Bitcoin transactions are exempt from value-added-tax (VAT) in Spain, says Spanish tax lawyer Alejandro Gómez,\n\nThe General Directorate of Taxes, a subsidiary of the Spanish taxing authorities, made the statement in a response to a request from Gómez.\n\nAccording to Gómez, the consultation found that Bitcoin payments were a form of financial service and thus exempt from VAT under the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.\n\nA translated version of the consultation concludes,\n\n“Therefore, we can conclude from the Granton Advertisingjudgment, that of the concept “other negotiable instruments” under the article 135.1.d) of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC, is closely related to payment instruments, which allows the transfer of money. Consequently, those financial services shall be deemed to be VAT-exempt.\n\n“Virtual currencies, such as bitcoin, work as means of payment and, considering its features, shall be considered under the concept ‘other negotiable instruments,’ so its transmission is both liable and exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT).”\n\nThe exemption could be huge for the country’s large Bitcoin community, as it means an end of the possibility of double taxation on Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin payments will not be taxed as a commodity and taxed only once for related services if it is from company.\n\nSpain’s tax authority, Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria, has said very little on the subject of Bitcoin and taxation in the past. Its only announcement was in May of last year, in which it said it was monitoring the use of the digital currency for its potential use by criminals.\n\nVAT and Bitcoin around Europe\n\nVAT and bitcoin have been a heavily dreaded subject among supporters of the digital currency because of the potential of treating bitcoin like a commodity and, thus, Bitcoin transactions being taxed twice – once for the service and once for being a commodity. And as with all things cryptocurrency and law, whether VAT should be applied twice to Bitcoin transactions has been very unclear.\n\nThe European Union has yet to make a decision, but many member countries already have. Estonia and Poland’s tax authorities both have made statements saying Bitcoin transactions are not exempt under Article 135.1.e of the directive 2006/112/EC.\n\nHowever, England and Germany’s tax authorities have said Bitcoin transactions will not be treated to a VAT, stating that the digital currency is either another form of currency or a financial service. Many major European countries, including France and Sweden, have not made statements about the subject yet.\n\nAn Allen and Overy Lawyer\n\nGómez is the founder of lawandbitcoin.com, a website dedicated to news about how law is applied to bitcoin all over the world.

In effect, the Superwallet will allow users to spend BTC, CNY or US dollars at bitcoin-accepting merchants, converting fiat currency to bitcoin only at the point of sale as a means of transmitting the payment and settling the transaction.\n\nThe conversion will come at no additional cost to the user, who will pay a bid/ask spread on the purchase as they would when initiating a purchase with BTC. OKCoin will continue to cover mining fees, while fees for those who use its traditional exchange to access bitcoin as a speculative asset will remain unchanged.\n\nJack Liu, head of OKCoin\'s international division, suggested that the launch of the Superwallet would mark one of the first attempts to encourage the use the bitcoin protocol as a payments rail without requiring users to interface with its currency directly.\n\nOverall, he cautioned that the release is still a beta, and that the wallet is, for now, only as strong as the wider ecosystem with which it will need to interact. However, he expressed optimism that more bitcoin companies would be encouraged to adopt a similar approach when developing future efforts.\n\nLiu told CoinDesk:\n\n""The Superwallet is not branded as a bitcoin currency product. It will highlight the powerful open protocol which will allow users to spend their chosen currency using the bitcoin protocol in the same way the native tokens of the protocol can be spent.""\n\nSuperwallet users who wish to transact in BTC will still be able to do so, a feature Liu believes will maintain the company\'s appeal to bitcoin users while providing benefits to a larger pool of customers.\n\n""It removes the need to believe in deflationary money supply, decentralization, certain political leanings or the need to stay abreast of industry trends or currency movements,"" Liu added.\n\nFinTech focus\n\nThe news comes on the heels of a slew of signals that the formerly trading-focused company was seeking to enter the consumer market. CEO Star Xu first hinted the company was on the verge of shifting focus at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) this January in his inaugural US appearance.\n\nOKCoin went on to experience a string of departures that saw CTO Changpeng Zhao and product manager Zane Tackett leave abruptly for competitors or new endeavors. However, Liu said the Superwallet concept is unrelated to the exits, reiterating that his company is still equally focused on continuing to improve its exchange product.\n\nLiu did, however, suggest the company is on a new path forward in his comments, framing OKCoin as a financial technology company that is more broadly interested in solving problems for mainstream consumers.\n\n""We want to show we\'re innovative, that we\'re not just about speculation,"" Liu continued. ""Bitcoin is an important, important, important part of our FinTech company, but we\'re trying to solve problems.""\n\nLiu\'s comments suggest a frustration with an industry that he implied was too focused on onboarding consumers to bitcoin as a currency.\n\n""This type of thinking is a little narrow, how to help bitcoin users try to avoid volatility. There\'s this other community that wants to have an CNY or fiat wallet and think of a bitcoin address as a zip code or payment code,"" he said, adding:\n\n""I don\'t think the average person wants to be looking at updates from Gavin Andresen and whether he put in new block sizes.""\n\nLimitations for users\n\nAt launch, Liu sees the Superwallet as more useful to its domestic Chinese users, who can connect bank accounts directly to the product, something US users are not able to do.\n\nStill, he said there are workarounds for those who are willing to go through the current levels of friction to initiate USD purchases on the bitcoin network.\n\n""You would buy bitcoin somewhere, including potentially OKCoin, and move the bitcoin to your USD wallet. So you don\'t have to have a bitcoin wallet, just a USD wallet,"" Liu explained.\n\nFrom there, Liu said users can scan bitcoin QR codes with their wallet to pay with fiat at the point of sale. Such new activity, he contends, would bring added liquidity to the network in a boon for bitcoin users.\n\n""We\'re not changing the network. Anyone who wants to use bitcoin can keep using bitcoin,"" Liu added.\n\nFor now, though, he suggested the OKLink wallet is lacking refinement for English-language users. Translations for OKLink are still in development, Liu said, as are supporting versions of the product, such as iOS and Android editions.\n\nDomestic market competition\n\nWhile a change in the thinking of one large bitcoin exchange, it could be argued the Superwallet approaches concepts already being explored by other players in the wider digital currencies space that have attempted to move fiat currencies using open ledgers.\n\nPushing back against these comparisons, Liu argued that payment networks such as those developed by Ripple Labs are still centralized, meaning tokens function as IOUs.\n\nIn this light, Liu framed the Superwallet as an effort that seeks a similar usability while relying more on the bitcoin blockchain as a means to transmit fiat.\n\n""If I send CNY via bitcoin to Circle, Circle owns this BTC and can get exactly the value of USD for that BTC. It does not owe any exposure to me or to any other party. Fiat should be transferred through a decentralized core and OKCoin has committed to that core being bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nIn this way, Liu suggested OKCoin could also compete in China, a market that has traditionally not be viewed as one where bitcoin can win a share of the payments space.\n\nLiu attacked this idea as well, contending that despite the low fees charged by Alipay or UnionPay, OKCoin can appeal to Chinese users who need to transact internationally.\n\n""WeChat is a closed payment system. When a WeChat user arrives in a foreign country for example, he or she will need to install a new wallet,"" Liu argued.\n\nBuilding an ecosystem\n\nUltimately, Liu envisions an ecosystem where bitcoin serves as the rails for international payments and companies like OKCoin act as the on and off ramp for users to convert in and out of different fiat currencies.\n\nHe stressed that the ecosystem needs to come together to enable this economic activity. For example, Liu noted that, today, OKLink users would not be able to send USD to a Circle wallet and have that user receive USD on the other end.\n\nHowever, Liu did outline examples of how OKCoin\'s Superwallet could be useful for users of the bitcoin payroll service Bitwage.\n\n""Now a Chinese person can get Bitwage and the bitcoin goes to a CNY wallet, and they get paid automatically in CNY,"" Liu explained.\n\nLiu also indicated that he doesn\'t see the Superwallet as a viable consumer spending tool at present, given the limited number of merchants on the protocol. For this effort, Liu acknowledged the support of companies like Coinbase and BitPay is needed.\n\nWith this goal in mind, Liu ended by calling on the industry to join together for what he characterized as the greater consumer good, concluding:\n\n""Everyone in this industry should be embracing this concept.""\n\nBlueprint image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Netki wants to help people move away from confusing Bitcoin addresses, such as 15eA82FZLogpSb8nkQ5h5qaF3QNEwSeyCm, toward human-readable names such as kyletorpey.tip.me.\n\nAny bitcoin user would be able to send bitcoin to anyone else as easily as a Gmail user can send an email to someone using a web browser.\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nNetki uses a combination of the Namecoin blockchain and Secure DNS (DNSSEC) to take care of name storage and mapping between a name and an address.\n\n“Your base records reside in the Namecoin blockchain proving ownership, and allowing for full, censor-proof control,” Netki CEO Justin Newton explained via email. “The actual wallet name-to-address lookups occur on standard DNS records secured and authenticated using DNSSEC.\n\n“This combination of decentralized and distributed [solutions] provides the control and ownership of the blockchain along with the privacy of keeping your name to address mapping off of a public ledger,” Newton said.\n\nThe Netki CEO also explained that wallet providers will be able to hand out names in a manner similar to how email addresses are handed out to Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo and other online mail providers. He specifically mentioned ChangeTip’s use of the tip.me domain as an example of this feature.\n\nNewton was also able to share his thoughts on the differences between Netki and another Bitcoin name system, OneName:\n\n“We believe that a lot of what OneName is doing is really fantastic. There is a need for a decentralized way to validate your social identity, and their roadmap feature of using signatures instead of passwords for logins is excellent and long overdue. We do believe, however, that tying your identity to your wallet address on a public ledger negates the possibility of privacy on the blockchain. For us, making it easy to share your address with anyone without having to publish it to everyone is one of the keys to our service. We’d love to see OneName support Wallet Names where they currently support bitcoin addresses.”\n\nA Problem for Privacy?\n\nThe obvious question when talking about name-mapping systems for digital currencies is what it will mean for user privacy. After all, privacy and anonymity are still desirable features for a large number of bitcoin users.\n\nNewton said the protection of privacy was also a concern for Netki, but he added that the use of HD wallets “allows the return of a unique address every time.”\n\nNetki also supports Payment Requests, which are sometimes referred to as the “SSL for wallet addresses.”\n\nNewton explained that the integration of Payment Requests will allow users to see a green lock next to an address in the “To” field of a Bitcoin wallet. That lock helps users confirm that they’re sending bitcoin to the correct individual, organization, or company. This process is similar to the green lock found next to website URLs that have been secured via SSL and an HTTPS connection.\n\n“The combination of HD Wallets and Payment Requests with Wallet Names increases the privacy and security of sending bitcoin, while at the same time making it more user friendly and reassuring to end users,” Newton said.\n\nAn example of this system can be seen in the video below:\n\nIn addition to ChangeTip, Netki has also partnered with Gem, Snapcard, Purse.io, ShapeShift, BitQuick, Coinprism, Fold App, and many other companies in the Bitcoin space.', 'The rapidly growing Latin American social network Taringa! will start paying its content-providing members in bitcoin, offering a service that could boost Bitcoin adoption in the region, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nWith its 75 million users mostly located in Spanish-speaking Latin America, Taringa! (the exclamation mark is part of the name) is the second-most-popular social network after Facebook and one of the main destinations in the Latin American Web. The social network, whose slogan is “Collective Intelligence,” is a hybrid of Facebook and Reddit, offering a crowdsourced social bookmarking and commenting platform similar to Reddit.\n\n“Today we are launching Taringa! Creators, a revolutionary program that allows Taringa! users to receive a monetary compensation for the valuable content they share in our community,” announces Taringa! (in Spanish). “This is a super innovative project, because we will pay in bitcoin: the new virtual currency that works without banks or governments and allows paying via Internet without a credit card or a bank account, instantly and without transaction costs. For that, we signed an agreement with the company Xapo, founded by Argentine entrepreneur Wenceslao Casares, based in Silicon Valley, which offers the virtual Bitcoin wallets where we will transfer the money earned by you, which you will be able to use as you prefer.”\n\nOffering a financial compensation to those who dedicate part of their time to power the social networks that are an increasingly important part of everyone’s online life is certainly revolutionary but also overdue, and bitcoin payments are an ideal implementation. Perhaps other social networks such as Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter will follow.\n\n“Xapo’s partnership with Taringa! implements the largest bitcoin integration the community has yet to see and is a historic moment for both bitcoin and social media,” notes the Xapo announcement. “Top content creators can now earn bitcoin through Taringa!’s Revenue Sharing Program, rewarding users who bring quality content to Taringa!. The platform is supported by a simple one-click integration with Xapo’s secure bitcoin wallet.”\n\nThe initiative is likely to will have a huge impact on Taringa!’s user base, largely under-banked despite having access to smartphones and Internet, and could introduce millions of people across the globe to the benefits of Bitcoin. According to Xapo, the partnership has the potential to quadruple the current number of bitcoin transactions worldwide.\n\nThe traditional payment infrastructure couldn’t support Taringa!’s plans to reward its loyal users for content shared on the social network, and therefore Taringa! had to look for alternatives. Latin America’s “horrendous,” underdeveloped financial system made it impossible to deliver funds, said Taringa!’s co-owner Hernán Botbol. Credit-card networks aren’t developed enough and bank account penetration isn’t deep enough for users to receive payments in their traditional currencies.\n\n“We have had this on our mind, mainly because we think we can bring more people to create great content and also because we think that it’s fair, given that all this that we have is just because our users are creating the content,” said Botbol. “But we never were able to do that because the infrastructure is horrendous – even if you send someone a check, they don’t know what to do with that.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal notes that the initiative, which exploits bitcoin where the traditional financial system is unable to deliver, could be an impetus for wider adoption in the developing world, where many believe digital currencies have their best chance of success.', 'Bitcoin’s consumer appeal and the technical promise of distributed ledgers were hotly debated topics during yesterday\'s FutureMoney event, held in Canary Wharf, London.\n\nThe Blockchain and Beyond panel, moderated by Richard Brown, executive architect for banking industry innovation at IBM, consisted of Jon Matonis, founding member of The Bitcoin Foundation and prominent bitcoin advocate; Chris Gledhill, technologist at Lloyds Banking Group; Robert Sams, CEO of Clearmatics and Mark Smargon, founder of startup Colu.\n\nBrown kicked off the discussion with an attempt to reach consensus on whether digital ledgers such as the blockchain were superior to bitcoin as a currency.\n\nMatonis set out to defend bitcoin as a monetary unit, noting that the separation between the two was a ""cliché"". He was also quick to disregard its unstable price, adding that markets for crude oil and silver were just as volatile.\n\nThe majority of necessary work will take place on the blockchain, he said, because that is where the computational power is:\n\n“I am not saying that it is the only game in town, but I am being a realist and saying that the computational power, the resilience of the hashing is far and away the leader.”\n\nSmargon weighed into to the debate clarifying that the term bitcoin was fairly definitive, whereas blockchain continued to be somewhat vague.\n\nDespite initial optimism about bitcoin\'s growth, Gledhill seemed to side in \'camp blockchain\': “I talk to a lot of my peers and we all get really excited about the intricacies of how the blockchain works as a disruptive potential,"" he said.\n\nSams echoed the sentiment of many naysayers who claim that bitcoin is still in its infancy, adding:\n\n""There are a lot of interesting ideas included in the bitcoin protocol, but … it is going to go through iterations or should go through iterations of innovation before the powerful use cases are found.""\n\nConsumer adoption\n\nWith this in mind, the panel moved on to discuss consumer adoption. Gledhill said that the cryptocurrency space had yet to see ""that killer app"" that would set the tone for future use cases.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the technologist spoke of risk adversity and his bank’s role in safekeeping customers’ funds. He said:\n\n""If you are putting your life savings into a bank you expect us to be responsible. I think with new technologies there is that importance for banks to assess [them] to ensure they are not putting our consumers at risk.""\n\nGledhill continued: ""So unless there is a killer use case for customers that is above what they are using at the moment, then I don’t believe they want it [bitcoin],"" concluding, ""it doesn’t solve a problem and its potential could introduce risk, so why would we adopt it?""\n\nMatonis countered that bitcoin adoption was not going to take place in the developed world. Instead, its real potential lies in parts of the world such as Africa or Argentina, he said, where monetary issuers are unstable and a large of part of the population is unbanked.\n\nStoring digital assets and smart contracts\n\nOne area of conversation focused on whether or not tokens on a blockchain will come to represent real world assets and obligations.\n\n""Right now bitcoin is not an efficient way of storing data, but also storing valuable data in a centralised database poses certain requirements that may be even more complex,"" said Smargon, adding: ""We are also researching use cases which are not financial, because the concept is so big.""\n\nLooking to the future, Colu’s co-founder said that bank hacks would increase, and that this security issue would drive the financial institutions to bitcoin. However, he added that existing technology was not yet sophisticated enough to overcome these issues.\n\nGledhill seemed unconvinced by the proposal of a decentralised register being used to transfer money, although he did note that blockchain technology was a good way of tracking assets.\n\nHe was also vocal about how the buzz around blockchain technologies had created a ""real pressure"" to take business cases and move them on to the ledger, sometimes unnecessarily.\n\nThe panel agreed than not all use cases require decentralised solutions, or anonymous validation. However, Sams added:\n\n""The global state of who owns what is arrived at through layers of reconciliation, message passing – it takes days. Whereas, with distributed consensus you can reach global consensus in minutes.""\n\nThe innovation drive at banks\n\nBrown’s panel was not the only time the buzz surrounding the blockchain appeared during the day-long event.\n\nExecutives from some of Europe’s top banks, including RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, Intesa Sanpaolo and Santander, also discussed the disruptive potential of distributed ledger systems during a wide-ranging discussion on innovation in banking.\n\nTowards the end of the panel, moderator Mateo Rizzi, general partner at SBT Venture Capital, questioned whether banks have a fear of missing out rather than a ""desire to embrace a radical change"".\n\nBelinky, who noted that distributed ledgers could ""transform"" banking, replied: ""We are all very aware that trust is shifting. We [banks] are on the defensive. FinTech and innovation have been accelerated in the last 5 years or so. It’s the topic of the hour.""\n\n""Stay tuned because we will continue doing more things,"" he concluded.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In the interview with CoinTelegraph, Evans discusses his non-profit Conscious Entrepreneurship Foundation, pictures the chain of colorful but unhappy events that put a Bitcoin activist, Michel Espinoza behind the bars, and talks about his position with the court of law. Dr. Evans also explains why Bitcoin today should be taken more seriously as ever.\n\nDr. Charles Evans is Associate Professor of Economics and Finance at Barry University in Miami, Florida, and Founding Director of Conscious Entrepreneurship Foundation—has been involved with virtual currencies for almost two decades.\n\nFirst, from an academic and activist perspective following the release of Digicash\'s eCash in 1995, and later working within some of the gold-backed \'e-currencies\' that followed during the Dot-Com Bubble. After the 9/11 Attacks and the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001, investor interest in this industry essentially fell off the face of the earth, and he returned to academia to teach Economics and Finance.\n\n“[I am] the first expert witness in a criminal case to be paid with Bitcoin.” - Dr. Charles Evans\n\nCoinTelegraph: Tell us about the history of your non-profit.\n\nCharles Evans: After a year-and-a-half of getting together each month to celebrate Bitcoin\'s virtues, the founders of the Miami International Bitcoin meetup group hired an attorney who specializes in non-profit organizations in July 2013 and incorporated Conscious Entrepreneurship Foundation (CEF) in November 2013 to promote virtual currency among the 70-75% of the world\'s population that is unbanked. We received notification of CEF\'s non-profit status on September 11, 2014 making it the second Bitcoin-focused organization in the USA to be granted non-profit status by the IRS. (BitGive was the first.)\n\n“Bitcoin supporters in Africa very actively seek our advice, and watching them adapt to this strange, new, blockchained world is an absolute delight.”\n\nCEF has adopted the Bono Declaration of August 2013 as its motto: ""Capitalism takes more people out of poverty than aid.""\n\nThe majority of our international contacts are in Sub-Saharan Africa, much to our surprise. When we started, we expected that our focus would be on Latin America and the Caribbean. Instead, Bitcoin supporters in Africa very actively seek our advice, and watching them adapt to this strange, new, blockchained world is an absolute delight.\n\nIf the writers at Forbes are correct that African Cheetahs are this generation\'s Asian Tigers, then it looks as though it will be driven by Bitcoin and related technologies.\n\nThrough CEF, we serve as advisers for Dream Bitcoin Foundation in Ghana, and recruit interns here in South Florida for Alakanani Itireleng in Botswana, Philip Agyei Asare in Ghana, and Mustapha Cole in Sierra Leone. Through them, our interns gain access to Bitcoin supporters in Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, who are establishing a Pan-African Bitcoin association.\n\nSeveral of my students already are working on commercial ventures with partners that they have met this way, and I am looking forward to helping these projects move forward.\n\nBut for Bitcoin, the ""Developing World"" might as well have been on another planet, as far as trading with individuals there is concerned. Now, individuals in what we prefer to call the Emerging Middle-Income Regions of the world are able to leapfrog from unbanked to bank-free—as they went from unwired to wireless a generation ago—and to engage in small-scale cross-border trade as equals.\n\n“Michel Espinoza was one of two young men who were arrested in February 2014 for offering to sell bitcoins to undercover police officers in Miami Beach.”\n\nCT: How and why Mr. Espinoza has been arrested and what is your involvement in the case?\n\nCE: Shortly after the first North American Bitcoin Conference (NABC), Michel Espinoza was one of two young men who were arrested in February 2014 for offering to sell bitcoins to undercover police officers in Miami Beach. The cases are separate, although many news accounts imply that they are connected. Anyone who wants to know the specifics of the charges and the evidence against Mr. Espinoza should communicate with his attorney, Rene Palomino in Miami.\n\nAs I understand it, after seeing the burlesque escapades of the NABC—an annual event organized by someone with no ties to South Florida that more closely resembles a frat party than a financial services trade show—local law enforcement investigators came away with a very negative impression of Bitcoin and determined to take steps against it.\n\nWhile the prosecutor\'s decision to move forward is now very unfortunate, it was understandable at the time, considering the vast amount of financial fraud that takes place in this region. If my introduction to Bitcoin had been topless young ladies in gold body paint—however entertaining that otherwise might be—and calls to end the Federal Reserve at a weekend party in Miami Beach, I might have come to similar conclusions.\n\nRemember, this was at the height of the MtGox implosion, when Bitcoin was synonymous with Silk Road among mainstream media talking heads, Charlie Shrem was arrested, and economists like Paul Krugman and Tyler Cowen were predicting Bitcoin\'s impending demise with witty wordplay and economic logic. It was a time when Bitcoin supporters really needed to be putting their best foot forward and not taunting the Eye of Sauron.\n\nRoll the clock ahead one year, and IRS officials have declared bitcoin to be property, like Magic: The Gathering playing cards; former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt is consulting with Bitcoin startups; Kathleen Moriarty—the legendary lawyer who ushered the first exchange traded fund (ETF) through the SEC two decades ago—is handling the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF application; the CFTC has approved several bitcoin derivatives for institutional investors; the SEC has issued Second Market\'s Bitcoin Investment Trust a ticker symbol (GBTC); the New York Stock Exchange and a former CEO of Citigroup have participated in a US$75 million investment in Coinbase; the Governor and former Attorney General of Texas, Greg Abbott, accepted bitcoin during his campaign; and Republican candidate for President in 2016, Rand Paul, is accepting bitcoin for his campaign.\n\nMy role is to explain to the court what Bitcoin is, what it is good for, and why anyone should take it seriously.\n\n“I have agreed to work for Mr. Espinoza, who has paid my fee in bitcoin, which seems only fitting under the circumstances.”\n\nCT: How come you’re being paid in bitcoin?\n\nCE: After meeting with Mr. Espinoza and his attorneys recently, I agreed to speak on his behalf. Again, I hesitate to comment on precisely why I have chosen to be associated with this case, preferring to let Mr. Palomino address the specifics of the case. Suffice it to say that I have agreed to work for Mr. Espinoza, who has paid my fee in bitcoin, which seems only fitting under the circumstances.\n\nAs far as I know, this makes me the first expert witness in a criminal case to be paid with Bitcoin.\n\nMembers of the South Florida Bitcoin community in Miami and Fort Lauderdale are rallying behind Mr. Espinoza to help him set up a website to raise funds for his defense and to enable people to get to know him beyond the lurid headlines.

04/23/2015,"['NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a little noticed move, bitcoin exchange itBit has filed for a banking license in New York, according to the state banking authority.\n\nApproval for the license may come in the next couple of weeks, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, which could make itBit the first bitcoin company to be regulated as a bank in the United States.\n\nThe application is part of itBit’s plan to expand its business into different corners of financial services, and present itself as a trustworthy and reputable company. Right now, itBit operates as an exchange where buyers and sellers trade the bitcoin digital currency.\n\nAfter a series of scandals that have roiled the virtual currency markets, reassuring customers, investors, and bitcoin market participants is critical. Last year, rival Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy after its computer system was hacked, and prominent bitcoin advocates had been accused of money laundering.\n\n“Some highly publicized failures and potentially illegal activity have focused attention on virtual currencies and have highlighted the need for a sound regulatory framework for virtual currencies,” itBit Chief Executive Charles “Chad” Cascarilla said in an October letter to New York’s state banking regulator on an unrelated matter.\n\nItBit, whose exchange operates in Singapore, moved its primary headquarters to New York last year, and hired Erik Wilgenhof Plante from eBay Inc as chief compliance officer. The company’s web site touts its anti-money laundering efforts and “know your customer” credentials, as well as its compliance in all jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\n“Whether fairly or not, companies that work within the regulatory framework are more trusted by customers and partners,” said David Berger, CEO of the Digital Currency Council, an industry advocacy group.\n\nThe bank application for itBit Trust Company LLC lists three bigwigs in government and regulatory circles as “organizers,” including former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Sheila Bair, former Financial Accounting Standards Board director Robert Herz and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. Organizers are responsible for setting up limited liability companies in New York, but do not necessarily hold operating positions within them.\n\nThe application also names Cascarilla as an organizer, as well as his business partner Emil Woods, a former SAC Capital portfolio manager who co-founded the investment firm Cedar Hill Capital Partners with Cascarilla.\n\nBenjamin Lawsky, New York’s superintendent of financial services, has been a vocal advocate of regulating virtual currencies like bitcoin as well as other businesses, like payments, that would operate using the same technology.\n\nThat technology, called blockchain, essentially records every transaction that happens on the system. Transferring cash requires changing an entry in the ledger, but does not require processing by a bank or other intermediary, making it potentially faster and cheaper.\n\nMany on Wall Street and Main Street dismiss unregulated virtual currencies like bitcoin as a wacky concept embraced by paranoiacs, gamblers and bored teenagers. But large companies including International Business Machines Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are looking seriously at applying the technology behind bitcoin to businesses ranging from payments to trading.\n\nCentral banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have also examined blockchain, while major cities including Singapore, London and New York are positioning themselves as bitcoin hubs.\n\n“Many people believe that the real payoff with the bitcoin phenomenon is blockchain and all the various uses it can be put to,” said Jeff Neuburger\u200e, a partner at the law firm Proskauer Rose who specializes in technology. “It will have some impact on the way all kinds of financial services are conducted.”\n\nSpokespeople for itBit and New York’s department of financial services confirmed the company had filed a banking license application but declined further comment. Bair, Herz, Cascarilla and Woods did not respond to requests for comment. Bradley could not be reached for comment.\n\nItBit is backed by venture capitalists including Canaan Partners, RRE Ventures and Liberty City Ventures, where Cascarilla is a partner. Since its founding in 2012, the company has received $3.3 million in a round of fund-raising, according to the startup site CrunchBase.\n\nLately, itBit has been looking to gather more money from investors including Cedar Hill to fund new business ventures, one person briefed on the matter said.\n\n(This story corrects amount of fundraising in second-to-last paragraph to $3.3 million in one round from $6.6 million in two rounds)', '“[O]nly 39% of Latin American users have bank accounts, with Bitcoin we no longer have that barrier.” - Agustina Fourquet, PR manager, Taringa!\n\nLatin American Social Networking Giant Taringa! has started Taringa! Creadores a revenue sharing program to start paying its users bitcoin for their content contributions.\n\nTaringa! is a social networking platform that enables people around the world to create and share information, content and experiences. Taringa! is free, democratic and open, giving users the ability to express themselves without intermediaries or censorship. With its 75 million unique visitors and a registered user base of 27 million people, T! is only second to Facebook in Latin American traffic. This is big news.\n\nWhile their algorithm is not publicly disclosed, it is based on a revenue sharing model where different regions pay different amounts in advertising. According to its FAQ: the US, Spain, Colombia and Mexico are the highest bidders.\n\nXAPO, partnering with Taringa! through a simple one-click integration with its secure wallet hopes this will bring access to a core group of users, which are underbanked and could benefit greatly from Bitcoin’s technology.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke with PR manager, Agustina Fourquet, from Taringa! to find out more.\n\nCoinTelegraph: How did you decide to integrate Bitcoin?\n\nAgustina Fourquet: XAPO is big and for Taringa! this is something historic. For the first time we’re implementing a revenue sharing model, and for our Latin American users something like Bitcoin was indispensable.\n\nThe opportunity came partly because Taringa!’s founder (Hernán Botbol) is living in Mountain View and knows Wences Casares, XAPO’s CEO.\n\nWe had analyzed the situation before, and it was really costly and complicated to use something else. According to our statistics, only 39% of Latin American users have bank accounts, with Bitcoin we no longer have that barrier. We knew the opportunity to partner with XAPO was natural for us.\n\n“[W]ithout any kind of marketing or broadcasting, 2,000 users sent us mails interested in participating.”\n\nCT: How did Taringa! users react to this announcement?\n\nAF: They were surprised, Taringa! is 100% user-generated and until now they were doing it just for the love of it, for points and to share the things they like.\n\nWe have users in all Latin America, the US and Spain. The first day that Taringa! Creadores was launched, in less than 24 hours, without any kind of marketing or broadcasting, 2,000 users sent us mails interested in participating.\n\n“[W]e believe that those users who do well might be earning about 4 to 5k Argentine Pesos a month.”\n\nCT: With this, Taringa! is in a way becoming an employer in the region. How much could a T! user aspire to earn with your platform?\n\nAF: The idea is that in short/mid term, these users can acquire an additional bit of income, maybe not their main income. According to some of our stats obtained from running simulations, we believe that those users who do well might be earning about 4 to 5k Argentine Pesos a month (1.42-1.77 BTC, a standard minimum wage in Argentina).\n\nThe first payment is going to be accredited next week. We were thinking about how we would shape our payment schedule; and we’ve settled on a weekly basis with payouts to be likely on Mondays.\n\nCT: How will this program be deployed?\n\nAF: For the first stage, Taringa! will inject 750,000 US dollars (~3147.82 BTC) that will be dispensed according to how this undertaking evolves. After that, we will continue with a revenue share model using a percentage only know to us, but surpassing the average of other revenue sharing models we’ve seen. Maybe at a future date we will reveal what that percentage is; for the moment we feel it’s too soon.\n\nWe are going to start with a closed invitation for 1,000 users that will have the opportunity to invite 4 users more, via facebook, e-mail, twitter and else; maybe inviting people that already monetize their contents in other platforms and are not Bitcoin users yet.\n\n“We believe that it is fair to encourage users that generate quality content.”\n\nCT: This could open opportunities for abuse within that publishing model. How are you going to control this?\n\nAF: In the first place, every participant has to be registered, completing a form for Taringa! Compradores. It has to be a person that can be individualized, when in the past the contributors were anonymous, now they will have to provide their full names. Once the registration is complete, they will obtain a XAPO wallet.\n\nWe believe that it is fair to encourage users that generate quality content. In addition to having a team of moderators aware of flagged and reported content, it will have to comply with our Terms and Conditions. There’s a no-crap policy in place.\n\nCT: What do you think about this announcement?\n\nAF: I think it’s wonderful, first of all, for the Taringa! brand itself, because this is showing what Taringa! is. It is known by name, but most people do not know what it does or why it is used. Taringa! has lots of people sharing things with others.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The move means that Andresen, as well as core Maintainer Wladimir van der Laan and Developer Cory Fields, will no longer receive their salary from the foundation. Instead, they will be funded by MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, which also seeks to provide a stable platform for the developers to work from. The MIT Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory headed by Joi Ito—who is know for his interest in Bitcoin—while the Digital Currency Initiative was launched only last week, and is headed by former White House advisor Brian Forde.\n\nThe switch for Andresen, Van der Laan and Fields comes in the wake of a hectic month for the Bitcoin Foundation. Earlier this month, newly elected board member Olivier Janssens exposed the dire financial situation at the foundation, after which the foundation publicized plans to split up into a promotional body, a development body, and an additional standards body specifically geared towards the standardization of the Bitcoin protocol. Ito then proposed to host a Bitcoin standards body at MIT’s Media Lab. It now seems like this idea has spun into actually host a Bitcoin development body instead, although Forde emphasized that MIT will officially be doing neither.\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, Forde said:\n\n“The Digital Currency Initiative is not hosting a development NOR a standards body. [Andresen, Van der Laan and Fields] have accepted positions at the Media Lab to continue developing [Bitcoin core]—a community-driven free software project. As I mentioned in my post, we want them to do exactly what they were doing before— write the code that maintains and improves Bitcoin core. We look forward to providing them with a stable platform and the resources needed to allow them to best support the community.”\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation, which was founded in 2012, has always been controversial in the sphere, as some feared that the organization could become a centralizing force in the decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem. Janssens in particular has been a vocal opponent of the foundation's mission to fund core development, which is why he awarded Mike Hearn's Lighthouse project with US$50,000, hoping it could replace the foundation. More recently, Janssens got elected to the board of the foundation on a platform that promised to divorce the foundation from the development of Bitcoin.\n\nIn his blog post, Andresen responded to this presumed centralization of power at the foundation, and sought to ease similar concerns that MIT could now become such a centralized power:\n\n“The Bitcoin Foundation was never the center of development; the Bitcoin core open-source software project has been the center, and like most open-source software projects, the developers who work on Bitcoin core are supported in many different ways. Some work for companies that want to see Bitcoin succeed, some for nonprofits, and many are self-funded and self-motivated.”\n\nThe Media Lab's primary source of funding comes from corporate sponsorship. Typically, the lab asks sponsors to fund general themes. Specific members of the lab's faculty and research staff often also assist the sponsor companies in deriving the benefits from their sponsorship.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Here’s a contribution from Felix Salmon, who, after years of blogging on finance and the economy for Reuters and other outlets, is now a senior editor at Fusion.\n\nNathaniel Popper’s new book, Digital Gold, is as close as you can get to being the definitive account of the history of Bitcoin. As its subtitle proclaims, the book tells the story of the “misfits” (the first generation of hacker-libertarians) and “millionaires” (the second generation of Silicon Valley venture capitalists) who were responsible for building Bitcoin, mining it, hyping it, and, in at least some cases, getting rich off it.\n\nThe tale is selective, of course: Not everybody involved with Bitcoin talked to Popper, and the identity of Bitcoin’s inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains a mystery. But Popper did talk to most of the important people in the cryptocurrency crowd, and he tells me that he put real effort into trying “to find a woman who was involved in some substantive way.”\n\nThe result of that search? Zero. Nothing. Zilch. Popper’s book features no female principals at all: The sole role of women in the book is as wives and girlfriends.\n\nThere are nasty consequences of this. If you are a woman involved with Bitcoin, you are invariably going to get treated like an outsider. As Victoria Turk says, “it seems that the only Bitcoin community that particularly welcomes female participation is the NSFW subreddit r/GirlsGoneBitcoin,” which is basically a site where women get paid in cryptocurrency to pose nude. Or look at Arianna Simpson’s enraging account of what it’s like to be a woman at a Bitcoin meetup:\n\nThe person who actually suggested the event to Ryan was another young woman (the only other woman at the event), a VC who was in town from San Francisco and was interested in checking it out for the first time. The aforementioned groper knew Ryan vaguely from other Bitcoin events, and greeted their arrival with a warm “Oh, nice to see you! I see you brought your girlfriend this time.” When the two of them try to point out that a) they are not together and b) she was actually the one who had brought him, they are cut off with a swift “Sure, sure, I just wanted to see what the dynamic was between you two.” Apparently that’s code for “checking if you’re ok with my hitting on her,” as that’s exactly what he proceeds to do.\n\nMen make up an estimated 96 percent of the Bitcoin community, which means that if Bitcoin does end up succeeding, as its adherents think it will, and if the people who own Bitcoin see their holdings soar in value, then all of the profits will end up going to what Brett Scott calls the “crypto-patriarchy.” Not many men, to be sure: As Charlie Stross says, the degree of inequality in the Bitcoin economy “is ghastly, and getting worse, to an extent that makes a sub-Saharan African kleptocracy look like a socialist utopia.” But it’s not many men, and effectively zero women.\n\nPopper doesn’t dwell on the almost complete absence of women in the Bitcoin story—in fact, he doesn’t mention it at all in his book. And the Bitcoin elite themselves aren’t doing much introspection on the topic. (We still have Bitcoin developers like the one in Simpson’s article saying things like “women don’t care about cryptocurrencies.”) But the gender gap is a bigger problem than Bitcoiners realize. Unless and until women can be brought into the Bitcoin fold, broader adoption is simply not going to happen.\n\nIf you talk about Bitcoin with the people who use it, the language they use is always about technology and finance. Bitcoiners tend to think in terms of how things work, rather than how they’re used in the real world. Buying and selling Bitcoin is still much more difficult than it should be, despite many years of development, which implies that people aren’t concentrating enough on real-world ease-of-use.\n\nIn general, people buy Bitcoin for one of three reasons: because they’re speculating on its future value, because they are doing something illegal, or because they have ideological reasons for doing so. But if there’s ever going to be broad adoption of Bitcoin technology, it will need to be appealing to law-abiding people who neither know nor care what the blockchain is, and who have no particular beef whatsoever with fiat currencies.\n\nThat’s a product design job, and frankly, it’s a product design job well suited for women who aren’t approaching the problem while grinding the ideological axes so widely held inside the Bitcoin community. As one woman involved with Bitcoin put it to me, “Money is a political issue for Bitcoiners. It’s a human issue for everybody else.”\n\nRight now, Bitcoin is almost purpose-built for the $582 billion international remittances market, where women are half of the senders, and two-thirds of the recipients. And while there is no shortage of Bitcoin-based remittance products out there, none of them seem to be designing for real-world use cases. The developers are solving technical problems, and ignoring the much bigger and more important human problems.\n\nLet’s say you wanted to build a mobile savings app in sub-Saharan African. If you asked male Bitcoin developers to build such a thing for a target audience of young African girls, they might have talked about how to maximize the amount of money saved. But, working on the ground in South Africa, the Praekelt Foundation came from a different perspective. Apps like these aren’t really about maximizing savings, so much as they’re about empowerment. If you can build a product for girls that ratifies their identity and individuality and gives them self-esteem, then you’re creating something much more valuable than a few dollars’ worth of savings: You’re keeping them in school, and you’re keeping them healthy, and you’re helping them to not get pregnant. That’s the kind of way that cryptocurrencies could change the world. The problem is that the men in Popper’s book just don’t think that way.\n\nBitcoin boosters like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen have an interesting reaction when people criticize Bitcoin on the grounds that the community is just male nerds. Yes, they say, it is—just like the internet was, 20 years ago. In other words, far from treating the homogeneity of Bitcoin as a problem, they treat it as being auspicious. And, so far at least, there’s no evidence that they’re really attempting to fix the problem.\n\nThe lack of women in Bitcoin isn’t just an issue of equality. It’s a fundamental weakness of the currency itself. As long as the Bitcoin community is dominated by men geeking out about the blockchain, it’s never going to be able to make the human connections that are required for widespread adoption. Right now, the best that anybody can hope for (and no one’s holding their breath even for this) is that a handful of female geeks might be welcomed into the clique of male geeks who are working on Bitcoin-related projects.\n\nBut even if that happens, it’s not even close to being sufficient. Bitcoin, at its core, is an attempt to solve big socioeconomic problems through technology. So long as it remains an overwhelmingly male domain, it’s going to continue to concentrate on the economic problems, while missing the big social problems. Which means that it’s going to continue going nowhere.', 'Spain\'s bitcoin community is celebrating following confirmation that the cryptocurrency is exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in the country.\n\nBitcoin had always been exempt from VAT, but a spokesperson from Spain\'s tax office, Ministerio de Hacienda, told CoinDesk the decision had been clarified following a question from a bitcoin aficionado.\n\nThe confirmation is based on the interpretation of EU VAT Directive 2006/112/CE, which recognises bitcoin as ""financial service"".\n\nBoth bitcoin startups and legal experts in Spain are praising the administration\'s decision, which provides clarity in an otherwise uncertain regulatory climate.\n\nPablo Fernández Burgueño, an expert in e-commerce law and the co-founder of Abanlex, said the exemption seemed ""logical"". He told CoinDesk:\n\n""Bitcoin is mostly being used as a speculative tool, only a minority are using it as a payment form, because of this the tax office would find it impossible to levy VAT for every bitcoin transaction.""\n\nDaniel Diez, business development manager at bitcoin-to-cash service Bit2Me, added that bitcoin startups would now be able to plan their financial strategy more effectively. He said:\n\n""It is great news for [bitcoin] companies because previously, the legal uncertainty around the subject was very high and it could lead to financial planning errors. We hope to see institutions giving more positive [bitcoin related] news that facilitates bitcoin\'s adoption.""\n\nWith Spanish banks BBVA and Bankinter now investing in bitcoin companies, Alberto Gómez Toribio, CEO and co-founder of Coinffeine, said the country was ""one of the best places in the world"" for crypto-entrepreneurs.\n\nLike others, he praised the Spanish government\'s ability to understand the challenges being faced by companies in the bitcoin space.\n\n""The country\'s public institutions are aware that in order to stimulate the bitcoin sector, flexibility and being open to discussion with experts in the field is important. They [public institutions] are doing a very good job.""\n\nRamifications of the exemption\n\nAccording to Fernández, startups can now create business plans with more transparency, fully aware of what kind of taxes they are expected to pay, how much profit they can generate and how to trade in bitcoin.\n\n""The government\'s decision will actively boost the Spanish bitcoin market,"" he added.\n\nThe lawyer also noted other ramifications of the long-awaited confirmation.\n\nAs Spanish citizens are subject to Spanish law, those purchasing the digital currency from companies in Poland or Estonia – the latter levies a 20% tax on those trading bitcoins as a service and the former imposed a 23% VAT on bitcoin mining profits – would still be exempt from paying VAT.\n\n""Those who have previously paid VAT for bitcoin purchases can now refer to Hacienda (the Tax Office) to request a refund,"" Fernández added.\n\nThe application of VAT to bitcoin services has proved somewhat of a grey area in the European Union.\n\nNotably, the tax office\'s definition of bitcoin as a ""financial service, linked to payment methods which enable the transfer of money"" and the assumption that bitcoin transfers are considered to be ""special risk"" activities, means that all Spanish companies operating with the digital currency will have to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) rules.\n\nHat tip: Law and Bitcoin.\n\nSpanish flag image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Representatives from Neucoin have not yet responded to press inquiries.\n\nDogecoin founder and Adobe senior manager Jackson Palmer has announced he is taking an ""extended leave of absence"" from the cryptocurrency community.\n\nCalling the ecosystem ""toxic"", Palmer used the occasion to blast aspects of the industry, while encouraging users of dogecoin not to lose sight of its fun and playful roots. Launched in December 2013, dogecoin quickly became one of the more popular alternative digital currencies, though its community has recently seen a decline in enthusiasm.\n\nIn statements, Palmer suggested that the industry is in the midst of a period of stagnation due to the ideologies of the individuals it is attracting, as well as what he characterized as the poor quality of startups founded by new participants in the space.\n\nPalmer told CoinDesk:\n\n""All in all, the cryptocurrency space increasingly feels like a bunch of white libertarian bros sitting around hoping to get rich and coming up with half-baked, buzzword-filled business ideas which often fail in an effort to try and do so.""\n\nPalmer went on to suggest the amount of venture capital in the space, which hit record volumes in Q1 2015, was playing a role by increasing the amount of ""anger-fuelled attacks"".\n\n""I don\'t have time for it anymore,"" he added.\n\nDemographic issues\n\nThe Australian native went on to present his opinion that digital currency participants have done little to create a community that is inclusive to all, citing the recent support of Kentucky Senator and US Tea Party member Rand Paul as evidence.\n\n""The community is very white male dominated, and there are a lot of anarcho-libertarian beliefs caught up in there which I really don\'t agree with,"" Palmer said.\n\nThe comments suggest that despite the influx of new participants into the ecosystem as a result of dogecoin\'s success, Palmer believes these individuals have been turned off by the activities of those in the space.\n\nNotably, Palmer\'s comments echo those of observers in the space, including media outlets like Fusion, which commented on bitcoin\'s perceived male-dominance in a recent article.\n\nBusiness follies\n\nPalmer also took aim at businesses in the digital currency industry for its lack of progress in bringing the technology to the masses.\n\n""I\'ve yet to see a bitcoin business receive VC funding that has a provable business model (ie: one that generates profit) outside of exchanges and merchant services who simply take a slice of their customers\' business,"" he said.\n\nCalling it a ""hotbed for scams"", Palmer also expressed an overall fatigue at stories indicating that people have lost money. In tweets, he further expressed his love of the traditional payments service Venmo as well as for the ecosystem as a whole, suggesting he still sees long-term value in the underlying technology.\n\n""Those charges merchants incur on traditional credit card payments? They exist for a reason, and that\'s insurance against fraud protection,"" he continued, adding:\n\n""I like the idea of being able to reverse charges if my bank account is ever compromised, personally.""\n\nImage via Hackadoge\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Digital Currency Council (DCC) and Coin Report have done surveys to get consumer opinion on its progress. As Bitcoin has grown, so have the corporate players involved, and the number of countries using Bitcoin worldwide. Now, financial giant ING has integrated Bitcoin into a massive mobile banking survey that covered most of Europe, with over 12,400 people responding to questions about Bitcoin, and it’s future in the mobile user space.\n\nBitcoin Survey: The countries attracted to Bitcoin\n\nING is a global financial institution with a strong European base, offering banking services with over 53,000 employees. They provide retail and commercial banking services to customers in over 40 countries, so they have a lot of access to consumers who may use Bitcoin now and in the future. This is their second annual International Survey, and more proof that Bitcoin is having a global impact on finance and technology if ING feels the need to integrate Bitcoin questions into their consumer surveys. The survey is from last year, and another one is expected soon, so we’ll update these numbers when we get more information. The countries charted include Romania, France, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, Italy, The United Kingdon, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, Poland, Netherlands, and Turkey.\n\nOverall, about one in four, 24%, of the over twelve thousand people surveyed in Europe believe Bitcoin and digital currencies will be the future of money online. 38% disagree and 38% had no opinion. The country of Turkey did the most online banking of any country surveyed and was the most interested in Bitcoin, with 36% saying it is the future of spending online versus just 24% disagreeing. The country that does the next most online banking, The Netherlands, is also the most negative towards Bitcoin, with only one in twelve people thinking Bitcoin has a big future in online commerce, 57% giving it the thumbs down. Italy and Poland were the other two countries to have a more positive than negative verdict for Bitcoin going forward, with about half those surveyed having no opinion of it.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Survey: 1 in 4 Bitcoin Users Defrauded by Exchanges\n\nIn addition, Forklog, the Russian Bitcoin magazine, conducted their own survey earlier this month of almost 800 people to get their pulse on Bitcoin use. 80% of the respondents were from Russia and another 10% from the Ukraine. It seems from those responding that Bitcoin is somewhat popular in Russia, even though it is facing a ban from The State.\n\nAlmost 40% plan on putting their savings into Bitcoin, but have not as of yet. About one in four currently save up to 20% of their money in Bitcoin, and almost 10% put it all in Bitcoin. 28% say they will not be saving in Bitcoin. Over 90% of Russians have negative feelings towards the Russian government for attempting to ban Bitcoin. More than seven out of ten intend to use it even if they may get in legal trouble for doing so. 20% said that Russian laws making it illegal would keep them from using Bitcoin.\n\nTwo out of three Russians would not actively participate in getting Bitcoin legalized nationally while about a quarter would contact government or sign petitions. 10% said they would do whatever it takes to make it legal. More than half said they do not trust Bitcoin exchanges due to exchange risk, but almost 40% do actively use Bitcoin exchanges. 14% keep their Bitcoin in exchange wallets. 45% believe that Bitcoin’s Block Chain technology will change the world within 20 years. 56% see the price staying within $200-1000 USD this year.\n\nImages provided by Shutterstock, ING and Forklog.\n\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s results in these surveys? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'South African Bitcoin startup Bankymoon has built the world’s first blockchain smart metering solution for modern power and utility grids, VentureBurn reports.\n\nThe startup outlined its plans in a presentation titled “Smart Grids and the Blockchain – Bitcoin’s first killer App” at the recent Bitcoin Conference Africa in Cape Town, South Africa. Lorien Gamaroff, founder and CEO of Bankymoon, is expected to give another presentation on May 14 at the Bitcoin Conference in Prague.\n\nModern “smart grids” permit efficient management of supply and demand, with Internet-connected “smart meters” that react to changing conditions and can be topped in real-time in case of need. According to Gamaroff, by 2023 most power grids will be smart: 80 percent of the grids in the United States, 60 percent in Europe and 45 percent in the Asia Pacific region.\n\n“You’d think that with all the smartness happening in our grid, that the problems are solved,” said Gamaroff. “But, in fact, this brings us to the most difficult and biggest problem of all, which is payments. Your grid could be as smart as you like but if all customers aren’t paying, it’s worthless and it becomes unsustainable and will collapse.”\n\nBankymoon, founded in 2015, specializes in deep integration of bitcoin payments into current processes.\n\n“The power of bitcoin lies in the ability to program functionality to automatically respond to payment transactions,” notes the Bankymoon website. “Unlike bank accounts, Bitcoin addresses can be monitored by predefined processes which can trigger automated actions. These actions can form part of a workflow which will only proceed once Bitcoin transaction has been detected.”\n\nBankymoon’s smart meters have their own Bitcoin addresses. When a smart meter receives a Bitcoin payment, Bankymoon calculates the tariff and then loads the meter. Bankymoon’s integration of Bitcoin payments into smart metering systems for modern grids allows users to “send” electricity, water and gas to anybody else in the world, from anywhere, by topping their utility meters.\n\n“Imagine a student abroad who needs to have their meter topped up,” said Gamaroff. “They’d phone their parent and ask them to send money. The parent now doesn’t have to remit anything. They can just go and top up the meter using bitcoin.”\n\nThe same model permits donating to worthy recipients, for example schools and hospitals, by directly contributing to their utility bills.\n\nBesides the “programmable money” features of Bitcoin, the existence of large unbanked populations in the developing world shows the benefits of bitcoin payment integration in smart grids. Bankymoon’s solution bypasses banks and credit cards – which many users don’t have access to – and, using an Internet of Things (IoT) approach, goes directly to the smart metering devices.\n\nAccording to Gamaroff, the application of Bitcoin to smart metering shows how deeply digital currencies can pervasively and positively impact societies. “This [solution] is potentially game-changing for driving bitcoin adoption,” he said.', ""Hacker, mad man, homophobe, troll—a few weeks ago, after a six month investigation by the FBI and the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Randall Charles Tucker was arrested and charged with felony computer tampering.\n\nWhen we spoke to Mr. Tucker—also known as “Bitcoin Baron”—last month, he was on a roll, taking down small-town municipal websites and sticking it to police officers, even when he was totally off-base with his accusations. At the time, we didn’t know the extent of his activities. But then, neither did the FBI.\n\nFuck Prison, Fuck the System, Fuck all you officers and fuck you government. — Dead Acc (@_Bitcoin_Baron_) March 29, 2015\n\nChat transcripts, videos, photos and information obtained by the New York Observer reveal that Bitcoin Baron wasn’t just a sloppy hacker. He was a violent collector of child pornography and, quite possibly, mentally ill—but we’ll get to that part later. So how did he evade capture until someone simply tweeted out his name?\n\nLet’s begin in October, 2014…\n\nThe long road to catching the Internet’s most inept criminal\n\nThe Bitcoin Baron saga started when an operation by hacker group Anonymous, #OpHongKong, sent a video to D.C.-based video news site News2Share on October 8th, 2014. When it blew up and caught over 300,000 views, News2Share’s Ford Fischer received an email from Bitcoin Baron.\n\nOn October 8th, Bitcoin Baron emailed Mr. Fischer from an email address called “settheworldfree999@gmail.com”—at this point going by aliases like “ZeusAres” and “Key Last.” He wanted Mr. Fischer to upload a video of his, which was labeled “Anonymous,” but clearly of inferior quality.\n\n“Presumably, his feeling was, ‘If these guys put up my video, it will magically become viral as well,'” Mr. Fischer told the Observer, “But that’s not obviously going to be the case if it’s shit.”\n\nAt first, Mr. Fischer didn’t even see the email. In only a few hours, Bitcoin Baron issued a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on News2Share, taking down the site for not complying immediately with his demand. Mr. Fischer ended up uploading the site just to make the problem go away. It received less than 500 views.\n\nMr. Fischer didn’t hear from Bitcoin Baron again for another two months, when he popped up again with the “Bitcoin Baron” alias and YouTube channel. The channel is covered with various videos: threats against government agencies, terrible raps, and records of rudimentary DDoS attacks—many of the videos have been taken down in the past few months, without explanation. The Baron continued threatening News2Share, but by then moved on to issuing threats against the site Counter Current News.\n\nFrom then on, he started ramping up his activity. With March 2015 being his period of peak activity, Bitcoin Baron took on the following projects:\n\nDemanded 100 bitcoins from the city of Moore, Oklahoma to demand justice for a man who died in police custody.\n\nDowned a number of IRC chat rooms for other hacktivists and gaming groups.\n\nAttacked the website of a children’s hospital.\n\nTook down a municipal site in Texas to demand a local police officer be put in jail. The officer had already been jailed one year prior to the threat.\n\nDowned a number of Tor hidden services sites that hosted child pornography (we’ll get to that later).\n\nBitcoin Baron was long-time player of Sherwood Dungeon, a free online game where he fell in with a gaming group called “)T(“. While he was attacking municipalities and threatening reporters, he was in a Skype group where he would gloat and attempt to shock the other members of the chat—the Observer obtained these chat transcripts.\n\nAfter his attack on the City of Madison, for example, he complained that the first news reporters misattributed his attack to Anonymous—a common mistake among general assignment reporters who don’t know anything about hacktivism. From the chat transcripts in his gaming community:\n\n[3/10/2015 11:37:49 AM] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: AnonFags keep stealing mycredit\n\n[3/10/2015 11:37:54 AM] Måns: again?\n\n[3/10/2015 11:37:58 AM] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: Not the bank one\n\n[3/10/2015 11:38:00 AM] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: but the previous one\n\n[3/10/2015 11:38:05 AM] Måns: ah\n\n[3/10/2015 11:38:10 AM] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: ‘Anonymous’ says it’s responsible for cyberattack on City of Madison\n\n[3/10/2015 11:38:16 AM] Måns: xd\n\n[3/10/2015 11:38:20 AM] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: fucking queers\n\n[3/10/2015 11:38:41 AM] Måns: anonymous wants the D\n\n[3/10/2015 11:38:49 AM] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: ikr\n\n[3/10/2015 11:40:02 AM] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: Gonna threaten this news article bitches\n\nIn public, he maintained a Twitter account and YouTube channel to promote his work, and reached out to the press repeatedly to draw more attention to his work. According to Arizona DPS and the FBI, a tweet was sent publicly—and accurately—that claimed Bitcoin Baron’s name was Randy Tucker and that he had “no skill.”\n\nHe was arrested the same day.\n\nHacker without a cause\n\nWhen we spoke to Bitcoin Baron last month, he positioned himself as a crusader against police injustice, municipal mismanagement and the corrupt, going after “anything [he could] find really that’s got something to do with innocent citizens in the crosshairs of police.”\n\nInstead, Bitcoin Baron—like many hacktivists whose placebo politics lead them from one hot cause to another—really just wanted to do damage. When a man died in police custody in Moore, Oklahoma, Bitcoin Baron took down the city’s municipal website with a ransom of 100 bitcoins. Regardless of the fact that $28,000—the amount 100 bitcoin was worth at the time—is an absurd ransom for a small-town website, Bitcoin Baron was unable to articulate exactly how paying him was supposed to right any wrongs.\n\nHe didn’t, of course, get his money.\n\nHe attacked municipalities, gaming services, hospitals, web hosts and other hacking groups as his targets and goals shifted. And regardless of his hatred of Anonymous, he also casually participated in #OpSeaWorld, an Anonymous operation largely inspired by the documentary Blackfish, which exposed the widespread kidnap and abuse of killer whales.\n\nBitcoin Baron, who in his spare time is the worst rapper on the Internet—let’s call him the Bitcoin Baron of the rap game—even made the following rap video in honor of the op:\n\nBut one of the most inexplicable motifs in Bitcoin Baron’s shenanigans is his relationship to child pornography. A member of )T( who goes by “Andreas” said that Bitcoin Baron “likes child porn a lot,” and Bitcoin Baron has gleeful collected it, though there are currently no charges against him for possessing it.\n\n[3/12/2015 12:27:53 PM] ?ëV?ÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: oh fuck yes\n\n[3/12/2015 12:27:55 PM] ?ëV?ÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: girls hub is back\n\n[3/12/2015 12:28:03 PM] ?ëV?ÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: moar CP = fun\n\nOn March 12th, Bitcoin Baron attacked the website for the Shriners Hospitals for Children organization. People who chatted with Bitcoin Baron claim that the site for the children’s hospital was not just taken down, but defaced with child pornography—the Shriner’s Hospital couldn’t be reached for comment.\n\n[3/12/2015 8:04:49 PM] ÐëVîÎZ Bitcoin Baron: Who wants to see thechildrens hospital getting DDoSed?\n\n[3/12/2015 8:05:29 PM] Van: dont do it devilz\n\n[3/12/2015 8:05:37 PM] ÐëVîÎZ Bitcoin Baron: already am\n\n[3/12/2015 8:05:38 PM] ÐëVîÎZ Bitcoin Baron: LOL\n\n[3/12/2015 8:05:38 PM] Van: thats so wrong\n\n[3/12/2015 8:05:41 PM] Van: stop\n\n[3/12/2015 8:05:49 PM] – intrusi0n: lol\n\n[3/12/2015 8:05:55 PM] Van: destroying a place that helps children isreally cold blooded\n\n[3/12/2015 8:06:05 PM] Van: how could you do that\n\n[3/12/2015 8:06:17 PM] ÐëVîÎZ Bitcoin Baron: I’m heartless\n\n[3/12/2015 8:10:43 PM] Kozy: don’t do it\n\n[3/12/2015 8:10:48 PM] ÐëVîÎZ Bitcoin Baron:https://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/\n\n“The same thing was the case to our chat,” Andreas said. “He attempted to spam it with CP, and as no admins were\n\non at the time, it was a war to keep changing it back until he got bored.”\n\nFor many in Bitcoin Baron’s tiny online community, that was the moment they were totally unable to go on tolerating him, and he was soon banned.\n\nWithin the week, Bitcoin Baron started collaborating with @TorReaper, an Anon who takes down sites hosted on Tor’s hidden services network—in this case, child pornography sites, including Girls Hub, the site he’d celebrated in private chats:\n\nBy the end of March, the Baron had latched onto the #OpDeathEaters campaign, an ongoing Anonymous operation convinced that there is an international pedosadist ring permeating Western oligarchy—obviously a discussion for another time.\n\nThis isn’t to say that Bitcoin Baron is, necessarily, a pedophile. Rather, child porn is another tool in the outreach and outrage kit. Child porn is an expedient, incendiary way to wreak havoc and lash out.\n\nMadness and Ineptitude\n\nIf his muted rap lyrics are to be believed, he spent two weeks in a “mental hospital” after he was arrested for aggravated assault for stabbing his father. And just a couple of days before the first time we spoke to him, Bitcoin Baron went into his Skype chat and threatened to kill himself, bragging to the chat room and seeking shock and validation:\n\n[11/03/15 20.24.57] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: 6 pills down\n\n[11/03/15 20.25.06] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: wanna watch?\n\n[11/03/15 20.25.10] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: xD\n\n[11/03/15 20.26.15] ?: Sure\n\n[11/03/15 20.26.18] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: LOL\n\n[11/03/15 20.26.20] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: kk hold on\n\n[11/03/15 20.26.40] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: you think im bsing right?\n\n[11/03/15 20.26.45] ?: Not really\n\n[11/03/15 20.26.47] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: lmao\n\n[11/03/15 20.26.53] ?: a bit maybe since a lot of people have faked\n\nsuicide\n\n[11/03/15 20.26.59] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: lol well im trying to do it\n\n[11/03/15 20.27.09] ?: show it then\n\nAt this point, Bitcoin Baron turned on his video to show everyone the pills he was downing. One friend pulled up Snapchat and recorded the apparent suicide attempt and sent it to another member of the Skype group:\n\n[11/03/15 20.30.03] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: my eyes are watering\n\n[11/03/15 20.30.04] ?: don’t throw up big boy\n\n[11/03/15 20.30.15] ÐëVîÎZ – Bitcoin Baron: this is fucked up shit\n\n[11/03/15 20.30.21] ?: so stop doing it\n\nBitcoin Baron wasn’t a hacker mastermind, either. He had a functional understanding of how to use encryption tools and onion routing, which anyone could learn in an afternoon from a handful of tutorials on YouTube. Mr. Fischer suspects that the tools he used to take down various websites were all of the plug-and-play variety. All he needed to perform the DDoS was to find a tool, plug in a URL, and watch the site go down.\n\nReally, there isn’t a worthwhile skill or capability in Bitcoin Baron’s tool belt. The tool he used to make his videos is Camtasia, a laughably rudimentary video capture tool. His videos, which are mostly just still images with audio, instead of being a single image frame seem to be a rolling screen recording of a still image on his desktop—in one previously public video, you can actually see the mouse moving across the screen.\n\nSo how did this potentially insane, technically inept pseudo-hacker cause so much damage? Because causing damage has become so easy. Too often, we believe that because so many people do not cause damage on the Internet, it is because they are unable. Everything from sophisticated breaches to spamming and trolling on social media have become easier because as life has become more digital, both the tools of attack and the vulnerability to those attacks are in everyone’s hands.\n\n“If you have distributed powers of defense, but also distributed powers of offense, you’re in a situation where you are much more secure on average, but if somebody really wanted to get you, they can do really bad things,” Benjamin Wittes, co-author of The Future of Violence, told the Observer last month. “So you’re simultaneously more and less secure, depending on who you are and who your enemies are.”\n\n“He was trying to make it seem like part of some network the whole time,” Mr. Fischer said. “It seemed like he wanted to have a sense of belonging. It makes sense that he’s not a socially adaptive young man, and it seems like he was taking that out on the Internet.”"", ""As consumers' adoption of bitcoin continues to increase and a number of major retailers have decided to accept the virtual currency, alarming cases of fraud with bitcoins continue to emerge. Because bitcoin transactions are irreversible and not overseen by a central authority or bank, bitcoins are a popular vehicle for fraud and theft.\n\nBitcoin scams are often initially promoted in online forums or chat rooms, with promoters creating an elaborate front to convince investors they are legitimate. The following are five of the most common scams involving bitcoin:\n\n1. Bitcoin Ponzi Schemes and High-Yield Investment Programs. These scams lure people in with promises of high interest rates on deposits. As with other Ponzi schemes, early investors are paid out using investments from later investors. When new investors stop joining and payments cannot be made, the scheme collapses. These scams last often only a couple of months, but the organizers are prone to simply repeat the whole process again afterwards.\n\n2. Bitcoin Mining Investment Scams. Bitcoin mining involves validating transactions and providing security for the public ledger, known as the blockchain. This process requires extremely powerful and expensive computer equipment. The mining scams typically involve orders for equipment that are paid for in advance and never delivered. (For an in-depth review of mining, see: What is Bitcoin Mining?)\n\n3. Bitcoin Wallet Scams. A bitcoin wallet is a software program used to store bitcoins. Wallet scams attract users with the assurance of greater transaction anonymity. Once the deposit level rises above a certain level, the scammers simply move the bitcoins into their own wallet.\n\n4. Bitcoin Exchange Scams. These exchanges attract users by offering credit card processing at more competitive rate than their competitors. The fraudulent bitcoin exchanges simply do not return bitcoin or cash after receiving payment.\n\n5. Bitcoin Phishing Scams. Phishing scams can involve emails informing people that they have been awarded or given bitcoins. They are told that they need to log into their bitcoin wallets through a link in the email that unbeknownst to them gives the phishers complete control the account.\n\nAvoiding Bitcoin Scams\n\nIt is advisable to thoroughly investigate the background of the bitcoin-related company you are thinking of transacting with and look for transparency in their dealings. Publicly available audits can assuage doubt over whether a company is able to deliver what it promises. Proof-of-reserves cryptographic audits enable companies to publicly disclose their bitcoin holdings. Established forums like reddit can help provide a balanced perspective on the legitimacy of a company.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs in the offline world, if it looks too good to be true, it is most likely a scam. When dealing with bitcoins, it is best to treat the currency as carefully as cash in the everyday world. If you lose it, it is very unlikely that you will ever get it back.""]"
04/24/2015,"['The bitcoin community—the developers, executives, venture capitalists, policy wonks, academics, and even bloggers who work in, engage with, and support the decentralized technology and the digital currency—has a diversity problem.\n\nIt’s no worse than in the technology industry writ large, though some people disagree. Whatever the case, women are very much a minority in the business of bitcoin. But there are more of them than a Fusion piece this week would have you believe.\n\nThe story, entitled, “Why bitcoin’s male domination will be its downfall,” garnered fast and furious responses on Twitter from people in the bitcoin community who disputed author Felix Salmon’s representation of the issue. (“Effectively zero,” he says at one point; an “almost complete absence” at another. ) Using Nathaniel Popper’s forthcoming bitcoin book Digital Gold as a jumping-off point, Salmon wrote, “If you are a woman involved with Bitcoin, you are invariably going to get treated like an outsider.” Digital Gold focuses on the origins of bitcoin and a small handful of its earliest characters. Popper told Salmon he put effort into “trying to find a woman who was involved in some substantive way,” but as Salmon (not Popper) says, the result was “Zero. Nothing. Zilch.”\n\nThat string of strong words is a bit misleading. It refers to the involvement of women in the very early days of bitcoin. Nowadays, the landscape is different. Popper, for his part, was mostly silent on the issue—but replied to one critical tweet by saying, “I would wait and read the book before you conclude what I say in it.”\n\nOn Twitter, bitcoin folks were quick to reply to Salmon:\n\n@felixsalmon seriously? a cursory search didn\'t turn up my lovely female friend @anjiecast? — Pamela J. Hobart (@amelapay) April 23, 2015\n\n@amelapay I want to say ""Huh?! All the other conferences I go to are way more male-centric than BTC"" but probably doesn\'t help. — Robert P. Murphy (@BobMurphyEcon) April 23, 2015\n\n@felixsalmon I call BS: Bitcoin is the only FinTech to ever have a community women\'s day, and current FinTech is even more male dominated. — Daniel ? (@csuwildcat) April 24, 2015\n\nThe bitcoin industry has what Brian Forde, director of digital currency for MIT Media Lab, calls a “pale male” problem. (At a roundtable discussion about BitLicense this week, all of the bitcoin executives and policy pundits were male—the only female in the room was a reporter covering the talk.) An ongoing Coindesk survey first posted in March asks, “Is the Bitcoin community just young, white and male?” A separate survey from 2013 concluded that 96% of bitcoin “users” are male.\n\nBut there are quite a few women in the business of bitcoin—and while they may be heavily outnumbered by their male counterparts, they are hardly standing on the sidelines. “I might be a special case, but in my experience, I’ve only been welcomed and encouraged in this space,” says Andrea Castillo, an economic researcher at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. “I’ve never felt there were barriers presented to me because of my gender. If anything, I think people have been nicer to me because of it.” Castillo and her former colleague Jerry Brito worked together on bitcoin’s first policy primer—Brito now serves as executive director for Coin Center, a nonprofit watchdog working to help influence policy and regulation of the industry.\n\nOn Twitter, Brito responded to Salmon’s article by pointing out that Castillo herself is one of the most influential women in bitcoin policy, along with his Coin Center colleague Robin Weisman.\n\n“You can always look at a ratio on paper,” says Castillo, “but for me the more interesting question is, Are there any barriers? Are there people who don’t want them [women or people of color] to join and be involved? I don’t see that at all. I see everyone saying, ‘Are you interested in bitcoin? Join us, get involved.” I mean, it’s an open-source project.”\n\nM.K. Lords is another vocal woman in the industry, and one of many people who are actively involved in the bitcoin community without working full-time at a bitcoin company. Lords’s day job is at a brokerage that accepts bitcoin for precious metals. In her free time she runs a bitcoin blog, hosts a bitcoin radio program, and has assembled multiple bitcoin conferences. “To say there are no women in bitcoin is sexist because it diminishes all the very active women in the space,” she says. “Women are accepted with open arms in the bitcoin industry. Yes, you deal with similar culture in tech at large, it is mostly male, but I haven’t experienced any kind of sexism. At my conferences, I had 40% more women in full speaker slots than other conferences.”\n\nThere are in fact so many women working in the industry, Lords says, that, “if you ask three different women who the prominent women in bitcoin are, you’ll get different names each time. There really are a lot of us.”\n\nIn that spirit, here are just 10 of the prominent female voices in bitcoin. It’s by no means an exhaustive list (nor a ranking), but it helps to push back on the assertion that women have been sidelined in the growing business of digital currency.\n\n– Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO, BitPesa\n\nRossiello’s company focuses on Africa, allowing for quick and inexpensive money transfers to the continent.\n\n– Cindy McAdam, president and general counsel at Xapo\n\nWith $40 million in funding, Xapo is one of the most prominent bitcoin wallet services. McAdam, a former executive at other mobile payments executives, is one of its highest ranking executives.\n\n– Elizabeth Ploshay, account manager at BitPay\n\nA former D.C. person with a background in P.R., Ploshay became a contributor at Bitcoin Magazine before leaving to join payment provider BitPay. She also now sits on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\n– Connie Gallippi, founder and executive director of BitGive\n\nGallippi is betting that charity is an avenue that can help fix bitcoin’s mainstream reputation.\n\n– Victoria Van Eyk, VP of community development at ChangeTip\n\nA founder of the Bitcoin Strategy Group, a consultancy, van Eyk also works at ChangeTip, a bitcoin startup that allows for peer-to-peer bitcoin micro-payments via Twitter.\n\n– Pamela Morgan, CEO, Third Key Solutions\n\nMorgan, an attorney, created Empowered Law, a “crypto-friendly law practice,” and also runs Third Key, which works with bitcoin startups on multi-signature security measures.\n\n– Fereshteh Forough, founder, Code to Inspire\n\nForough has been key in bringing bitcoin awareness to Afghanistan, where she co-created the Women’s Annex. She was a 2013 TED speaker in New York and now runs Code to Inspire, which teaches young women in Afhganistan to code.\n\n– Catheryne Nicholson, CEO, BlockCypher\n\nA former U.S, Naval officer, Nicholson is co-founder and CEO of BlockCypher, one of a handful of platforms for building applications on bitcoin’s block chain.\n\n– Elizabeth Stark, entrepreneur-in-residence, StartX\n\nA former professor of tech policy at Stanford and Yale, Stark was key in the movement against SOPA. She is entrepreneur in residence at the non-profit accelerator StartX, and is part of Start Bitcoin, a group of entrepreneurs advocating for digital currency technologies.\n\n– Blythe Masters, CEO, Digital Asset Holdings\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest names to have jumped into digital currency, Masters left her post as head of global commodities at JPMorgan last year. In March, she was named chief executive at this recently launched trading platform.\n\nThe perception that there is a dearth of women in bitcoin harms efforts to change it. “It’s so easy to paint bitcoin with a broad brush, but there’s a lot of details people leave out,” Lords says. “In fact, when there are articles about a problem with women, I hear mostly from the men, saying, ‘This is crazy! We love the women in bitcoin and we want more of them.\'”\n\nPua Pyland, who runs the blog “The Bitcoin Wife” and was one of the only female voices in bitcoin early on, told Fortune back in February that when she first started her blog, “it was a very different landscape. The community was small, and there were no forward-facing female advocates. My husband and I were early adopters, and I was looking to provide a different voice and perspective on Bitcoin…. Fast-forward to today. There are so many strong female voices in Bitcoin, and they are all very positive advocates to get more women involved.”', 'There\'s a new regulator in town.\n\nDaniel Roberts at Fortune reports that Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, is putting the finishing touches on BitLicense, a policy that ""will require digital currency companies to obtain a license in order to transmit money on behalf of customers.""\n\nThis means that the cryptocurrency is getting slightly more legit, though the Bitcoin community is unsurprisingly somewhat unhappy about that. While some people think that regulation is a way to wider acceptance, Bitcoin is by and large a community full of people with serious philosophical opposition to the mainstream system. That\'s why they created bitcoin.\n\nFrom Fortune:\n\nWhile some welcome [regulation] (such as those rolling out insured exchanges ) because it can bring the currency and the technology mainstream, many are more philosophically motivated, and were attracted to the space precisely because of its lack of regulation. The latter camp includes people like Roger Ver, nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus,” who recently told Fortune, “Bernie Madoff… was regulated up and down and every which way, and it didn’t do any good, he ran away with everyone’s money… Without all the regulations, we could do so much more already.”\n\nThese bitcoiners should get together with JP Morgan\'s Jamie Dimon.', 'The Bitcoin exchange itBit has applied to become a trust company in New York State \x97 a move that would make it the first cryptocurrency firm to receive such a license in the U.S.\n\nitBit Trust Company LLC sent articles of organization to New York\'s Department of Financial Services on Feb. 3, according to a public notice on the agency\'s website. A number of high-profile former regulators and politicians are listed as backers, including former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. head Sheila Bair, former New Jersey senator and member of the Senate Finance Committee William Bradley and former Financial Accounting Standards Board director Robert Herz. Their involvement with itBit, co-founded by chief executive Charles Cascarilla in 2012, had not previously been announced.\n\nNew York regulators have been become increasingly invested in the question of how Bitcoin companies should be regulated as the digital currency and related technologies gain traction in the U.S. DFS superintendent Benjamin Lawsky proposed a controversial set of requirements for digital currency firms in July 2014.\n\nA trust charter could help itBit gain the confidence of future investors, according to Martin Mushkin, an attorney specializing in Bitcoin law.\n\n""It\'s getting good publicity to show that it really wants to be upfront and aboveboard,"" said Mushkin. ""The advantage of being regulated and carrying on business in compliance with regulation is that people will feel more comfortable with them than some outfit that tries to go around it.""\n\nitBit currently caters to institutional and retail investors in Singapore looking to buy and sell bitcoins. Reuters reports that the application is ""part of itBit\'s plan to expand its business into different corners of financial services.""\n\nCascarilla and Emil Woods, who together with Cascarilla co-founded the hedge fund Cedar Hill Capital Partners in 2004, are also listed as organizers on the application.', 'CoinHako, a Bitcoin wallet and exchange based in Singapore has announced today that their bitcoin reserve is insured by BitGo Inc’s web-based, multisig institutional wallet protection service. The technology of BitGo, underwritten by Ararted Insurer XL Group, assures that the deposits of both hot and cold wallets on CoinHako are “insured against hacking and theft.”\n\nWith this announcement, CoinHako has fulfilled one of its immediate priorities by building on top of the BitGo platform to provide industry leading security for its users\' funds.\n\nCoinHako CEO Yusho Liu stated:\n\n“This will give our end users even more confidence that the coins held by CoinHako are protected with an insurance\xad-based offering and secured with the industry\'s best practices and technologies. This is a big step forward for the industry.”\n\nApart from protecting the bitcoins of CoinHako’s users from hacking and theft, BitGo’s multisig wallet protection service also provides risk management controls, transparency and internal checks and balances to allow the monitoring of its reserves. But regardless of the protection of BitGo, users are still encouraged to enable 2FA and to use strong passphrases.\n\nBitGo CEO Mike Belshe announced:\n\n""We\'re excited to have CoinHako\'s Bitcoin exchange secured on our platform. The team at CoinHako has been a great development partner, and we fully support their focus on security as one of the core tenets of their business. I\'m confident that they will be a great contributor to the Singaporean bitcoin ecosystem.""\n\nMore About CoinHako\n\nOriginated from Silicon Valley, CoinHako provides its users in Asia with easy access to bitcoin. The company is currently in Singapore solidifying the “basic infrastructure for the ecosystem."" Due to its simplicity and the multiple layers of security, CoinHako is the easiest way to purchase or sell bitcoins in Singapore.\n\nCoinHako also helps security consultancies that are in need of assistance for Bitcoin technologies, as Gerry Eng, CTO of CoinHako states,\n\n“Adopting industry best practices is at the core of what we do. On top of offering a top-notch Bitcoin service for users in the region, we want to share our expertise of the blockchain with businesses, government agencies, as well as the Interpol.”\n\nThe integration of BitGo’s multisig, institutional wallet protection service will help CoinHako to establish their infrastructure as a Bitcoin wallet and exchange, and may help the company expand its exchange services throughout Asia.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

The company unveiled its revolutionary plans during Bitcoin Conference Africa.\n\n“You’d think that with all the smartness happening in our grid, that the problems are solved. But in fact this brings us to the most difficult and biggest problem of all, which is payments. Your grid could be as smart as you like but if all customers aren’t paying, it’s worthless and it becomes unsustainable and will collapse,” highlighted Bankymoon CEO, Lorien Gamaroff.\n\nThe startup’s platform utilizes bitcoin and other virtual currencies to streamline transactions. Through the app, users have the ability to pay for their water or electricity bill without needing to go to a service center or bank. They also have the option to top up someone else’s meter from anywhere in the world.\n\nGamaroff shines light on the possibilities of the platform using foreign aid as an example. Overseas donors and organizations could easily provide direct contributions to a remote school or village in the form of bill payments.\n\nThe bitcoin app also aims to service the underbanked. Individuals without access to basic financial services would be able to pay for reoccurring charges without a traditional bank account.\n\n“Banking might be convenient but not a lot of people have access to it. According to the World Bank’s 2013 data, about half of the world is unbanked. Eighty percent of those are in Africa, 65% in Latin America and nearly 60% in Central Asia Pacific,” said Gamaroff.\n\nThe CEO and founder of Bankymoon anticipates that by 2023, 80 percent of the U.S. will be equipped with smart grids.', 'A Swiss art installment drew a great deal of attention to bitcoin this week after Swiss law enforcement officials confiscated the piece for its participation in Agora, a dark web marketplace.\n\nThe exhibit, designed by Swiss art group !Mediengruppe Bitnik, included a robot and an array of dark web purchases.\n\nUsing The Dark Web\n\nThe robot, aptly named ""Random Darknet Shopper,"" was given 100 bitcoins per week and programmed to use its allowance to randomly buy one item from the underground market.\n\nThe purchased items were then shipped to a Swiss art gallery called Kunst Halle St Gallen where they were displayed as part of the exhibition.\n\nBefore being taken into custody, the robot purchased several items including a Hungarian passport, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and Ecstasy tablets.\n\nRobot Under Arrest\n\nIn January, police discovered the illegal purchases and confiscated the robot and all of its items and considered filing charges against the artists who\'d designed the installation.\n\nRelated Link: Bitcoin Job Seekers Look To Bet On A Winner\n\nHowever, the charges were dropped and the robot, sans Ecstasy, was returned to the gallery in April. In a blog post, the gallery confirmed that police had decided that buying the drugs was ""a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition"".\n\nBitcoin Still Struggling With A Negative Image\n\nWhile the robot\'s illicit activities went uncharged, the ordeal served as a reminder that cryptocurrency still has a strong association with criminal behavior and the dark web.\n\nWith the Silk Road trials still fresh in the public\'s mind, bitcoin still has a long way to go before it will shake its image as a tool for illegal activity.', ""Want to pay for pay for dinner in bitcoins?

In this article, we identify cities that are at the forefront of embracing the virtual currency.\n\nSeveral different metrics were used in making the list, including the number of bitcoin merchants in the city, the number of bitcoin ATMs, and the population size relative to bitcoin activity. Bitcoin maps like the collaborative coinmap.org allow you to view current bitcoin accepting businesses by city or country. Similarly, CoinDesk's bitcoin ATM map shows the locations of bitcoin ATMs across the world.\n\nHere are the 10 leading cities, starting with the strongest bitcoin presence:\n\n1. San Francisco, US. Not surprisingly, California's tech Mecca figures a prominent role in our list. The city currently has 177 merchants accepting bitcoin and one bitcoin ATM with a relatively small population of 837,000. San Francisco is home to startups such as Coinbase, developer of the world’s most popular bitcoin wallet.\n\n2. Vancouver, Canada. Bitcoin has a strong community in Canada, which was the first country to sign an official law regulating the virtual currency. Vancouver boasts 86 bitcoin-accepting merchants and an impressive 13 bitcoin ATMs. The city of 578,000 inaugurated the world’s first bitcoin ATM and is the headquarters of the Quadriga CX Bitcoin exchange.\n\n3. Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The capital of the Netherlands has a robust 74 merchants accepting bitcoin and one bitcoin ATM for a population of 779,000. Nearby cities Utrecht and the Hague are also havens for the cryptocurrency. Amsterdam is home to leading bitcoin startups including BitFury and BitPay.\n\n4. Ljubljana, Slovenia. The smallest city on our list with a population of only 272,000, Ljubljana has 51 merchants accepting bitcoin and two ATMs. The prominent bitcoin exchange Bitstamp is headquartered in Ljubljana.\n\n5. Tel Aviv, Israel. Israel's financial center and one of the world's leading cities for startups has 58 merchants accepting bitcoin and four bitcoin ATMs in a population of 404,000. The Israel Bitcoin Meetup Group in Tel Aviv is among the most active in the world with 1,785 members.\n\n6. Zurich, Switzerland. The largest city in Switzerland and a leading financial center, Zurich has 64 merchants accepting bitcoin and two ATMs serving a population of 366,000.\n\n7. Tampa, US.

The government of the tiny island is pushing forward a new regulatory framework to create a true paradise for digital currencies.\n\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with Brian Donegan, Head of Operations for Digital Development and eBusiness at the Isle of Man Department of Economic Development. Donegan confirmed that the island, a self-governing British Crown dependency located in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland, is gearing up to become the ideal environment for digital financial technology businesses, entrepreneurs and developers.\n\n“The Isle of Man is investment-grade and has the perfect business environment to maximize value,” said Donegan. “The Isle of Man has a superior technology proposition, excellent bandwidth, Tier 3 Data Centers and self-sufficient local electricity power supplies.”\n\nDonegan confirmed that, besides the advantages of political stability and a world-class computing and telecom infrastructure, the Isle of Man government intends to offer to digital fintech businesses a clear, rock-solid regulatory environment to foster good business models – and keep dubious ones out.\n\n“We will keep crime out and protect the consumer,” he said.Two relevant pieces of legislation, the “Designated Businesses (Registration and Oversight) Bill 2014” and the “Proceeds of Crime (Business in the Regulated Sector) Order 2015,” are advancing through the approval process and should enter in force in a few weeks.\n\nA decade ago the Isle of Man government recognized e-gaming as a potential strategic growth sector, and established a suitable legal and fiscal framework to attract online gambling and sports betting businesses. As a result, leading operators such as PokerStars flocked to the island and today are an important part of the thriving e-business sector, which accounts for around 19 percent of the Isle of Man economy.According to Donegan, the government now wants to re-use the same “Freedom to Flourish” approach for Bitcoin and digital fintech, and will make efforts to attract and welcome not only Bitcoin 1.0 businesses focused on blockchain-based financial transactions, but also new Bitcoin 2.0 companies that leverage the technology of the blockchain to address other business opportunities.\n\nDonegan edits an e-business blog on the aptly titled “Where You Can” Isle of Man government website. In the latest post, he notes that a powerful blockchain cluster has emerged with some dynamic start-ups in the Isle of Man.\n\n“The recent surge in crypto 2.0 businesses is clear evidence that an Isle of Man blockchain cluster is also on its way,” he says. “This cluster effect creates a formidable peer group of experts that can share their combined knowledge, expertise and resources to the overall economic benefit of the Isle of Man.” Donegan adds that he has been working with various companies in this highly innovative sector to ensure that they have the support and assistance needed to get started on the Isle of Man.\n\nBlockchain entrepreneurs can move to the Isle of Man and take advantage of interesting financial and fiscal incentives. Alternatively, they can stay where they are and set up a virtual Isle of Man corporation through local registered agents and non-executive directors. The Department of Economic Development can assist in the process, and may also be able to provide introductions to local investors and venture capital companies for funding.', 'While Internet citizens find it strange that fax machines still exist, everyone still needs to send faxes at times – often to large legacy organizations, banks and public administrations that still live in the 20thcentury. Sending faxes is difficult because almost nobody has a fax machine at home anymore, and going to a post office seems a waste of time to those accustomed to living at Internet speed.\n\nThere are, of course, Internet fax services that allow using a PC connected to the Internet to send and receive faxes. But Internet fax services require a subscription, which can be expensive. For example eFax.com, probably the best-known Internet fax service, charges $17 a month for a basic subscription, plus 10 centers per page after the first 150 pages. That seems far too expensive, since most people don’t need to send more than one or two faxes per year.\n\nReasonably priced pay-as-you-go plans without subscriptions would be ideal for sending faxes when the need arises, but the overhead costs of traditional payment systems make that difficult to implement. The problem is that paying costs money – bank wires, credit card payments, and even PayPal have fixed transaction costs. If sending a fax over the Internet costs, say, half-a-dollar, it doesn’t make sense to pay one dollar to cover transaction costs. Therefore, most Internet fax service providers use subscription-based pricing, but buying a subscription doesn’t make sense to casual users.\n\nBitcoin Fax has now entered the market as a new Internet fax service that allows sending faxes anywhere in the world with no sign-up required. Australian developer Simon Males announced the service on Reddit saying, “Thought I would support the Bitcoin economy by helping those who still need to send faxes from time to time.” Many posts to the Reddit discussion are enthusiastic.\n\nThe user interface is very simple: The user needs only to enter a fax number anywhere in the world, upload a PDF document, and send. Payment is in bitcoin, with fees that range from 11 cents USD to send faxes to Japan to $7.58 to send faxes to places such as Afghanistan. Most countries in Europe and the Americas are priced at 17 cents per fax.\n\nAccording to user feedback on Reddit, the service works well, and sends faxes a few minutes after the payment has been sent.\n\nBitcoin Fax seems a very good Bitcoin business model. The developer has identified a simple need and a market – the casual users who still need to send faxes every now and then – and provided a solution based on a unique advantage of bitcoin payments – fast and cheap micropayments.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Coinbase offered ideas for Bitcoin micropayments applications and business models.\n\nInternet pioneers such as Ted Nelson, Marc Andreessen and Tim Berners-Lee thought that the Internet should have a built-in framework for micropayments. Berners-Lee tried to include micropayments in Web protocols, but the idea was never implemented. Now Bitcoin provides an ideal framework for Internet micropayments, which enables new, simple and efficient business models.', 'COURTESY COINTEMPORARY.COM\n\nDigital currencies have been (very) slowly but surely infiltrating the art market, and now the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art (MAK) has become the first museum in the world to have purchased a work of art using Bitcoin.\n\nThat work, Dutch artist Harm van den Dorpel’s Event Listeners (2015), a limited-edition screensaver currently displayed on the online gallery Cointemporary.com, will be featured in an upcoming show titled “24/7 – The Human Condition” as part of the first-ever Vienna Biennale 2015: Ideas for Change, which will run from June 11 to October 4.\n\nEvent Listeners was created especially for a panel held on March 31 called “MAK NITE Lab Digital Superposition – The File as an Object,” for which experts from fields such as contemporary art, artificial intelligence, and art law were invited to speak.

Around the same time, Russian Telecom Regulator Roskomnadzor blocked access to sites dedicated to Cryptocurrency, including bitcoin.org, hasbitcoin.ru, bitcoin.it, btcsec.com, etc. due to a court order.\n\nBitcoinconf.ru\n\nSmile Expo, a company which organizes conferences for 3D Printing, virtual reality, cryptocurrency, Robotics, etc. stated that the purpose of its bitcoinconf.ru website is to display necessary information for their upcoming conferences in the aforementioned industries, not to promote bitcoin. Moreover, Smile Expo argued that the company covers a vast range of conferences in different industries and does not only specialize in Bitcoin.\n\nSmile Expo added that the given resource had simply provided information on the Moscow Bitcoin Conference, for example, not cryptocurrency itself and therefore should be accessible in Russia.\n\nBtcsec.com\n\n“We have no plans to close,” the founder of BTCsec, Ivan Tikhonov, told CoinTelegraph back in January. “We believe this ban is unlawful and we will fight it in court.”\n\nFollowing through with this promise, representatives of BTCsec.com presented the case that public discussion about the topic of cryptocurrency should be allowed, regardless of the proposal to ban the “distribution of information” on the cryptocurrency technology.\n\nTikhonov stated:\n\n“I’m expecting the decision of blocking BTCsec.com to be cancelled as I deem it illicit, and think the whole trial involved evident flaws. One should remember that cryptocurrencies are not banned in Russia for now, and no information concerning them cannot be considered as information forbidden for distribution within the Russian Federation. I believe they stand to win.”\n\nThe Sverdlovsk Oblast Court decided to carry on with the hearing under general trial jurisdiction on May 15.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

In this article, she looks at bitcoin in the context of Darwin\'s evolutionary theories.\n\nIn the six years since the inception of Satoshi Nakamoto\'s blockchain, many have begun to see bitcoin as a disruption force in the future of finance.\n\nPut simply, money is a ledger – one that has now become programmable. Now anyone can create their own currency and with simple scripting language, different values can be coded to manifest values of community.\n\nEconomists try to understand this new innovation through modern monetary theory, while those who advocate economic equality tend to dismiss bitcoin as Wall Street-friendly currency with a libertarian bent.\n\nYet, careful examination of its design reveals how the vision of this technology transcends political ideology. In actuality, it is best understood as a representation of innate human nature and as an innovation that can foster evolution of the species.\n\nDarwin’s vision\n\nThe vision of man put forward by naturalist Charles Darwin in the 19th century contained aspects of human nature that can appear somewhat contradictory.\n\nMost people are familiar with Darwin’s theory of genetic mutation, natural selection and the survival of the fittest from The Origin of Species. But his second work, The Descent of Man was largely ignored. In it, Darwin argued for recognition of the higher nature of man based on innate altruism and love.\n\nThese seemingly opposing characteristics appear in two polarized images that are developing in bitcoin.\n\nOn one hand bitcoin is often associated with the dark side of humanity, seen in events such as speculators\' manipulation, the Silk Road scandals and the demise of Mt Gox, while on the other hand it evokes altruistic aspirations shown in its fast growing usage for charity and tipping.\n\nThese two human tendencies are inherent in this technology’s unique architecture. Bitcoin brings a new monetary design that has never existed before.\n\nAt first glance, with its fixed supply (a total of 21 million bitcoins will be created), it can appear as a gold-like asset. This is one reason why it is attracting investors and speculators and is criticized by economists as deflationary, thereby incentivizing hoarding.\n\nYet, this is only half the puzzle. Unlike gold, bitcoin can be infinitely divided (into 8 decimal points and more if consensus is reached). Along with this contradictory message of scarcity (finite supply) and abundance (infinite divisibility), Darwin’s dualistic human nature is manifested in the function of mining.\n\nThe mining pools at the heart of the bitcoin network are like worker owned co-ops; they self-organize through mutual aid, competing while cooperating through sharing resources.\n\nDigital scarcity\n\nThe foundation upon which bitcoin’s programing language is written is open source. Unlike corporate proprietary software, anyone can read it and modify the code. This makes blockchain networks open to anyone.\n\nThe concept of open source has over the last decade challenged crony capitalism. In his blog piece, Watching Open Source Destroy Capitalism, JD Moyer described how “capitalism is based on scarcity” with private production and distribution. He argued how open source challenges this scarcity by reducing or eliminating the cost of production and distribution.\n\nWith the invention of the BitTorrent file sharing protocol, communal and altruistic impulses suppressed by the dominant ownership culture found expression online.\n\nTill now, this trend of sharing has not been associated with money and has grown separately from an individualistic and entrepreneurial spirit. The invention of the blockchain has opened up a new path to link these often conflicted aspects of human nature manifested in the ideological schism of capitalism and socialism; between on one hand an impulse for competition for healthy price discovery and on the other cooperation for sharing.\n\nSatoshi’s perfect market\n\n\n\nThe core invention of the blockchain technology is its solving of the doublespend problem. In his creation of HashCash, cryptographer Adam Back introduced the concept of digital scarcity; a way to make an object in the digital world scarce.\n\nIBM\'s Richard Gendal Brown noted how this scarcity is bitcoin’s irreducible essence, namely enabling ""transfer without duplication"".\n\nUntil the emergence of bitcoin, scarcity in the digital world was artificially created through enforcement of copyright law and proprietary models of access restriction. Now, bitcoin creates scarcity through algorithmic consensus.\n\nSilicon Valley tech entrepreneur and author Andreas Antonopoulos acknowledged that the creator Satoshi Nakamoto not only invented a new currency, but he also gave us the world’s first ""perfect market"".\n\nThrough mathematical solutions found within the chaos of unpredictable, unrepeatable random numbers, new bitcoins are conceived and blocks created. Similar to DNA code, every bitcoin is like a unique cell that can’t be replicated. Cells do not multiply, but divide without losing intrinsic value in order to support growth and health of the larger organism.\n\nCurrency of abundance\n\nUnlike bitcoin’s living ecosystem, in the current fiat world, central control kills the spontaneous force of the market. It turned the system into a mechanical and ruthless machine. A dead system can’t nourish itself. It becomes parasitic and sustains itself through incurring debts, stealing and extracting through rent seeking.\n\nIn this paradigm, the language of scarcity locks people in, fueling fear and rewarding those who control and exploit. The callous aspects of man have dragged the whole world into a virtual reality of an abstract Nintendo computer game, in which humanity is degraded into heartless cyborgs, engaging in drone attacks, sweatshop mass exploitation and financial colonization.\n\nThe invention of the blockchain is offering a way out of this tyrannical system of control.\n\nSatoshi’s perfect market enables a distributed system of accountability. By rewarding those who abide by the rules, it regulates man’s fallible nature and secures the system. It channels aggressive and competitive parts of human nature and directs them to constructively serve higher ideals embedded in this technology.\n\nThe blockchain as a public asset ledger is an asset in and of itself. As the network matures, bitcoin’s scarcity that helped to develop the system and add value comes to fruition with the companion feature of expansion through infinite divisibility. Through non-inflatable solid value, abundance is created, becoming a currency that carries the innate human nature of sharing.\n\nThe evolution of our species has for so long been stagnated through religious dogma, patriarchy, as well as economic and political oppression.\n\nAs the centralization of man’s greed has held humanity down for centuries, a piece of mathematics enshrined in computer code has unleashed a new potential. As levers of control are removed, money used to coerce and enslave people is now being transformed to become a flow that can realize the innate capacity for altruism encoded in our DNA.\n\nThe path of evolution is now cleared. We no longer need permission. Each individual can freely respond to the call within to rise higher.\n\nEvolution image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

As one of the earliest Bitcoin companies, SatoshiLabs also operates bitcoin hardware wallets named Trezor and Coinmap used to check the merchants who accept bitcoin worldwide.\n\nMarek Palatinus, who is also known as “slush” to many people, is the architect of the Slushpool, which launched in 2010, to become the first bitcoin mining pool in the world. More than 939,000 BTC have been mined since it started operating in December 2010.\n\nAlthough the bitcoin mining pool industry is developing very rapidly in China comprising a large portion of the total hash rate, Slushpool was, in fact, the major choice for miners around the world before China’s domestic mining pool, Pond F2pool, was founded.\n\nThis March, Slushpool released its first version in Chinese. “China is one of the markets, which are not fully developed and bitcoin is becoming more and more popular there,” said Palatinus. “So we have opened our service to China and offered technology support in Chinese through our server based in Beijing and Singapore.”\n\nBefore working in the Bitcoin industry, Palatinus has worked in the IT industry for nearly 15 years. He has developed several successfully internet startup and worked as an enterprise architect for one of the largest banks in Central Europe.\n\nCoinTelegraph: How did you create the world’s first mining pool?\n\nMarek Palatinus: Hi, my name is Marek Palatinus but in the Bitcoin space I'm better known by nickname “Slush.” The SlushPool was created in late 2010 when I was mining for bitcoins alone with my computer and realized that it's quickly becoming unprofitable for single miners. Fortunately, a solution came to my mind. I've created a system where small miners would join together to pool their resources and share their profit proportionally. That's why the method is called “pooled mining.”\n\nCT: Who owns SplushPool? And how has it been going at Slushpool since it was created?\n\nMP: SlushPool has been going through a lot of stuff since its inception. It will be 5 years this December and in the history there have been just very few hours of downtime. Most of our business consists of taking care of the infrastructure and providing customer support. The SlushPool falls under our parent company called SatoshiLabs, which also produces bitcoin hardware wallet called TREZOR and runs a Bitcoin services directory CoinMap.org.\n\nCT: How many people work in the Slushpool team?\n\nMP: SlushPool was originally a one man project and then gradually after few years I've realized that it's getting more serious, so I've started to bring more people in. Now there's up to 8 people working on various parts of the business.\n\n“[O]ur pool has the best user interface and monitoring capabilities.”\n\nCT: Why did you decide to release a Chinese version?\n\nMP: Bitcoin mining is a global phenomenon so it is natural for this business to expand to all continents. China is one of the biggest untapped markets with a huge potential as Bitcoin is quickly becoming popular there. We have already released our service in China; we have servers in Beijing and also in Singapore for Asia-pacific and we even provide support in Chinese language.\n\nCT: Compared with other mining pool, what advantages do the Slushpool have?\n\nMP: I can honestly say that our pool has the best user interface and monitoring capabilities. Any bigger mining farm operator will tell you that quickly identifying the problem when things go wrong is the key. This is where we have edge over other pools \xadin the advanced monitoring and reporting features. Our support team is also very well informed and provides answers and help quickly.\n\nCT: On the Chinese version of your website it says that “our unique return system provides loyal users with steady and transparent rewards.” How does this work?\n\nMP: We are using a score based system to distribute bitcoins to miners proportionally to their hashing speed. This system works best for people who mine with our pool over a longer period of time, because sometimes the reward can be unpredictably higher or lower. That's the nature of bitcoin mining.\n\nCT: Could you explain what the “smart load balance” and “failover system” features are?\n\nMP: These are systems we use on the server\xad side of our business. In simple words it means that our servers are distributed on a cloud and even if it goes down locally, we can relay you to other servers in different location to achieve the highest possible uptime so our customers can earn bitcoins without interruption.\n\n“[W]e send payouts automatically to miners so there's never too many bitcoins on one spot [.]”\n\nCT: How does Slushpool secure users’ accounts?\n\nMP: We take security very seriously at SatoshiLabs and no different is it on SlushPool. That's why we send payouts automatically to miners so there's never too many bitcoins on one spot, thus not even making a target for hackers. Users can also enable 2 factor authentication for access to their accounts. When you combine this with our TREZOR wallet risks are very minimal.\n\nCT: What’s ahead for Slushpool in the future?\n\nMP: Right now we're working on implementation of “merged mining”, which is additional revenue stream for miners without any added effort from their side. A mobile friendly website and mobile monitoring app is also in the pipeline.\n\nIn general we'd like to provide our users with everything they need to mine efficiently. We're also testing new possibilities of getting feedback and proposals on new features through our Development corner. There are always many things that we can choose from to develop or integrate but currently our main focus is to get more miners on board from all around the world.\n\n[Editor’s note: The interview was conducted for 8BTC News on behalf of CoinTelegraph by Meng from 8BTC.]\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Adoption of Bitcoin in Poland is surprisingly increasing with many businesses including Bitcoin as one of the payment options. The fact that the country’s official currency, Polish zloty is the eleventh* most popular currency in Bitcoin trade is enough to understand the extent of penetration of Bitcoin in Poland.\n\nPoland: Many Firsts in Bitcoin\n\nPoland also has a significant number of firsts in its credit when it comes to Bitcoins. Medicover Hospital in Warsaw, run by one of the country’s healthcare providers, Medicover Group became the first hospital in Europe to accept Bitcoin from patients. The hospital treats over 8000 patients from more than 20 different countries each year and these patients can pay their hospitalization, treatment, health checkup and other miscellaneous bills with Bitcoin.\n\nPoland was also the home of the very first Bitcoin Embassy in the world. Ambasada Bitcoin was started in Warsaw over a year ago to promote Bitcoin in Poland, to use and to build a community around it. It was shut down a few months ago, owing to some legal issues.\n\nThere have been discussions on the possibility of recognizing Bitcoin as a financial instrument under Polish law, but the idea was dropped, as Bitcoin didn’t satisfy the requirements to be met by a financial instrument in accordance with the law of the land.\n\nFew Poland based Bitcoin business have run into trouble lately, with the banks terminating accounts of a Polish Bitcoin exchange – BitMarket. On the brighter side, T-Mobile has collaborated with InPay to allow its customers to top up their phone and data credits. In addition, Chip-Chap, a digital currency platform has collaborated with HalCash to provide access to Bitcoin over their ATM network.\n\nREAD MORE: Polish Bitcoin Exchange BitMarket.pl has its Bank Accounts Suspended\n\nBy making Bitcoin easily available and increasing its volume of usage, the currency might soon gain a strong position in the country’s economy.\n\n*Correction: I had erroneously mentioned Polish Zloty to be sixth most traded bitcoin-currency pair in the world. It has been corrected in the above article (reference)', 'I was recently checking for interesting applications on my mobile’s app store, that is when I came across this mobile app called Lawnmower. It is a simple application that allows you to invest your spare change on bitcoins.\n\nThe app, Lawnmower is currently in beta stage and is available only on Apple app store. Three classmates – Alex Sunnarborg, Patrick Archambeau and Pieter Gorsira, have developed this application. These University of Florida students are backed by Boost VC. The Lawnmower application, in concept is similar to an application called Acrons. While Acrons allows its users to invest their spare change on traditional investments, Lawnmower users can use their spare change to buy bitcoin.\n\nLawnmower sounds like a great application, but it has a catch (which is preventing me from using it). In order to use Lawnmower, you should meet two prerequisites.\n\nIf you happen to satisfy both these requirements, and provided that you currently use an Apple device, you can easily download Lawnmower and start using it.\n\nIn order to use it, you have to connect both your bank account/ credit card/debit card and your Coinbase account to Lawnmower application. Once done, you can forget about it and go shopping just the way you always do.\n\nHow does Lawnmower Work?\n\nLawnmower will keep an eye out on all transactions you make on the connected accounts and calculates spare change for each purchase. It calculates the spare change by rounding off the final value of each purchase after deducing tax to the next dollar. In the case of rounded off transaction, it calculates an additional dollar as spare change. Once the app accumulates a minimum spare change of $4.00, it will automatically purchase Bitcoin on your behalf from Coinbase and adds it to your Coinbase Bitcoin Wallet.\n\nHow does it help?\n\nWith Lawnmower, people do not have to go out of their way to invest in Bitcoin. It helps them automate the process, and by investing spare change at regular intervals, they do not feel the burden of making a one-time investment on bitcoin. As an investment option, this method will also reduce the effect of Bitcoin price fluctuations.\n\nLawnmower has the potential of introducing new people into the Bitcoin community. The apparent low risk associated with investing in Bitcoin using spare change will encourage more people to understand and involve themselves into the Bitcoin community.', ""vTorrent is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency client with a built-in bittorrent network, which could make it even harder for ISPs to track and take users to court for online “pirated” content.\n\nIn 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto first began explaining Bitcoin, he used bittorrent as an example of how the currency network would scale and gain value.\n\n“For transferable proof of work tokens to have value, they must have monetary value. To have monetary value, they must be transferred within a very large network - for example a file trading network akin to bittorrent.”\n\nNow in 2015, a new project that aims to bring crypto currencies and torrents together in one place has been launched.\n\nvTorrent which launched in December 2014 aims to create a marriage between crypto and torrents. Currently the project is in early beta testing of its torrent and encrypted messaging features, which users can access from within their crypto wallet. The project page explains:\n\n“We are not aiming to be 'the next Bitcoin,' but we are aiming to be limewire or kazaa with blockchain at its core.”\n\nThe anonymous developer, who goes by the name vTorrent on the Bitcointalk forum, was keen to point out that there are other projects attempting to do something similar, ThePirateBayCoin for example, which has outlined its intentions but is yet to launch.\n\nTorrents have been hugely popular over the last decade with up to 30 million people using them on any given day, but in recent years copyright holders have been actively using the courts to shut down torrent operations. In a recent test case in Australia, a landmark piracy and privacy case was won by Dallas Buyers Club LLC, the company that owns the rights to the 2013 Hollywood film.\n\nThe company wanted the major ISPs in Australia to hand over the names and addresses of 4,726 people that it had identified as illegally downloaded the movie from IP addresses. Having won its legal battle against the ISPs, the judge, Justice Nye Perram, ordered the ISPs had to hand over their customers contact details but under the supervision of the court.\n\nSince this is a decentralized cryptocurrency client with a built-in bittorrent network and encrypted services, ISPs will have a harder time keeping track of what their customers are doing making projects such as vTorrent potentially very popular and further driving the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut another contributor to the vTorrent project highlighted that the distributed nature of cryptocurrencies could potentially be used to help movie rights holders. In particular, high quality movies and TV shows could be more efficiently distributed over the internet using crypto torrent users, who could become paid local distributors reducing the strain on internet bandwidths, while ensuring that content providers are cannot be censored.\n\nWith tens of millions of torrent users around the world, the combination of crypto and torrents could lead to a new wave of mass adoption for crypto, and a new way for copyrights holders to figure out new business model to cut down their costs and work with torrent users instead of taking them to court.\n\nBy Ahmed\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

At an emergency weekend meeting, the board of United Spirits, which is now 55 per cent owned by the British drinks group, asked Mr Mallya to step down as chairman after a probe found improprieties in financial transactions between the Indian spirits business and other parts of Mr Mallya’s empire between 2010 and 2012. During the period under scrutiny, Mr Mallya was attempting to save Kingfisher Airlines, trying — ultimately unsuccessfully — to keep his popular but money-losing carrier aloft. “The inquiry\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009suggests that the manner in which certain transactions were conducted, prima facie, indicates various improprieties and legal violations,” Anand Kripalu, United Spirits’ recently appointed managing director, said in a letter to the Bombay Stock Exchange. The letter said that in light of the findings — though “without making any determination as to fault or culpability” — the board had “lost confidence” in Mr Mallya as either chairman or director of United Spirits and called for him “to resign forthwith”. Mr Mallya rejected the demand, defiantly describing the conclusions of the probe as based on “half truths and twisted facts”. In his statement, the Indian tycoon denied any wrongdoing. He said the transactions under scrutiny were in “full compliance of law at the relevant time”, were reflected in United Spirits accounts, and were duly approved by then-shareholders and directors. Mr Mallya also said Diageo had spent four months conducting due diligence before acquiring United Spirits and that “details of all transactions were disclosed to them.” It was therefore “surprising” these deals were now being cited as a cause for him to step down from the board, he said. “I do not intend to resign as a director of United Spirits Ltd, and shall pursue the contractual obligations with Diageo PLC,” Mr Mallya said in his statement. In a subsequent tweet to his 3.5m followers on Twitter, Mr Mallya said: “I am not going to submit myself to a trial by media. I know the facts and so do all with fiduciary responsibilities. I have legal rights too.” Diageo spent years in on-again, off-again negotiations with the mercurial Mr Mallya before finally reaching a deal to acquire India’s largest spirits producer in 2012. However, it was not until last July that Diageo finally secured majority control with the successful conclusion of an open tender offer that boosted its holding from a previous 28 per cent. United Spirits’ financial results for the quarter immediately after that transaction were repeatedly delayed amid questions over a $225m loan the Indian spirits business had made to its former parent company, controlled by Mr Mallya. In September, the United Spirits board said it was authorising an investigation into whether funds had been “improperly advanced” to Mr Mallya’s holding company or Kingfisher Airlines before Diageo’s takeover. Mr Mallya has promised to challenge the findings of the probe and resist efforts to oust him. However, Mr Kripalu’s letter said that United Spirits directors would recommend to shareholders that Mr Mallya be removed from the board if he refused to step down.', 'Chris Bryant in Frankfurt APRIL 25, 2015 12 Ferdinand Piëch, Volkswagen’s storied patriarch and chairman, has resigned after losing a power struggle with key directors, marking the end of a proud era at the world’s second-largest carmaker by sales.  Mr Piëch, the 78-year-old grandson of the inventor behind the VW Beetle, resigned on Saturday evening with immediate effect, bringing the curtain down on a towering two-decade stewardship of VW. Earlier the carmaker’s steering committee of top directors had met in Braunschweig and concluded that “in view of the background of the last weeks, the necessary mutual trust necessary for successful co-operation no longer exists"".  Mr Piëch also quit his other directorships within the VW Group and his wife Ursula also resigned from the company’s board.  Berthold Huber, the former head of the IG Metall union and deputy chairman of VW’s supervisory board, will take over as chairman on an interim basis at the request of key shareholders.  The announcement marks an extraordinary denouement to a leadership crisis that Mr Piëch triggered two weeks ago when he indicated he no longer supported chief executive Martin Winterkorn.  Key shareholders, including the State of Lower Saxony and Mr Piëch\'s cousin Wolfgang Porsche, rallied to the chief’s side. Employee representatives, who hold half the seats on the supervisory board, also backed Mr Winterkorn, leaving Mr Piëch unusually isolated.  Top directors met a week ago and declared Mr Winterkorn “the best possible” CEO of VW — an unprecedented defeat for the chairman. However, Porsche and Piëch family representatives met again on Wednesday, with German media reporting that the chairman had tried again to topple Mr Winterkorn. Together the two families control 51 per cent of the voting shares in VW. The following day Mr Piëch denied trying to oust the chief but by then boardroom trust was shattered. Mr Porsche, the chairman of Porsche SE, the holding company for the two families’ VW stock, said on Saturday that he had “complete trust” in VW’s management. Former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn He thanked Mr Piëch for his ”extraordinary and highly successful” work for VW over the decades and said Porsche SE would continue to discharge its responsibility as anchor investor of VW “with great loyalty”.  Mr Piëch remains a board member at Porsche SE and so far there is no indication he plans to sell his VW stock. Stephan Weil, prime minister of the State of Lower Saxony, which holds 20 per cent of VW voting shares, said Mr Piëch’s resignation had become “unavoidable” and was necessary to end speculation and have clarity at the top of VW. Nevertheless, he said he regretted Mr Piëch’s departure: “It’s no exaggeration that he is one of the most important personalities in [postwar] German economic history.” Mr Piëch\'s huge drive and ambition as chief executive and, later, as chairman of VW helped propel the German group to within touching distance of the crown of world’s largest carmaker by sales. FT Archive Auto industry driven by Wagnerian passions VW’s CEO receives an unwelcome message from his boss, writes Philip Delves Broughton Continue reading In his early career as an engineer he was responsible for countless innovations and as chief of VW from 1993 to 2002 he transformed its fortunes and began assembling a stable of brands that now spans Bugatti, Lamborghini and motorcycle maker Ducati.  But investors were often frustrated by Mr Piëch’s costly dealmaking and his trophy engineering projects such as the VW Phaeton saloon.  His corporate governance, such as his decision to appoint his wife to the board, was also criticised. A survey of institutional investors conducted by Evercore ISI, the advisory and research firm, this month found that 80 per cent would welcome a change of chairman and 65 per cent a change in the chief executive.  Mr Piëch’s resignation comes at a difficult time for VW, which is trying to slash €5bn in costs at the core VW brand to boost margins. It is also facing tumbling sales in Russia, South America and the US while its key China market — VW’s largest — has also started to slow.  “The disruption at such a senior level at a critical time for VW will no doubt unnerve many shareholders in the weeks to come,” Stuart Pearson, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said.', 'Kathrin Hille in Grozny APRIL 25, 2015 68 Men with guns are everywhere in Grozny. They stand on street corners, hang out in hotel lobbies and swagger through shopping malls, Uzis hanging from the waist. They are Kadyrovtsy, the fighters who became policemen after Ramzan Kadyrov, their militia leader, became head of the Chechen Republic under a deal with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. The Kadyrovtsys’ distinctive tight black uniform with a Chechen flag patch on the right arm and a Russian one on the left reflect how many Russians regard today’s Chechnya: a rival power base to parts of the Russian security state. Tensions between Moscow and Grozny came to the fore after the murder in February of Boris Nemtsov, the opposition politician, for which three former Chechen security officials were arrested. This week, after security forces from the neighbouring Stavropol region shot dead a Chechen man in Grozny, Mr Kadyrov felt compelled to remind Moscow who was boss in Chechnya. Mr Kadyrov instructed his security officials: “If someone appears on our territory without your knowledge — no matter if a Muscovite or someone from Stavropol — I order you to shoot to kill.” The Chechen government insists the Stavropol officials had come as paid assassins and lacked documents for a legal operation. But Mr Kadyrov’s aggressive response raises a bigger political question: his regime may have stabilised war-torn Chechnya, but could it now weaken the Russian state as a whole? “Kadyrov has tried to build a state within the state for a long time,” says Ekaterina Sokiryanskaya, a Caucasus expert at International Crisis Group. “He only listens to Putin, and nobody else.” While other republics in the North Caucasus exchange intelligence on the Islamist insurgency with which the restive region struggles, the Chechen arm of Russia’s Federal Security Bureau, the successor to the KGB, refuses to do so. “It shares what it feels like sharing with Moscow, and lets the centre decide what it sends back down south,” says Mark Galeotti, an expert on the Russian security services at New York University and author of a book on the Chechen wars. The Kadyrovtsy who enforce the will of the Chechen leader Chechnya’s warlord rulers have clashed over their claim to special status with other parts of the security apparatus before. So far, they have had their way. In 2013, Mr Putin replaced his top investigator in Chechnya after only seven months on the job following a run-in with Chechen officials. Sergei Bobrov, a highly decorated general at the Federal Investigative Committee, had pressed on with an investigation into the murder of three women in the Chechen village of Geldagan even after his staff received threatening phone calls telling them to stop. Two people from Geldagan said their village belonged to the area of influence of Magomed Daudov, a former fighter under Mr Kadyrov’s father and now the republic’s prime minister. “No investigator can build a case without asking him what to do,” said one of the two. The same year Mr Bobrov was forced out, the Federal Investigative Committee released several Chechen men with links to Mr Kadyrov whom the FSB had detained on charges of extorting, kidnapping and torturing other Chechens in Moscow. In Chechnya, some believe that Mr Kadyrov ordered Mr Nemtsov’s murder just steps from the Kremlin walls because he thought this would be a service to his political overlord. “That man is getting really worried what will happen to him if Putin is no longer there,” said a government critic in Grozny who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. “With the criticism from the west, the economic crisis and rumours about disagreements in Putin’s circle, he realised that Putin will not be there for ever. Once Putin is gone, he loses everything.” Others see the Nemtsov murder as a result of infighting. In Grozny, speculation is rife whether Mr Daudov or Adam Delimkhanov, a Duma member and brother of the commander of interior ministry troops in Chechnya, have ambitions to replace Mr Kadyrov. True or not, these theories point to the precarious nature and the built-in risks of Mr Putin’s solution for Chechnya. But the Russian president does not appear to share such concerns. He considers Chechnya a model that can be applied elsewhere. Last November, he suggested to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, that Ukraine pacify its eastern Donbass region by buying it off with money and autonomy as he had done in Chechnya. That is more than an abstract idea. Moscow is bringing other parts of the North Caucasus in line with some of Chechnya’s draconian practices. In 2013, Mr Putin replaced the head of Dagestan, who had tried to counter the creeping Islamist insurgency through dialogue with Salafi Muslims. Since then, Dagestan has cracked down on Salafism as Chechnya has. Dagestan authorities have also started using Mr Kadyrov’s practice of punishing insurgents’ families by destroying their houses and expelling them. Vladislav Surkov, a Kremlin adviser on Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ukraine for Mr Putin, this year negotiated treaties for a far-reaching integration of the two Georgian breakaway regions with Russia in exchange for more economic aid. As far as Mr Kadyrov is concerned, the deal is very clear. “If you entrusted this region to me, I must ensure security [here]. If not, please be so good and fire me.” Nemtsov, Putin and a climate of fear Play video']"
04/26/2015,"['Amsterdam has always been somewhat of a bitcoin haven.\n\nWith startups seeking to make the city the ""bitcoin capital of the world"", it has historically attracted high-profile bitcoin events. Last spring, for example, saw the opening of Amsterdam\'s very own Bitcoin Boulevard, a project that signed up 10 merchants in the city to accept bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation also picked Amsterdam to host its Bitcoin 2014 conference last May in what may have been the most high-profile testament to the city\'s pull for bitcoin aficionados.\n\nSander Regtuijt, business development manager at BitStraat, encouraged bitcoin users who haven\'t yet been to explore its offerings.\n\nRegtuijt said:\n\n""Visiting Amsterdam because of bitcoin-related reasons would be a good idea, because, besides all the places where you can spend your bitcoin, there is a lively bitcoin community as well.""\n\nWith this in mind, CoinDesk takes a look at five different ways in which you can fund a trip to Amsterdam.\n\n1. Traveling with bitcoin\n\nIf you want to take in the sun whilst sipping on an ice-cold beer purchased with bitcoin, now is your chance. Did we mention you can do so by one of the city\'s world-famous canals?\n\nIf air travel is the only feasible option for you, then don\'t panic.\n\nPaying for airplane tickets with bitcoin has never been easier with AirBaltic, Air Lituanica, BTCTrip and CheapAir accepting payments in the digital currency.\n\n2. Accommodation with bitcoin\n\nNow you have your transportation is sorted, but where will you stay?\n\nIf you are after a bitcoin-friendly hotel, check out the easyHotel Amsterdam City Centre - located in the “De Pijp” district. The hotel\'s website offers a bitcoin payment option at checkout and generates a BitPay invoice, QR code and wallet address to settle the payment.\n\nIf you are willing to spend more time researching a suitable hotel, then head over to Expedia, which also began accepting bitcoin payments for hotel bookings in June last year. Alternatively, you can also spend your bitcoin at the Cocomama hotel, a boutique hostel. Don\'t be put off by the lack of an obvious bitcoin payment option, the hotel asks you to provide credit or debit card details in guarantee of the booking. Bitcoin payments will be made upon arrival at the premises and must be stated in the comments section of the booking form to avoid your card being charged.\n\n3. Sightseeing with bitcoin\n\nAmsterdam has all the advantages of a big European city: cultural and historical heritage, a lively nightlife scene, international restaurants and thanks to its extensive canal infrastructure – little road traffic, which makes it ideal for cycling.\n\nTo make the most of the city, hire a bike. You can do so with bitcoin at Starbikes, where a half-day rental will only set you back an affordable 5€.\n\nIf cycling is not for you and you are traveling in a group, why not invest in a boat tour?

The new cash remittance application leverages the bitcoin block chain. Any web-enabled kiosk, ATM or cashier can offer Romit KYC (know your customer)-compliant money transfer services. The service can send money to a smartphone, tablet or PC.\n\nBy using the bitcoin block chain, the Romit remittance solution circumvents Forex foreign exchange fees, wire transfer fees, and banking requirements.\n\nThe service could extend Robocoin’s role in the emerging global remittance market.\n\nSend money in three easy steps\n\nThe Robocoin website explains how to send money using Romit in three steps: 1) Enter the recipient’s phone number. 2) Select the destination country. 3) Insert cash into an ATM, or hand the cash to the cashier. Romit then sends a confirmation text message to the recipient with the amount sent and the pickup location. The cash-to-bitcoin-to-cash settlement occurs immediately. Customers do not have to create bitcoin wallets to send money.\n\nThe Robocoin bitcoin wallet name has changed to Romit.\n\nThe website presents a cost comparison between Romit, Western Union and Moneygram for sending money from the U.S. to the Philippines. The chart compares costs for sending $20, $50, $75, $100, $150 and $200. The most dramatic savings are for transfers up to $200, the company claims.\n\nTo send $20, Romit charges $0.80 (4 percent), compared to Western Union, $5.66 (28.31 percent) and MoneyGram, $10.90 (54.59 percent). The Western Union and Moneygram fees include Forex conversion costs.\n\nBusinesses with web-enabled kiosks or cashiers can create a Romit cashier account. There is a form on the website for applying for a Romit cashier app.\n\nThe money transfer service began on April 22 at 20 kiosks in the U.S., Hong Kong, Romania and Italy.\n\nAlso read: Robocoin wallet will leverage existing bitcoin ATMs to expand bitcoin network\n\nTarget markets: c-stores and third world countries\n\nThe company plans to expand the money transfer service to convenience store chains, pawn shops. It is targeting the Philippines, India, Mexico and other remittance-heavy markets.\n\nRobocoin provided the first bitcoin ATM in the world and installed it at the end of October 2013 in Vancouver, Canada, according to coinatmradar.com, which tracks bitcoin ATM installations.\n\nRobocoin currently has 34 ATMs installed worldwide, according to coinatmradar.com.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Catherine Bleish, MPA (@thebitmom) writes about her family’s “Uncoinventional Bitcoin Bus Tour” across the USA. The self-styled “Blush Family”—John Bush, Catherine Bleish and their two children—traveled from Philadelphia to Texas using only cryptocurrency for payments.\n\nArrival in New Hampshire\n\nOur first day in New Hampshire we were treated to breakfast by our hosts Mike and MarMar Rogers. This couple has hosted our family each year since 2012 when we’ve visited for the Porcupine Freedom Festival. They watched my daughter Aliana go from a bump in my tummy to an articulate young woman. They are like family to us and this visit was a special opportunity for us to bond and connect as we transitioned into the bus.\n\n— Mike and MarMar with the Blush kids, Aliana and William\n\nAfter breakfast John had lunch with representatives from WageCan. They sent John back to Hollis with a brand new WageCan bitcoin debit card, loaded and ready for our first purchase through this new technology. We all piled in the rental car and drove toward the seacoast to pick up the bill of sale and get to know the bus for the first time.\n\n— John and the WageCan crew\n\nMeeting the Bus\n\nWhen we arrived it was like a dream. There she was, this beautiful bus greeting us from the distance. It was real. This was really happening! I was so excited that I felt like I couldn’t breathe. We got out and hugged the Halldorsons, who then gave us a tour of the bus, inside and out.\n\n— John recording Jeff and Kelly (on the bus) as they teach him about the bus’s internal systems\n\nWith the bill of sale in hand we we to eat pizza at a local joint in Dover. Not only did they have gluten free pizza, but they had gluten free beer! John paid for the meal with our WageCan debit card. It worked flawlessly. We were thrilled!\n\nThe next morning we went to the DMV to get our temporary plates. Again, we used the WageCan debit card to spend bitcoin when it previously would not have been possible. Success! We drove to the bus, applied the temporary plates and took off toward our first New Hampshire bitcoin meetup—Happy Hour at Murphy’s Taproom in Manchester.\n\n— John using the WageCan bitcoin debit card to get our temporary plates.\n\nWe filled up the diesel tank with our WageCan debit card, then got on the highway. I was leading in the rental car, driving slow enough for the bus to keep pace, when suddenly the bus was gone from my rear view mirror. I slowed to about 45 miles per hour, but the bus did not catch up. Then my Skype rang on my tablet.\n\nThe bus had broke down.\n\nBitcoin Meetup\n\nI turned around, picked up Aliana from the bus, and drove to the meetup without John. He stayed behind to wait for Jeff Halldorson to figure out what the problem was. We arrived at the meetup late enough that everyone had already ate, drank and paid. I felt silly, but very at home surrounded by Free State Project participants, as my kids enjoyed a happy hour snack. I paid our tab in BTC and we all caravaned to the next meetup, an informal discussion on Freedom Cells at The Quill, an activist hangout located in Manchester, NH.\n\nThe event went great. Jack Shemik filled in for John to discuss the concept of Freedom Cells. We listened to John’s Libertopia speech on the topic, then I facilitated an intimate discussion of how this concept could be applied in the Free State. The entire time, I had John and the bus in the back of my mind, but I knew it would work out for the best.\n\n— Jack Shimek presenting for John at The Quill\n\nAround 1:00 a.m., I got a phone call that John was on his way back in the bus. Apparently, after sitting all winter, the fuel filters had been clogged and the oil needed changing. By the end of the night, it also needed a jump. I have never been so happy to walk out in the cold at 2:00 a.m. (I used to work for UPS in the middle of the night) to help park a vehicle.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

Mostly the data is net positive, showing an increase in total wallets, and investment. However, there are a number of included data points that demonstrate slowing growth in key bitcoin, and bitcoin-related areas.\n\nThe collected data indicates that the first quarter of 2015 was the most popular ever in terms of the dollar-value of venture capital investments made into the bitcoin ecosystem. That data point, however, is skewed by a single investment — the $116 round million invested into 21, a company that remains at least partially occluded in terms of its ambitions. Aside from that single investment, first quarter venture investment was on par — $113 million — with the preceding fourth quarter.\n\nKey to bitcoin’s performance, at least from an external perspective, is the number of wallets in existence. Those receptacles and storage locations of bitcoin help the market understand how many new people the cryptocurrency is attracting. In the first quarter, according to the CoinDesk report, total wallets grew from 7.4 million to 8.4 million, up 14 percent on a sequential quarter basis.\n\nThat growth rate is likely under expectations from a year ago. The market value of all bitcoin in circulation — some remains yet-to-be-mined — fell from the last quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2015 by 36 percent.\n\nHere’s CoinDesk’s recent chart of aggregate bitcoin trading volume, on a monthly basis:\n\nThe sequential quarter total is skewed by the November timeframe, but it seems that volume hasn’t seen too great an acceleration, or deceleration in the last two three-month cycles.\n\nAmong the bulleted key takeaways that the report contains is the following: “Bitcoin struggled to gain mainstream consumer traction [in the quarter].” That has been the case for the life of bitcoin. That the trend persists isn’t, therefore, too surprising. Still, it isn’t hard to wonder what bitcoin firms that pitched investors over the past 18 months, predicted would happen — did they anticipate that the price of bitcoin be so low? Would investors have invested quite so much over the past year if bitcoin wallet adoption was as slow as it has been?\n\nLast thought, here’s CoinDesk’s aggregate new merchant adoption of bitcoin:\n\nYou can ask yourself if that deceleration is bad, or merely a blip.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by Trevor Hill\n\nConsidering crypto-currency is a relatively new technology, many are still unfamiliar with it and don’t understand the concept. Consequently, public opinion of Bitcoin is generally viewed with an air of skepticism, from laymen to economists, and met with accusations of being a bubble or a Ponzi scheme. There have even been embellished reports proclaiming “the death of bitcoin” published by various news outlets at different points in time. This kind of criticism has diminished in recent years, as price charts have begun to show a positive correlation between bitcoin’s price and growth within it’s market. With more and more people becoming familiarized with the currency there is a good possibility we can expect this trend to continue in the future.\n\nAlso read: New York’s BitLicense Faces Competition From Rand Paul Event\n\nStill, other concerns routinely attach themselves to Bitcoin, such as its perceived connections to criminal activities, drug dealers, and terrorists. These worries add to the mystique of Bitcoin that both fascinates users and incites attempts by outsiders to regulate it.\n\nContinuing in his father’s footsteps, Kentucky Senator and Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul is well known for his unorthodox views and willingness to lead on controversial issues. Some of these issuesinclude auditing the Federal Reserve, repealing mandatory minimums, legalizing hemp, and the decriminalization of medical marijuana. Now, he is leading the way on cryptocurrency advocacy. Just weeks following his campaign’s acceptance of bitcoin donations, Paul attended a bitcoin fund-raiser event at the Union League Club in New York on Sunday, April 19, 2015. He showed his support and continued interest in the currency, saying that he was open to new ideas and was intrigued by bitcoin’s potential to dramatically reduce transaction costs. This New York event comes at a time when the state is in the process of passing BitLicense, a restrictive licensing requirement for Bitcoin companies. In light of this regulation, Paul gave a nod to continued deregulation of bitcoin, crediting the advancement of the Internet in the 1990s with a lack of government regulation.\n\nThe presidential candidate is no stranger to cryptocurrency, having shared his insight about bitcoin in the past at other events and interviews. Although he has been somewhat skeptical of bitcoin — especially in regards to its value as a money — he still has generally been supportive of the currency. In a previous interview with Forbes, Paul suggested that bitcoiners take a Hayekian approach and create a currency backed by a basket of stocks or commodities. This suggestion drew backlash from the bitcoin community, with people rebuking him for his ignorance on the subject. However, despite his support and interest in bitcoin, Paul has readily admitted that he is no expert on the matter.\n\nAs a money, bitcoin’s value increases as more people use it, since it is accepted in more areas of the economy as a form of payment. This is also known as the network effect. In order for the network effect to take its course more, people must become introduced to it. And what better way to introduce bitcoin to a large audience than to have a major presidential candidate endorse it?\n\nWhat do you think about Rand Paul’s support for Bitcoin?

You may also be interested in reading these ones:', 'Blockchain Gaming is a series of reviews and previews of video games which utilize blockchain technology. This installment covers Moonga, the first online trading card game to track card ownership using blockchain technology.\n\nThis is the first installment of Blockchain Gaming, a series of written reviews and previews of blockchain-based video games. Since the cryptocurrency industry is still nascent, most of these games are still in rudimentary forms, but we believe that blockchain gaming will become a noteworthy genre, if not a commonly-used technology across the gaming world.\n\nMoonga, however, has been around for a while, having been released in 2009. It became a fan favorite as an early innovation in online trading card games, but began losing the spotlight to bigger competitors like Blizzard. Now EverdreamSoft is turning to blockchain gaming in an attempt to regain their competitive edge.\n\nStory\n\nMoonga takes place in the land of the Four Continents, ruled by the tyrannical Sayosia Empire. Like many fantasy stories, it follows the tale of an unwanted child who rises to prominence after apprenticing under a great wizard. Named Marnordir, he discovers a way a way to imbue magical essences into cards called Spells, which can be wielded in battle and are the basis of the game.\n\nTaking up residence in the country of Juzil, Marnordir used these cards to kickstart a rebellion against the Empire of Sayosia. Sayosian forces suffer heavy losses, but eventually Emperor Daryen obtains the secret of the Spells by way of deceit. That’s pretty much where the player takes off.\n\nThere’s not much more to learn about the story from the Moonga website, but you can ascertain bits and pieces about the Moonga universe from browsing the cards. There’s also a community and detailed lore online to flesh things out, but in truth, the focus isn’t really on the story. Other trading card games like Magic: the Gathering don’t have much story behind them, either, and they have stood the test of time.\n\nPresentation\n\nIt’s hard to expect much from a game running on Android and iOS. The game menu is nothing special, with a looping tune that can become monotonous. When you enter a match, battle music begins and the screen turns sideways to better virtualize the tabletop card-playing experience. Both screens are accompanied by the game’s stylistic illustrations.\n\nThe illustrations are where Moonga‘s presentation really shines. Some of the cards are really fun to look at, especially the creature and monster cards—they look almost like watercolor paintings. EverdreamSoft wants you to want these cards.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the grammatical errors in some cards and the online lore. Granted, this is a European company working in their spare time. The English-speaking market is huge, however, and it’s a very easy fix that would give the story more production value. They could also add captions at the bottom of cards (if space allows), like Wizards of the Coast does for MtG.\n\nGameplay\n\nHaving grown up on MtG and Pokémon cards, the rules seemed unfamiliar to me, but it works very well. You must choose five of your cards to use for the duration of the match; four are Attack Spells to be used once each during the games four rounds, and the fifth is a Support Spell played during one of the rounds as a surprise.\n\nWith only five cards to choose from per match, the key becomes expanding your options with cards that are not only powerful, but versatile. Players can collect Evolving Cards which morph Attack Spells into a different and generally more powerful form, and many different abilities called “capacities” are available, such as life boosts, direct damage, nullifies and counters.\n\nEach round consists of a battle between the opposing Attack Spells, which have a base amount of offense, defense, and damage dealing capability. Players take turns going first, meaning one opponent knows what Attack Spell the other will play. If your Spell’s offense is higher than the opponent’s defense, you deal the given amount of damage to the opponent. Attack Spells’ capacities can also raise or lower its or the opponents stats.\n\nYou can also raise your Attack Spell’s stats by expending Power Points—both players start with eight, and they are also required to play certain cards. Both players also start the match with twenty Life each, and whomever has more at the end of the last round is the winner. With only four rounds, it sounds like it would be over fast, but multiple layers of strategic thinking emerge from this set-up, which requires more skill than luck.\n\nBlockchain Integration\n\nBlockchain integration is what this series of reviews/previews will be all about, and EverdreamSoft is off to a good start with Moonga. One of the biggest buzz words in the decentralized space right now is smart property, and Moonga has joined the bandwagon by placing cards on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Counterparty protocol. When you trade the card to another player, you basically send it via a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThis allows for a multitude of possibilities. You could buy and sell cards on the blockchain for BitCrystals, which will be required to purchase booster packs with the arrival of Spells of Genesis. You could use the Spells in both games, making them true digital assets with the same essential properties as physical playing cards.\n\nThe possibilities are truly endless, here, and it will be exciting to see how it works out for EverdreamSoft. They plan to hold a crowdsale of BitCrystals in the future to raise funds for further games, and it’s likely that competitors will put in-game assets on the blockchain, as well.', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by Nigel Dollentas\n\nUnbreakable Coin is a cryptocurrency that launched a year ago promising uncompromising security for all users from the very core. UNB secret to this security is sharing the same source code as Bitcoins, running on the SHA-256 algorithm which is regarded as a highly secure encryption method. I was able to sit down with Jim Blasko, the president of UNB.\n\nAlso Read: Coinkite API Unlocks Potential for Bitcoin Developers, Merchants and Users\n\nWhat is the mission of Unbreakable Coin; what is it trying to achieve?\n\nThe mission behind UnbreakableCoin is pretty significant, but, in short, I would say, UnbreakableCoin was released with a vision to be a trusted, choice to Bitcoin.\n\nUnbreakableCoin strives to be globally recognized as the best option for crypto users who want a coin that remains truly decentralized and released fairly to all.\n\nHow is Unbreakable coin different compared to when it started, a year ago?\n\nThat question could be looked at two ways, so I’ll say this first: Nothing has changed with UnbreakableCoin, and that is what makes it better. I know it sounds funny but let me explain why. UnbreakableCoin’s source code is no different then when it was released a year ago there has been no changes to it.\n\nAs part of keeping UNB decentralized means, not making changes to the source code, the name, or anything really. Releasing new wallets that run on the old source code is fine, and we did that. However, there has been nothing different about the coin itself.\n\nThe way I see it, making changes to a publicly released coin, is a conflict of interest to holders of that coin and causes a significant disruption of decentralization of that coin.\n\nWith that said, the only physical difference to UnbreakableCoin over the last year would be the increases in difficulty from mining. With the difficulty currently at 25 Million, UNB is a pretty hard coin to mine, but those with ASIC devices can get some every day with the pools out there.\n\nThe second part of my answer is that overall awareness and usage for UnbrekableCoin has increased much faster than I ever imagined.\n\nI had no idea how fast this coin would grow especially with so many other options, but I can say I am proud of what’s happened so far and where we are headed.\n\nWe have developed to a point that I have to answer emails in different languages with help from google translator. I am very lucky to have met and worked with so many dedicated people from around the world that contribute their time to UnbreakableCoin’s awareness and real world usage.\n\nI am thankful to everyone involved in making UnbreakableCoin a better commodity for the communities.\n\nWhat makes Unbreakable Coin so “unbreakable”?\n\nSurprisingly, not many people have ever asked me what makes it “Unbreakable”. I am proud to say after one year, UnbreakableCoin has never broken. At times, we’ve seen some slow blocks, but the coin never has broken, and I feel that is a testament to its namesake.\n\nUnbreakableCoin was built on Bitcoin’s v0.8.6 SHA-256 core, which many feel is the most stable version of Bitcoin’s core, so that was the start of UnbreakableCoin’s toughness.\n\nWe complimented the core with our 24/7 dedicated servers that provide permanent nodes that consistently point to each other and save UnbreakableCoin’s blockchain. Combined with users of UnbreakableCoin’s wallet (creating temporary nodes) we have a network for UnbreakableCoin that spans the globe.\n\nNo matter the size of any node, each one is an extra layer of protection for UNB, in this aspect, we are getting stronger by the day. An unknown fact, the pattern in our logo is a representation of the mesh network of connected nodes.\n\nOne moderator from Cryptsy.com complimented UNB by saying “It has been nice working with UNB because it never has to go into maintenance.” I think from an exchange standpoint UNB does exactly what its supposed to do, work all the time.\n\nWhat separates UNB from other cryptocurrencies?\n\nMany things separate UNB from the pack of alternative crypto coins, and possibly one of the most important factors is that Unbreakablecoin is about the closest coin to Bitcoin that exists. From a technology standpoint, we are identical, and UnbreakableCoin can do anything Bitcoin can do.\n\nThere aren’t many SHA-256 coins when compared to all Scrypt coins and newer algorithms which surprised me at first because SHA-256 is known as the most secure of the algorithms, and like Bitcoin, UnbreakableCoin is also POW (Proof of Work).\n\nSoon I realized how this SHA-256 POW creates a complication that makes it harder to become viable, see much like Bitcoin, UnbreakableCoin always needs miners and miners go for the most profitable coin. With that fully understood, I added dedicated mining hash that will always keep the blockchain moving.\n\nRecently I’ve noticed a trend where many crypto coin developers will give up on their attempts to get people interested in mining their coins, and they have retreated to POS (Proof of Stake) which eventually destroy the coins value (and they usually quit soon after that).\n\nIn other cases, I’ve seen coins get abandoned by the original developer because they did not make any money, and it was too much work for them. UnbreakableCoin was not created to make me rich overnight, and there was no premine to UnbreakbleCoin, so once it was released I had to buy my UnbreakableCoin just like many others (I had no mining gear when UNB was launched).\n\nI have dedicated the last year of my life to making UnbreakableCoin something people would like to use, and I’ve had excellent support and enjoyed every minute of it. I am not going anywhere, and neither is UnbreakableCoin; we are here to stay.\n\nI felt by taking a straightforward approach to our community that UNB would be successful someday, and I’m proud that it’s happening much faster than I anticipated. Just a few other point about what separates us from other crypto coins, we were the first crypto coin to get an LLC license, open an office in Las Vegas (Were about 2 miles from the strip), provide the public with a phone number so they could call UnbreakableCoin’s team.\n\nFrom there, I launched UNBAuctions.com, which is an auction site that allows sellers to accept over 100 different crypto coins as payment for their sales. It is an excellent site for UnbreakableCoin fans, and it is also gives 100+ other crypto coins real world usage – something many of them do not have.\n\nSo one thing, is we are helping to make other coins viable as well. Prior to the auction sire, I had never seen a coin’s group give real world usage to another coin- like who helps the competition? We do.\n\nI have had many developers who were very appreciative and thankful that I added their coin to our auction site, personally I am just glad to be doing something helpful for the crypto industry. I think my favorite part of the auction site, is that it is the easiest way on the planet to get crypto currency.\n\nNo money is needed, and no credit cards are accepted, there is no reason to learn how to mine, just sell/auction off your old stuff and get crypto for it. Sometimes, the greatest things are simple.\n\nWhat is in the future for UNB?\n\nEach day brings a new idea for UnbreakableCoin and my plans for UNB will never stop. For over a year now, my life has been consumed by what UNB can grow into, and I am even more excited about it now than ever. I see UnbreakableCoin doing splendid things as we keep growing.\n\nThe crypto communities have embraced the ideals of UNB I am humbled by how many people considered UNB a crypto community favorite. The communities out there have been very supportive.\n\nTo show my appreciation of the UNB supporters, I have been building and hosting websites for people who are willing to accept UNB in their business. I have a few upcoming cool projects so make sure to stay tuned. Most recently, I built a radio station called BitcoinTalkRadio.com for a friend of mine.\n\nYou can expect lots of UnbreakableCoin advertisement there. I think we have something special going on there.\n\nI expect to expand UNB as much as possible, and more websites are coming for UNB, We are working as fast as we can to launch some really special projects for UNB, and some investment money surely wouldn’t hurt us.\n\nI continue to surrounded UNB with the best minds in Crypto that I can find, creating our Unbreakable Team, and recently we got the best Pro PR teams in the Crypto industry led by Michael Terpin.\n\nI am very proud of where we are after one year, and where we are going from here. All signs are pointing to right places for UNB.\n\nThanks for your time Jim!\n\nFor more information: UNB official website\n\nDo you use UNB on a regular basis? Where do you see it in a years time?

Only when the five mounted the platform did George Osborne look like a man of power and a certainty to extend his 14-year reign as Tatton’s MP and then\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009ah, that bit’s become a bit tricky. He had arrived at the Knutsford Academy for hustings organised by the Knutsford Guardian. The format was in keeping with the rules of disengagement that have become the norm this election: the questions, primarily local, were preselected; the timings strict; interventions almost non-existent. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was fine with all that. He was, even as they assembled, polite but a bit distant, which is his style as an MP. He might have had a good gossip with his Labour opponent, David Pinto-Duschinsky, a special adviser at the Treasury under the old regime; they might even have had a decent joust on financial nitty-gritty. Neither was on the agenda. In depth UK general election The UK faces its closest and most unpredictable general election in memory on May 7 Further reading Even so, Mr Osborne had to absorb pressure. The second question was about whether MPs should have regular surgeries, and the others piled in with promises about their constant availability. “I have always put the constituency first. I have surgeries here. I had one earlier this month,” he said when his turn came. “I’ve just been at the scout hut to make sure they’re getting the renovations done.” But there was just a hint of the country weekender in his answers: “We’ve got to get the redesign of Bottom Street right,” he added later with slightly suspicious emphasis, the way the couple who have bought the big house might say: “Of course we use the village shop. We bought our milk there the Christmas before last.” While half-listening to the others, the chancellor had a faraway look, as though something else was on his mind. He hardly reacted to what they said, except when the Ukip man, Stuart Hutton, proclaimed that all his party’s plans had been properly costed, whereupon the chancellor slipped him a sideways look of contempt as though Mr Hutton had just put a turd on the table. Mostly, his eyes darted around; the brow was furrowed. As the evening went on, his command grew and his political class shone through. He subtly got across that the planned road and rail improvements were not unconnected with his influence. But he did not own the hall: the biggest applause of the night came when a sixth-former asked if the railways ought to be renationalised.

Explore graphic This is a notoriously rich and ostentatious constituency, covering the lushest parts of the Cheshire commuter belt. But the footballers are rarely on the electoral roll. The Rolex shop and Aston Martin dealers in Wilmslow are close to one of the constituency’s three food banks. And both Knutsford and Alderley Edge stations are shockers, unthinkable in the south. Tatton was where in 1997 the disgraced Tory Neil Hamilton was overthrown by the Independent Martin Bell who, had he not stood down, might be the MP even now. And George Osborne would have gone elsewhere and never been to the scout hut or Bottom Street. He may soon be spending more time worrying about such things rather than the deficit in 2019-20; hence, I suppose, the furrowed brow.

The charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.\n\nSpeaking from Antigua in a YouTube video in late February, Micon described a raid of his Las Vegas home.\n\n“A bunch of guys with guns broke down my door, put me in handcuffs, serving a warrant from the Nevada gaming commission,” he said.\n\nThe 10 agents “stole most of my electronics,” he added.\n\nCourt papers filed Monday state that Micon operated Seals with Clubs, which accepted Bitcoin digital currency, between March 1, 2014 and Feb. 9, 2015 “without first procuring and thereafter maintaining in effect the required licenses.”\n\nSeals with Clubs was promptly shut down, but Micon then launched a new Bitcoin site, SwCPoker.eu.\n\n“All the Bitcoins were safe,” he said in his YouTube statement, encouraging players to pull their currency from the former site. “Math does not bow to guns.”\n\nMicon was not charged with a crime in February, and it was unclear whether he was still in Antigua when the $20,000 arrest warrant was issued Monday.\n\n“After I was led out in handcuffs in my underwear, it was pretty clear that it was proper to leave sooner rather than later,” he said in the video. “And I didn’t really want my 2-year-old daughter, whom I love very much, to grow up in a police state where creativity is often met with guns, handcuffs.”\n\nHe said the gaming authorities indicated that they were familiar with his “social feeds and my entire output as a journalist.”\n\nHe continued: “I don’t think I was doing anything unethical.”\n\nMicon also supported himself with revenue from live and online poker winnings and operation of legal websites dealing with news about gaming and Bitcoin.\n\nReached through email Monday, Micon directed inquiries to his lawyer.\n\n“Bryan has always maintained that he committed no wrongdoing, but I’m not in a position to comment on the Attorney General’s filing because I haven’t seen it,” said defense attorney Richard Schonfeld.\n\nContact reporter David Ferrara at dferrara@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-1039.

Project manager Ivan Starinin told CoinDesk:\n\n""The bitcoin community is open source at its core and we wanted to contribute somehow. Giving away our source code turned out to be the logical step to show our love to the community. The bitcoin ecosystem needs to reunite at these times more than ever before.""\n\nBitcoin in Russia\n\nBitcoin has come under increasing scrutiny by the Russian authorities.\n\nEarlier this year, the country\'s media watchdog proceeded to blacklist a series of bitcoin-related websites, restricting domestic access to their domains. More recently, the censored websites – including bitcoin news website and exhibition company Smile Expo – took their case before a judge in an attempt to overrule the decision.\n\nSuch actions were prompted by legislation proposed by the Russian Ministry of Finance in August 2014. Expected to be passed this summer, the draft bill would ban digital currencies, imposing fines on those who openly promote the technology, as part of a broader bid to crackdown on ""monetary surrogates"" in the face of capital flight abroad.\n\nAt the time, the chairman of Crypto Currencies Foundation of Russia, Igor Chepkasov, told CoinDesk that the ruling was part of a wider clampdown which he believed pointed to the prohibition of bitcoin in the country. He urged bitcoin enthusiasts to fight against the imposed measures, asking them to ""unite and fight for their rights"".\n\nMoscow Red Square image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It is unclear if the financing would be part of it.\n\nGet Term Sheet, our daily newsletter on deals and deal-makers.', 'Last week, lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen and other Bitcoin Core developers joined the recently established MIT Digital Currency Initiative. This was widely interpreted as an MIT takeover of the roles of leadership, funding and co-ordination of Bitcoin technical development, previously claimed by the Bitcoin Foundation. In parallel, Bitcoin policy think tank Coin Center is claiming the role of interface to policy makers and regulators, with the publication of a framework for state digital currency regulation.\n\nThe report, titled “State Digital Currency Principles and Framework,” is a model for digital-currency-specific regulations and laws. The report provides a template with structure, definitions and language for the essential components of any digital currency law: \u200bwho must be licensed, how start-ups are encouraged, how solvency is guaranteed and other necessary elements.\n\nRecently, Bitcoin-friendly bills have been proposed in Utah, New Hampshire and New York City. Texas, Kansas, California, Pennsylvania and North Carolina also have expressed interest in Bitcoin regulations, and New York has proposed the controversial “Bitlicense” scheme, which many observers consider far too strict.\n\nCoin Center hopes that states will use the report as a template for their own bills and regulations.\n\n“The state that reaps the benefits of new technologies, new jobs and enhanced financial inclusion will be the state that first discovers a path worth following,” says Executive Director Jerry Brito. “We hope this report will help in that endeavor.”\n\nBrito adds that, to be a leader in the future of financial technology, a state must carefully forge a path toward consumer protection and avoid the pitfalls of inartful and unnecessarily costly regulation.\n\nOf course, striking an optimal balance between necessary crime prevention and consumer protection on the one hand and equally necessary innovation and technology leadership on the other is challenging. The recent initiative of the Isle of Man government to create a balanced regulatory environment that offers “freedom to flourish” to innovative fintech companies, while keeping crime and fraud out, is an important development in that respect.\n\nThe Coin Center report emphasizes that only operators with unilateral control of customer funds should be subject to a license requirement, and that anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, if absolutely necessary at all, should match, but not exceed, federal standards.\n\n“Intermediaries who do not assume a position of trust, nonfinancial uses and individual access are digital currency innovations that should be encouraged,” the report says. “These intermediaries can benefit both consumers and businesses through improved financial privacy, financial inclusion, and vibrant technology-based economies. These uses should not be burdened by compliance costs that lack concomitant consumer protection benefits.”\n\nBrito, who is also a professor of Law at George Mason University, co-authored the report “Bitcoin: A Primer for Policymakers.” Coin Center is a not-for-profit research and advocacy center focused on public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies such as Bitcoin.\n\n“Our mission is to build a better understanding of these technologies and to promote a regulatory climate that preserves the freedom to innovate using blockchain technologies,” says the Coin Center website. “We do this by producing and publishing policy research from respected academics and experts, educating policymakers and the media about blockchain technology, and by engaging in advocacy for sound public policy.”\n\nIt’s probably too early to speculate on which organizations will co-ordinate the technical and policy-related aspects of Bitcoin development, but it seems clear that MIT and Coin Center are establishing strong leadership positions.', ""Bitt, the Caribbean's first bitcoin exchange company, is looking to tap the region’s potential for remittances and banking services by providing faster and cheaper payments using bitcoin. CoinTelegraph spoke to the CEO and co-founder of Bitt, Gabriel Abed, about Bitt’s plans, as well as the challenges and specificities associated with the Caribbean market.\n\n“There is huge potential for Bitcoin and blockchain based transactions in the Caribbean. —Gabriel Abed, Bitt CEO\n\nAfter a two-year development period, the company launched its BTC solution suite on March 30. It includes a mobile digital wallet, international remittances services and e-commerce merchant solutions.\n\nBitt, which currently runs under beta, is vying for market share of traditional money transmitters and payment solutions services. They want to enable anyone around the world to start accepting bitcoin, with special focus on locals in the Caribbean region, an estimated 60% of which are currently unbanked or under-banked.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Why did you decide to launch the Bitt exchange for the Caribbean, and how much potential does this region hold for Bitcoin in general?\n\nGabriel Abed: There is huge potential for Bitcoin and blockchain based transactions in the Caribbean.The costs of remittance are astronomic and can exceed 10%, so this is a key area where large savings can be passed onto to end users by using Bitcoin as a vehicle of value transfer and accounting. In order to offer remittance services, however, an exchange with market liquidity is needed. Recognizing this and the lack of any serving Caribbean currencies, we saw a need to be met and an opportunity to seize.\n\nThe Bitt Exchange is built to accommodate high frequency trading and the demands of Wall Street institutional traders using our APIs. At the same time, we recognize the importance of having an easy-to-use platform for less sophisticated traders, as adoption is a key component of Bitt's MO.\n\nCT: With 60% of Caribbeans under banked, how much opportunity is there for ‘remittances’ in terms of savings for users, compared to conventional methods such as Western Union?\n\nGA: The opportunities are endless. The problem is that legacy systems such as Western Union and Money Gram are too slow and costly. Bitt fixes those two problems and adds an extra layer of security with low-friction payment mechanisms. Our solutions are faster and cheaper.\n\nCT: You just closed a seed round of US$1.5 million. Will you be hosting future rounds and what will these funds go towards?\n\nGA: Simply put, the money will be used towards building the next generation of financial tools in the Caribbean and helping ignite the Caribbean's first ever, e-commerce and digital boom on behalf of a population in search of options. We are going for future rounds, but will aim to achieve the right partners to take forward with us as we revolutionize digital transactions in this part of the world.\n\n“We believe the advantages [of Bitcoin] outweigh the disadvantages of adoption and expect to see greater legal clarity, similar to that of the U.S.”\n\nCT: The recent meeting of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) looked at cryptocurrencies promising future clarification. How conducive would you say the regulatory environment for Bitcoin startups is in the Caribbean, and is there a favorable outlook?\n\nGA: Having forums like ECLAC that address digital currencies and the risks and opportunities they represent through educational forums is certainly a cause for optimism, as it shows that there is an understanding of the importance of being proactive and not reactive to a technology as important as the blockchain in the Caribbean. We believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of adoption and expect to see greater legal clarity, similar to that of the U.S. and leading Western European countries in the future.\n\nCT: Some Caribbean jurisdictions are especially renowned as tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands. How will this play into Bitt’s overall business strategy as well as regulatory stance?\n\nGA: It's well-known that low taxes are used as an incentive to attract offshore business to the shores of many islands. Bitt takes advantage of these efficiencies, but they have no bearing on our regulatory stance, which is simple: if the legislation exists, we will follow it.\n\n“Our biggest difficulty is an uninformed government unit who may take a negative stance based on limited research and FUD.”\n\nCT: Are there any islands in particular that are either hostile or favorable toward cryptocurrencies, and where do you see the biggest potential or difficulty?\n\nGA: So far, no hostility, but we have found favorable grounds in some territories. I am not prepared to say anything further as the conversations are in their early stages.\n\nOur biggest potential is in the territories with governments who have a history on forward-thinking implementations of next-generation architecture. Our biggest difficulty is an uninformed government unit who may take a negative stance based on limited research and FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt).\n\nCT: Given the recent hacks at other exchanges such as Bitstamp and BTER, and Bitcoin’s security concerns in general, how do you ensure that your customer’s funds are safe?\n\nGA: Eric Lombrozo, Michael Perklin, Luke Dash Jr., Oliver Gale and Gabriel Abed designed a pretty comprehensive security policy that ensures customers are looked after, and the incidents mentioned above can never apply to Bitt. For starters, we use HSMs [hardware security modules] to generate keys in an offline environment using true-RNG [random number generation] and HD multisignature wallets with independent hot and cold wallet systems in place with redundant transaction signing servers.\n\nOur security is one of the leading solutions in the industry. The difference is that Bitt.com has a network security engineer as the CEO (me), and therefore data security and mathematical security is my focus. We could have launched over one year ago, but choose to take our time to address every concern and possible attack vector.\n\n“The Caribbean is a special place and you need to be well aware on how to approach officials with something as radical and different as Bitcoin.”\n\nCT: The “Let the Bit Drop” Bitcoin Festival that was scheduled to be held on the island of Dominica on March 12 was cancelled due to a lack of “logistical support” from the small Caribbean nation. What do you think they mean by logistical support, and will we ever see such a unique experiment take place in the Caribbean?\n\nGA: Lack of research into Caribbean markets and attempts to work with non-governmental officials on a project that required government oversight appeared to have been the issue. The model was quite intriguing and could have been very successful. However, foreign companies think doing business in the Caribbean is the same as their part of the world.\n\nThe Caribbean is a special place and you need to be well aware on how to approach officials with something as radical and different as Bitcoin. Discussions and education must come first, followed by a proposed business model, before an announcement or declaration is made. As we have seen in the case of Let the Bit Drop, premature announcements that are pinned on a government's approval are a headache waiting to happen. You need to appreciate this market and how business works in this part of the world that we are pleased to call “home.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

By creating a system of rights to copyrighted works in digital form, Bitcoin can turn art from mere collector’s pieces to limited and tradable virtual goods.\n\nArtists have long attempted to make their artwork scarce by creating limited editions of their pieces, as well as numbering the pieces. Digital artists have tried this as well, thereby undermining the digital nature of their artwork.\n\nVogler has teamed up with the law firm of dtb Rechtsanwälte in Berlin to create a license using the Bitcoin technology to transform digital artworks into technically and legally limited and tradable virtual properties.\n\nThe holder of the user-rights are recorded in the Bitcoin-Blockchain, and the rights to a work are assigned with a Bitcoin transaction output.\n\n“For the first time, digital art becomes collectable and tradable without printing or materializing it.” explains Vogler.\n\n“In this way digital artworks are turned into virtual properties which are superior to material artworks in many respects: Their acquisition comes with more usage rights and their ownership can be easily proven. Furthermore they can be securely transferred worldwide with minimal transaction costs and – if paid with Bitcoins – securely sold without the need for an escrow service.”\n\nThe right to transfer the rights of the art-piece itself is exclusive, meaning the virtual property is technically and legally limited to a single user. Vogler publishes his works under the licenses, which he has electronically signed, and can be viewed here.\n\nArt aficionados have made Berlin, home to 440 galleries and world-class collections of some 10,000 international artists, a hot spot on the global artistic circuit.\n\nKnown for its youthful energy, restlessness, innovation and grit, post-Berlin Wall Berlin has been a hotspot for emerging international artists, and thus a logical location for Vogler’s project.\n\nThe art market itself has been booming. Last year’s sales were a record $66bn, a 7 percent increase compared to the previous year. Two months ago an oil painting by French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Gauguin sold for nearly $300m, the highest price ever paid for a piece of art.\n\nCould Vogler’s idea revolutionize how luxury art is owned? Perhaps more importantly, could it help even out the playing field for those on the more realistic end of the art market? Only time will tell. Already, however, Bitcoin has made inroads into the art market, with high-end pieces being sold in Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'News powered by Bitcoinist.net\n\nArticle by JP Buntinx\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin adoption and awareness, most of the money is flowing in through Chinese Bitcoin exchanges. Several major players, such as BTCChina, OKCoin and Huobi, are coming up with various tools and features to give them a competitive edge. And it is OKCoin who has come up with the very first Superwallet, a tool that gives mainstream consumers access to Bitcoin technology in the native currencies, starting with CNY.\n\nAlso Read: OKCoin To Expand Bitcoin Adoption With New Service\n\nOKCoin’s Superwallet\n\nEveryday consumers have a hard time wrapping their head around the Bitcoin technology due to the fairly steep learning curve involved in becoming acclimated with Bitcoin. Even if the average consumer is willing to discuss Bitcoin, he or she will often refer to the fact that Bitcoin’s purchasing power is always denoted in USD. Why not a different currency, such as EUR, GBP or CNY?\n\nOKCoin is trying to change that problem by creating their Superwallet feature, which is called OKLink. What does this Superwallet do differently from other Bitcoin wallets? First of all, OKLink is an open digital wallet, allowing both national and digital currencies to be transferred across borders in the blink of an eye. Furthermore, as an added perk for the consumer, OKLink is free of charge.\n\nOKLink entered its public beta testing phase on April 22nd; at this point, the wallet is only available to use through a web interface. However, OKCoin officials are expecting to release mobile applications — for both iOS and Android — in the next few months. As of press time, OKLink supports CNY, BTC and USD wallets, each of which can transfer in and out of CNY directly.\n\nPractical Information Regarding Usage\n\nWe have gotten used to a financial infrastructure where every e-money or online payment solution works within proprietary networks, which centralizes every aspect of online finance. For example, a Paypal user can not directly transfer value to an OKPay customer without going through a conversion process. To make matters even worse, these conversion processes are always subject to fees.\n\nOKCoin is a frontrunner in this regard, as they are the first company to allow a seamless transfer of value between Bitcoin and national currencies. Not only does the end user get to use their preferred currency at any given time, but this solution also lets you benefit from the Bitcoin protocol without exposing yourself to price volatility.\n\nOKCoin offers an example of a practical use-case for OKLink:\n\n“Consumer A sends CNY to Consumer B who receives as USD. The CNY from the consumer’s wallet will be first exchanged into BTC and then transferred through the bitcoin network into Consumer B’s wallet where BTC is converted to USD.”\n\nThis utility is just one of the wallet’s many possibilities, as OKLink also lets you spend the supported fiat currencies wherever Bitcoin is accepted. For example, buying an online gift card from Gyft.com with fiat currency would be made possible through OKLink. This method also cuts out any fees associated with fiat currency payments passing through banks and credit card institutions.\n\nIt comes down to this: the Bitcoin blockchain can support multiple ways of transferring value across borders. While the main focus has always been on the native Bitcoin currency OKLink now makes it possible to use blockchain technology for fiat currency payments in real-time.\n\nSource: Press Release\n\nAll images courtesy of OKCoin and OKLink', 'Patrick Byrne, CEO and chairman of Overstock.com. Joe Pugliese/WIRED\n\nOverstock.com is one step closer to offering a new kind of stock intended to remake the stock market in much the same way the bitcoin digital currency remade our money system.\n\nOn Friday, the Salt Lake City-based online retailer filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission that indicates it may issue up to $500 million in stock or other securities using technology akin to the online software system that underpins bitcoin. ""We may decide to offer securities as digital securities...the ownership and transfer of which are recorded on a cryptographically-secured distributed ledger system using technology similar to (or the same as) the distributed ledger technology used for trading digital currencies,"" the filing reads.\n\nThis past summer, Overstock\'s free-thinking CEO, Patrick Byrne, said that the company was hoping to issue a ""cryptosecurity"" using bitcoin-like technology, and he hired both the developers and the lawyers needed to do so. Now, he and his company have taken the idea to government regulators. As Byrne puts it, he\'s calling on the SEC to ""sprinkle holy water"" on his push towards digital securities. ""This is a decision point for the establishment,"" he says.\n\nByrne hopes to offer stock that\'s controlled not by a central stock exchange such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ, but by a network of machines spread across the internet.\n\nBasically, Byrne hopes to offer stock that\'s controlled not by a central stock exchange such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ, but by a network of machines spread across the internet—machines outside the control of any one central authority. Using cryptographic algorithms, these machines would mathematically verify all trades and record them in an online ledger that anyone could examine at any time, much as the worldwide bitcoin network verifies and records the exchange of money. Byrne and Overstock have long complained of loop holes in our existing stock markets, and he believes that technology can help shore up these holes.\n\n""The prospect of using a blockchain-like public ledger to hold securities or other assets is quite exciting and one that should be explored,"" says James Angel, a professor of finance at Georgetown University who specializes in the details of the U.S. financial system. ""This will make a great test case as to whether it really works or whether it will suffer Mt. Gox-like problems."" Mt. Gox is the popular bitcoin exchange that descended into bankruptcy after hackers broke into its online system and eventually made off with the equivalent of $460 million in bitcoin.\n\nA Free Market\n\nLast year, Overstock became the first major online retailer to accept payments in bitcoin. Like so many others, Byrne argues that the digital currency can free our economy from the grip of big banks and big government. Now, he\'s bringing this same attitude to stocks. His project is just one of many that seek to remake the stock market using bitcoin technology, such as NXT, Mastercoin, Bitshares, and Counterparty. At one point, Overstock hired some of the primary developers behind Counterparty, but these engineers have since left the company.\n\nOn Friday, Overstock filed what is called a ""shelf registration."" Basically, this would allow the company to sell any kind of security—common stock, preferred, debt, warrants, etc.—if and when it chooses to. Such filings are not uncommon–though this one is unusual in that it says the company could issue the securities in digital form.\n\nAccording to Overstock\'s filing, the company would offer its digital security through what\'s called an alternative trading system, or ATS. This is essentially a stock market alternative that must be registered with the SEC. Overstock would have to make arrangements with an existing ATS or somehow create a new one. It must also answer any objections from the SEC.\n\nInitially very few shareholders will choose to hold their shares in digital form because of the technological uncertainty. James Angel, Georgetown\n\nGeorgetown\'s Angel expects the SEC to approve the filing, but he says this may take a while. ""The SEC staff in corporate finance is notoriously risk averse when it comes to new technology, so they may delay things for a long while and request lots of additional disclosures,"" he says. ""[But] the parade of horribles in the disclosure is very complete, so I would think that it would get approved eventually.""\n\nAngel adds, however, that if Overstock does offer a digital security, he expects few investors to take advantage of it—at least initially. ""My own prediction is that initially very few shareholders will choose to hold their shares in digital form because of the technological uncertainty. Investors tend to be very risk averse about things such as custody,"" he says. To succeed, he says, such an offering must have proper regulatory oversight by the SEC and carry insurance from an organization such as the SIPC.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment on Overstock\'s filing. But according to Byrne and company spokesperson Judd Bagley, Overstock expects the SEC to open a review of the filing. Byrne has an unusually combative history with the SEC, but he says that he intends to take a more diplomatic route towards a cryptosecurity.

Creative teams involved in the entire industry which try to visually articulate Cryptocurrency as a whole have, up to now, been presented with a very unique challenge as it has no overarching brand.\n\n”The initiative to Brand Crypto saw entries come from designers from 90+ different countries spanning five continents. From the complete list of entries, six brands were shortlisted by a panel of crypto industry experts and these choices were then resubmitted to the global crypto and design community for input and participation in finalizing the selected brand identity.Brand Me Crypto winner, Teresa Ledford said of her winning design, “I wanted to create a symbol that was fairly simple and would translate well to handwriting. After looking at all the existing symbols used around the world, my goal was to come up with something that was unique and descriptive, yet still had some consistency with other currency marks.\n\n”The design, chosen by the people and endorsed by the community, has now been given creative, open brand licensing rights and made available to all at BrandMeCrypto.com.\n\n“With the brand identity selected and brand formats becoming available for download at brandmecrypto.com we would like to encourage members in the crypto and creative community to utilize this brand when representing the overarching crypto market for global awareness, acceptance and industry-wide adoption.” said Chantel.A small and simple ‘Supporting Brand Crypto’ icon - which links to the brand’s downloadable file - has been created for those in the industry to add to their websites and show their support. This, together with the community already beginning to adopt the chosen design to represent the wider industry, is set to fulfill the promise of a problem solved.']"
04/28/2015,"[""Coinbase has launched its bitcoin wallet, exchange and merchant services in the UK.\n\nThe UK is only the second country, after the US, to gain access to the San Francisco-based company's bitcoin trading platform – Coinbase Exchange.\n\nCoinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said the decision to launch in the UK was partly influenced by his trip to London last year.\n\n“The interest in the UK is at a different level than it is elsewhere in Europe. We got the sense that the demand there was really high … [and] London is a financial capital of the world, so it was a logical next step,” he explained.\n\nExchange access\n\nUsers in the UK can now trade bitcoin on the Coinbase Exchange in two new currency pairs – BTC/GBP and BTC/EUR.\n\nCustomers are now able to add GBP and US dollars to their Coinbase wallets via wire transfer and can add euro using SEPA. The company’s merchant tools are also available in the UK.\n\nThe exchange launched in select states in the US three months ago and Armstrong said he was more than pleased at how well it has performed to date.\n\n“We’re already the biggest exchange by volume in the US and number three or four in the world, depending on the data you look at. I think launching in the UK will help improve on that and increase the liquidity on the platform,” he said.\n\nBanks and regulators\n\nArmstrong said the two major issues Coinbase has faced when trying to expand into other countries are trying to get banks to cooperate and navigating regulatory environments.\n\nThe CEO explained his company has a banking partner in the EU region (although declined to name it), which agreed to support GBP payments.\n\nHe said working with regulators in the UK was time consuming, but he gave credit to the financial regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA):\n\n“The FCA has been really great to work with. I think they’re being very forward thinking in this space right now. The UK regulators were very easy to work with and I think are setting a good precedent for how other countries should look at this.”\n\nOngoing strategy\n\nCoinbase is in talks with regulators and banks in a number of other countries with a view of expanding access to its exchange and wallet even further.\n\n“One of our goals is that we want to try to be, as a wallet at least, available in 40 countries by the end of this year, which is a pretty ambitious goal – we’re in 24 right now. But I think that will certainly be possible,” said Armstrong.\n\nHis company, which has raised a total of $106m to date, currently employs 105 people across the globe, boasts 2.1 million users and provides bitcoin payment processing services to over 39,000 merchants.\n\nArmstrong explained that Coinbase’s strategy is threefold: “Our strategy is: Launch the exchange, make it the most liquid exchange in a bunch of different countries. Launch the API, make it easier for people to build all sorts of applications, and the third thing is our consumer wallet, so we’re expanding that to a bunch of developing and first world countries.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“If we can get all of those three things done, I think we’re going to be able to help move the bitcoin ecosystem forward.”\n\nUK image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Micon is accused of failing to acquire the necessary licensure to operate Seals with Clubs.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and $50,000 in fines.\n\nSeals with Clubs shut down in February, a move attributed to then-unspecified operational security concerns believed to be connected with a pending crackdown by state regulators. Micon later left the US for Antigua, stating shortly after the closure of Seals with Clubs that his home had been raided by agents from the Nevada Gaming Commission.\n\nIn a press statement, Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt said that the charges were being brought against Micon in order to protect the state\'s gaming industry, noting:\n\n“Operating or otherwise conducting gaming in the state without a license is illegal, and this office will aggressively pursue individuals and companies who seek to circumvent gaming regulations.""\n\nDuring a press conference, according to the Review-Journal, it was revealed that an agent for the Nevada Gaming Control Board had gone undercover during an investigation into Seals with Clubs.\n\nAccording to the release, the case is ""the first instance of state-level criminal prosecution in Nevada of an illegal Internet poker site using Bitcoin as currency.""\n\nComplaint alleges unlawful operation\n\nAccording to the complaint, Micon is accused of running an unlicensed gaming platform from March of last year until early February, when Seals with Clubs announced its closure.\n\nThe three-page filing states:\n\n""Between about March 1, 2014 , and February 9, 2015, [Bryan Micon] willfully operated, carried on, conducted maintained and/or exposed for play in the State of Nevada an internet gaming poker site under the name Seals with Clubs, without first procuring and thereafter maintaining in effect the required licenses.""\n\nMicon\'s attorney Richard Shonfeld did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The new stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet.\n\nOverstock, one of the first and largest online retailers to accept bitcoin payments, first announced the project in October 2014.\n\n“There is an opportunity to recreate the financial world as we know it in the parallel universe that is the blockchain,” Overstock’s CEO Patrick Byrne told Wired. “We are writing rules for this whole new universe. “ In a recent Coin Telegraph interview, Byrne said that Overstock is building the platform that will let companies issue a crypto-equity, which is a new frontier with many legal obstacles.\n\nOn Friday, Overstock got one step closer to implementation. In a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Overstock indicated that it may issue up to $500 million in stock or other securities using the blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin.\n\n“We may decide to offer securities as digital securities, meaning the securities will be uncertificated securities, the ownership and transfer of which are recorded on a cryptographically-secured distributed ledger system using technology similar to (or the same as) the distributed ledger technology used for trading digital currencies,” reads the prospectus. “Digital securities are designed to enable trades to settle immediately or nearly immediately, unlike traditional securities, [and] enable the securities holder to hold its securities directly or through its broker-dealer, outside the system for traditional securities.”\n\n“The prospect of using a blockchain-like public ledger to hold securities or other assets is quite exciting and one that should be explored,” Georgetown University professor of finance James Angel told Wired.\n\nThe hypothetical language used in the filing shows that it is but the first official interaction with the SEC, which may take some time to digest and give a green light to this novel and potentially disruptive approach to securities.\n\nThe filing is a “shelf registration” meant to introduce future offerings to regulators and investors gradually, with more detailed information expected to come later. However, Overstock’s CEO Patrick Byrne is confident: “I wouldn’t have taken all the time and trouble and expense to do this if I didn’t plan on using it someday soon,” he told Wired.\n\nAngel thinks the SEC will approve the filing eventually, but investors will be initially cautious.\n\nThe Overstock digital securities would not be listed for trading on existing stock exchanges, but traded exclusively on a specific trading system to be registered with the SEC as an Alternative Trading System (ATS). The prospectus emphasizes that the ATS will operate with the speed and irrevocability appropriate to the immediate or nearly immediate settlement of digital securities, but warns that “the payment mechanics of the ATS are novel and untested.”\n\nThe distributed ledger used to record transfers of ownership of digital securities, represented by ledger balances and secured by cryptographic key pairs, will be available to the public and store the complete trading histories.\n\nThe ATS won’t use a Bitcoin wallet approach where the cryptographic keys are controlled by the user – at least not initially – but a centralized key management scheme similar to that used by “Bitcoin banks” such as Circle. Initially, either the ATS itself or each broker-dealer participating on that ATS would hold the private keys on behalf of securities holders.\n\nThis centralized or semi-centralized model, which may appear as a step back from the decentralized blockchain, is justified because it will enable securities holders to manage their digital securities account with a simple login and password, similar to traditional online brokerage accounts.\n\nThe use of the word “initially,” however, indicates that Overstock may implement a more decentralized model in a second phase. Customer protection against dishonest brokers will be provided by multisig: “There can be multiple private keys, any number of which may be required in order to authorize a transfer of ownership of the digital securities,” notes the filing.', 'Purse has announced \'Instant\', a new product that aims to expand the appeal of its existing e-commerce marketplace while continuing its focus on Amazon shopping.\n\nLaunched in 2014, Purse now claims 32,000 users on its traditional \'Name Your Discount\' marketplace, which matches individuals looking to buy bitcoin with a credit card and users willing to sell bitcoin in exchange for savings on Amazon purchases.\n\nPurse co-founder Andrew Lee explained that Instant finds the company stepping in to play an active role on the formerly peer-to-peer (P2P) platform, purchasing Amazon gift cards from its market and holding a reserve of these assets for buyers who want items more quickly.\n\nDrawing on a more familiar product as an example, Lee told CoinDesk:\n\n""Our model was like Airbnb, person to person. This is like if Airbnb said let\'s take the 100 most popular locations in San Francisco and just contract them out and offer them to consumers.""\n\nIn exchange for reduced savings, 5% as compared to as much as 20%, Lee said that Instant buyers will benefit from free shipping with Amazon Prime.\n\nLee went on to suggest the move was inspired by a need to improve the platform\'s user experience.\n\n""In terms of the delivery time, we didn\'t have much of a guarantee,"" Lee explained. ""Sometimes it would be one-two days, other times it would be two weeks. With Purse Instant we\'re taking out all those variables.""\n\nLee went on to suggest that he believes the move positions Purse to be at the forefront of using bitcoin as a means to penetrate the consumer deals industry while solving what he called the liquidity issues facing owners of Amazon gift cards.\n\n""Long-term vision, we have a unique value proposition enabled by bitcoin,"" Lee continued. ""If you think of those people who hunt for promo codes, you can skip all that now by just having bitcoin.""\n\nThe move comes amid a recent flurry of experimentation from the Roger Ver and Bobby Lee-backed team, which launched a bid to take its model into the physical world with a bitcoin-only retail shop in February.\n\nRevisit CoinDesk\'s review of Purse\'s \'Name Your Discount\' marketplace here.\n\nImage credit: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, these debit cards are restricted to small networks, and are not as widely accepted as Visa or MasterCard. The merchants need to be in their network for such solutions to be used. This restriction makes bitcoin debit cards fall short of being the ideal solution for integrating bitcoin with all credit card accepting merchants.\n\nBy partnering with MasterCard, OneBit is the first company to enable bitcoin to be used on a large scale by tapping into the MasterCard network.\n\n-Toby Hoenisch, OneBit Founder\n\nUsing OneBit is simple. You neither need an account nor a physical card. Anyone with an Android smartphone can use this free Bitcoin wallet application to pay at one of MasterCard's NFC (Near-Field Communication) terminals.\n\nThe phone app utilizes your smartphone's NFC chip to emulate the chip inside a MasterCard PayPass contactless card, in combination with your bitcoin wallet. The PayPass platform provides contactless mobile payment functionality, which allows MasterCard holders to pay without swiping their cards. Merchants will not see any differences between a OneBit transaction and a regular PayPass transaction, since BitPay handles the currency conversion in real time.\n\n- Hoenisch\n\nThrough an affiliate partnership with MasterCard, OneBit will receive a tiny cut of the access fee from each PayPass payment it facilitates through MasterCard. This revenue stream allows OneBit to make their service completely free, “We don't charge fees to the end-user” Said Hoenish.\n\n- Hoenish\n\nWhile currently available in 30 countries, not all merchants have upgraded their payment terminals to accept PayPass. In Europe and Singapore the terminals are already very common, and they are rapidly gaining popularity in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. However, according to Hoenisch, “In the US, only 15% of the payment terminals have NFC.”\n\nNevertheless, MasterCard's PayPass locator map shows that a large number of merchants in the USA have PayPass integrated into their payment terminals. Any stores where speed of payment is key are likely have PayPass, including; most Gas stations, McDonalds, convenience stores, drug stores, and even grocery stores.\n\n- Hoenisch\n\nThere are other contactless competitors on the market today such as Visa's payWave and American Express' ExpressPay. These systems, if combined with OneBit, would raise bitcoin's usefulness significantly. For now Hoenisch has his eyes set firmly on integrating with Samsung's hardware platform LoopPay, and he has since the very beginning. Hoenisch explains, “I had the idea of OneBit when I saw the presentation of Samsung Pay and Loop Pay”\n\n- Hoenisch\n\nBefore launching, OneBit must undergo a rigorous set of security tests that MasterCard administers. The application must pass them all before it can be integrated into the PayPass platform. Once launched, bitcoin users will be able to use any PayPass enabled terminals to pay using bitcoin. Anyone without a bank account, but with a smartphone, will have access to modern banking services.\n\n- Hoenisch"", 'CoinMate.io has been in beta since December, but has finally gone public. The Britain-based Bitcoin to fiat exchange bills itself as offering numerous security features which it believes the whole industry should adopt. In particular, the exchange plans to use Trezor hardware wallets to secure coins stored with it.\n\nCCN spoke with Roman Valihrach, CEO of Confirmo, LTD, the parent company of both CoinMate.io and BitcoinPay.com, via Skype. The company also owns BitcoinPay.com, a service not unlike BitPay, BitNet, or BitKassa. On the issue of security, it was chief among his concerns:\n\nWe know [inventor of Trezor] Slush. He’s from Prague. He had the Slushpool, and now he introduced Bitcoin Trezor, which is a hardware wallet. So we’re in talks with him and we want to some kind of co-operations that will offer his solutions to our clients. We use it ourselves. […] We have experience for ten years working with payment systems.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Exchange Buttercoin Closing\n\nThe exchange takes sort of a “no cash on hand” approach to Bitcoin security, similar to the way cab drivers, restaurants, and bars will only hold a limited amount of cash at any given time. Very busy establishments and drivers will make regular deposits, and similar to this, the company, as a rule, does not keep more Bitcoin on the server than is necessary. In his words, he said:\n\nWe worked with just regular payment systems previously and we were regulated by the European law, so we know all the things that you have to do properly for the safety of money. Meaning, we know how much money is owned by the users, so that’s the money we have to hold separately at all times, and only work with our own capital. Speaking of Bitcoin, we hold all of the Bitcoins that are our clients’ separately in offline wallets, and we only had a limited amount on the server, so that if that gets stolen – because the server is online, that can always happen – it’s not going to do any damage to us.\n\nBitstamp, when they got hacked back in December, I think their online wallet, the hot wallet, was just the one for receiving bitcoins or for paying out bitcoins, meaning if the hacker knew how to get access to that wallet, he would wait for the highest amount of bitcoins to be on the server and then he would steal it.\n\nBritish Laws “Are Better” For Bitcoin Exchanges\n\nValihrach and his team are from the Czech Republic, but he says that the regulatory environment in England is friendlier to his cause.\n\nIt’s easier and the laws are better because there’s many uncertainties in Czech Republic about the taxes and about the [anti-money laundering] legal environment. Whereas in the UK, the laws are better. And I think they will be bringing something like a BitLicense anytime soon in the UK and they’ll be the first in Europe.\n\nSpeaking of the exchanges in Europe, yeah, Bitstamp is the biggest. They don’t offer instant bank transfer, so you have to wait a couple of days. That’s one of the advantages that we want to bring in. We want to make it simple for people that are newcomers because the majority of these exchanges focus on experienced traders, and there’s a lot of people that don’t know anything about Bitcoin, maybe they want to try it out, and want to have it very simple and easy to just buy a bitcoin very quickly and easy and have it somewhere safe.\n\nThe next version of CoinMate will go live in June and it will introduce a number of features not on the platform now. For instance, many customers will be able to take advantage of European instant bank transfers. Additionally, fees will switch to a “maker/taker” model, where the trendsetters of prices in the market will pay the lowest fees. Valihrach explained this fee model to CCN like this:\n\nOur [current] fee model is just a simple 0.2%, whether you are a market maker or a market taker. We were approached by some professional traders who were trading in some different markets, being some like liquidity makers, and they want to have a lower fee for when you actually – you’re the maker, so that means that you put in a better ask, that’s not going to pair with any other, so it’s going to fill into the order book and stay there for awhile, it could be a couple hours or it could be a couple of days. But if you’re the maker, you’re going to get a lower fee. […] If you’re the maker, you’re probably going to get a 0% fee because you’re filling up the order book.\n\nThey will also have a “quick buy” solution similar to Coinbase and Circle, but integrated into the exchange.\n\nThat’s going to make it simple for anyone who just wants to buy a Bitcoin, not speculate on the price going up or down. So it’s just going to show you the price, you say take it, and that’s it.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The blockchain concept that defines Bitcoin will present investment opportunities not only in the crypto-currency space, but in other industries looking for solutions that are secure and frictionless.\n\nThat’s one of the findings of a new report on Digital Money from Difference Capital Vice President Dushan Batrovic.\n\n“Overall, we are quite enthused about the prospects of the new technology in helping to reduce the roughly $50 billion in annual friction costs associated with just the eCommerce and global remittance markets,” says Batrovic. “In the longer term, we see lots of potential to repurpose the bitcoin distributed ledger (or blockchain) for a host of other applications outside of the currency markets.”\n\nBatrovic says a central authority or clearing house has the ability legitimize a currency, but it also adds friction. The promise of frictionless transactions has been a shiny lure to would-be pioneers of crypto-currencies.\n\nAny discussion of cryptographic currencies, says Batrovic, must begin with Bitcoin, which is now fourteen times as large as the next protocol. The volatile currency now has a market cap of about US$3.1 billion, and is accepted by more than 90,000 merchants, including Dell, DISH, Overstock and Zynga.\n\nBatrovic says he is enthused about the possibility of other companies building on Bitcoin’s platform. He thinks an emerging Bitcoin ecosystem will present investor opportunities in several sub-sectors of the space.\n\nBatrovic says Bitcoin has a number of things going for it, including low or no transaction fees, a controlled money supply, protection against identity theft, speed, and no fraud for merchants.\n\nBut the analyst warns there are drawbacks to Bitcoin, including the fact that transactions are irreversible, that there is no recourse if you lose your private key, there is volatility in value added services such as wallets, miners and exchanges, and, of course, there are the ever-present regulatory and tax issues.\n\nBatrovic says he is enthused about the possibility of other companies building on Bitcoin’s platform. He thinks an emerging Bitcoin ecosystem will present investor opportunities in several sub-sectors of the space.\n\nThe analyst says there are opportunities in Wallets, where Coinbase has raised $75 million in VC financing in order to develop a range of of services including an exchange, processing and other merchant services.\n\nHe also thinks there will be a new hierarchy of exchanges in the wake of the collapse of Mt. Gox, which was the largest Bitcoin exchange. New contenders include Slovenia’s Bitstamp and Bitfinex, which has seen its trading volume grow of late.\n\nBatrovic says there will be opportunities in Processing, where merchants will need to work with payment processors such as First Data, Global Payments and Moneris. Hopefuls in this space include bitpay, Coinkite, and GoCoin, he says.\n\nThe analyst sees the Mining aspect of Bitcoin, where players like Bitfury, CloudHashing, and CoinTerra compete to verify a block and earn 25 Bitcoins, as becoming commoditized and therefore presenting less opportunity than other parts of the ecosystem.\n\nFinally, Batrovic says there is opportunity in Financial Services, which he describes as a “catch-all” term that includes all the companies creating value-added services such as ATMs, where ExpressCoin and Lamassu are notable players, crowdfunded lending platforms like LendingClub, and secure “vaults” companies like Elliptic and Xapo.\n\nThe real gem in the bitcoin ecosystem is the blockchain or distributed ledger because it creates a method by which to transact or simply hold data on the public web without an intermediary. If we step back from the currency aspect, why not use the blockchain to hold and transfer medical records…\n\nBatrovic says some companies, like Coinbase, Circle, Coinplug, and 21 Inc. are expanding into multiple categories.\n\nBatrovic notes that there are several notable Canadian players in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including Coinkite, a wallets and merchant services provider from Toronto, the Vancouver-based io, a bitcoin exchange platform, Ottawa’s BitAccess, which makes Bitcoin ATMs, Vancouver-based payments processor CoinPayments, CoinTrader, which has built an online trading platform and is also based in Vancouver, and Montreal and San Francisco-based Blockstream, which has a $21 million seed round all star investors including Khosla Ventures, Real Ventures, and from Reid Hoffman and Eric Schmidt.\n\nBut Batrovic circles back to the theme that he is excited about the possibilities for the blockchain or distributed ledger beyond currency.\n\n“The real gem in the bitcoin ecosystem is the blockchain or distributed ledger because it creates a method by which to transact or simply hold data on the public web without an intermediary. If we step back from the currency aspect, why not use the blockchain to hold and transfer medical records? Or for land registration? Or for financial contracts? Or for real estate title transfers? We are quite intrigued by the opportunities to repurpose the blockchain. A few companies like Blockstream and Factom are promising to do just that.”', ""Executive Summary\n\nThis report targets potential investors in next-generation cryptographic application projects, often called 'cryptocurrency 2.0', or 'crypto 2.0'.

Clients can choose to increase the amount with a 1 percent flat fee. The security firm also provides transparency, improved management controls and internal checks for better monitoring of the exchange’s security.\n\n“We’re excited to have CoinHako’s Bitcoin exchange secured on our platform”, said BitGo CEO Mike Belshe. “The team at CoinHako has been a great development partner, and we fully support their focus on security as one of the core tenets of their business. I’m confident that they will be a great contributor to the Singaporean Bitcoin ecosystem.”\n\nCoinHako\n\nThe integration comes just after Pramodh Rai, a former graduate analyst at Barclays Bank joins the young startup as lead developer. In addition, the move is to better secure their platform and holdings as they hope to soon expand throughout Asia.\n\n“Security is of utmost importance, particularly in the wake of recent hacks at Mt. Gox and other exchanges,” said CoinHako CEO and co-founder, Yusho Liu. “We have instituted various measures of security within CoinHako to protect our funds and users. This latest integration with BitGo means our funds are insured against theft and hackers. Moreover, this integration has also enabled us to shift to multi-signature wallets, which is the best industry practice currently.”\n\nBitgo Entering Asia\n\nCoinHako is the most recent Asian partnership for the security firm.

Those funds, according to the company, will be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nThe news follows reports from earlier this week that Circle was looking to raise as much as $40m in new funding.\n\nNew feature outlined\n\nThe company’s new account features mean users can hold their funds in both bitcoin and USD.\n\nCustomers who choose to hold their funds in dollars rather than bitcoin can still make payments to people or merchants who accept bitcoin. At the time of payment, Circle will instantly convert funds from dollars into bitcoin.\n\nAlso, customers can accept bitcoin payments and Circle will convert the funds instantly into dollars in their Circle accounts, if they wish. Those who prefer to keep their funds in bitcoin can do so, CEO Jeremy Allaire explained in a new interview.\n\n“We’re putting forward this hybrid fiat-digital currency model, which gives users the benefits of digital currency – instant settlements, global interoperability, no fees and high levels of security – but without having to use a new currency,” Allaire said.\n\nHe reiterated:\n\n“This hybrid model allows customers to have all the benefits of digital currency, without the risks.”\n\nAllaire went on to explain that a user can add dollars to his or her Circle account for free by way of bank transfer, then when they want to pay another Circle user, they can do so in an instant, whether the payment is denominated in bitcoin or dollars.\n\nThe company is rolling out the USD features gradually, launching them on selected customer accounts and adding new ones each week.\n\nInternational outlook\n\nAllaire said Circle’s next step is to add more currencies to the platform. He explained:\n\n“We want to bring these benefits of bitcoin to all the major currencies in the world, including in the UK, Europe and in China.”\n\nWith these “global goals” in mind, Allaire said he believed Circle would benefit from significantly more capital and the addition of some new strategic investment partners, so he set out to raise some more funds.\n\n“Having [Goldman Sachs and IDG Capital Partners] as strategic equity investors in the company is a big vote of confidence in Circle and in the opportunity presented by digital money,” Allaire concluded.\n\nDollars image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Coinbase will also let financial traders speculate on the the price of bitcoin against pounds and euros on its exchange.\n\nThe move brings Coinbase into the competitive British market, which co-founder Fred Ehrsam argues is buoyed by the forward-looking attitude of UK regulators towards Bitcoin, as well as other financial technology innovations. “The payments regulators and the Treasury are taking a very balanced view of bitcoin. They’re really taking their time to understand the core technology prior to regulating.”\n\nCoinbase stands out in the loose, anarchic world of bitcoin. It is one of a small group of companies attempting to sanitise the currency, ridding it of many of the negative connotations that have sprung up since it first exploded into the public eye in early 2013.\n\nOver its short history, bitcoin has been heavily linked to the narcotics trade, first through the Silk Road black market, and later through spin-offs after the site’s operator, Russ Ulbricht, was arrested in October 2013; it has also become heavily associated with theft through hacks and scams.\n\nBut while the cryptocurrency, with its pseudonymous aspects and anti-state roots, is popular amongst the darker side of the finance world, there are many players who want to bring it into the light. Coinbase is the biggest.\n\nFounded in June 2012 (when the price of bitcoin was just $6, compared to $225 today), the company has won the support not just of the bitcoin establishment, but also of the wider tech industry. In January 2015, it successfully raised $75m in its third fundraising round, valuing it at $400m, the biggest of any bitcoin firm. But more than the money, it is the investors backing Coinbase that give it the credibility to try and take bitcoin mainstream.\n\nBacking Coinbase in the series C funding round were a number of large US banks, Japanese phone company DoCoMo and the New York Stock Exchange. Now, the company offers services throughout the bitcoin economy. It handles payment services for merchants who want to accept the currency, stores bitcoin for consumers who want to spend it easilyand, following NYSE’s investment, runs a foreign exchange for traders who want to buy and sell bitcoin in bulk.\n\nThe Coinbase exchange launched in January, and according to Ehrsam, “quickly rose to be the most liquid bitcoin exchange in the US … globally it’s neck and neck to be the most liquid bitcoin exchange in the world”, outside China, that trades in US dollars.\n\nWith the expansion of the exchange service to Britain, Ehrsam predicts the customer base will be “a healthy combination of regular everyday people, [high-net-worth individuals] and then a few hedge fund guys, a few institutional guys. Over time, that shifts more and more towards larger institutional players.”\n\nThe company’s merchant services were trialled in the UK by Dell, which became the biggest company to accept bitcoin for sales in Britain in February. British businesses can sign up for a merchant account, accept bitcoin in exchange for goods and services, and choose to immediately convert the currency into pounds, paid into their bank account.\n\nIn the US, Coinbase handled bitcoin payments for more than 10 companies with more than $1bn in revenue by the end of 2014; at the start of the year, it had none, co-founder Brian Armstrong told the Guardian in December.\n\n“I can throw out other numbers which are interesting too: our consumer wallet growth is 10x in the last year, and despite the price going up or down our core metrics around user sign-ups, deposits of bitcoin, and so on, continue to grow at a good rate. Maybe more interesting is merchant activity … that graph looks great.”\n\nIt is this ability to extend a previously niche product into the mainstream that has earned the company the tag of “AOL for Bitcoin”. Just as the proto-ISP brought millions online, Coinbase could bring millions outside the conventional financial ecosystem. But unlike many startup founders, Ehrsam downplays the dominance of the Coinbase in its sector.\n\n“It’s very analogous to email, where you might have a lot of people using Gmail: ultimately, the switching cost is next to zero, because we’re completely interoperable with the rest of the bitcoin network. At the end of the day, that means that people can walk,” he argues.\n\nBut underpinning the whole expansion is a more fundamental question: is Coinbase too late? 18 months ago, one bitcoin was worth $1200; now it’s less than a fifth of that, and the price has been essentially static since the beginning of 2015. Is bitcoin in its dying days?\n\n“It is a funny thing living in the bitcoin world every day,” Ehrsam says. “We’ve been through this cyclical process at least three times, where you see what appears to be a plateau. Then there’s a ramp up, and a ‘bust’, but it still ends up at a higher plateau.\n\n“And it brings new people in building new things.”', 'UPDATE 21st September 15:05 UTC: BTCS has indicated it has completed the merger with Spondoolies-Tech.\n\nBTCS shareholders now own approximately 55.4% of the merged company, while Spondoolies-Tech shareholders own 44.6% of the new entity.\n\nIn a statement, BTCS CEO called the move a ""major milestone"" that would help reinvent the former bitcoin-specific retail website as a leading transaction processing firm.\n\nBitcoin Shop (BTCS) and Spondoolies-Tech have signed an agreement that would find the publicly traded bitcoin services firm and the Israeli mining hardware manufacturer merging and continuing under a united brand.\n\nThe result, according to BTCS CEO Charles Allen, amounts to a ""merger of equals"", one that he believes positions BTCS to become a mining operation that could compete against established industrial outlets such as BitFury and KnCMiner.\n\nIn interview, Allen elaborated on the merger as well as the company\'s recent movements in the mining space, which have included securing an 83,000-foot facility and the prior purchase of 550 Th/s of mining hardware from Spondoolies-Tech.\n\nEvoking a classic Baron Rothschild quote, Allen said that in his estimation, the bitcoin mining sector offers the best profit-making opportunity, one compounded by the lack of interest among new investors in contributing to transaction processing on the bitcoin network.\n\nAllen told CoinDesk:\n\n""If you want to change the world and develop software for the next five years, have fun, but we\'re a public company and we\'re focused on driving revenue and building a solid business. As a combined entity, we\'ll be well positioned to have the cash cow in the industry.""\n\nAllen indicated his belief that Spondoolies was the best option among a limited number of mid-sized participants in the bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing space, noting the recent struggles experienced by US firms Butterfly Labs and Cointerra.\n\n""Spondoolies never had late issues with their customers,"" Allen said. ""In our minds, they have best product on the market. If you put it all together it really makes for a really solid offering.""\n\nThe news follows BTCS\' 27th April announcement that it had raised $2.3m in new capital through a private placement involving hedge funds and investors.\n\nThough both developments were potentially positive signs for the company, Bitcoin Shop shares declined on the news, tumbling to $0.20 per share from a high of $0.28 earlier in the week.\n\nPuzzle pieces image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Letter of Intent follows last week’s announcement that Bitcoin Shop raised $2.3 million in a venture capital funding round.\n\nBitcoin Shop, quoted on the OTC Market with the ticker BTCS, is based in Arlington, Virginia. Besides operating an e-commerce store which accepts a variety of digital currencies and offering a multi-signature wallet with bank-grade security, the company is the lead investor in Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Coin Outlet, and runs bitcoin mining operations in a new 83,000-square-foot facility.\n\nThe new mining facility is expected to handle more than 10 megawatts of power and up to 40,000 TH/s (terrahash per second) of mining hardware for “transaction verification” operations. (That means bitcoin mining, but with a crisp business-like aura.)\n\nBitcoin Shop wants to expand and consolidate its position as one of the leading players in the Bitcoin space. “We believe the sustained decline in the price of bitcoin has created tremendous opportunities for us to further expand our business and seize opportunities created from the market downturn,” said CEO Charles Allen, commenting on the latest funding round. “With the completion of this financing we believe we are well positioned to be a leading Bitcoin- and blockchain-focused company.”\n\nThe funding announcement noted that the company plans to leverage its transaction verification services business while it builds a universal digital currency platform with the goal of enabling users to engage in the digital currency ecosystem through one point of access.\n\nThe merger with Spondoolies-Tech is subject to a number of conditions, including satisfactory completion of diligence and execution of definitive agreements, and it will, therefore, probably take some time to work out the details. It’s expected that the merger will build a fully integrated transaction verification services business using Spondoolies-Tech mining technology.\n\nBoth companies believe the anticipated combination of Bitcoin Shop and Spondoolies-Tech will create the world’s first publicly traded company to produce Bitcoin transaction verification equipment.\n\n“Our key goal in 2014 was to create the partnerships needed to build an ecosystem and start laying the foundation to put our vision into place,” said Allen. “Once completed, our merger with Spondoolies would be a significant leap forward in making this ecosystem a reality. [O]ur next objective will be to complete the development and production of a next-generation chip to drive our transaction verification services business and to generate revenue from the combination.”\n\nSpondoolies-Tech is a digital currency hardware manufacturer. Founded in 2013 by a group of Israeli high-tech veterans, the company raised $10 million in capital from leading Israeli venture capital firms with the goal of building Bitcoin transaction-verifying servers from the bottom up, creating the infrastructure on which digital currencies will flourish.\n\nSpondoolies-Tech produces a line of bitcoin mining hardware rigs, considered among the best in the industry. Besides, it offers cloud mining services in cooperation with Genesis Mining.\n\n“Over the last several months, we’ve worked closely with Charles Allen and the BTCS team to establish the nature of our potential partnership,” said Spondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem. “The synergy between the teams is amazing. I have the utmost of confidence that together we will build a very successful and prosperous company by growing and expanding our business beyond bitcoin mining equipment.”', 'GBTC is the listed stock for the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) that many people in and outside the bitcoin sector have been eagerly waiting for.

Until then, buy orders might appear and disappear.\n\nThe bid has been removed as of today, but this does tell us that there are bids in the millions ready to be placed. And considering the relative size of the liquidity in various exchanges, an initial buy of millions in the first days of GBTC trading could be the proverbial snowball that starts the avalanche.\n\nHowever, this is assuming that GBTC trading does occur within the near future.

The BIT’s sponsor is Grayscale Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.\n\nEach BIT share represented ownership of 0.1 bitcoins initially. The trust will not generate any income and regularly sells/distributes bitcoins to pay for its ongoing expenses.

While some criticize Ripple for collaboration with a company many consider to be “anti” cryptocurrency by the nature of its business model, others, such as Grayscale Investments Director Michael Sonnenschein, have hailed the partnership as a capitulation by Western Union:\n\nIncredible!

Its popularity with the community however remains to be seen.', ""The buzz generated by the conference was not the only factor that pushed up the price of Bitcoin in March 2013. A financial crisis in Cyprus came to a head in the middle of the month; the closure of some bank accounts there led to conjecture that Russians were seeking refuge from the Cypriot banking system in Bitcoin. But Casares noticed that every time he helped another one of his wealthy friends start buying Bitcoins, prices rose, suggesting to him that they were responsible for much of the increase. Over the course of March, the price of a single Bitcoin nearly tripled, to around $100, and that surge generated the first widespread media coverage in the United States and Argentina (some of it, not coincidentally, from journalists cultivated by Casares). The crowd at the next Bitcoin Meetup in Argentina, hosted in April by one of Casares’s friends, was about five times larger than the first one organized by Casares just a few months earlier.\n\nDante Castiglione first heard about Bitcoin that same March. A Canadian who hired him to do some software consulting asked if he could pay him in Bitcoin. Castiglione, who grew up in a small apartment in downtown Buenos Aires, ran his own consulting firm, the latest in a long line of jobs after he dropped out of college. He is a successful version of what Argentines refer to as a buscavida, a person who gets by finding opportunities on the fringes of society, a more expansive career option in Argentina than in most countries.\n\nWhen it came to working for overseas clients, the biggest issue for Castiglione, like many Argentines, was the government-set exchange rate between dollars and pesos. In an attempt to tamp down inflation, the government has long forced banks to sell dollars at artificially low rates. In March 2013, the government said a dollar was worth around 5 pesos. But anyone could go to one of the money changers on Calle Florida and trade a dollar bill for about 8 pesos, the black-market rate, also known as the dólar blue. (Economists and people outside Argentina often regard the dólar blue as the real exchange rate, a closer reflection of the peso’s actual worth.) The official exchange rate was costly for businessmen like Castiglione. When dollars from foreign customers came in through traditional means, banks automatically converted them at the mandated rate, and Castiglione ended up with three fewer pesos for each dollar than he would have gotten by exchanging them on the street. Castiglione had to sacrifice nearly 40 percent of a foreign payment to turn it into pesos.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhen the Canadian customer paid Castiglione in Bitcoins, Castiglione found someone online willing to meet him in Buenos Aires and pay him in pesos at something close to the dólar blue rate. The demand for his Bitcoins was, in fact, so great that Castiglione, whose company was limping along, began to think there might be a business opportunity there. If he bought Bitcoins for slightly less than he sold them, he could make a profit on every trade, even if the price of Bitcoin didn’t go up. By September 2013, he had become a full-time Bitcoin broker.\n\nIn-person Bitcoin trading, as Castiglione does it, happens in many other cities around the world. But if this were the only way to procure Bitcoins, the interest in trading them would not have exploded as it has in the United States and China, where exchanging money directly with strangers — without a trusted middleman, in other words — is not a routine part of business. In most places where Bitcoin has become popular, there have been ways to buy the virtual currency online. This, of course, requires cooperation with banks or other payment networks, which happened in the United States and Europe. The American company Coinbase, for instance, allows customers to transfer money from their bank to a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoins online.\n\nIn Argentina, the banks refuse to work with Bitcoin companies like Coinbase, which isn’t surprising, given the government’s tight control over banks. This hasn’t deterred Argentines, long accustomed to changing money outside official channels. For Castiglione and his company, DigiCoins, this means operating at the edge of the law, but he takes comfort from the fact that, at least for now, the Argentine government has bigger problems to deal with.\n\nInstead of bank tellers and branches, Bitcoin users in Argentina have come to rely on Castiglione and his competitors, some of whom are even willing to make house calls. This financial system developed much more slowly than it has in the United States, where American companies could take deposits from banks anywhere in the country. But as a result, Argentina’s Bitcoin economy is much more resistant to bank policies, government regulations and full-service companies like Coinbase that undermine Bitcoin’s decentralizing spirit.\n\nI first met Castiglione when I visited Buenos Aires in June 2014. At the time, he was working downtown, out of a stuffy single room in the same building as a Berlitz language-school office. A joker playing card was lodged in the corner of the whiteboard on the wall. A friend of Castiglione’s son was at a desk, working on the DigiCoins website. His daughter, Fiona, was in touch with customers by phone and online. His son, Marco, was in and out, taking cash to clients, which he carried in his backpack. Sitting behind his own desk next to the door, Castiglione was describing the life of a money-changer, especially when it comes to matters of security. He spoke with tough confidence: “Not many people will like to mess with us.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he acknowledged that he and his children remained safe largely because they successfully kept their clients ignorant of their location by switching offices frequently: “Right now, maybe God is on our side.”\n\nOne of Castiglione’s main competitors was another Bitcoin broker named Brenda Fernández. Originally from the Buenos Aires suburbs and a college dropout, she previously smuggled electronics into the country and sold them on the local equivalent of eBay. She talked in loud bursts, punctuated with high-pitched laughs, and proudly made provocative statements about breaking the law and ignoring standard business practices when I met her at an event at the Bitcoin Embassy. “I find a way to market myself as the crazy Bitcoin girl,” she told me.\n\nIn a more serious moment, Fernández, who is 24, attributed both her attitude and her embrace of Bitcoin in part to the gender transition she made in her early 20s, after years of struggling with traditional gender categories. “It feels good, doing things that you are not supposed to, saying to the structures of power that they don’t have power over you,” she said.\n\nAfter the event at the embassy, Fernández took a small black-and-yellow taxi to a hostel near the National Congress that wanted to exchange about $1,000 worth of Bitcoins. The Rock Hostel, with band-themed rooms, caters to a young clientele. A number of people were drinking beer in the common area when Fernández showed up. The owner, a tattooed 29-year-old named Soledad Rodriguez Pons, had already transferred the Bitcoins to Fernández online, so after a bit of flirting, Fernández quickly handed over the cash; the transaction took place at the reception desk, where a sign offered customers a 10 percent discount if they paid by credit card. On top of the desk, under glass, were paper currencies from around the world.\n\nThe Rock Hostel is one of hundreds of hotels in the country using the Argentine start-up BitPagos to collect credit-card payments from foreign customers. If Rodriguez Pons accepted credit-card payments from American customers through the usual financial channels, customers would be billed in dollars, and when those dollars came to Rodriguez Pons’s Argentine bank account, they would be converted at the official rate, about 30 percent lower than the black-market rate. It would also take 20 days for Rodriguez Pons to get her pesos. BitPagos helped counter these drawbacks by taking the credit-card payment in the United States and then using the dollars to buy Bitcoins, generally from Coinbase, before sending them to Rodriguez Pons immediately. When Rodriguez Pons needed to pay the rent or laundry bills, she called Fernández or Castiglione — her two standbys — to sell the Bitcoins for pesos at a rate close to the dólar blue. Rodriguez Pons saved so much money this way that she could offer the 10 percent discount for credit cards and still easily come out ahead. In June 2014, BitPagos moved about $150,000 for the Rock Hostel and other tourist establishments, nearly twice what it handled three months earlier.\n\nRodriguez Pons, like many BitPagos clients, knew little about how Bitcoin worked and hadn’t tried hard to figure it out. She once, somewhat accidentally, held onto her Bitcoins at a time when the price was rising, and ended up with a small windfall when she sold. She used the proceeds to build a rooftop bar and a music-rehearsal space. Beyond those extras, Rodriguez Pons credited the savings from using BitPagos with keeping her business alive in Argentina’s very difficult business environment. The hardest part was often reaching Fernández and Castiglione.\n\n“I had to call Brenda four times today,” she said with a smile.\n\nAs anyone who has dealt with Western Union or wired money abroad already knows, Argentina is not the only place that could benefit from Bitcoin’s easier and cheaper way of moving money across international borders. A Hong Kong firm called Bitspark recently opened a shop in a mall popular with Filipino domestic workers, through which they can send money back home using Bitcoin. Another firm, BitPesa, allows customers to convert Bitcoins into Kenyan shillings and deliver them into mobile wallets within Kenya.\n\nTransactions of this sort inevitably stir up fears of money laundering and terrorist financing. Banks currently serve as the front line in stopping illicit money transfers. If these regulated institutions are cut out of the business of moving money, the banks and government officials say, who will ensure that terrorists and organized crime are not using the network to move millions across borders? The fact that there is no single authority responsible for supervising the Bitcoin system has also made it easier for con men and thieves to defraud companies holding Bitcoins for customers — something that became clear last year when Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, declared bankruptcy after nearly half a billion dollars of clients’ Bitcoins were fraudulently transferred out of their accounts. (A hacker generally needs only an owner’s password to steal his or her Bitcoins.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOddly enough, American regulators have actually been friendlier than banks toward the new technology. Even before the advent of Bitcoin, the Federal Reserve was looking into ways to update the relatively antiquated American payment networks, which often take two or three days to complete a simple money transfer. Several different branches of the Federal Reserve have released research papers over the last few years praising the improvements that Bitcoin might spur, even if Bitcoin itself isn’t adopted by the mainstream as a virtual currency. In 2013, when he was chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke wrote a letter to a Senate committee studying Bitcoin in which he praised its “long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.”\n\nBanks are aware that this is an area in which they will likely have to adapt or lose business, perhaps even be made irrelevant. While most of the major banks have criticized Bitcoin and refused to work with virtual-currency companies, many of them are nonetheless spending a lot of time and energy behind the scenes studying the technology. JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank, decided in early 2014 not to conduct business with Bitcoin companies. But it did form its own Bitcoin Working Group, which consists of about two dozen executives throughout the bank who have been meeting fortnightly or monthly to discuss how the technology could change their business.\n\nBanks are captivated, in particular, by the ledger on which all Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are recorded: what is known as the blockchain. Unlike traditional financial ledgers, kept by a central institution, the Bitcoin ledger is updated and maintained by everyone on the network, not unlike how Wikipedia is written and monitored by its users. One virtue of this approach is that the network has no central point subject to failure, like Visa and the New York Stock Exchange in their financial realms. It also means there is no middleman collecting fees with each transaction. And because the bookkeeping is publicly accessible, records can’t be manipulated in secret or after the fact.\n\nJPMorgan belongs to an association of big banks, the Clearing House, that has been confidentially putting together a “proof of concept” for a decentralized ledger, or blockchain, that would run on the computers of all the participating banks. According to people involved, this network, which is still in the conceptual phase, could allow instant transfers between accounts at all the member banks and eliminate the current risks involved in having billions of dollars in limbo for days at a time. For many bankers, the most valuable potential use of the blockchain is not small payments but very large ones, which account for the vast majority of the money moving around the world each day. The banks, though, are moving slowly, even as several start-ups are trying to use the Bitcoin blockchain to do the same thing on a global basis, cutting out the banks altogether.""]"

Crypto Facilities buys bitcoins mined by MBP, which are then sold by way of two-of-three multisig contracts.\n\nIn interview, Hedgy CEO Matt Slater said that product helps miners address the issue of price volatility as they look to sell coins on the market.\n\nHe said his startup has been working with MBP founder Dave Carlson for months on the derivative – Carlson also serves as an advisor to Hedgy – and explained that the solution can help other industrial mining companies better manage their financial risks.\n\nSlater told CoinDesk:\n\n“Our core focus right now is solving this problem for miners. And Dave, being one of those most well respected and biggest miners in the space, you know, if we can solve it for Dave we can solve it for other miners as well.”\n\nSlater added that Hedgy has fielded interest from other bitcoin miners, as well as companies in the broader digital currency space, about the use of smart contracts to alleviate concerns about price fluctuations.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Tim Draper praised the Hedgy the team and predicted a significant role for blockchain-powered smart contracts to come.\n\n""Hedgy is awesome.

According to Mercator, the benefits of operating bitcoin wallets for customers may not outweigh the costs of securing those holdings sufficiently.\n\nMainstream traction\n\nThe report asserts that bitcoin\'s primary use case is to buy and sell speculatively and, as a result, ""is unlikely to find much traction among the broader mainstream of CU account holders"".\n\nMercator also questions whether or not bitcoin can vehicle for consumers payments, and as a replacement for credit and debit cards in particular.\n\n""[Transaction irreversibility] is undeniably beneficial to merchants (assuming they have a way to hedge away all the foreign exchange risk), but, for the most important stakeholders in the ecosystem – consumers – the benefit is unclear.""\n\nMercator closes the report by acknowledging the impact cryptocurrency will likely have on mainstream financial services, adding that the exact impact is difficult to foresee at this time.\n\n""Predicting what exactly these implications will be, however, is a bit like\n\ntrying to grasp the significance of the Internet would have been in 1995 – these are early days still,"" the report concludes.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin Tracker One is authorized by Sweden’s financial supervisory authority, and will be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Stockholm. The average dollar exchange rate of bitcoin from the most liquid exchanges provides the underlying reference price. The first day of trading is expected to be May 18th, 2015.\n\n“We are proud to offer the world’s first “Bitcoin tracker” to be traded on a regulated exchange,” said Alexander Marsh, Chief Executive Officer of XBT Provider. “By enabling this easy and secure way to invest in Bitcoin we hope to have eliminated the boundaries that earlier prevented individuals and companies from being able to actively invest in what we believe to be the future of money.”\n\n“These are exciting times for the Bitcoin ecosystem,” said Board member Staffan Helgesson. “Bitcoin Tracker One will be the world’s first financial instrument that provides consumers and institutions the possibility to invest in bitcoins without holding coins themselves.”\n\nThe Bitcoin Tracker One Prospectus, which has been approved by the Swedish FSA, currently is available only in Swedish. XTB Provider AB will hedge all sales of the bitcoin-traded note by buying an equal value in the bitcoin market. A spokesperson for Nasdaq confirmed to CoinDesk that XBT Provider had been approved as a certificate issuer and that its product was the first bitcoin-based item to be listed on the Swedish exchange.\n\nMarket maker Mangold Fondkommission, a Stockholm-based brokerage and investment bank, will assist XBT Provider with clearing services and acts as a liquidity provider for Bitcoin Tracker One.\n\nThe XBT Provider website states that the company is aiming to attract additional liquidity providers to the order book going forward to complement the natural flow of orders. The goal is offering a liquid market with a small spread, making the instrument attractive for all type of investors.\n\nBitcoin Tracker One is the latest addition to the growing number of bitcoin investment vehicles that aim to expand bitcoin investments beyond the volatile spot exchanges and attract traditional investors who prefer not to trade bitcoin as currency because they are scared by bitcoin’s wild price swings. Bitcoin Tracker One could become an interesting option for those traditional investors who are persuaded that the dollar exchange rate of bitcoin will rise in the mid- and long term, but prefer not to hold bitcoin directly.\n\nOther similar bitcoin investment vehicles are Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), which received formal approval for listing on the OTC Markets Group’s OTCQX exchange with the symbol GBTC, and the upcoming Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), which will be available to investors on NASDAQ with the ticker COIN.\n\nXBT Provider AB (publ) is a public limited liability company formed in Sweden and incorporated under Swedish law, with statutory seat in Stockholm.

Hoping to be able to cover his legal expenses, Micon has since launched a defense fund.\n\nIt first became evident that something was amiss at Seals With Clubs in February of this year, as the site indicated it would be shutting down, which was at the time attributed to unspecified operational security concerns. Several days later, Micon uploaded a YouTube video explaining that his house in Las Vegas was raided by police, and that he and his family had fled the U.S. to the Caribbean country of Antigua. From there, he planned to launch a new poker site: SwC Poker.\n\nIt wasn't until this week that Micon was officially charged by Nevada General Attorney Adam Paul Laxalt, even though Micon's exact role at Seals With Clubs was never completely clear.\n\nThe criminal complaint reads:\n\n“[Micon] did willfully and unlawfully, as owner, lessee, and/or employee, whether for hire or not, either solely or in conjunction with others, operate, carry on, conduct, maintain or expose for play […] an interactive gaming system without having first procured, and thereafter maintaining in effect, all federal, state, county and municipal gaming licenses required.”\n\nIn response, Micon hired the Nevada law firm Chesnoff & Schonfeld to provide him with legal defense. To help pay for this, Micon has now opened a legal defense fund on Go Fund Me.\n\n“I maintain that I have committed no wrongdoing and have retained the legal services of Chesnoff & Schonfeld, whom I believe are the best lawyers for my case,” writes Micon on the web page of the crowdfunding campaign. “As a husband, father of a 2 year old girl, and outspoken Bitcoin advocate, I desire nothing more than to continue to be with my wife, raise my daughter, and continue to build layers on top of the Bitcoin protocol.”\n\nInterestingly, according to Part Time Poker, Micon will probably argue that bitcoin is not the same as currency in the context of gambling law, a theory that is as of yet untested in US court. Considering his passion for the cryptographic currency, this doesn't seem unlikely.\n\nEmphasizing his devotion towards Bitcoin while speaking to Poker News, Micon said:"", 'British shoppers are now able to exchange bitcoin for the British pound in a move that could help kick-start the use of the cryptocurrency.\n\nCoinbase has launched its bitcoin wallet and exchange to allow UK consumers to buy bitcoin directly in pound sterling for the first time.\n\nBritish consumers who previously wished to pay in bitcoin were forced to exchange pounds for euros or US dollars before buying the digital currency.\n\nCoinbase believes the launch will make its bitcoin wallet “a viable way for [British] consumers to pay for goods and services”.\n\nShoppers can sign up for the wallet either on the Coinbase site or via the Android or iOS app.\n\nIn January, bitcoin received a vote of confidence when Coinbase raised $75m (£50m) in a funding round.\n\nThe Series C financing represented the largest funding round to date for a bitcoin business and was also the first time a financial institution had made an investment in a bitcoin firm.\n\nThree financial institutions including the New York Stock Exchange, financial services group USAA and bank BBVA were all part of the financing round.\n\nIn a blog post, Coinbase said: “The mission of Coinbase is to make payments more open and efficient around the world.\n\n“This announcement is an important step furthering that mission which will bring easy bitcoin access to one of the financial capitals of the world.”', 'Named after an ancient Roman Goddess, MonetaGo is looking to provide liquidity to Bitcoin exchanges in 35 countries around the world, with the goal to expand to 50 by the end of the year.\n\n“We want to be the umbrella to the other exchanges,” Margaux Avedisian, co-founder and business development officer, told Bitcoin Magazineat Inside Bitcoins New York.\n\nWhereas other exchanges launch in one country and look to sign up consumer traders, MonetaGo aims to connect all of these exchanges together to increase liquidity for them all. Further, MonetaGo allows trades to be settled in multiple currencies. This is possible because the company is built using the AlphaPoint trading platform, a company that Avedisian launched in 2013.\n\nJesse Chenard, CEO and co-founder, offered the following example: “If someone wanted to buy $100 worth of bitcoin on a U.S. exchange, but there was only $50 in available bitcoin, the trade couldn’t occur. MonetaGo would connect that trade to another exchange that also had $50 in available bitcoin, allowing the trade to go through.”\n\nChenard has experience taking small ideas and making them large. He is the founder of Tremor Video, which had its initial public offering in 2013. The rest of the founding team is composed of the former Creative Director at NASDAQ, one of the co-founders of igot, the president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, and Avedisian.\n\nThe company is in beta and is privately funded. While based in New York City, the company isn’t expanding into the United States yet.\n\n“The regulation is still too uncertain in the United States,” Chenard explained.\n\nThe Coming Consolidation of Exchanges\n\nThe launch of another exchange begs the question: Does the ecosystem actually need another one?\n\nChenard doesn’t see it being a problem for MonetaGo because they view their company as more business-to-business, targeting the other exchanges. But he does agree that there will be consolidation in the industry over the next year and a half.\n\n“If you look at some of these countries, they might have four or five different exchanges that are operational. You have one that is by and far the leader, you might have another that has some volume, but the remaining two or three really have no volume,” Chenard explained. “While they might have really great products, they just can’t get the volume to compete. These will either be acquired because of their products or they will be able to work through our exchange to gain that volume.”\n\nWhere’s Wall Street?\n\nLiquidity is one of the reasons Wall Street has had to stay out of the sector. The amount of money Wall Street is looking to move is significantly greater than what is available on the exchanges.\n\nAccording to Chenard, though, it’s a lack of understanding that has kept Wall Street from getting into bitcoin. “They’ve likely heard of bitcoin, but you ask them too much about it and they just don’t really understand,” he said.\n\nOn top of that, there is fear of bitcoin going away. “So many businesses have shut down over the years, taking their consumers’ bitcoin with them, that there is fear for a lot of Wall Street,” he said.\n\nFundamentally, until Wall Street understands the state of the asset and are certain their money won’t disappear, the large money firms are going to hang out on the side. Bitcoin just isn’t worth it for traders looking to move $50 million a day, Chenard said.', 'Most people have no idea what their average cost per coin is and without knowing your cost, how can you make educated financial decisions?\n\nThat\'s like running a business without knowing how much you paid for the products that you sell.\n\nNormal everyday people around the world will not realize Bitcoin’s potential until this function becomes a seamless wallet feature and as common as deterministic wallets are now.\n\n""Buy when there is blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own."" – Baron Rothschild\n\nThis is an old saying that relates to trading stocks but it also holds true for a number of commodities that endure drastic price swings such as gold, oil and even food. This is also true of Bitcoin. Whenever you read blog posts like ""Bitcoin price crashes"" or ""Bitcoin is doomed"" that means that there is ""Bitcoin blood on the streets"" and it\'s time to BUY.\n\nBut how do you know when to buy and how much? What if the price continues to drop after you buy? Who wants to be buying when the price of something is falling? That sounds like financial suicide, doesn\'t it? But quite the opposite is true. History has shown us that those who have bought during a downtrend have set themselves up for success down the road.\n\nAdding up the numbers\n\nWhat Peter is talking about is managing a business but the same is true for managing your bitcoins. Allow me to explain something called dollar cost averaging or DCA for short.\n\nHere\'s how it works. Let\'s say that you bought 1 bitcoin when the price was at US$500. This means that your average cost per bitcoin is US$500. As we all know the price of Bitcoin is below US$500 today so that puts you at a loss. As I am writing this article the price of BTC is around US$220, so if you bought 1 more bitcoin today you now have 2 bitcoins and you have spent a total of US$720 on those two coins, which means that your average cost per bitcoin is now only US$360 (US$720 divided by 2.)\n\nThis is where the saying ""buy when there is blood in the streets"" came from. It means that as the price falls, it is ""on sale"" so to speak and you should be buying as you are greatly reducing your cost per unit and setting yourself up for increased profitability later. Now let\'s say that you buy another 4 bitcoins at US$220 each for a total of US$880. Now you have a total of 6 bitcoins for a total cost of US$1600. US$1600 divded by 6 is just US$266.66 per coin so your average cost per coin is much, much less than your initial US$500 coin.\n\nMost of us however probably aren\'t buying in single-coin increments so the math gets much more tricky when you receive weird numbers like 0.29641701 coins.\n\nThis method is how a number of gas stations purchase their gasoline and how some restaurants purchase fish because market prices for certain fish fluctuate with supply and demand. (Look for the words ""Market Price"" next time you\'re at a seafood restaurant.) I also wouldn\'t be surprised if there are some massive corporations that use DCA to hedge against volatility.\n\nPhases of attack\n\nI don\'t like the idea of Bitcoin just being some speculative tool for you to buy and sell and buy and sell in some zero-sum gain routine. I don\'t really like the idea of selling Bitcoin to exchanges at all. Bitcoin is money; money is for buying goods and services in the real world that enrich the lives of human beings. So once you know your average cost per coin, you know what the price of Bitcoin needs to be before you spend them.\n\nAs long as the price of Bitcoin is below your average cost, you are in the ""acquisition phase"" where you buy and/or keep larger percentages of the coins that you receive for goods and services (some merchants might hold 100% when the cost is below their DCA). Accepting coins for goods and services is what builds an actual Bitcoin economy instead of some dumb investment scheme.\n\nWhen the price is above your average cost, you enter ""the utilization phase"" where you use your additional purchasing power to spend and get more goods and services for your money. When enough people are doing this, we will begin to see an upward trend in Bitcoin’s value because fewer people are selling off their coins in some sort of panic and more people will establish Bitcoin savings. Widespread use is what really scares banks and if enough people utilize Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), more people will hold onto their coins, Bitcoin’s price will likely stabilize and large numbers of people will realize that they don\'t need a bank at all. This is bad news for banks and their accompanying fees.\n\nNote: If you are a merchant or get paid in Bitcoin, you have no control over when you acquire coins, so you might want to hold less when the price is above your DCA and more when the price is below your DCA. That\'s why I propose DCA as a built-in feature with all wallets and exchanges like BitPay.\n\nDon’t just stand there…\n\nHere comes the 1-2 punch that sound money delivers to the despotic inroads of governments and central banks. When you acquire below your average cost per coin (receive or buy), your average cost per coin falls. When you utilize above your average cost per coin (spend or sell), your average cost per coin also falls. You win with both!\n\nThis is probably the single most important function that is missing from services like BitPay and every Bitcoin wallet available today.\n\nThis needs to be a standard feature for every wallet for both merchants and consumers. Without this feature, Bitcoin is much more of a gamble for the common man and if you don\'t know how to manage a dollar cost average calculator, you will almost certainly lose money with Bitcoin.\n\nIn conclusion, more people regularly using, saving or speculating in the Bitcoin space need to better measure and manage their bitcoins. Buying when there is ""blood in the streets"" is one way to lower your average cost and hopefully set you and the entire Bitcoin economy up for a future with much more purchasing power.\n\nIf BitPay is reading this, please implement a dollar cost averaging tool into your service so more of your merchants will hold larger percentages of their coins while also reducing risk for those merchants.\n\nThanks for reading, and if you see this hidden potential, please share this post... especially if you know any wallet developers or anyone at BitPay. Viva Bitcoin!\n\n\n\n']"
