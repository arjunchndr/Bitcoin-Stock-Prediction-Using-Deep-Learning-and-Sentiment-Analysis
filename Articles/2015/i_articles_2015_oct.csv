It’s necessary for me to do business with Bitcoin because just one day without it and I lose money on the investment platforms I work with.\n\nJose Luis Escalona, a Bitcoin user from Valencia, Venezuela’s third-largest city, uses Bitcoin to save and thinks the government’s move will only cause the price of Bitcoin to rise.\n\nTo be honest, this kind of move from this authoritarian regime does not surprise me. But I’ll tell you something, neither in China nor in Russia have they been able to block the use of Bitcoin. Venezuela will not be the first to try nor the last to fail in the intent, Jose Luis Escalona told CCN.\n\nJesús Durán Franco, a Caracas resident, says a Bitcoin blockade was only a question of time and doesn’t think the government will reverse it anytime soon:\n\nThey aim to impoverish the people so that there are more and more all the time who depend on the government\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Coinbase has announced customers across 26 countries can buy bitcoin ""instantly"" from today.\n\nPreviously, users could top up their accounts via bank transfer, however the exchange now supports 3D Secure credit and debit cards – having trialled the technology in the UK and Spain.\n\nIn a blog post, the company stated:\n\n""Since credit and debit cards will not require a customer to pre-fund their Coinbase account with a bank transfer, customers can now receive bitcoin much faster.""\n\nVisa\'s 3D Secure protocol, which requires users to verify their identity via password, is supported by most banks in Europe.

Smith says nothing could be further from the truth and is going on the record to talk about the future of bitcoin as a medium for professional and private investment during a talk he will give on The Bitcoin Capital Market during the Bitcoin Trading Conference Day at Blockchain Week in Barcelona.\n\nBlockchain Week will take place from the 5th to the 8th of October. At the conference, experts from all over the world will explore the potential of the blockchain to aid in the development of smart cities, eCommerce, Retail, Trading, Security, Compliance, Mobile Applications and more. The panel discussions and talks on Wednesday, October 8th will be given over to discussions of digital currency as a medium of trading and investment.\n\nBlockchain Week is designed to appeal to bankers, politicians, lawyers, investors and leaders in the bitcoin industry. During his talk, Mr. Smith will be exploring the existing and new types of bitcoin investments that are just now coming into the market and the innovators that are offering them. Also why they are necessary to forge mainstream acceptance of the currency.\n\n“Traditional financial products and instruments need to be offered through the medium of bitcoin to advance the transition of bitcoin from early adopter novelty to a fully integrated part of the world financial ecosystem.” Says Smith, a fintech specialist with a 20 year history designing and managing global risk strategies for some of the world’s most prominent commodity trading companies. “First Global Credit is one of the earliest, though certainly not the only company that has entered the digital currency market to develop services needed to fill these gaps in the bitcoin ecosystem.”\n\nInstead of having interest wane following a year of bitcoin trading within a range, professional interest in the digital currency still continues to be strong with the likes of Citigroup, Santander and Barclays looking seriously at the opportunities presented by bitcoin and the blockchain. In addition to his talk on The Bitcoin Capital Market, Mr. Smith will also take part in a panel discussion later that day on Investment Opportunities in Bitcoin alongside Eddy Travia of Coinsilium and Salvador Casquero Director of FX Trading of Banco Sabedell, the fifth largest banking group in Spain.\n\nThe Bitcoin Capital Market talk being given at 10:15AM on Wednesday the 7th of October followed by the Investment panel at 11:30.\n\nFor further information on Digital Currency Summit’s Blockchain Week visit the website Blockchainweek.io Tickets can be ordered at http://blockchainweek.co/buy.html.

Circle has raised $76 million (£50.17 million) since launch in 2013, most recently raising $50 million (£33.1 million) in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs back in April.\n\nThe company began by offering a digital bitcoin wallet that lets people hold, send, and receive bitcoin through online accounts. But Allaire says this was just a proof of concept.\n\nHis ambition for Circle is to use the technology that underpins bitcoin to make sending and receiving any form of money as easy as sending email.\n\nMoney is uploaded to your Circle account in whatever currency you wish, then when you want to pay someone it is converted into bitcoin and transferred via the blockchain to the receiver, who quickly converts the sum back to whatever currency they wish.\n\nThe blockchain software, which underpins bitcoin, acts as the trusted middleman in the transaction — basically a proxy for a bank. The software records who has paid who and once it\'s set down it can\'t be changed.\n\nBecause of the speed of the transaction, both parties are unlikely to feel much impact from the volatility of bitcoin. And because they\'re not going through a bank, they won\'t pay foreign exchange or other fees. Circle\'s money transfer service is free.\n\nAllaire hopes that Circle becomes the go-to app for payments, not just across borders, but small sums between friends — just as sending an email today is the same whether it\'s to Japan or Leeds.\n\nCircle last week became the first US company to receive a BitLicense from New York regulators, a new license required for digital currency companies that want to operate in the state.\n\nThe new license means for the first time that Circle can let people hold, send, and receive US dollars on the app. Allaire and Neville are hoping this will lead to much wider adoption. Allaire said currently ""hundreds of thousands"" of people use Circle.\n\nThe company also hopes to soon offer the service in sterling and euros, followed by many other currencies. Circle, which is incorporated in Ireland but based largely in Boston, will use the London office as its base for European expansion once these currencies are added to the service.\n\nNeville told Business Insider that Circle chose London for its European expansion base over Dublin largely because of the attitude of the government and regulators towards financial technology and digital currencies in the UK. Neville said Britain is amongst the most forward thinking in the world in this area.', 'Once More for Posterity: Dorian Nakamoto Explains Why He Is Not the Mastermind Behind the World\'s Most Popular Digital Currency\n\nApproaching the home that Dorian Nakamoto shares with his 93-year-old mother in the small Los Angeles County suburb of Temple City, one beholds a posted note under the doorbell declaring, “Private property: No solicitors or reporters.” Though I have come as an invited guest, the note stands as a stark reminder of the peculiar form of hell Nakamoto endured just a year and a half ago, when he was hounded to distraction by hordes of media and various curiosity-seekers after Newsweek magazine published a purported exposé that dubbed him the “Father of Bitcoin.”\n\nThe claim fell like a bomb on those who follow Bitcoin, and given Newsweek ’s longtime status as a paragon of mass magazine journalism, it engendered widespread discussion. The article, by Leah McGrath Goodman, served as the magazine’s cover story on March 6, 2014. It claimed to have uncovered the true identity of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, following a two-month investigation that included “interviews with those closest to (Dorian) Nakamoto and the developers who worked most frequently with him (“Satoshi”).\n\nCiting Dorian’s past contracting work on top-secret engineering projects, an ingrained disdain for government intrusion, and using quotes from various family members which paint him as a humble, privacy-obsessed engineering mastermind, Goodman made a compelling though surface-level argument for Dorian Nakamoto as the creator of Bitcoin.\n\nBut following the article’s publication, most involved with Bitcoin were quick to question the validity of Goodman’s claims, seeing the evidence presented as largely circumstantial. A commonly held belief among those who are skeptical of Newsweek ’s claims is that “Satoshi Nakamoto” is actually an alias for a group of cryptographers/software engineers, rather than an individual. Others who corresponded with “Satoshi,” including core developer Gavin Andresen, believe he is in fact an individual.\n\nFurthermore, a recent piece by Nathaniel Popper in The New York Times makes the case that if the creator was indeed an individual, he was probably BitGold inventor and noted cryptocurrency expert Nick Szabo, not Dorian Nakamoto (although Szabo, too, refutes these claims).\n\nStill others have asked the logical question of why a humble and essentially private person such as Dorian Nakamoto would create Bitcoin, seek anonymity for that feat, and then choose an alias that includes his given last name, in light of all of the other measures he took to remain anonymous.\n\nMike Hearn, a developer who communicated with Satoshi prior to his departure from Bitcoin, even posted a blog entry that charted logical inconsistencies within Goodman’s claim that Dorian Nakamoto and Satoshi Nakamoto are one and the same.\n\nTrial By Media Fire\n\nThe Newsweek story revealed sensitive details about Dorian Nakamoto in an effort to highlight personality traits and motivations that fall in line with what little there is to infer about Bitcoin’s creator. It ended up turning his world upside down.\n\nIn the midst of an unwanted media blitz that included what he describes as being unable to grab milk from the store without being barraged by reporters, Nakamoto gained support from lawyers and individuals in the Bitcoin community. One group even created the short-lived website “newsweeklied.com” that was intended to clear his name and raise funds for a lawsuit against the publication giant.\n\nIn a statement formally submitted to Newsweek by Nakamoto and his lawyer, he states that he “did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin,” and that, “Newsweek ’s false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year-old mother, my siblings, and their families.” He then ends the letter: “This will be our last public statement on this matter. I ask that you now respect our privacy.”\n\nGiven the definitive nature of that statement, I ask Dorian why he now desires to speak to the press. His simple answer: “Closure.”\n\nCookies and Courtliness\n\nAs we enter Nakamoto’s home, he leads me into the kitchen, where the table is neatly set with woven placemats, a Japanese style tea set and a box of chocolate chip cookies. It is immediately apparent that Nakamoto, 65, a bachelor with a past marriage and grown children on his family resume, may not regularly entertain new guests in such a quasi-formal setting, but he has his own sense of how to go about doing so. He exudes a kind of courtliness, reverence and respect for the occasion that young people today would likely describe as “old-fashioned.”\n\nAs I take my seat, he is quick to offer and pour me green tea, then proceeds to make sure that I am content and comfortable in a way that feels refreshingly sincere. Not drinking any tea himself, he settles into his seat and begins to form circles around the empty cup with his fingers. Far from the shrewd, eccentric man portrayed in the Newsweek piece, he appears much more as a kind and good-humored person, with an almost canonical approach to respect and hospitality. After an exchange of additional basic pleasantries, he chuckles to himself and says in his slow, deep voice, “OK. Ask me anything.”\n\nAt the crux of Newsweek ’s claim that Nakamoto is in fact the creator of Bitcoin is a brief exchange between Goodman and him, in which Goodman states that he “tacitly"" acknowledged his role in the Bitcoin project by declaring to her: “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.”\n\nThe words “no longer involved” and “turned over” would seem to lend credence to the belief that Nakamoto was in fact involved in some capacity with the “Bitcoin project.” I ask him about this exchange specifically, seeking to gain some clarity on his response. He replies: “I was thinking about work I had done at Citibank that was security things, security exchange. Even if I was involved I can’t tell you, because every engineering firm makes you sign a nondisclosure contract for during and post. I thought maybe that [her question] was something to do with Citibank work that I did.”\n\nThis response provides potential clarity surrounding this pivotal exchange between Goodman and Nakamoto. He insists he was not even familiar with the term “Bitcoin” at the time of the Newsweek interview, and thought Goodman was referring to a project that he had worked on at Citibank. Why, at the time, he drew this conclusion about the connection between “Bitcoin” and his previous, confidential work for Citi is still not entirely clear.\n\nThe Case for and Against\n\nThe Newsweek piece emphasizes: “Perhaps the most compelling parallel between the two Nakamotos are their professional skill sets and career timeframes.”\n\nWhile portrayals of work on classified military projects are commonly projected with an almost clichéd, sinister tone, Nakamoto’s’s reasons for the life of secrecy described by his family are far more practical than they are mysterious. In addition to the nondisclosure agreements he signs with each classified project, and his firm belief in abiding by what he describes as the “engineer’s code,” he also emphasizes that it is extremely advantageous for people in his line of work to be as private as possible in order to best preserve their job security.\n\nIn this and his other responses, it is clear that Nakamoto has the mind of an engineer, articulating each of his carefully constructed thoughts piece by piece, and attending to even the most seemingly minute details. Noting the measures that his employers take to ensure that contractors will not be motivated to exchange classified information for rewards, he explains how anything from debt to a troubled relative or an affair (remember David Petraeus’s exit from the CIA?) would be grounds for immediate removal, and likely result in permanent exclusion from classified projects.\n\nHe notes that since publication of the Newsweek article, which exposed many personal details including sensitive information about his health and finances, he has been effectively “blacklisted” from the types of engineering jobs that he has worked on throughout his professional career.\n\nRespect for the “Bitcoin Creator”\n\nWhile the unwanted association with Bitcoin has brought significant hardship and stress to Nakamoto’s life, he brightens and is eager to thank the Bitcoin community for their “support.” He then expresses appreciation toward the “creator” for bringing Bitcoin’s blockchain technology to the world.\n\n“The more I study about it, I think it’s a fantastic idea. I really appreciate what he [Satoshi Nakamoto] did, and all the people who contributed, including [Bitcoin core developer Gavin] Andresen and Andreas [M. Antonopoulos, Bitcoin entrepreneur and security expert].”\n\nWarming to his topic, he continues: “And then the free software, freeware--that is a brilliant idea on the part of this creator or group of creators. But you also need very talented people to implement and carry it out; also marketing, sales. I just feel when I looked at it, I said ‘Wow! This is a beautiful thing.’ Especially if you are anti-authority or anti-establishment, which would be banks and governments and things like that. And they [Bitcoin] have a hold of young people now, including Jeffrey right here!\n\n“I’d like to see how Bitcoin evolves into the next stage. How it encounters this problem, I won’t say problem, but government is always trying to encroach. Same thing with banks. And we will have to withstand the storm of what’s going to happen to our dollars as the international standard exchange currency….The biggest thing is we can’t possibly pay,” he says, in reference to the American debt. “My hope is that the top level designers, the creators, think about that.”\n\nI am astonished to hear that Nakamoto has such high praise for the technology, and moreover, that he has clearly thought about how it should evolve, drawing on the nuances of the economic implications surrounding a decentralized currency/monetary system, and in light of the current geopolitical environment.\n\nRiding Toward a Powerful Future\n\nNakamoto’s car, a faded beige Toyota Corolla, which “still runs great” after having logged almost 200,000 miles on the odometer, is not his preferred method of transportation. Driving to grab some Chinese food in Temple City, he points out the flawed street design and cracked sidewalks that obstruct his frequent bike rides around town.\n\nChuckling as he explains what he sees as simple solutions to basic infrastructure problems, he notes the pleasure and peace he finds in his regular bicycle rides, smiling as he recounts past excursions through the San Gabriel foothills and on the banks of the Los Angeles River. (Yes, there is such a thing, but it is mostly a wide concrete channel traversing the L.A. basin.)\n\nIn his New York Times piece, Popper states, “At this point, the creator’s identity is no longer important to Bitcoin’s future.” While most Bitcoin observers would likely believe this to be true, it is also clear that the unique mindset, convictions and motivations that governed “Satoshi’s” approach have had a meaningful, lasting effect on the enterprise, and they warrant examination. In this regard, Satoshi Nakamoto becomes more than the ""genius” (or geniuses) who created Bitcoin—he also created Bitcoin, took no credit, and left the fortune amassed by his own creation completely untouched, all in order to best preserve the purity of a powerful idea. And that is a world-changing thing, quite likely unique in human history.\n\nIt is almost impossible for most of us to imagine a person or group who would have both the technical skill set to create Bitcoin and the ability to faithfully execute on such selfless principles. This draws us to figures like Nick Szabo and Dorian Nakamoto. Both men’s personalities and beliefs align with the characteristics that make Satoshi Nakamoto such a uniquely compelling figure. While such investigations are, for these reasons, entertaining and thought-provoking, they do clearly affect—in Dorian’s case, severely affect—the individuals under examination.\n\nMoreover, such attempts to unveil the creator’s identity go against (what appears to be) Satoshi’s desire for Bitcoin to evolve as a truly inclusive open source project, in which the actual identity of its creator is ultimately unimportant.\n\nWith all that said, I am glad I was able to spend a day with Dorian Nakamoto in Temple City. I hope that this account will shed some light on Newsweek ’s so-called “Father of Bitcoin,” and perhaps help provide him with the closure that he seeks. If so, it couldn’t happen to a humbler guy.\n\n***\n\nPostscript: After learning of Dorian’s financial complications, his friend cryptograffiti created a piece of artwork that will be auctioned off with 100% of the proceeds going to Dorian.

These police raids are a result of an ongoing investigation regarding money laundering with Bitcoin, a service offered by several individual residing in the Rotterdam area. Bitcoin’s PR problem has gotten slightly worse yet again by the look of things.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Criminals Target Australian Financial Sector\n\nGuaranteeing Total Anonymity While Exchanging Bitcoin\n\nIt is not the first time Bitcoin is linked to money laundering activities. However, this police investigation focuses on several individuals offering a guaranteed anonymous exchange from fiat currency to Bitcoin. This type of business is deemed illegal under Dutch national law, and it was only a matter of time until the operation was shut down.\n\nThe individuals offering this service would accept large amounts of Bitcoins in exchange for fiat currency, all the while charging a higher commission rate. Doing so enables money laundering of stolen or illegal fiat currency into Bitcoin, which will affect the Dutch economy in the long run. Customers who received the fiat currency would own illegally obtained funds, causing all kinds of legal trouble.\n\nAccording to preliminary reports, these individuals have been able to launder a few million EUR through Bitcoin. All of the bank accounts and Bitcoin wallets used during the operation of this business have been frozen by the authorities. A total of three residents of The Netherlands have been arrested during the police raid, and they will be arraigned as early as tomorrow.\n\nPolice officials also confiscated various computers, drugs, weapons and any type of administrative files that could help build the case against these criminals. The three Dutch people arrested are 19, 20 and 23 years old respectively, all of whom live in the Rotterdam area. On an international level, one 24-year old man was arrested, whom will be extradited from Malta. The other arrest took place in Latvia, and police officials are questioning this person right now.\n\nIt will take some time to fully construct the flow of money going in and out of Bitcoin through the hands of these individuals. Not all of the money sources have been unraveled just yet, nor is it clear how this team of criminals managed to get their hands on such large amounts of Bitcoin. More details will be revealed as the investigation progresses.\n\nBitcoin Is Not Viable For Illegal Activities\n\nIf there is one thing the history of Bitcoin has shown us, it is that virtual currency is not a viable tool for illegal activities. Despite Bitcoin’s association with various illegal marketplaces and less-than-legal business deals, all of these schemes have come to an abrupt halt sooner or later. The reason for this is simple: Bitcoin is not an anonymous form of money, as every transaction can be publicly tracked through the blockchain.\n\nThis story will have a slightly negative impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem, as mainstream media will continue to feast on anything that puts virtual currency in a negative spotlight. However, it is exactly these mainstream media outlets who are not telling the entire story, as the major culprit isn’t Bitcoin, but fiat currency.\n\nBitcoin is perfectly traceable and a far cry from anonymous. Fiat currency, on the other hand, is the most anonymous form of money that has ever existed. There is no way to trace paper money or coins at any given time, and fiat currency has been part of drugs, gambling, prostitution or any other illegal activity since the day it was created.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

Some see Bitcoin as the best kind of currency ever created; others warn that it's unsustainable and dangerously unregulated. Some of those arguments hold more water than others, but regardless of which side you take, it's hard to argue against the opinion that Bitcoin and the other 700+ cryptocurrencies out there have plenty of room to improve.\n\nWe're also seeing academic efforts made to improve security as a whole as everyone comes to terms with the fact that cryptocurrency isn't going to be a temporary fad.\n\nThat's where academia comes in.

Cornell University, for example, launched its Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3) in July.

We're also seeing academic efforts made to improve security as a whole as everyone comes to terms with the fact that cryptocurrency isn't going to be a temporary fad.\n\nIf anything, this shift just cements Bitcoin and similar currencies as a sure-thing for the foreseeable future.\n\n--\n\nRobert Montenegro is a writer, playwright, and dramaturg who lives in Washington DC.

This will be the second ETN issued by XBT Provider, who issued the first ever bitcoin ETN, called Bitcoin Tracker One, on the Nasdaq Nordic earlier this year, on May 18.\n\n- Alexander Marsh, XBT Provider CEO\n\nETNs are unsecured debt obligations from an issuer, listed and trade on exchanges. Bitcoin ETNs are an easy way for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to the digital currency, without buying the underlying asset. The first ETN was developed in 2006 by Barclays Bank, the leader in ETN issues, so that retail investors could invest in hard-to-access assets, particularly in the commodity and currency areas.\n\nWith the launch of Bitcoin Tracker EUR, Nasdaq Nordic has a second investment instrument whose underlying asset is bitcoin, and both are issued by the same issuer, XBT Provider. The first, Bitcoin Tracker One, was launched on Nasdaq Stockholm, but is now available for retail and institutional clients, in 179 countries, for anyone with an Interactive Brokers account.\n\nBitcoin Tracker One is listed in Swedish Krona (SEK) and has exposure to bitcoin and the US Dollar, which is the underlying currency of the instrument. The company chose the USD as the underlying currency because “the BTC/USD market is the most liquid bitcoin market widely available for trading.”\n\n- Alexander Marsh\n\nAs of the day of publication, Bitcoin Tracker One is among the most traded ETNs in the foreign exchange category on the Nasdaq Nordic, out of 51 available ETNs in total.\n\n“Bitcoin Tracker EUR will give the investors all the benefits of Bitcoin Tracker One, and also offer a currency they are used to invest in."" - Staffan Helgesson, General Partner at Creandum and Board Member of XBT Provider\n\nSince ETNs are debt securities, guaranteed by the issuer, investors need to asses more than just the risks surrounding the underlying asset. If the issuer goes bankrupt, the investors may not receive any capital. XBT Provider is a Stockholm-based company established in January 2015, with the sole purpose of issuing securities. The company is part of the KnC Group AB, which is particularly well known for its subsidiary, KNC Miner.\n\nFor investors who do not want to rely on the issuer\'s creditworthiness, and prefer investing in equity securities rather than debt securities, there are also bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF). A bitcoin ETF is an investment fund that holds bitcoin, and divides ownership into shares.\n\nWith the increased popularity of bitcoin, more investment vehicles are becoming available to investors. Earlier this month, ARK Investment Management announced the first ETF on a major US exchange, through investment in Grayscale\'s Bitcoin Investment Trust\'s shares.\n\nNo matter the types of bitcoin investments, the price of bitcoin is most important. For the two bitcoin ETNs, the higher the price of bitcoin, the higher the ETN payouts and the more investors.\n\nThe company cited that bitcoin holders do not trade bitcoin often, instead they hold onto them for “speculation, saving or for other long-term purposes.”\n\nAccording to the prospectus, only 4 percent of all bitcoins were traded within one week by their holders, compared to 24 percent over three months, more than half over six months and 38 percent in one year.\n\n- XBT Provider\n\nOther than miners and some major participants who regularly cash out bitcoin to cover overheads, only a small proportion of all Bitcoins seems to be used for transactions.\n\nSince bitcoin’s price reflects the expectation of bitcoin usage in transactions, this low usage could affect the price of bitcoin and therefore its ETN performance. The company hopes that the introduction of Bitcoin Tracker EUR will entice more investors to actively invest in bitcoin. Marsh adds that with Bitcoin Tracker EUR ""we hope to further eliminate the boundaries that earlier prevented individuals and companies from being able to actively invest in what we believe will be the future of money""', 'The head of one of Europe\'s biggest FinTech hubs is stepping down to lead the development of a blockchain lab.\n\nEric van der Kleij, who led London-based Level39 for three years, is returning to Entiq, an innovation consultancy he co-founded in 2013, to explore the real-world applications of blockchain technology.\n\nThe lab, van der Kleij said, will seek to help organisations gain a better understanding of distributed ledgers, smart contracts and related technologies.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The Entiq Lab has undertaken testing of fundamental financial services functions such as territoriality, finality, delivery versus payment and is developing proof of concepts.

10/02/2015,"['Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous developer. What makes bitcoin so unique is that it is completely decentralised. Users participating in the network create bitcoins by mining them via their specially designed computer systems. In return, the users who mine these coins also participate in the network ensuring it stays completely decentralised.\n\nSince bitcoin’s first appearance, there has been a dispute in which many argue that bitcoin is simply a new payment method rather than a currency.\n\nThere is a limited, but growing amount of online vendors who accept bitcoin as payment. And if you look at it that way, bitcoin can perfectly be considered as a payment method.\n\nIn fact, these claims are supported by the business model of companies such as Coinbase or BitPay, which are proof that bitcoin is only being used as a payment method.\n\nBitcoin, itself does not have any value: no one sells items in Bitcoin amounts, but rather in dollar amounts that are paid via Bitcoin. A single Bitcoin’s value is determined solely by supply and demand which is expressed in dollars. So in a sense, its value is pegged to the value of the dollar. Many argue that this is the key factor in which Bitcoin cannot count as a real currency.\n\nBut these arguments are simply the tip of the iceberg in a discussion that leads to nowhere. By using the same approach one might argue that even cash is only a payment method and that gold has no value as it is expressed in currency amounts, and that Bitcoin is equally a commodity like gold. Just a set of mixed up ideas which can’t bring a real contribute whatsoever, but that in a certain way, these could even make some sense.\n\nBitcoin is in fact, a payment method as it is a digital cash like currency and the US even recognize it as a commodity as well. Simple as that. Just like cash and gold, bitcoin is a mean of exchange as well. And I think this buries the discussion!', 'The police agency of the European Union, Europol, released their annual Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) report for 2015 yesterday. In the report the agency’s European Cybercrime Centre dissects the future risks and emerging threats of cybercrime, and provides recommendations to prevent and fight it. This 76-page annual report offers an eye-opening view from a law enforcement perspective, based on contributions by EU Member States and Europol staff experts, with further input from private industry, the financial sector and academia.\n\n- IOCTA, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre\n\nIn recognizing that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being accepted at the government level as well as at businesses, the agency also cited that its’ popularity has grown among cyber criminals. However, as the report points out, cyber criminals will use whatever is convenient and serves their purpose at the time, whether it is digital currency or not.\n\n- IOCTA\n\nAccording to the report, although bitcoin currently accounts for approximately 40% of all identified criminal-to-criminal payments of the EU law enforcement investigations, it is far from being the only currency used.\n\n- IOCTA\n\nFor comparison, when cybercriminals need to pay for legitimate services such as hosting or travel, the IOCTA observed that over 60% of transactions were done using traditional financial instruments such as credit cards or bank transfers. Of course, whether these cards or accounts were legitimate or fraudulently obtained is unknown.\n\nThe agency also mentioned that it has observed “a continuation of migration from traditional payment mechanisms to those offering a greater degree of anonymity, particularly pseudonymous payment systems.”\n\nThe IOCTA further revealed that even though there are currently over 650 cryptocurrencies recorded, with more being created almost daily, it named only bitcoin as being widely used: “Bitcoin is establishing itself as a single common currency for cybercriminals within the EU. Bitcoin is no longer used preferentially within Darknet marketplaces but is increasingly being adopted for other types of cybercrime as well.”\n\nIn the previous year’s IOCTA report, more niche, privately-controlled currencies had been anticipated, but this prediction has not materialized. Since bitcoin offers many benefits including privacy, it has been widely used by many people including cybercriminals.\n\n- IOCTA\n\nSince cryptocurrencies are inevitably going to be used, the agency strongly recommended that law enforcement focus on learning about the technology in order to fight cybercrime: “Investigators must familiarise themselves with the diverse range of account and payment references and file formats of digital wallets used by the different payment mechanisms in order to recognise these in both standard and forensic investigations.”\n\nThe agency also argues that it is not efficient to regulate cryptocurrencies, because those who are not breaking the law will comply and be at a disadvantage. Those breaking the law will continue to use it illegally: “Any regulation of cryptocurrencies would likely only be applicable and enforceable when applied to identifiable users such as those providing exchange services.”\n\n- IOCTA\n\nSince regulations would likely not be very useful at preventing and stopping cybercrime, the IOCTA advised that laws will not be conducive to maintaining a good relationship with the public: “While there may always be a need for laws which compel private industry to cooperate with law enforcement, there is greater benefit in establishing and building working relationships in order to stimulate the voluntary and proactive engagement of the private sector.”\n\nCybercrime remains a growth industry, as well as becoming more aggressive and confrontational. Cybercriminals will work harder to to come up with new technologies to get ahead of law enforcement to make catching them harder, no matter what kind of payment systems or technologies are present.\n\nIn a rare admission of responsibility by a police agency, the IOCTA surprisingly admitted, “a key driver of innovation within cybercrime may be law enforcement itself.”\n\n- IOCTA\n\nAfter recognizing that cyber criminals will always find a way to stay ahead of law enforcement technologically, the IOCTA pointed out that cybersecurity tactics need a lot of improvement: “Many of the so-called smart devices are actually quite dumb when it comes to their security posture, being unaware of the fact that they are part of a botnet or being used for criminal attacks.”\n\nAn example of devices that are prone to attack is the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), which is enabled by default on millions of Internet devices using the Universal Plug and Play (UpnP) protocol, including routers, webcams, smart TVs and printers. They became the leading DDoS amplification attack vector in the first quarter of 2015, according to the IOCTA.\n\nIn dealing with smart devices and the Cloud, law enforcement faces many challenges, including access to data, training, education, and digital forensics.\n\n- IOCTA\n\nThe need for people to be connected and use smart devices opens up many scenarios for attacks. The IOCTA gave a range of examples from hacked smart cars to hacked medical devices, to even hacked weaponized drones.\n\n- IOCTA\n\nRecent statistics show that the global number of cybersecurity incidents has been steadily rising. In 2014, companies detected and reported 42.8 million IT security breaches.\n\nWith better technology, the number of cybercrimes is rising but the report’s author feels that law enforcement has also been doing a good job in keeping up with the technology to prevent cybercrime.\n\n- Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol\n\nThroughout the report, there were mentions of other complementary technologies and programs commonly used with bitcoin as well, including BitTorrent, a few encryption suites, and up-and-coming programs like OpenBazaar. Overall, the report made for an interesting read, and it leaves its’ audience with a clear impression that Europol’s European Crime Center has been doing their homework and is keeping an eye on the greater bitcoin community, with an interest to learn as much as they can to combat crime within it.', 'Let’s set the record straight on one thing: EMV and bitcoin have nothing to do with each other.\n\nOutside of the fact that both have something to with payments — one being via traditional payments cards, and the other being a volatile digital commodity/currency — comparing the two is akin to comparing apples and asparagus because they both start with an “a.”\n\nBut, of course, with the EMV news abuzz because of the Oct. 1 liability shift yesterday, everyone, and we mean everyone, wanted to get the chip card conversation into the mix. Still, when a headline like “Banks Introduce EMV-chipped Credit Cards To Keep Bitcoin At Bay,” hits the wires, it stops you dead in your tracks.\n\nYes, that was an actual headline — and not from The Onion or the PYMNTS’ April Fools’ Edition.\n\nThe piece that was featured on Inside Bitcoins was a (questionable) attempt to inform the public about EMV and what that chip inside those payment cards is really about. Drawing from a CNN Money article about EMV seemed to give it some credibility to the piece (minus some technical details).\n\nBut then you get into the second part of the article, which had a subhead of “Grasping At Straws To Keep Bitcoin At Bay.”\n\nOh boy, this should be good.\n\nAnd that’s where this EMV-ish article went rouge.\n\n“While the efforts to make credit card payment should be applauded, these new chips are one of the top financial innovations the sector has seen in the past 50 years. Financial institutions are grasping at straws to keep consumers away from other viable alternatives, such as bitcoin, which are not in control of the banks or governments.”\n\nI mean seriously. Talk about the conspiracy theorists hard at work!\n\nYes, bitcoin has a lot of interesting FinTech innovations attached to it — like the blockchain technology that underpins it. But suggesting that the only reason that the payments industry adopted EMV is to keep bitcoin from taking over the world so that the central bankers and key players can continue to be in power — well, it is probably the most creative theory we’ve ever heard about why the U.S. adopted EMV.\n\nIt does get points for creativity, though.\n\nAnd there’s more. It further suggests that accepting bitcoin is free, and that merchants who have to upgrade would severely reduce their fees.\n\n“Merchants will have to upgrade their infrastructure at an additional cost to accommodate for these EMV-enabled payments,” the article stated. “If they decide to accept bitcoin as a payment method, however, there is no additional infrastructure to set up. Plus, they will be charged lower payment processing fees, and are protected from bitcoin price volatility.”\n\nAnd keep them from customers, too, since none of them use bitcoin.\n\nAt least it was an entertaining read.\n\nBitcoin Tracker Week 93\n\nThe Good, The Bad — The Top Bitcoin Stories Of The Week\n\nThe ‘Buy Button’ To Buy Bitcoin\n\nThe power to instantly buy bitcoin just got a little bit easier, thanks to help from Coinbase. The company announced Oct. 1 that customers in 26 countries can buy bitcoin “instantly.” The feature was added in the U.K. and Spain and now it is being expanded across Europe.\n\n“Since credit and debit cards will not require a customer to pre-fund their Coinbase account with a bank transfer, customers can now receive bitcoin much faster,” the company wrote in a blog post.\n\nWith this change, Coinbase no supports 3D Secure credit and debit cards, whereas before users could only top up their accounts using bank transfers. Because Visa’s 3D Secure protocol requires users to verify their ID using a password, it enables Coinbase users to buy bitcoin faster.\n\nMore Support From The Street For Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s momentum on Wall Street continues as more of the world’s leading banks have agreed to investigate how bitcoin could be used to power mainstream financial transactions. While bitcoin has been creating a buzz on the Street for some time, now major names like Bank of America, Citi and Deutsche Bank have joined in the race to explore bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nThese big names follow the companies like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan who have already joined the initiative to explore the blockchain. The announcement from R3, a distributed ledge, indicated that 13 new banks have joined a partnership to design and apply distributed ledger technologies to global financial markets.\n\n“The addition of this new group of banks demonstrates widespread support for innovative distributed ledger solutions across the global financial services community, and we’re delighted to have them on board,” says David Rutter, CEO of R3. “We have placed an emphasis on working with the market from Day 1, and our partners recognize that a collaborative model is the best way to quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively deliver these new technologies to global financial markets.”\n\nOther banks include Bank of New York Mellon, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, SEB, Societe Generale and Toronto-Dominion Bank.\n\n“This is an exciting partnership, and we’re very pleased to be involved,” said Niall Cameron, Head of Markets, EMEA at HSBC. “Innovative, open-source developments like distributed ledger technology require expertise to deliver but have huge potential, offering banks and their clients the prospect of enhanced security, lower costs and improved error reduction.”\n\nAlleged Bitcoin Money Launderers Busted\n\nAnother day means another day for bitcoin to get its name caught in a money laundering scandal. Money laundering, after all, is one of the biggest crutches holding back bitcoin from mainstream support.\n\nNow, reports indicated that Dutch police arrested six in a raid this week that stemmed from a case of offering an anonymous exchange from fiat currency to bitcoin — which is banned under Dutch law. The group in question would allegedly collect bitcoins and exchange the money, but charge a steep commission rate. The reports show that they have laundered a few million worth of euro using this bitcoin exchange scheme.\n\nBitcoin: “The Go-To Currency for Criminals?”\n\nIt’s not the first time bitcoin has been accused of being the currency of criminals — and it won’t be the last. But the latest news from Europol shows that it believes bitcoin is being used by EU cybercriminals.\n\n“Although there is no single common currency used by cybercriminals across the EU, it is apparent that bitcoin may gradually be taking on that role. Bitcoin features as a common payment mechanism across almost all payment scenarios, a trend which can only be expected to increase,” the agency said in a report.\n\nThe EU has said it’s working to combat digital crime by attempting to identify where the top threats are in the region. In the report, the group focuses on exploring bitcoin and how criminals may be using it for illegal activity. It also digs into dark marketplaces and how they can be better cracked down on.\n\nThis means discussing the open bazaar area as a marketplace type to keep a close watch on. This discussion is also sparking conversations abut how to regulate bitcoin and bitcoin exchanges.\n\n“Any regulation of cryptocurrencies would likely only be applicable and enforceable when applied to identifiable users such as those providing exchange services. The inability to attribute transactions to end users makes it difficult to imagine how any regulation could be enforced for everyday users,” the report reads.\n\nBitcoin.com Launches\n\nWith the help of bitcoin’s first angel investor, Roger Ver, the launch of Bitcoin.com has arrived. This site is known as being an “innovative collaborative platform for both novice and veteran members of the bitcoin community.”\n\nThis means running forums on bitcoin, teaching new users about how bitcoin works and keeping the bitcoin community in the know about what’s new in bitcoin wallets. The site also offers an advertising feature for bitcoin companies to buy display ads, which is another attempt to bring visibility to the bitcoin companies in the market.\n\n“Education to raise further awareness about bitcoin and digital currency is much needed, and Roger Ver himself has personally overseen the launch of Bitcoin.com. With bitcoin’s very first angel investor at the helm, Bitcoin.com will be steered in a clear direction while keeping a strong focus on community involvement,” said a press release about the launch.', 'Every few months an article will pop up on the front page of a major news website, heralding how Bitcoin is the future of world currency. Just two months ago, the CEO of the largest Bitcoin market, Coinbase, claimed that in 15 years “Bitcoin could surpass the dollar as the global reserve currency.” The claim is a bold one considering that rough estimates put the number of people who own Bitcoin at around 500,000. So, why all the hype?\n\nBitcoin was founded in 2009 by an anonymous software engineer (or team of engineers). What made Bitcoin so unique is that it is completely decentralized. Users create Bitcoins by mining them via their computer systems. The more powerful a user’s computer is, the more Bitcoins they can mine. In return the Bitcoin system is built on top of every user who mines for these coins.\n\nThere is a limited, but growing amount of online vendors who accept these coins as payment. A single Bitcoin’s value, $240 at the time of writing, is determined solely by supply and demand. This is the key problem with Bitcoin. Its value is still anchored in the value of dollars. Without any monetary value assigned to Bitcoin, it is functionally useless. No one sells items in Bitcoin amounts, but rather in dollar amounts that are paid via Bitcoin. In a sense, Bitcoin is a payment method more than a currency.\n\nBut a trip to any online community dedicated to Bitcoin will produce claims that other currencies are dying and Bitcoin is on the rise. Like the CEO of Coinbase, many supporters believe this unregulated currency has a future in the mainstream global market. There are some indicators that paint a positive picture. This past January, major financial players invested $75 million into Coinbase. These investors included Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (the largest bank in Spain) and the United Services Automobile Association.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury and other nations and national banks have expressed interest into what cryptocurrency’s place in the global exchange market will be. Bitcoin is the predominant option. However, other cryptocurrencies include Litecoin and Dogecoin. (Yes, the doge in Dogecoin does refer to that shibu inu that the Internet loves.) Users point to Bitcoin’s explosive growth in 2013 as a sign that Bitcoin’s value is only going to increase, seeming to ignore the subsequent crash and inherent volatility.\n\nMainstream adoption is increasingly unlikely. Bitcoin originated in, and is still most popularly used by, illegal online businesses. Due to the lack of centralization and general anonymity, it is the currency of choice for the online sale of drugs, fake IDs and weapons. Bitcoin played a role in the emergence of the dark net – a “hidden layer” of the Internet whose illegal trades are fueled by the ability for Bitcoin to hide the actions of involved parties.\n\nConcerns have also been repeatedly raised about its potential use to wire money to terrorist and criminal organizations. Bitcoin’s questionable and dark history gives it a negative reputation. These problems are due to Bitcoin’s lack of centralization, a characteristic that the currency desperately needs to shed if there is to be any chance of widespread adoption. In its current state, no government would adopt Bitcoin as a major currency.\n\nAfter analyzing the facts, it becomes apparent that Bitcoin is not destined to grow and mature beyond what it is today. Without a major overhaul of Bitcoin’s system and values, it is naïve to think that there will be widespread adoption. There are too many inherent problems and general complexities with the currency for it to gain mainstream traction; however, Bitcoin’s death shouldn’t spell the death of cryptocurrency as a whole.\n\nThe future may well give rise to a government-operated and monitored cryptocurrency, that could replace currency as we know it today. But, for now the Internet will have to settle on the humble life of Bitcoin. Its value may rise and fall, and tech savvy investors will continue to speculate. But Internet communities will continue to do what they do best: live in the bliss of Bitcoin’s ignorance.', ""A survey by the World Economic Forum says the tipping point for bitcoin and blockchain adoption will happen by the year 2025.\n\nThe majority of 800 executives and experts surveyed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) put the 6-year-old currency bitcoin, as well as the underlying blockchain technology, 10 percent of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) running through the two technologies by 2025. The WEF was a bit more cautious with its own prediction and put 2027 as year they would reach the “tipping point.”\n\nThe WEF described the use of apps such as Smartcontracts.com, a website that allows people to issue programmable contracts that pay out sums of bitcoin when certain factors (set by the creator of the contract) are reached and verified, without the involvement of any middleman, as a “Shift In Action” in society. “These contracts are secured in the blockchain as “self-executing contractual states,” which eliminate the risk of relying on others to follow through on their commitments.”\n\n“[By 2025] 58% of respondents expected this tipping point to have occurred. Bitcoin and digital currencies are based on the idea of a distributed trust mechanism called the 'blockchain,' a way of keeping track of trusted transactions in a distributed fashion. Currently, the total worth of bitcoin in the blockchain is around $20 billion, or about 0.025% of global GDP of around $80 trillion,” read the report.\n\nPositive impacts of bitcoin and blockchain technology reaching a critical tipping point listed by the WEF included: more direct financial transactions with less and less middleman; brand new assets that can be traded; better property records, and more financial inclusion in emerging markets; blockchain-based contacts and legal services used as unbreakable escrow or programmatically designed smart contracts; and increased transparency.\n\nTechnological Shifts that Will Change the Future\n\nWorld Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on the Future of Software and Society gathered to identify 21 changes in society caused by software that would shape the future. They then survey business and technological leaders about when the “tipping point” for these technologies would happen and what the possible positive and negative effects of them would be, and published the results in a report titled Deep Shift: Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact .\n\nThe committee featured 18 thought leaders and executives in the technology industry, which included several familiar, or involved, in the bitcoin/blockchain industry. Ron Cao, managing director of Lightspeed Venture Partners, a venture firm that invested in American bitcoin exchange CirclePay and Chinese exchange BTCC (formly BTC China); Primavera De Filippi, research fellow at Berkman Center for Internet & Society, France, and early explorer of bitcoin’s and blockchain’s effect on modern law, among others.\n\nThe report also included the “sharing economy,” 3D printing, smart cities, wearable devices, the Internet of Things (IoT), among the list of future-shaping technologies.\n\n“Now comes the second machine age. Computers and other digital advances are doing for mental power – the ability to use our brains to understand and shape our environments – what the steam engine and its descendants did for muscle power,” wrote Council Vice-Chair and Director at MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Erik Brynjolfsson in the report.\n\nBlockchain use by governments was another trend that was included in the list. Possible uses by governments included recording land registries, tax collecting schemes, and other improvements in governmental processes. The tipping point decided by the WEF was the first time that tax is collected through a blockchain application and expected it to happen by 2023.\n\n“[By 2025] 73% of respondents expected this tipping point to have occurred. The blockchain creates both opportunities and challenges for countries. On the one hand, it is unregulated and not overseen by any central bank, meaning less control over monetary policy. On the other hand, it creates the ability for new taxing mechanisms to be built into the blockchain itself (e.g. a small transaction tax).”\n\nThe WEF remained neutral on whether this would be a net positive or negative, citing corruption, real-time taxation, and unclear role for government in the process, including a state’s central bank, were reasons it could “cut both ways.”\n\nAn example given by the report as already underway was a 2016 mayoral candidate of London who has suggested implementing blockchain technology to upgrade the city’s’ ledger for land, as well as for its finances and budget. (Similar experiments are going on in Honduras and the Isle of Man.) “Because these records are kept permanently, there is a strong possibility (without the blockchain) for them to be altered or faulted.”\n\n“The Internet is driving a shift towards networks and platform-based social and economic models. Assets can be shared, creating not just new efficiencies but also whole new business models and opportunities for social self-organization. The blockchain, an emerging technology, replaces the need for third-party institutions to provide trust for financial, contract and voting activities,” concluded the report."", 'South Korean bitcoin services company Coinplug has closed a $5m Series B funding round.\n\nThe company drew support from firms including SBI Investment raising its cumulative funding to date to $8.3m.\n\nJoon Hyuk Park, investment director at SBI, told CoinDesk blockchain technology\'s potential to change legacy financial services, coupled with the team\'s business background and their execution capabilities had influenced his firm\'s decision to invest.\n\nRyan Uhr, Coinplug\'s CEO, said the funding will be used to ""ramp up development of its blockchain-based services"", adding:\n\n""In the future, Coinplug is planning on presenting a global remittance service. Also, we will focus on developing an efficient and competitive blockchain platform ... and provide the platform for major banks in Korea.""\n\nThe company, which also operates a bitcoin exchange and provides bitcoin wallets, is discussing various blockchain strategies with several banks.\n\nChief among these is Coinplug\'s new blockchain-based authentication service for which the company won 50m KRW ($45,500) at a FinTech competition, which was held in June this year and sponsored by major banking group JB Financial.\n\nA statement issued by the company said Coinplug held patents for this kind of technology as well as a number of other blockchain systems, which it plans to sell internationally.\n\nCoinplug\'s CEO concluded: ""The reason we applied for patents in the first place is that we want to present our recently developed and developing blockchain-based technological services to other industries. Also, we wish that blockchain technology would become more widely used and accepted in Korea.""\n\nDollar image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Its origins were shadowy: it had been conceived the previous year by a still-mysterious person or group known only by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto.""\n\nThe article continued: ""And its purpose seemed quixotic: bitcoin was to be a \'cryptocurrency\', in which strong encryption algorithms were exploited in a new way to secure transactions. Users\' identities would be shielded by pseudonyms. Records would be completely decentralised. And no one would be in charge – not governments, not banks, not even Nakamoto.""\n\nYet, the article adds, the idea caught on:\n\n""Some of its growth is attributable to criminals taking advantage of the anonymity for drug trafficking and worse.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', '2015 has seen no shortage of major financial institutions jumping onboard the blockchain bandwagon – in the last two months alone, more than 22 banks have announced pilot projects focused on the emerging technology.\n\nOne of the earliest and most vocal financial institutions in the fray, however, was US stock exchange Nasdaq, which revealed in May it had been working for a year to harness bitcoin\'s distributed ledger for private stock sales.\n\nWhether the bitcoin blockchain will emerge as the one ledger to rule them all, a predecessor to more refined, enterprise-grade technologies or one blockchain among many, remains to be seen, but Nasdaq suggests it is equally interested in any of these possible futures.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Fredrik Voss, vice president and head of blockchain strategy at Nasdaq, spoke to CoinDesk about his organization\'s strategy for communicating its thesis on the technology to those just delving into similar research.\n\nVoss told CoinDesk:\n\n""You get confusion around bitcoin and blockchain, there is an increased understanding that there are two innovations, the asset and the technology innovation.""\n\nAppointed in June, Voss previously served as the company\'s deputy head of commodities, but admits he was a ""newcomer"" to the technology before assuming the position.\n\nVoss presented a clear roadmap for Nasdaq\'s development, adding candidly that the company is not ""married"" to the bitcoin blockchain, but is rather ""ledger agnostic"" in its approach, believing bitcoin remains the best ledger system for its current needs.\n\nStill, it\'s the underlying technology that Voss believes holds ""great potential"" to solve pain points in the operation of financial markets due to attributes such as its auditability and security.\n\n""That is what attracted me and attracted Nasdaq, and the potential of creating efficiencies and releasing capital that is locked into post-trade processes. Those are powerful and attractive attributes,"" Voss said, adding:\n\n""Now of course it remains to be proved that those things can be deliver.""\n\nThe comments comes as part of a wider interview that finds the firm opening up about its stance on bitcoin, touching on topics such as the role of blockchains in settlement and how its work fits into the broader explorations being conducted by major banks.\n\nInside the initiative\n\nVoss described Nasdaq\'s blockchain operations as informal yet expansive in scope.\n\nFor example, he declined to disclose how many full-time team members the company had working on the technology, but suggested the number of those working on such projects ""once a week or once a day"" is above 25.\n\nNasdaq\'s blockchain group, he said, is divided into technologists; those performing supporting functions such as communication, information security and legal work; and its business unit, which defines the use cases on which it experiments.\n\n""Currently, it is really a combination of informing, inspiring and encouraging the organization and the unit to see where the opportunities are with this technology,"" Voss explained. ""It\'s not that we\'ve set aside money and resources and we sit in a room and think big thoughts, we\'re leveraging the entire organization and using the organization as it is.""\n\nCertain departments, he hinted, are looking at proofs of concept and prototypes, though he declined to reveal details about unannounced projects.\n\nQuestion of ownership\n\nVoss also weighed in with his view on the more theoretical arguments ongoing in the space, elaborating on his view of how asset management should ideally function on a blockchain.\n\nFor example, in its Nasdaq Private Market, private shares are issued via colored coins, a process by which the metadata of a bitcoin can be augmented to represent a real-world asset. Up for debate is how beneficial this advent is when more advanced blockchains using smart contracts can move data sophisticated enough to serve as the asset itself.\n\nVoss, however, dismissed this concern as academic, arguing that while this outcome may be desirable in the long term, more simplistic uses of blockchain technology still offer advantages over today\'s best practices.\n\n""You have electronic representations of paper-based certificates and you have electronic representations of physical assets in other markets. The attractive attributes of a distributed ledger is the settlement immediacy of even those tokens,"" he said.\n\nVoss argued that today\'s technology lacks the ability to achieve ""immediate settlement"".\n\n""Then there\'s the distribution and the efficiency you can have when not having to replicate the same transaction over and over and over again, and you can have the 24/7 aspect, you\'re operating around the clock which in most markets is difficult to achieve,"" he continued.\n\nLooking out, he acknowledged having assets directly embedded into the blockchain would be more beneficial, but suggested Nasdaq still believes the technology is attractive today.\n\nR3\'s emergence\n\nVoss further provided clarity to Nasdaq\'s work and how it fits into the large experimentations being conducted by major financial institutions.\n\nAddressing distributed ledger startup R3 CEV and its acquisition of 22 major banking partners, Voss said he was encouraged ""more sources and more brains"" are entering the space, even if he doesn\'t envision major stock exchanges striking a similar alliance.\n\n""We think it will increase the pace of work in the field, but I think it\'s too early to talk about bank-chains or exchange-chains, it feels too much like early days,"" Voss stated.\n\nVoss suggested he would be happy to share findings with major banks, but suggested its emphasis would be on matters relevant to its business. This included making its clearing and depositories more efficient and improving the technology it licenses to partners.\n\n""We have a market technology business where we provide settlement solutions to others around the world, and for us to add distributed ledger systems to those systems adds value for those clients,"" he said.\n\nPrivate markets work\n\nVoss was less open about the ongoing work being conducted by partner and portfolio startup Chain to develop its new blockchain-based Nasdaq Private Market.\n\nHowever, he emphasized that the project is on schedule and that it continues to meet internal benchmarks, even as similar products are also set for launch by companies including Digital Asset Holdings and Symbiont, among others.\n\n""What I can say is we make public what we make public,"" he said. ""We\'ve set up a number of milestones internally, we\'re hitting those milestones and proof of concepts and putting out releases of user interfaces and testing those.""\n\nShould this positive progress continue, Voss suggested Nasdaq could launch its Private Market product before the year\'s end.\n\nFredrik Voss image via Nasdaq\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

10/03/2015,"['SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian businesses are turning their backs on bitcoin, as signs grow that the cryptocurrency’s mainstream appeal is fading.\n\nConcerns about bitcoin’s potential crime links mean many businesses have stopped accepting it, a trend accelerated by Australian banks’ move last month to close the accounts of 13 of the country’s 17 bitcoin exchanges.\n\nThe development is a blow to hopes of bitcoin fans that the currency can play a significant role in everyday business transactions in developed economies, with Australia once seen as one of its most promising markets. It is estimated to hold 7 percent of the currency’s $3.5 billion global value, a sizeable figure in a country of just 24 million people.\n\n“We’ve got a squeaky clean reputation, and that’s actually worth a lot more to us than dipping into this,” said James Snodgrass, principal of Sydney’s Forsyth Real Estate, which ditched the currency in late 2014 after the firm was investigated by the federal tax office.\n\nForsyth had offered to collect home deposits and other realtor fees via bitcoin to cater to international buyers. The tax office probe found no wrongdoing but Forsyth was burned by the negative publicity and bailed out before ever taking a bitcoin payment.\n\nAlthough most mainstream banks in Europe and the U.S. already refuse to keep bitcoin-affiliated accounts, developments in Australia represent the first coordinated shutdown of bitcoin exchanges by a country’s banking system.\n\nThe move makes it much harder for people to convert regular currencies in to or out of bitcoin, threatening its long-term value.\n\n“It really runs on people using bitcoin, and if nobody uses it then it’s worthless,” said University of Technology Sydney senior finance lecturer Adrian Lee.\n\nBANK SHUTDOWN\n\nThe banks’ shutdown appears at odds with a government inquiry which in August recommended removing sales tax for people who buy bitcoin. The Australian anti-money laundering agency, AUSTRAC, told Reuters that banks have no legal obligation to close bitcoin accounts.\n\nThe so-called “Big Four” banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank - directed inquiries about bitcoin to the Australian Bankers’ Association.\n\nTony Pearson, the association’s acting chief executive, wouldn’t confirm the coordinated rejection of bitcoin but said in an email that its “lack of transparency and regulatory oversight raises a number of risks for users and also poses risks for the payments system, the integrity of the financial system and the erosion of the tax base”.\n\nAustralia’s organized crime agency has said it is concerned the currency’s untraceable nature makes it attractive for money laundering and selling illicit drugs.\n\nIn the U.K. and the U.S., most large banks have already cut ties with bitcoin account holders, but lack of industry co-ordination has left room for individual lenders to support the currency, including Germany’s Fidor Bank AG, which operates in Britain, and tech-focused Californian lender Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nA beer poured for a customer sits on a bar next to a Bitcoin sign in central Sydney, Australia, September 29, 2015. REUTERS/David Gray\n\nCLOSE, MOVE OFFSHORE OR SNEAK AROUND\n\nThe 13 Australian bitcoin exchanges whose accounts were closed by the banks have shut operations.\n\nThe remaining four have had their accounts frozen, and now face three options: close, move overseas or spread their business into several smaller bank accounts to avoid detection by their banks.\n\nBuyabitcoin.com.au, one of the remaining four exchanges, said it is still considering its options.\n\n“It makes it, obviously, hard to take payments from our customers, but we have a couple of relationships left,” said Andrew Smith, general manager of the Melbourne-based exchange.\n\nSmith declined to identify which bank his firm is now using from fear of repercussions but said he plans to move the business offshore.\n\nTwo sources told Reuters that regional lender Bank of Queensland still held some bitcoin accounts. The bank said in an email that “virtual currencies fall outside of our risk appetite” but did not deny or confirm it had these accounts.\n\nRETAIL PULLOUT\n\nSome industry watchers believe ambivalence may be bitcoin’s biggest problem.\n\nAt least six Australian retail businesses, which as recently as 2014 courted publicity for offering sales by bitcoin, told Reuters they were considering exiting the currency.\n\n“If governments begin to aggressively attack the whole idea of cryptocurrencies and give it a bad name, it might have an adverse effect on our brand by accepting it,” said David Brim, co-founder of off-road vehicle maker Tomcar Australia, which has sold one car using bitcoin since introducing it in November 2014.\n\nGrant Fairweather, owner of the Metropolitan Hotel in Sydney, said he started accepting bitcoin when a group of digital currency fans chose his pub as their regular meeting venue.\n\n“They tell me that it’s doing quite well, but that doesn’t transpose into here,” said Fairweather, who sells about A$100 ($70) worth of drinks via bitcoin from the meetings and does no other bitcoin trade.\n\nAn online clothing retailer told Reuters she had made no bitcoin sales since introducing the service in 2013 and asked not to be named, saying “since bitcoin’s going out anyway, we’d rather not throw our name back into it”.', 'To process a transaction, you need first to make sure the sender owns the asset he wants to transfer, and make sure he will not trade it twice.\n\nIn the blockchain, information is stored in blocks that record all transactions ever done through the network. Hence, it allows validating both the existence of assets to be traded and ownership.\n\nTo avoid double spending, the technology requests several nodes to agree on a transaction to process it. A validation is also artificially difficult to achieve: miners leverage computer power to solve complex cryptographic problems (the proof-of-work). Every time a problem is cracked, a block is added to the chain, and all the transactions it includes are thus validated. The updated chain, including the new block, is shared with other nodes and becomes the new reference; this process leverages cryptography to prevent duplicate transactions.\n\nNew blocks issued are also linked to previous ones, so that it is almost impossible to go back on a transaction. This technology addresses all the issues to validate a transaction, so that processing one doesn’t request a third-party any more: the network replaces institutions.\n\nNow, transferring assets through the blockchain is done almost in real time as it takes around 10 minutes to add a new block to the ledger. The complexity of the math problem to solve is increasing with time and computer power. And it is cheaper than ever as miners get rewarded at around 0.0001 Bitcoin (BTC) every time they process a transaction. This is a game changer.\n\nBeyond Bitcoin, Several Use Cases Are Explored\n\nOf course, Bitcoin was the first use case of the blockchain, and the most famous one. Its founder developed this technology to process money transfers and to solve many cryptocurrency issues. Instead of having a central bank that issues money, and banks to validate financial transactions, Bitcoin relies on the blockchain. Abra, for instance, is leveraging this technology to ease money transfers across borders — they rely on Bitcoin to disrupt the remittance market.\n\nStability is a key success factor for the technology to expand widely.\n\nBut beyond this monetary use, many applications of the blockchain could be explored. And startups are already working on this technology to disrupt industries. Indeed, every time a third-party is involved to process a transaction, the blockchain could replace it.\n\nOverstock developed “tØ” a public equities trading platform based on the blockchain. And in the same area, NASDAQ announced a partnership with Chain a few months ago: They are working on disrupting shares trading by using the blockchain.\n\nMore generally, financial institutions, like Goldman Sachs or Barclays are teaming up with the startup R3 to create a new framework for the markets based on the blockchain.\n\nA few startups are going even further, and plan to use the blockchain to trade physical assets. Thus, Bitproof and Blocknotary are disrupting contracts by recording them on the blockchain; instead of completing your house sale in front of a notary, just store the contract on the public ledger.\n\nColu, on its side, is using the blockchain to manage property through digital tokens that can unlock either online services or physical objects.\n\nThis also could be applied to intellectual property. For instance, Verisart is using this decentralized technology to verify art pieces. It encodes copyrights of artwork and records them on the blockchain. ProofOfExistence, as well, is leveraging the public ledger to keep track of files you have created.\n\nTo go further, the blockchain could be used to identify people. ShoCard encodes and stores personal information regarding identity. It could enable smart contracts, as well: As soon as terms are met, the contract is processed, thanks to the decentralized infrastructure. IBM is currently working on this application. It also unveiled a partnership with Samsung ADEPT, a proof of concept using the blockchain in the Internet of Things area.\n\nRisks And Threats\n\nBut to go ahead, the blockchain technology needs to fix a few issues. Starting with the network capacity. As we saw earlier, a block is added to the ledger every 10 minutes. Due to the limited size of a block (1MB), the network is restricted to processing 7 transactions per second (tps). This is way far from what VISA can handle, with up to 56,000 tps.\n\nA debate around the block size appeared a few weeks ago and a fork happened in the blockchain: A few miners started increasing block size to 8MB. And this sized is scheduled to double every two years. To solve this debate, if the Bitcoin XT reaches 75 percent of the network, the network will entirely switch to the new block size. More generally, the debate is around whether the blockchain should process a huge amount of transactions for a small transaction fee, or a small number of transactions at a higher rate.\n\nPersonal computers in 1975, the Internet in 1993 and Bitcoin in 2014. — Marc Andreessen\n\nSecurity is also a threat, as a few Bitcoin trading platforms were hacked or closed, making millions of BTC disappear. This also could happen with assets that could be traded over the blockchain.\n\nThese issues highlight the need to have governance, which is a challenge for a decentralized network. But stability is a key success factor for the technology to expand widely.\n\nIf Bitcoin has been everywhere for years, its underlying technology — the blockchain — might be the most interesting and disruptive part of it. Indeed, for the first time in history, the technology seems to be able to replace institutions. When the decentralized network replaces third-parties, there is a wide range of potential use cases, as it eases and reduces the cost of transactions. Startups are now accelerating on this technology, and famous VC investors, like Marc Andreessen, even compare it to previous tech revolutions: “Personal computers in 1975, the Internet in 1993 and Bitcoin in 2014.”\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'Geoffrey Aronow is a partner at Sidley Austin LLP in Washington DC. He has provided compliance advice and represented clients in investigations and proceedings at the CFTC and the SEC for over 30 years.\n\nAronow co-authored this piece with Brian Klein, a partner at the litigation boutique Baker Marquart and a former US federal prosecutor. He represents clients involved with digital currency and blockchain technology. This article explores recent rulings by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and how they affect bitcoin traders across the world.\n\nThe US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently announced settlements with two digital currency businesses, which, at first glance, may appear to impact only businesses, not individual traders. But the implications for anyone trading digital currencies, like bitcoins, regardless of where they live and trade are significant and need to be carefully considered.\n\nThe CFTC can be expected to bring future enforcement actions not just against businesses operating in the US, regardless of whether they have a physical presence there, but also against individual traders all around the world. This is because the CFTC asserts jurisdiction, at a minimum, over any transaction, wherever it may occur and whoever may be trading, that has a connection to conduct in the US or an effect on commerce in the US.\n\nAs a reminder, on 17th September 2015, the CFTC announced a settlement with Coinflip for marketing bitcoin derivatives without being properly registered with the CFTC. A week later, on 24th September 24, the agency announced a settlement of charges against TeraExchange, a CFTC-registered Swaps Execution Facility (SEF), for allowing a digital currency swap trade that was both a “wash trade” and a “prearranged trade,” in violation of US law and regulations.\n\nAlthough in neither case were fines assessed or serious sanctions handed down, the very fact that the CFTC brought the cases without seeking such penalties and publicly announced them close in time demonstrates that it wanted to give “fair warning” to market participants that, in the future, they had better adhere to CFTC rules and regulations, or else.\n\nTraders not immune\n\nThe fact that the CFTC acted against the trading platforms in these cases does not mean that traders themselves are immune from risk. Far from it. There are a number of US regulatory requirements that anyone trading digital currency swaps or other derivatives – and even, in some cases, trading any digital currency products – need to be sensitive to and have in mind as they trade such products. This is true even if the trader does not live in the US because of the long reach of US law.\n\nHere are some of the key land mines:\n\nWhile simply trading digital currency (like bitcoins) on an exchange does not require CFTC registration, if you give advice to others or otherwise involve yourself in the process of placing the trades of others, you may need to register with the CFTC. A digital currency contract that is determined to be a derivative (eg a future or a swap) or an option must be traded on a platform or otherwise in a manner consistent with CFTC requirements or you may be violating the law simply for engaging in the transaction. As highlighted by the TeraExchange case, US regulations prohibit a transaction that can be characterized as a “wash trade”, an “accommodation trade”, a “fictitious sale”, or a trade that “is used to cause any price to be reported, registered, or recorded that is not a true or bona fide price”. These provisions have been broadly applied to any situation where the CFTC believes the process by which a transaction occurs was not fair, open and competitive (unless otherwise provided for under its rules). And they create potential liability for the traders, not just the exchange. For trades done on a CFTC registered platform, such as a SEF like TeraExchange or a contract market, there are specific prohibitions against (1) violating bids or offers, (2) intentional or reckless disregard for the orderly execution of transactions during a closing period, or (3) “spoofing”, which is defined in the statute as “bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution”. Spoofing is an area of particular CFTC attention recently. There are prohibitions related to the theft or conversion and use of nonpublic information from the US government. CFTC regulations broadly prohibit fraud in connection with any transaction under its jurisdiction. Technically, the language of one of the provisions reaches any cash commodity transaction in interstate commerce, although it is unlikely the CFTC wants to become the general overseer of fraud in all commercial marketplaces. But it does mean the CFTC may be able to exercise its discretion to bring a case if it otherwise becomes focused on a problem in the marketplace. Moreover, the relevant statute specifically prohibits a person from entering into a swap transaction “knowing, or acting in reckless disregard for the fact that its counterparty will use the swap as part of a ... fraud against a third party"". The CFTC does not generally have to show actual intent to defraud, but can bring a case based on reckless conduct. The CFTC has broad authority to police for manipulation. Here, the CFTC will look at manipulation not only directly in the derivatives market, but also in the “cash” market where it believes there is the potential for a price distortion effect on a related derivatives market. The CFTC does not need to prove actual intent to manipulate, but simply recklessness. And it has jurisdiction to seek serious sanctions, including fines of $1m per violation, and for attempted manipulation, which requires only evidence of the necessary state of mind (intent or recklessness) and an act that it can say was taken in furtherance of the manipulation.\n\nPotential charges\n\nIn most cases under the CFTC statutes, rules, and regulations, persons can be civilly charged with being aiders or abettors, and can face principal-agent liability for any of the violations of law that the CFTC oversees. And, with regard to fraud and manipulation, egregious cases may well draw scrutiny from criminal prosecutors.\n\nBesides substantial civil monetary penalties, the CFTC can seek cease-and-desist orders or injunctions against further misconduct, disgorgement of proceeds and/or restitution to injured parties, and registration and trading bans and suspensions.\n\nThe latter is worth highlighting because, unlike the SEC in the securities markets, the CFTC can actually suspend or ban people from trading in derivatives markets, whether or not the person is a registrant.\n\nThe bottom line is that digital currency traders, regardless of where they live and trade, need to proceed with eyes wide open to the regulatory structure that the CFTC has now expressly warned will be applied to trading in digital currency markets.\n\nFailure to pay attention to these trading limitations can result not just in actions against the platforms on which the trading occurs, but against the traders themselves. Further, the response may not just be civil litigation but also prosecution by the criminal authorities. Traders everywhere need to beware.\n\nCaution image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

In the second wave, the Bitcoin price found support near 220.0. The upside was sharp, and during the up-wave, there is a bullish trend line formed on the 4-hours chart. The best part is the fact that the price has settled above the 100 simple moving average, which is a positive sign and might push the price higher.\n\nIf the price moves lower or corrects lower from the current levels, then an initial support can be seen around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the 223.0 low to 240.00 high. The mentioned fib level is just above the trend line and support area. So, one can say that there is a monster hurdle forming for sellers near 235.00. A break below the trend line and support area could ignite a move towards the 100 MA. Any further losses should be limited and mat find bids near the 50% Fib level. On the extreme downside, the last swing low of 220.0 might come into play for rescue of buyers.\n\nOn the upside, the last swing high of 240.00 can be seen as a resistance area.

Apps such as Twilight and Blue Light Filter are a blessing for our eyes, but a curse for ABN Amro’s mobile banking implementation.\n\nABN Amro recently released version 7.2 of their mobile banking application, which is where the problems started appearing. After facing quite a few user complaints regarding how the app is not behaving like it should, engineers started an investigation into the matter. Not only did this ABN Amro update add credit card support, but it also made changing the brightness of a mobile device’s screen – through third-party apps – impossible.\n\nThe reason for this change is quite simple: ABN Amro engineers feel that apps such as Twilight and Blue Light Filter cause security vulnerabilities for mobile banking applications. However, an ABN Amro representative failed to mention which part of the technology implemented in these light dimming apps is causing this vulnerability.\n\nSome security experts think ABN Amro engineers have protected their app against an attack called “tapjacking”. This type of attack makes it look like the user is entering information within the app running in the foreground, while they are actually entering data into a “cloaked overlay” application. When someone has an app like Twilight enabled, the ABN Amro application will no longer respond to screen touches.\n\nTo make matters even more confusing, only third-party applications focusing on reducing the blue light emanation from mobile screens seem to be causing the issue. Changing the operating system’s internal brightness settings doesn’t seem to be triggering unresponsiveness from the ABN Amro app.\n\nBitcoin QR Codes Can Be Affected By Screen Brightness Too\n\nThis is one of the few areas where traditional banking and Bitcoin QR code scanning are not that different from one another. When someone gives you a Bitcoin QR code to scan with your own device, it may not always work, depending on how bright or dim their screen is. However, it remains unclear whether this has anything to do with the QR code scanner itself, or a deeper technological issue.\n\nMost Bitcoin wallet applications are taking care of this potential problem on their own accord however. Especially popular solutions such as Breadwallet and Mycelium ensure the QR code can be scanned regardless of brightness. The number of cases where scanning a Bitcoin QR code was not possible is neglectable, whereas the number of people unable to use ABN Amro mobile banking is much larger than anticipated.\n\n\n\nHave you ever run into any issues scanning a Bitcoin QR code? And what are your thoughts on this explanation by ABN Amro? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nSource: Tweakers (Dutch)\n\nImages courtesy of ABN Amro, Shutterstock\n\nOriginally posted on: ABN Amro Mobile Banking Struggles With Apps Managing Screen Brightness – Bitcoin QR Codes Superior', 'The Linux Foundation released a white paper titled “A $5 Billion Value: Estimating the Total Development Cost of Linux Foundation’s Collaborative Projects,” which estimates the value of the open source Linux code (and its collaborations) to be worth US$5 billion.\n\nOpen source has come a long way in recent times. Since 2008, the organization has injected new innovative standards into the technology market.\n\nThe latest paper, published on September 30, is co-authored by Linux Software Engineer, Jeff Licquia, and Chief Marketing Officer, Amanda McPherson. It analyzes this propagation of open source projects and focuses in on the monetary assessment of its R&D operations. McPherson said the research became a focal point earlier this year because ""over the last few years every major technology category has been taken over by open source.""\n\nThe Foundation feels it\'s important to note the current economic value of the open-source model and that collaboration “can save the world.” Executive Director at the Linux Foundation, Jim Zemlin, said in a press release:\n\n“When people have the tools and connections to collaborate on a massive scale, any problem can be solved.”\n\nThere have been more than 500 businesses and countless developers involved in the Linux open source efforts, the report explains. Within the whitepaper collaborative projects such as the Cloud Foundry Foundation, DroneCode, Let’s Encrypt, and more are highlighted throughout.\n\nPutting a price tag on open source software can be a challenge as it is free to download and use by anyone, so the review is an analyzed guess of what people “might” pay for the software. Amanda McPherson states:\n\n“As the model for building the world’s most important technologies have evolved from the past\'s build vs. buy dichotomy, it is important to understand the economic value of this development model. We hope our new paper can help contribute to that understanding.”\n\nBut if Linux projects reveal a US$5 billion dollar assessment then how would the global projection be estimated? And what about other open source platforms?\n\nOpen source code has been very popular and bolstered by the likes of Elon Musk’s, Tesla Motors by releasing its patents. There are also many separate open projects that could weigh in far larger monetary value such as Apache Software and Cassandra.\n\nIn the report, Linux used a SLOCCount model released by Security and Computer Scientist, David Wheeler, who in 2002 pioneered the effort to measure the project’s value. Wheeler’s COCOMO model has proven to be a reliable source to research monetary value metrics concerning open source projects by measuring “person hours” and cost of development as some of its findings.\n\nMany reports have shown how open source data improves economic value such as ResearchGate’s Mikko Puhakka’s article “Evaluation and Valuation of Open Source Software Companies.” But it\'s stated throughout his report that it\'s hard to use these operations as a metric of value, because they receive no revenue and have no payment recording mechanisms. Puhakka says to measure the worth of these services “many unknown factors affecting present value” must be accounted for.\n\nThe Linux Foundation report believes that its 500 collaborative startups economic value of US$5 billion would take 1,356 developers more than 30 years to create. They call this pattern “Distributed Genius” and show examples of their distribution services with organizations like AllJoyn, which network over 85 million devices within its framework. A great number of the world\'s largest cloud providers run on its open project Xen creating a much larger network effect.\n\nThe Linux Foundation\'s collaborative unions are mentioned throughout the report showing how the globe uses its system daily. And although it\'s not easy to measure “free” sources, the global Linux product distribution, and many other open source businesses are creating real value in this world and setting a new precedent.', ""Models present creations by Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons AFP PHOTO / VALERY HACHE (Photo credit should read VALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images) Photograph by Valery Hache — AFP/Getty Images\n\nLegendary designer Pierre Cardin is selling one of his most unusual fashion statements, his singular home on the French Riviera, Le Palais Bulles (“palace of bubbles”). The price isn’t disclosed on the listing from estate agent Charles-Henri de la Grandière, but the Daily Mail reported the price as 300 GBP, or about $456 million U.S. dollars.\n\nAt once futuristic and primitive, the complex appears to be composed of a series of pink terra cotta orbs, each orb a different room, including ten bedrooms, all curves and rounded doorways and windows. Among the reported inspirations are caves and Inuit villages. But especially important is the structure’s lack of angles. “Round shapes have always inspired me,” Cardin has said. He also compared the house to the body of a woman and said about it, “everything is absolutely sensual.”\n\nCardin’s space-age bachelor pad is set on six levels on about 1.75 acres on the Theoule-sur-Mer cliffs, with unparalleled 180-degree views of the Mediterranean, an infinity pool, water features cascading into ponds, and an amphitheater seating more than 500 for hosting those personal command performances with the sea as a backdrop.\n\nThis unforgettable residence was the site of the Dior 2016 Resort show, held earlier this year, and it hosted other star-studded events over the years such as the James Bond 40th Birthday, when it looked the role of a Bond villain lair. The cost to rent out the bubble house for film festival parties and other events was about $13,000 and it was also offered as a one-of-a-kind vacation rental for about $1,100 per person per night.\n\nModels present creations by Belgian designer Raf Simons for Dior's women CRUISE 2016 collection.

The avant-garde purchase was not out of character for the designer who brought women the bubble dress in 1954, and who later dressed the likes of the Beatles and the Stones.

10/04/2015,"[', October 4, 2015 at 10:55 UTC\n\nEvan Duffield, creator and lead developer of the anonymous cryptocurrency Dash, will deliver a keynote at the Bitcoin Wednesday conference in Amsterdam on 7 October, 2015.\n\nIn contrast with Dash, Bitcoin is not anonymous, and was designed to be completely transparent and traceable. Additionally, while Bitcoin transactions are often not considered fully “confirmed” or “cleared” for up to an hour, Dash transactions are irreversible after only a few seconds. This feature makes Dash convenient for face-to-face purchases and transfers.\n\nEvan Duffield, founder and lead developer of Dash said:\n\n""We will be discussing all of our current technology in great detail, in addition we will be revealing some information about our next generation system and it\'s highly advanced capabilities, code named Evolution.""\n\nOne of the many ways Dash stands out from Bitcoin is its newly released ""decentralized governance"" system that is designed to fund projects approved by holders of the currency. This feature allows for such projects to be funded directly from the Blockchain without requiring trusted third-parties and in doing so sets out to resolve one of the most intractable issues faced by Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin, Dash is fully open source, but unlike Bitcoin, Dash’s development team is fully decentralized, making it one of the world\'s first truly Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.\n\nRichard Kohl, organizer of the Bitcoin Wednesday conference said:\n\n""The fact that the Dash team has decided to come forward in this way represents a unique opportunity to learn more about the extraordinary amount of innovation we\'re seeing in this dynamic and vibrant digital currency sector. “The concept of decentralized autonomous organizations funded by anonymous cryptocurrencies is something that still sounds like science fiction in 2015, but since we have teams around the world who are actually making it happen, it\'s time to start talking about what the technology can actually do and what its impact will be on society. Dash is one of these teams and they will be here at Bitcoin Wednesday on October 7th.""\n\nJoining Evan at Bitcoin Wednesday will be core team members from around the world: Daniel Diaz, Balázs Király, and Robert Wiecko, who will also give talks about Dash. This gathering of four members of the Dash team for this one event is designed to raise awareness about what makes Dash unique.\n\nThe appearance of Dash\'s team at the Bitcoin Wednesday conference draws attention to the high degree of innovation currently taking place in the digital currency sector, especially among many of Bitcoin\'s smaller competitors.\n\nDash is currently the 6th largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap (at approximately $14 Million) out of a field of more than 500. It currently trades at 1/100 the price of Bitcoin. While its market cap is just a fraction of Bitcoin\'s, in the short time since its launch two year ago it has attained more than 60% as many active nodes on its network as Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Wednesday (BitcoinWednesday.com) is the largest monthly conference on the digital currency revolution in The Netherlands with more than a 1,000 members. The Amsterdam event now in it\'s third year aims to be a progressive platform for digital currency innovation in all of its forms as well as a launching pad for new ideas in the sector. The conference also promotes the city of Amsterdam as an international center for digital currency innovation. It works closely with both the Dutch Bitcoin User\'s Group of the Netherlands and the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation, and organizes conferences and debates on the most relevant topics for this important new technology.\n\nAlso speaking at the October 7th event is Daniel Hassan of the Helsinki-based activist hedge fund Robin Hood who will talk about his experience with peer-to-peer finance and re-designing financial instruments with the Blockchain.\n\nThe Bitcoin Wednesday conference on 7 October is free, but spaces are limited and advance registration is required.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/BitcoinWednesday/events/222357855/\n\nThe publication of a press release on this page should not be viewed as an endorsement by CoinDesk. Customers should do their own research before investing funds in any company.', 'On October 2 the National Bank of Ukraine warned regional banks and executives of the certain risks using virtual currency. This comes after previous warnings in 2014 with the financial institution giving similar warnings. Due to the Bitcoin conference in Kiev many in the banking community have seen a surge of interest in the digital currency. This newly found enthusiasm can be seen with many participants at conferences and meetings held amongst the Ukrainian banking crowd.\n\nAlso Read: Kiev Will Host the Second Annual Bitcoin Conference\n\nThis news also comes after the National Bank of Ukraine invited PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet to their regional markets. When regulators had said they would facilitate the tech giants into the Ukrainian payment system, they also were looking into the regulation of Bitcoin. The Ukrainian equivalent of the BitLicense was drafted by the Bitcoin Foundation Ukraine during the time the National Bank Council investigated PayPal and other processors.\n\nAccording to the National Bank at present, the international financial institutions and collaborative banking industry have not coordinated approaches to cryptocurrencies. However at this same time members of the central banking committee and business executives are attending the International Forum of retail payments initiative of the World Bank. This includes the Market Infrastructure Committee and International Settlements discussing and monitoring the digital currency with government officials.\n\nThe warnings disclosed may have been caused by the September 30th announcement from Russian regulator Artyom Sychev, who said five banks in Russia were targeted with extortion letters. The messages sent to the banks threatened DDoS-attacks, but according to Sychev he pre-warned banks of the planned attacks and financial institutions were able to avoid the threats. The hackers extortion notes asked for 50 bitcoins (per bank) to be sent to their wallets, and they would cease the attack. Sychev, The Deputy Director of Security and Information, told Ukrainian press:\n\n“Last Saturday’s monitored channels, we have received information that, obviously, several major lending institutions will be attacked. We promptly contacted them, given the possible details of how the attack will take place, “- said Sychev.\n\nExperts at the World Bank want to watch this type of payment instrument for competency, and calculation. The National Bank and various banking groups believe the “Virtual currency schemes” need further analysis. The banks don’t express which way they truly feel about Bitcoin, but the warned of potential risks within the digital environment. The Ukrainian bank believes new members entering the cryptocurrency market should first provide security payments. The bank has not revealed on whether or not they will implement these policies or any at all for that matter.\n\nDo you think Ukrainian Officials will allow Bitcoin to progress in the region? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nImages courtesy of Wiki Commons and Redmemes\n\nOriginally posted on: Ukraine’s National Bank Warns About Bitcoin', 'Over the past 72 hours, the Bitcoin protocol has been suffering from a malleability attack. The attack has been happening to quite a few users moving funds on the network. The transactions look like bitcoin being sent twice or “double spent.” Typically the real action gets confirmed by the network, and the misleading output disappears on most wallets. The attack has been said to be safe but rather a “nuisance”.\n\nOver the past couple of months, the network has had similar malleability or spam attacks hitting the network and affecting confirmations. The cryptocurrency community has been aware of the problem with members like Charlie Lee speaking on the issue. Lee told CoinTelegraph that “Litecoin Shows There Is a Simple Fix for Spam Attacks on Bitcoin” and gave his opinion on the matter.\n\nDevelopers have also been working on fixing the issue by adding a BIP 62 solution to the problem. However, developer Pieter Wuille has said there have been “complexities” involved with the implementation. Many members of the community are currently having grievances with the malleability attacks and people are reporting it on many forums. In such thread, a user from BitcoinTalk has also claimed to be the culprit of the attack, stating:\n\n“OK. This is not ‘someone.’ It is me. Right now the stress-test is paused. I reserve a right to resume it. Ask me anything.”\n\nUsers in the network have been told as they have in the past not to worry. In an ELI5 written on reddit, it was recommended that people should wait for blockchain to confirm fully before adding on top of previous transactions.\n\n“I\'m very surprised and shocked at the lack of urgency being granted to actually doing something about this problem,” wrote one redditor. If and when BIP 62 initiates, it\'s encouraged for all miners to enforce the solution in order to make transactions run smoothly.\n\nCurrently, transactions being sent across the blockchain are being changed but without any knowledge of private keys. This means that users’ bitcoins are completely safe, and it does not change the source destination or amount sent, it just takes a while longer to confirm.\n\nYesterday I had sent a dollar from one wallet to another, and it took over an hour to fully confirm. There was a double spend in my transaction list, however it finally disappeared from my Bread wallet. Overall it is widely believed that BIP 62 will address malleability and spam issues indefinitely within the protocol.\n\nThere hasn\'t been any word from core development on whether this issue will be addressed. Back in January, Gavin Andresen said “DERSIG BIP looks great to me” and that he would suggest a few changes such as BIP 62, explaining it “would simplify avoiding OpenSSL in consensus implementations.""', 'The Syrian refugee crisis continues this week as the world confronts what the United Nations calls ""the biggest refugee and migration crisis since the Second World War.""\n\n- European Commission - Humanitarian Aid & Civil Protection\n\nBy mid-2014, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated that 10.8 million of Syria\'s 22 million population were affected by the conflict, and are in need of humanitarian assistance. An estimated 9 million Syrians have fled their homes since the outbreak of civil war in March 2011, taking refuge within Syria, or leaving the country altogether.\n\nTo escape the violence, Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring countries Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq, while thousands more have escaped to the Caucasus, the Persian Gulf, North Africa and Europe. However, according to the European Commission Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, countries bordering Syria are “approaching a dangerous saturation point.”\n\nIn response to the world\'s escalating refugee crises, members of a decentralized organization incorporated on the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitnation, have been working on its new Humanitarian Aid program.\n\n- Bitnation\n\nBitnation\'s CEO and Founder, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, is no stranger to the problems faced by refugees, her father claimed asylum in Sweden. “I’ve had asylum seekers living in my home while waiting for papers, etc. Not to mention, I’m from a family of refugees myself,” Tarkowski Tempelhof explained.\n\nThe CEO also has professional experience with the situation on the ground, an ex-military contractor with extensive experience helping international aid workers, politicians, and journalists move in and out of dangerous places. Helping obtain visas, security, transportation, and other vital services was all part of her previous job as a contractor in Afghanistan, Libya, and Egypt, long before founding Bitnation.\n\n- Tarkowski Tempelhof, Bitnation CEO and Founder\n\nApplying this wealth of experience, Bitnation has launched two programs: the Blockchain Emergency ID (BE-ID) and Bitnation Bitcoin Visa Cards.\n\nThe current refugee crisis has left countless victims without a home, identification, or access to even the most basic banking services. Opening a bank account is nearly impossible for people in these situations, and having someone send them some funds in any form is extremely challenging.\n\nTarkowski Tempelhof also expressed that BRER\'s aim is to help all refugees, without restrictions.\n\n- Tarkowski Tempelhof\n\nThe BE-ID is a rudimentary emergency identification card, based on blockchain technology, that is available to anyone, including individuals who cannot obtain other forms of ID. Issued by no government, refugees apply online and these IDs are issued as soon as the application form is filled out.\n\n- Bitnation\n\nWhile decentralized IDs are very useful, Tarkowski Tempelhof suspects that Bitnation’s Visa cards could be of the most use to refugees in their day-to-day life.\n\nThese debit cards are available to anyone, can be loaded using bitcoins, and used through the traditional Visa card network.\n\nUsing Bitcoin technology to load the card electronically allows anyone, anywhere in the world, to help the holder with financial assistance, and even allows private donations if a Bitcoin address is posted online somewhere. Once loaded, the card can be used like a normal Visa card, to withdraw fiat cash at ATMs or be used to pay for goods and services, without needing to go to a bank.\n\n- Tarkowski Tempelhof\n\nFor refugees, signing up for a Bitnation Visa card is free, but the card itself is a rebranded E-Coin bitcoin card, costing Bitnation 12€. The organisation is actively seeking donations to cover this expense, and extra donations will be added to the balance on the cards.\n\nSince the launch of the program, in September, there have been approximately 200 applications received for Bitnation Visa cards. The program is currently only marketed through Bitnation\'s ambassador network, a group of volunteers around the world who sign up to represent Bitnation in their area. Unfortunately, before any real marketing can begin for the Visa card program, many rules and regulations must be complied with, slowing down the progress of getting these cards in the hands of people who need them.\n\nWhile Bitnation IDs are issued as soon as the application is received, 1000 debit cards need funding through donations before they can be issued, “because of all the bureaucracy involved,” Tarkowski Tempelhof explained.\n\n- Tarkowski Tempelhof\n\nThere is another avenue for those who wish to help the organisation, donating time and skills. The IDs and their website depend on programmers donating their time to the project, which is a resource that has been drying up recently. As Tarkowski Tempelhof told us, “more JS devs would help speed the progress up tremendously.”\n\nTo help refugees understand the usefulness of bitcoin, and the tools that are being provided, Tarkowski Tempelhof and the Bitnation ambassadors plan to organize workshops in refugee camps coverings topics such as Bitcoin, basic communication encryption, Bitnation IDs, the debit cards, and even online maps.\n\nThis next step in educating refugees is “truly one of our greatest challenges,” stated Tarkowski Tempelhof, and from someone who recently spent a month in Ghana teaching locals how to use the blockchain as a land title registry, such a statement should not be taken lightly.\n\nThe United Nations is actively urging all world leaders to help. However, at the 70th session of the General Assembly earlier this week, Mr. Ban stated that “we are not receiving enough money to save enough lives” and clarified their financial situation with the memorable phrase: “the global humanitarian system is not broken; it is broke.” He further specified that the UN has only half of what they need to help the people of Iraq, South Sudan, and Yemen – and just a third for Syria.\n\n- Ban Ki-moon, United Nations Secretary-General\n\nThe European Union and its Member States are collectively leading the international response, having already donated more than €4.2 billion for refugee relief and recovery assistance, with €200 million more recently announced. The extra humanitarian assistance will address the “needs inside Syria and Iraq, as well as the needs of Syrian and Iraqi refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries”.\n\n- Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission\n\nTarkowski Tempelhof\'s goal mirrors that of the United Nations and the European Union, to not only save lives but to help refugees find stability and happiness. “Our aim is not just to keep people alive, but to give them a life -- a decent life,” stated Mr. Ban.\n\n- Ban Ki-moon\n\nBitNation is attempting to do exactly this, use new tools and connections, “We hope using the Blockchain in Emergency Response situations like this crisis will help show the world how Open Source innovation can change how we are able to resolve, not just respond to, Global needs,” Bitnation.', 'A society without physical money is already becoming very apparent in our world. Most people do not use cash or checks like they used to 20 years ago. Currently, there is only 8% of hard physical cash represented in the world, and the rest of our money is pure digits. It’s not hard to see that this is a reality as people use mobile banking, debit cards, and online payments. People can go for quite some time without using cash at all this day in age, and it’s increasing in popularity every day.\n\nAlso Read: Braintree Expects $500b USD in Transactions, Bitcoin Volume Key?\n\nSo within the cashless environment that’s growing globally what are the choices available to individuals? There are a vast amount of options, but they all have contrasting differences that are very apparent. With the U.S. and the U.K. showing signs of increased popularity for cashless transactions, banking executives and certain technological giants want to drive this trend of digital trade higher and increase its potential.\n\nServices such as Barclaycard, Apple Pay, Android Pay and just recently Samsung Pay are popping up in stores everywhere. Frictionless applications are taking the idea of physical cash transactions out of the purchasing equation, and centralized services are reaping the benefits. The problem with this is that these entities are using these new emerging services to track and identify users and harvest this data to continue its parasite economy. These services are maybe frictionless in the payment processing environment however behind the scenes they are very much tethered to centralized entities.\n\nApple Pay\n\nThe service provided by tech giant Apple is a mobile processing provider applicable to iPhones and compatible iDevices that let users make digital payments. Apple applications offer usage in the U.S. and various regions around the world. Just recently the service was introduced into U.K. markets with a few initial problems. Apple Pay works with a user applying a credit or debit card to its payment application that is controlled by Apple’s server. The service states that it keeps customer payment and retailer data private with its unique “dynamic security code”. By adding this method, Apple claims that it will not track usage and data would remain between the two parties. At brick and mortar venues, points of sale are authenticated through the iDevice with the touch of a fingerprint using Apple’s Touch “ID sensor”. The problem with this system is that its centralized server that can collect data, act as authorization and the ability to freeze accounts held indefinitely. Trusting in the company’s promises is a very hard thing to do in an NSA environment such as today’s.\n\nAndroid Pay\n\nAndroid Pay is Google’s second attempt to tackle the cashless payment processing world. The company replaced its older version Google Pay with its mobile application which uses NFC (Near Field Technology) to transmit payment data and authorizations. The same method applies to Android Pay whereas users load their debit and credit cards to work with them in virtual realms. Android Pays system uses pattern, password/pin, and fingerprint services to secure transactions. Google is another centralized service that claims it does not monitor its user-base. Despite this claim, it has been reported by various media sources that Google has been an arm for the special government agencies for quite some time.\n\nSamsung Pay\n\nSamsung has been in talks regarding its new mobile processing platform for a while now. It wasn’t until the Galaxy 5 release that information surfaced about its payment protocol. The application also requires users to load ‘supported’ debit and credit information and also can be loaded with gift cards. Samsung works in stores that use NFC technology at its point of sale kiosks. With the NFC Tech added to its service it additionally uses a protocol called MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) which emulates actual physical credit card swipes. Samsung Pay is also a centralized application through Samsung’s server that monitors transactions but also states that it keeps the information private. If the server within Samsung’s application or any centralized service for that matter is compromised, it will reveal millions of users private data and information.\n\nBarclaycard\n\nThe UK-based financial magnate Barclays has released two different enhancements to the contactless payment world. The service offers Quick Tap NFC to its Mastercard banking applications and a free mobile contactless sticker for Visa. The sticker provides a similar method to the cashless arena but is only for Barclay Visa users through its PayTag products. The service only works with Barclay approved environments and connects with its own card services. The server is completely centralized and monitored by the UK bank’s team which can authorize, and freeze the application at a moment’s notice.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was created in 2008 is one of the first forms of digital value that can be transacted without the need for third party intermediaries. The system is self-regulated and self-secured by its inherent circular nature of simply confirming time-stamped transactions. There is no central point of authority within the creation of a bitcoin they are created by the confirmation of transactions within the system. At this current time a set of 25 newly created bitcoins are created when a block is found by a miner, and the blocks themselves are transactions looking to be confirmed. The system cannot create large amounts of digital money from thin air like the central banking system. Bitcoin’s protocol is completely open-source and owned by nobody. Within this decentralized nature of circular self-preservation is the basic trust that it operates in this manner and being a peer-to-peer network this can be validated.\n\nTracking bitcoins is possible however this takes far more effort from a central authority. Bitcoin addresses come with no names and addresses associated with them offering a more pseudo-anonymous environment and making surveillance increasingly difficult. Because the value is transacted with and recorded from a public environment the information is voluntarily given by its participants. Those who wish to take various methods of anonymization to the next level can by hiding IP addresses, using TOR, shuffling coins, and other cloaking techniques. This gives the user choice on whether they prefer privacy or transparency in the open peer-to-peer network Bitcoin has to offer. Bitcoin businesses are already producing NFC technology systems and debit card alternatives for the cryptocurrency environment and most of these organizations offer high-tech security far superior to the traditional banking methods of today. Many of these centralized services do not offer two-factor authentication and banks wouldn’t even know what to do with the idea of multi-sigs, and ideas like threshold signatures — for this technology is completely over their head.\n\nWhen individuals use the bitcoin protocol this also gives them sovereign authority to make purchase and transact. There is no person or organization who needs to approve this trade except the buyers and sellers themselves. Accounts cannot be frozen by any entity and this cannot be said about the current traditional finance network. A business or group cannot reap the benefits of laying on extensive fees with cryptocurrency transactions because the only fees in the system of bitcoin are its self-preserving system. These fees are agreed upon by the voluntary community themselves and the miners in the network. They are also significantly less than the banking fees given today which can be as high as 12% as opposed to bitcoins less than 1% within most transactions.\n\nThe benefits of a purely voluntary network of digital transactions means that the implementation of corruption can be avoided or curbed. Because the body of users trusts and watches this system by agreeing upon its foundational characteristics the network thrives. This peer-to-peer system cannot be manipulated so easily, and data from it cannot be harvested in the centralized ways that Apple Pay and Samsung Pay use. The protocol gives the individual the advantage of controlling their money at a moment’s notice.\n\nBitcoin gives new meaning to how crowdfunding and technological trade can help areas of the world without resources faster. These ‘cashless concepts’ like cryptocurrency offer decentralization and a system that is controlled only by its voluntary activity. This system with all the attributes above is not tethered to a centralized issuer or organization. The new technological environment Bitcoin provides is a choice and an advancement for the people. As for the other centralized payment processors, well you can take their word for it…..\n\nWhat do you think of the current cashless choices?

Chen personally claimed that USFIA owned large amber mines in the Dominican Republic and Argentina, and that USFIA was set to undergo an initial public offering in the near future.\n\nForeign investors took interest in the IPO of USFIA and Chen’s claims that all investors would be entitled to receive pre-IPO shares in USFIA that would increase in value once the company becomes listed on the public stock market.\n\nInvestors were promised a highly profitable payout in Gemcoin, a cryptocurrency created by USFIA as part of the scheme. On its website, USFIA stated that Gemcoin is backed by US$50 billion in assets and has partnered with ApplePay to roll out 2,500 ATMs throughout the United States.\n\n“Gemcoin's value is backed by parent company AFG’s 10 Precious Gem mines and Gemcoin are stable as it is backed by its equivalent in precious stones. USFIA has agreements with ApplePay - 2,500 ATM's ready for nationwide distribution for use with our Global VISA Debit Card and joining a ATM network along side Bitcoin,” announced USFIA.\n\nFurthermore, Chen and others from USFIA hosted multiple presentations and talks to convince its investors that the company:\n\nPlans to open 3,000 coffee shops in the next three years; Owned 70% of the amber mines in the Dominican Republic; founded China Unicorn, an undersecretary to the Secretary of States of the People’s Republic of China; would increase exponentially every two months in value.\n\nThe US$32 million raised from the Gemcoin scam was almost immediately wired to Chen’s personal accounts in China, which are now frozen due to the complaints of the US SEC. However, the SEC claims that the majority of the funds were already used to purchase luxurious goods such as sports cars, apartments and other properties."", 'The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the country’s central bank, has issued a Bitcoin warning to regional banks and other financial institutions, the second after an year’s gap.\n\nThe latest warning comes in the wake of Bitcoin’s growing popularity within the national borders. According to a Ukrainian daily, a recently held Bitcoin conference in capital Kiev has sparked a series of conferences and meetings among the regional banking institutions, a factor that could lead to an organic Bitcoin adoption rate in the country.\n\nBut despite growing interests, Bitcoin is still a risky and speculative asset that might hurt individuals financially, in one way or another. NSU’s warning, therefore, appears more to be a reminder for banks and people to stay away from this new technology, until further notice.\n\nNatalia Lapko, the Director of NBU’s payment systems department, had earlier presented a balanced opinion on Bitcoin, saying that she believes in its potential, but also supports the need of regulation for such disruptive technologies.\n\nIn this regard, the NBU had admitted to have been studying Bitcoin, saying it will follow a global opinion when it comes to regulating the digital currency.\n\n“Users choose payment methods which the find convenient,” Lapko had said during the Bitcoin Conference Kiev. “The task on our part is: to make them as safe as possible. We keep up with the world community and will not lose this phenomenon as such.”\n\nBut according to the very recent comments made by NBU, the international financial institutions and watchdogs have still not reached to any specific conclusion related to Bitcoin regulations. However at this same time, the Ukraine’s central bank executives are attending the World Bank’s International Forum of Retail Payments. A part of this conference includes banks officials from various countries discussing the emerging digital currency sector.\n\nBitcoin transactions meanwhile remains to be illegal in Ukraine, according to a clarification published by NBU last year.', 'The housing market in the United States has been on the decline since late August. While unfortunate, it’s something Americans are used to. Since 2008, the country has struggled with the regular ups and downs of its housing market, and many of us, despite the media’s attempts to convince us that things “have gotten better,” remain skeptical.\n\nAlso read: The Bitcoin Halving: Deflating the Hype\n\nWith the recent drop, that skepticism appears to be somewhat justified. In retrospect, though, how upset can one get about the current situation? As we have seen in the past when things go down, they eventually come back up. It’s bound to take time of course; sometimes years or even decades go by before a crash subsides and things return to what can be considered “normal,” but nothing remains at the bottom forever.\n\nThose of us who love, respect and deal in Bitcoin know all too well that this mentality holds true. Nothing that goes down remains down permanently. Bitcoin, in many ways, is a lot like the American housing market. It has experienced grand highs along with incredibly grand lows. Between its consistent fluctuations in price and relative inability to stay steady over the last two years, it’s been difficult to grasp where things stand.\n\nMany digital currency enthusiasts likely had their fear meters tested in August of 2015 (ironically, the same time of the housing drop), when the price of Bitcoin fell below the $200 mark. 2015 also had a particularly rocky start when Bitcoin experienced a temporary crash that brought the price down to about $179, the lowest it had been in quite some time.\n\nNeedless to say, many of us felt worried and stressed as the corresponding data emerged. Those who had invested a lot likely felt the same way a stockholder feels the minute he sees a red, zigzagging line representing his favorite company strike the bottom of a sales chart. However, things eventually took an appropriate turn. Ten months since the drop occurred, the price of bitcoin sits at around $240, and while it’s hard to label the current price as “stellar” or “fantastic” in some way, it’s certainly a cut above where it stood when the year began.\n\nMuch like the housing market, bitcoin eventually rose from the ashes after reaching such an extravagant low, and there is no doubt that it will experience another rise in the future. Things may look bad for a few moments, but the situation eventually steadies out. The same rule goes for homeowners. Those worried about their respective dwellings need not fret for too long. As one source puts it, the drop consisted of a mere 12 percent, a small price to pay in the larger scope of things. Eventually, home prices will peak again.\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin, we cannot presently look at it and say that it’s in prime condition. $240 does not compare to $500 or $600, but what we can agree on is that as our digital age continues to develop, and bitcoin’s popularity grows, and society’s dependency on virtual means grows, bitcoin’s value will continue to increase. As usage, need and desire stimulate this value, bitcoin will have no choice but to pack its bags and trek north.\n\nIs the price of Bitcoin likely to experience a stellar rise in the near future? Post your comments below!\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect those of Bitcoinist.net.\n\nOriginally posted on: How Bitcoin is like the Housing Market', '“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” A saying that most of us are familiar with. For those who don’t know about it, it means don’t be completely dependent on only one thing without factoring in the redundancies and contingencies. The same holds good for bitcoin industry as well.\n\nThe bitcoin platforms are targeted regularly by hackers and they also attract a lot of DDoS attacks. In order to prevent unauthorised access and DDoS attacks bitcoin companies, both big and small depend on third party applications, in addition to their own security features. CloudFlare is one such service provider who has been providing CDN (Content Delivery Network) and DNS (Domain Name System) services to major bitcoin exchanges, services and publishing companies.\n\nIt was recently reported in an article featured on CryptoCoinsNews. The article lists some of the well-known players who use CloudFlare’s services for DNS and CDN services. The list includes names like BitPay, Bitgo, Coinbase, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, Purse.io and Shapeshift.io. The San Francisco based company has been offering its security and content delivery services since 2009. Various web platforms have been making use of their services. With its customers increasing the number of customers, CloudFlare is gradually becoming an attractive target for cybercriminals and hackers.\n\nThe CloudFlare servers receive both encrypted and unencrypted traffic from these bitcoin platforms using its services, making it an attractive target. We can safely assume that CloudFlare has its own security systems and fail -safes in place. Unintentional centralization of bitcoin services, using CloudFlare may encourage a focused sustained attack by hackers, eventually compromising the security, causing losses in tune of billions of dollars in bitcoin and private information.\n\nThe article suggests that bitcoin companies should not depend upon just one provider to meet all their requirements, thereby reducing the risk. It is also advisable for these companies to have their own safety and security features in mind. They should also offer a secure way for users to access their accounts.', 'With arrests, funding announcements and banking partnerships, it’s been a busy week in the world of bitcoin and blockchain technology.

Gemini will hold customer money in federally insured bank accounts. The exchange aims to make it easier for large institutional investors to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWall Street banks have recently been expressing growing interest in harnessing the technology underlying Bitcoin. But it is still unclear whether they and other large financial players will want to trade Bitcoin itself, as the Winklevoss twins are betting.

Australian banks last month announced plans to close the accounts of 13 of the country’s 17 bitcoin exchanges.\n\nThe development is a blow to bitcoin’s chances of becoming a mainstream currency since Australia was considered one of its most promising bitcoin markets. Australia is estimated to hold 7 percent of bitcoin’s $3.5 billion global value, a sizeable figure in a country of just 24 million people.\n\n“We’ve got a squeaky clean reputation, and that’s actually worth a lot more to us than dipping into this,” said James Snodgrass, principal of Sydney’s Forsyth Real Estate, which stopped using the currency in late 2014 after the company was investigated by the federal tax office.\n\nForsyth had offered to collect home deposits and other realtor fees in bitcoin to cater to international buyers. The tax office probe uncovered no wrongdoing, but Forsyth’s reputation was tarnished by the negative publicity. The company decided to ditch bitcoin before ever taking a bitcoin payment.\n\nAt least six Australian retail businesses, which as recently as 2014 courted publicity for offering sales by bitcoin, said they were considering no longer using the currency.\n\n“If governments begin to aggressively attack the whole idea of cryptocurrencies and give it a bad name, it might have an adverse effect on our brand by accepting it,” said David Brim, co-founder of Tomcar Australia, an off-road vehicle maker which has sold one car using bitcoin after introducing it in November 2014.\n\nGrant Fairweather, the owner of the Metropolitan Hotel in Sydney, said he started accepting bitcoin when some digital currency fans chose his pub as their regular meeting venue.\n\n“They tell me that it’s doing quite well, but that doesn’t transpose into here,” said Fairweather. He said he sells about $100 ($70) worth of drinks via bitcoin from the meetings and does no other bitcoin trade.\n\nAn online clothing retailer told Reuters she has made no bitcoin sales since introducing the service in 2013. She asked not to be named, saying “since bitcoin’s going out anyway, we’d rather not throw our name back into it.”\n\nFirst Coordinated Move By Banks\n\nDevelopments in Australia represent the first coordinated shutdown of bitcoin exchanges by a country’s banking system. Most mainstream banks in Europe and the U.S. do not keep bitcoin accounts.\n\nThe banks’ move makes it harder for people to convert regular currencies into or out of bitcoin.\n\n“It really runs on people using bitcoin, and if nobody uses it then it’s worthless,” said Adrian Lee. A University of Technology Sydney senior finance lecturer.\n\nThe banks’ actions were especially discouraging to bitcoin supporters in light of the fact that in August, a government inquiry recommended removing sales tax for people who buy bitcoin.\n\nAUSTRAC, Australia’s anti-money laundering agency, told Reuters that banks have no legal obligation to close bitcoin accounts.\n\nAustralia’s “Big Four” banks – Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp., Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank – directed inquiries about bitcoin to the Australian Bankers’ Association.\n\nTony Pearson, the association’s acting chief executive, would not confirm the coordinated rejection of bitcoin but said via email that its “lack of transparency and regulatory oversight raises a number of risks for users and also poses risks for the payments system, the integrity of the financial system and the erosion of the tax base.”\n\nAnti-Crime Agency Raises Concerns\n\nAustralia’s organized crime agency has voiced concern that bitcoin’s untraceable nature makes it attractive for money laundering and illicit drug sales.\n\nIn the U.K. and the U.S., most large banks have already cut ties with bitcoin account holders, but not in a coordinated manner. The lack of industry coordination has left room for individual lenders to support the bitcoin, including Germany’s Fidor Bank AG, which operates in Britain, and Silicon Valley Bank, a technology-focused lender in California.\n\nThe 13 Australian bitcoin exchanges whose accounts were closed by the banks have shut operations.\n\nRemaining Bitcoin Exchanges Feel Pressure\n\nThe remaining four bitcoin exchanges in Australia have had their accounts frozen. These exchanges now face three options: close, move overseas or spread their business into smaller bank accounts to avoid detection.\n\nBuyabitcoin.com.au, one of the remaining exchanges, said it is considering its options.\n\n“It makes it, obviously, hard to take payments from our customers, but we have a couple of relationships left,” said Andrew Smith, general manager of the Melbourne-based exchange. He declined to identify which bank his firm is now using for fear of repercussions. He said he plans to move the business offshore.\n\nTwo sources told Reuters that Bank of Queensland, a regional lender, still held some bitcoin accounts. The bank said in an email that “virtual currencies fall outside of our risk appetite,” but it did not deny or confirm it had these accounts.\n\nSome industry watchers believe ambivalence may be bitcoin’s biggest problem.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In recent weeks there has been noticeably more volume on two of the major bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp & OKcoin. The two charts below show the big increase in volume with very little price movement on both of these exchanges.\n\nAfter speaking with self proclaimed “degenerate gambler” and one of the most respected bitcoin traders of the space, BTCVIX, most of this volume appears to be wash trading. “And now we are even seeing some of this interest wane as I believe the ramping up volume washing bot activity is the Casino trying to keep the lights flashing and the sounds blasting so that we keep wanting to play the game,” according to BTCVIX. More can be found on this subject: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3lwnyn/the_state_of_trading_in_the_bitcoin_markets/\n\nThis is done to fake liquidity and volume. What happens is large orders are bought and sold of almost the same amount very quickly. This increases churn but affects price very little. Below are some charts showing what is considered to be wash trading.\n\nBitcoin has been stuck in a very tight range (under US$20) since the beginning of September. While this column has commented for months on the lack of volume on any upside moves and how disappointing that is, this type of volume increase can be a self fulfilling prophecy. Volume generally precedes price and while it is only one factor, there are reasons to be bullish here.\n\nAs the above chart shows, the price has broke above the 50 day EMA, which could set up for a move to test big resistance in the US$255-$260 range. Not only that but the Bollinger Bands and the Directional Movement Index (DMI) have both tightened to levels not seen in quite a while. What this means is that a big volatile move should be expected, and the bias is to the upside. The RSI is also positively diverging from price, which is bullish. The MACD just had a bullish crossover as well. Finally On Balance Volume (OBV) is at elevated levels and while this might be do to wash trading, it’s bullish as well.\n\nBased on the weight of the evidence, bitcoin looks poised to experience an upside breakout. If this happens, the first level that needs to be broken is US$260 for a sustained rise. While there are many key resistance levels before US$300, if price gets there and fails again - that would be extremely bearish.', '', 'A survey of US consumers suggests that at least some may be willing to start shopping with a specific retailer if they started accepting bitcoin.\n\nThe Next Generation of Commerce survey, conducted by digital marketing firm Acquity Group, featured feedback from 2,035 respondents on a range of topics including e-commerce, consumer loyalty and mobile engagement.\n\n3% of respondents indicated that they were ""willing to shift their loyalties"" to a particular retailer if they began accepting bitcoin or another digital currency. Respondents in the 18–22 demographic were most likely to make that change, whereas those in the 58–68 bracket indicated the least willingness.\n\n18% of respondents said that they would shift to a specific retailer if they provided ""social engagement as a form of currency redeemable for discounts or coupons"".\n\nImage via Shutterstock', 'US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen has issued new comments on how she believes the country\'s financial regulators should address bitcoin and blockchain technologies, stating that these agencies must be careful not to ""stifle innovation"".\n\nThe statements were issued in response to a question submitted to Yellen by US Representative Mick Mulvaney following a 15th July meeting of the House Committee on Financial Services\' Monetary Policy and Trade, of which he serves as vice chairman.\n\nIn his 11-page submission, Mulvaney sought clarity as to how the central bank viewed the increasing popularity of bitcoin after this summer\'s economic crisis in Greece, notably asking Yellen if the technology\'s increasing popularity implied the public may be losing faith in the Fed\'s ability to conduct monetary policy.\n\nYellen responded:\n\n""We do not interpret bitcoin\'s popularity as having a relationship with the public\'s view of the Federal Reserve\'s conduct of monetary policy.""\n\nDespite asking two questions, Yellen focused most of her response on how she believes regulation should develop in the US, emphasizing that the Federal Reserve and federal banking agencies have ""limited authority over the operation of digital currency systems"" as a whole.\n\n""Where a banking organization supervised by the Federal Reserve provides services to a business or individual that is an administrator or exchange of a digital currency, the Federal Reserve seeks to ensure that the banking organization fully complies with all applicable regulations,"" Yellen stated.\n\nOther federal and state regulators, she continued, may have different authorities over the technology, depending on their specific mandates.\n\nThe remarks are consistent with past public statements given by Yellen in regards to the development of bitcoin and blockchain technologies.\n\nYellen first addressed the technology in a Senate Banking Committee meeting last February, at which time she stated that the US central bank does not have the authority to supervise or regulate digital currency systems such as bitcoin.\n\nCosts and benefits\n\nYellen suggested that US authorities weigh the ""costs and benefits"" of new statutes or regulations carefully.\n\nAspects to consider, she suggested, include how such laws could ""strengthen the soundness of virtual currency schemes and increase public trust in the products"" and whether the technology represents a ""significantly different or greater risk"" than other new payment systems.\n\nYellen cautioned that the ""evolving nature"" of the technology means that such laws should not stifle innovation, a balance that regulators have so far stressed they are seeking to strike with mixed success.\n\n""Some may refrain from investing in or using digital currencies due to a perceived legal uncertainty and/or lack of consumer protection,"" she continued.\n\nNew York\'s state-specific regulatory regime for digital currencies, for example, has come under fire by industry supporters for being overly vague while imposing high costs on startups.\n\nOther attempts, such as those ongoing in California, have been met with equally mixed public responses.\n\nFederal Reserve image via Shutterstock\n\nJanet Yellen Response to US Representative Mick Mulvaney on Bitcoin\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As a result, there are now large venture capital investments and lots of startups building infrastructure.\n\n“The people behind the industry used to be very libertarian, very political in nature, and wanted to push an alternative currency and an alternative lifestyle,” said Liu. “You are now seeing the bitcoin players receive venture capital and work with banks closely, trying to create a more harmonious financial system integrating the traditional financial system with the Bitcoin network, and that’s going to be much more powerful.”\n\nOKCoin.cn and OKCoin.com , two separate companies owned by the same investors and focused respectively on Chinese and worldwide digital currency trading, were founded in 2013 with a $1 million angel investment from Ventures Lab and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, and received a $10 million series A funding round in March 2014. OKCoin is perhaps the largest exchange in the world with 20 percent of daily trading volume, said Liu.\n\n“As a native speaker of both English and Chinese, and as someone who has worked in traditional finance and at a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange, I hope to bring both international and institutional perspective to OKCoin and to shed more light on the Chinese market with the global Bitcoin community,” said Liu when he joined OKCoin as Director of institutional strategy and sales in November 2014. “I view OKCoin now as an international company, not as a Chinese one.”\n\nAccording to Liu, the most interesting applications use bitcoin and the blockchain as a transparent intermediate step for fund transfers in fiat currencies, making sending and receiving money as easy as sending and receiving email.\n\n“We can hide bitcoin technology in the background, and that’s what we have launched with a product called OKLink, in the spring, that was the first ‘superwallet’ in the world,” said Liu. “A superwallet is really a mobile wallet that allows you to hold a more comfortable type of value, like the USD or the CNY, but transact over the Bitcoin network.” Liu added that OKLink transactions aren’t affected by the volatility of bitcoin. “Because you are doing instant buy of bitcoin and sell of bitcoin, you are not affected by the bitcoin price,” he said.\n\nOKCoin launched the OKLink “superwallet” in April. OKLink is an open digital wallet, which allows national and digital currencies to transact cross company, cross border, and cross currency in an instantaneous and free manner. OKCoin gives an example of consumer-to-consumer transaction in fiat currencies channeled transparently through the blockchain:\n\n“Paul, an American, and Tom, a Canadian, are good friends. Paul is a Circle user while Tom uses OKLink. Tom would like to borrow from Paul $100 USD worth of Canadian dollars (CAD). Tom opens his OKLink Superwallet and shows his QR Code to Paul. Paul through scanning the QR code with his Circle Superwallet, sends Tom $100 USD. The Circle Superwallet buys exactly $100 USD worth of bitcoins from a U.S. dollar Bitcoin exchange and then via the Bitcoin network sends the bitcoins to Tom’s OKLink account. Tom has instructed as default that incoming funds should be received as CAD. OKLink Superwallet takes the received bitcoins and sells it on a CAD Bitcoin exchange for CAD. In the end, Paul sent $100 USD to Tom, and Tom received it as CAD to use.”\n\nBesides consumer-to-consumer transactions, OKLink can be used for business-to-business, consumer-to-business, and business-to consumer transactions.\n\n“This is a huge market, especially in China,” continued Liu. China already owns around 50 percent of bitcoin mining hashpower and 60 percent of exchange volume, and Chinese people – especially students – are frequently abroad and need efficient cross-border payments. Chinese consumers are already used to “a beautiful payment experience” with WeChat and Alipay for domestic payments, and they expect the same for cross border payments.\n\nInterestingly, the Bank of America (BoA) recently filed a patent application titled “System and Method for Wire Transfers Using Cryptocurrency” for an alternative to traditional wire transfers, where the funds are first transferred to a cryptocurrency exchange, then converted to a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, then sent to another exchange, and finally converted into another currency for the recipient.\n\nIn other words, BoA wants to patent the concept of using a cryptocurrency as a transparent intermediate step for fiat currency transfers, but it seems that OKCoin got there first."", '2015 has been a stabilizing year for Bitcoin, but now its global expansion has taken a unique twist. Thousands of bitcoin ATMs have multiplied like rabbits all year long, but where they have ended up may surprise you. The new global Bitcoin consumer ATM Mecca has shifted to Eastern Europe near the hotly-contested military crossroads of the Ukraine.\n\nEconomic Freedom Reaches Military Hot Zone\n\nThe Ukraine, which is considering legalizing Bitcoin through its banking system, has been in the news for all the wrong reasons over the last two years: from commercial airliners allegedly going down via missile attacks; to the nation’s political regime change; to NATO versus Russia military build-ups that may become a precursor to World War III.\n\nWhat has gone largely unnoticed during this period of geopolitical upheaval is the foundation of Bitcoin business and economic exchange that is beginning to be made throughout the turbulent country, along with other countries throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nIf you have used a RedBox movie service you may be familiar with the electronic kiosk concept in the West. Payment companies use similar kiosks for many different services like paying utility bills and loading debit cards. Over the last few months, Ukrainian payments leader BTCU.biz has now equipped over 15,000 of their machines with Bitcoin services for consumer exchange of funds, according to CoinATMRadar.\n\nNow, a person can walk up to a kiosk at over 4,000 locations across the Ukraine. Now, the country’s capital of Kiev can certainly be dubbed a “bitcoin hub” since you can now purchase cryptocurrency almost as easily as adding money to a bank debit card. It should be noted, however, that “bitcoin ATMs” are slightly different from “kiosks.”\n\n“This is probably a bit misleading as those are not bitcoin ATMs in the way we understand it, those are other crypto cash services,” explained Vlad, the owner of CoinATMradar. “However, those are very similar in functions to bitcoin ATMs, that\'s why I\'m adding them to the map. I\'m concentrating only on services which allow exchange of cash to bitcoin and bitcoin to cash directly.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“The ones added in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania are mostly payment terminals, which are used by some local Bitcoin company (1 in each country) in order to organize the process. So the terminals are not used purely for bitcoin, and they are not newly installed. E.g. the service in Ukraine is provided for more than a year already.”\n\nThere are two versions run by BTCU.biz: 24nonStop and diBox machines. There are over 7,400 24nonStop and over 5,000 iBox machines throughout the Ukraine, and the two machines work similarly for new Bitcoin transactions\n\nHow to buy\n\nWith 24nonStop machines, first enter your phone number. Then add the desired amount of money, but not less than 51 UAH (charge for use of terminal is 1% and the Ukrainian Hryvnia is currently worth about four cents in US Dollars). When you have completed your desired transaction amount, print and save the receipt. Then you take the receipt and go to the corporate website, btcu.biz.\n\nOnce there, select “Purchase,” then ""For cash in the terminal,” and enter the provided code from the receipt. Press the ""Pay"" button. Make sure that the code is accepted and the amount of money is equal to the one entered at the terminal.\n\nIf you want to get money to a bitcoin wallet: click on ""Add BTC-wallet,"" enter your wallet address and click ""Pay.” The coins will be automatically credited to the address you specify.\n\nFees are impressively large for Bitcoin transactions. Besides the 1% fee for the terminal use, the commission charge is approximately 17%, regardless of which machine you use. Maybe the upfront investment in outfitting all of these machines conveniently throughout the capital and the country is passed onto the consumer, initially.\n\nEastern Europe & Austria\n\nJust south of Ukraine is Romania, with over two thousand kiosks looking to fulfill your Bitcoin needs. The capital is Bucharest, with almost 2 million people, and over 500 Bitcoin locations to choose from. The company that controls this consumer exchange market is called ZebraPay, with over 1,500 locations across the country, and has been in service for the last year, starting with 800 locations.\n\nThe fees are reasonable, at 4%, and you will get your bitcoins almost immediately. The downside is these machines do not come with a QR scanner, so you will enter the address manually. They do offer address shortening at their corporate website if you have an account already @ zebrapay.ro.\n\nFurther south, your next Bitcoin-friendly country is Bulgaria, where there are now also over 2,000 Bitcoin kiosk locations. The capital is Sofia, in the west, with over 1.2 million inhabitants. There, you’ll find almost 500 Bitcoin locations to choose from, and another 2,000 locations, nationwide. These kiosks are run by CashTerminal, with over 630 locations, charging a more reasonable 1-3% per transaction.\n\nCommon places to find kiosks are at malls and public transit locations. Easy Pay is the largest Bitcoin provider in the country, with over 1,400 locations, and it works differently. You make your order through the website, crypto.bg, which will provide a 10-digit code to you. Then, go to their local location, which are manned by people who will process the transaction to your address in about 45 minutes, so it is similar to a Western Union transaction. Their charge is also 1-3%.\n\nEven Austria, in central Europe, is getting in on the Bitcoin wave, with over 650 locations, according to CoinATMRadar.com. The legendary capital of Vienna sports over 100 ATMs to serve 1.7 million people, and the service company’s name is Bitcoinbon. The company sells paper coupons at tobacco shops in denominations of 25, 50 and 100 Euros.\n\nThese coupons are good for up to 1 year, but obviously the value relative to a bitcoin is subject to change. You take the coupons to the company’s website, bitcoinbon.at, to redeem for bitcoins. The fee per transaction is well hidden on their site, but given the listed bitcoin price was lower than the going rate, assume the charge is about 3% at Bitcoinbon.\n\nA major step\n\nIt’s hard to see these developments in consumer access to bitcoin as anything but a huge positive for the global Bitcoin community. People commonly ask how do I get a bitcoin, and these options make getting your hands on bitcoin more convenient than ever before, at least in these four countries.\n\nOddly, while London has approximately only over a dozen bitcoin ATMs, according to CoinATMRadar, Kiev has thousands of locations where cryptocurrency can be acquired. Thus, it looks like one global “Bitcoin hub” had better seriously step up their Bitcoin consumer market game. Hopefully, international FinTech competition will replace military NATO insurgencies within Europe as the sport of choice for many years to come.', 'Q: What does Save the Children have in common with drug dealers and extortionists? A: They both accept bitcoin.\n\n(To be fair, they both accept cash, too)\n\nIt’s the dark web’s currency of choice: for drugs, blackmail and worse. Its exchange rate has been wildly volatile. Why then are aid agencies, child rights advocates and land activists getting their heads around Bitcoin?\n\nUnlike other tools for transferring digital value, there is no central database or authority. You also don’t need a credit card or even a bank account, giving Bitcoin interesting possibilities for deployment in the humanitarian world.\n\nThe blockchain technology behind Bitcoin, the “distributed ledger,” is attracting attention for three main reasons:\n\n1. As a way to transfer value, it can hugely improve what already exists\n\n2. It can do things previously considered too complicated or inefficient\n\n3. It has revolutionary potential for new ways of tackling big, complex problems across a range of industries, not only in finance\n\nAbout $900 million of venture capital has been invested in blockchain-related startups since 2012, even though few have significant revenue. A “killer app” has not yet emerged to fuel the uptake of the technology. Sceptics and enthusiasts alike say the current hype about blockchains often looks like a “solution looking for a problem”.\n\nWith or without Bitcoin, the blockchain is a “breakthrough in computer science” that will have as big an impact as personal computers or the invention of the internet itself, according to influential investor Marc Andreessen.\n\nAs law enforcement starts to tackle the Bitcoin phenomenon, pushing back its Wild West reputation, many banks have blockchain experiments under way; in September, nine major banks announced a joint venture, R3, to explore the technology further.\n\n“I don’t think anyone can ignore it,” a New York banking executive told IRIN.\n\nDespite recent focus on “innovation”, humanitarian organisations tend not to be early adopters of new technology.\n\nCriminals are.\n\nCatherine Haun, of the US Department of Justice, speaking at a blockchain conference in New York, said Bitcoin was no exception.\n\nWhile two users of a Bitcoin smartphone app can transfer the crypto-currency between themselves almost instantly, worldwide, the system also records every transaction in an indelible ledger spread throughout a vast network of users’ computers. This, as well as oversight of the on-ramps and off-ramps to real money, Haun said, gives law enforcement a rich trail to hunt for criminal transactions.\n\nBut what could the applications be for developing countries and humanitarian situations?\n\nRegulation\n\nOne problem is the limited vendors and money transfer operators that accept Bitcoin – even in the tech-friendliest of jurisdictions. The other is the long arm of counter-terrorism and money laundering legislation.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC) and CTF (Counter Terrorism Finance) regulations have already severely threatened other non-conventional money transfer operations, most notably the remittance companies servicing the Horn of Africa, which provide a link between cash, traditional banking and the hawala system of money transfer. Western banks have gradually dropped these money transfer operators as customers, fearing fines if funds flow to or from extremists, even where no failure of compliance has been proven, or even alleged.\n\nGiven the reach of US and other jurisdictions, any Bitcoin- or blockchain-based remittance operator would almost certainly come under the same regulation as banks and money transfer operators.\n\nEverything from houses in Tonga to handbags in Nigeria is already on sale for Bitcoin. In Kenya, another venture, BitPesa, has a three-way exchange running between Bitcoin, banks and the mobile money superstar, M-Pesa. Regulators and law enforcement worldwide will have to catch up, a working group of the Commonwealth grouping said in August. The group urged member states, many of whose economies receive significant income from remittances, to strike the right balance “to ensure they are addressing associated risks and avoid stifling innovation”.\n\nRemittances\n\nInternationally, the $500 billion remittance industry is an obvious possibility for the new technology. The percentages paid by migrant workers to send money home are punitive to the poor, as the Economist and World Bank agree.\n\nIf the middlemen could be squeezed or cut out entirely, a migrant worker in the Gulf could send money any time, without queuing up or paying a cut, and their hard-earned wages would reach home securely, almost in full.\n\nOne startup with ambitions to break into the remittance market is Abra, which last month announced $12 million in its latest funding round. Founder Bill Barhydt says Abra aims to be “an Uber for money” – and that people in 80 countries have expressed interest in being agents and vendors for the new system. These agents – themselves on-ramps and off-ramps – Barhydt says, will convert digital value into real cash at either end of the transfer.\n\nHumanitarian cash\n\nIn Nigeria, explains Alan Grundy, who works on emergency cash and voucher distribution for the International Rescue Committee, there are about 22 money transfer options, and nine mobile network operators. Getting cash for example into the areas of Nigeria where millions of people are displaced needs a complex set of contracts, interconnections and registrations.\n\nThe benefits of cash for humanitarian relief require significant legwork in criss-crossing regulatory, technical and interconnection issues. In countries with developed financial infrastructure, some aid agencies load value onto conventional debit cards that can be used in shops and businesses that take MasterCard or Visa, thereby avoiding national currency issues. In highly volatile situations, such as Ukraine, or places with limited telecommunications and banking, like South Sudan, the appeal of Bitcoin is greater, Grundy explains: “Banking doesn’t want to go there. Fine, I understand that… Remittances are unavailable because they need offices. I get that. Mobile money networks? OK, the cellphone coverage doesn’t get there… We have to look for a technological solution. Is blockchain the way to go? Maybe. It’s the only thing I’ve seen that’s an option.”\n\nThe next wave?\n\nSocial good initiatives, just like the financial industry, are on the hunt for the killer app for the blockchain. Emergency aid consortium Start Network is exploring a concept of “AidCoin” – a private implementation of the blockchain technology to transfer value in humanitarian settings. They are also looking into smart contracts. This is one of the hottest concepts in the blockchain ecosystem that broadly speaking are an automated transfer of value based on mutually-agreed conditions that can run on top of blockchain technology. In Honduras, a pilot programme is attempting to run a land registry on a blockchain [update: by late-2015 the project stalled], while multiple initiatives are testing concepts of blockchain-based identity registration, including for refugees. A South African firm is suggesting a system in which schools’ electricity meters could be topped up by wellwishers from anywhere using Bitcoin. Bitcoin donations to an NGO project in Kenya promise full transparency of the flow of cash all the way to the end user in real time. The list goes on.\n\nThe Bitcoin industry is eager to demonstrate its collective social responsibility too. Dawn Newton is COO of startup Netki. She points to the work of the BitGive Foundation as well as the convenient fundraising potential for non-profits. She admits it has an added advantage – the media do tend to latch onto the lurid stories. Some visible charitable activity might help an “image problem”, she said.\n\nbp/ag']"

The project is an industry first, allowing a POS terminal device to receive a digital currency payment. While bitcoin is most often used for ecommerce payments, the current Ingenico and BitPay project will make it possible to introduce bitcoin payments to retail merchants on a global scale.\n\nIngenico and BitPay presented a demo on the 6th of October as part of the Blockchain Week event, which is being held in Barcelona through the 8th of October. The bitcoin payment integration has been developed by BitPay and installed on an Ingenico terminal ICT250. Customers can pay using bitcoin in three simple steps. First, the merchant enters the amount of the order in his local currency. The device shows a QR code with the corresponding bitcoin amount, which the customer then scans to pay with his mobile phone.\n\n""At Ingenico our mission is to be at the forefront of any payment method and to provide secure transactions for both the merchant and the end customer,” said Miguel Angel Hernandez, Managing Director of Ingenico Iberia. “Participating in such an important project has allowed Ingenico Group to demonstrate its leadership in the payment space and bring a safe and secure payment method like virtual currency to the end user.""\n\n""We are excited to partner with Ingenico Group, one of the leading payment processors in both physical and online commerce,"" said BitPay Executive Chairman Tony Gallippi. ""This integration will help us expand bitcoin payments to thousands of retail payment terminals worldwide.""\n\nAbout Ingenico Group\n\nThe Group Ingenico (Euronext: FR0000125346 - ING), world leader in global payment systems, provides intelligent, secure and trusted solutions, enriching trade in all channels: store, online and mobile payments.

The company has raised over $32 million from top investors including Index Ventures, Founders Fund, and Sir Richard Branson.', ""The question of when bitcoin will become mainstream has been a constant debate. There are models that attempt to predict how bitcoin will reach this point, including Gartner's Hype Cycle and the Technology Adoption Lifecycle, as well as opinions from many world and industry leaders.\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) has a clear opinion, and has named some specific dates. The international organization was established in 1971, as a not-for-profit foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The WEF engages with a range of leaders and experts in several fields, including politics, business, academia. The goal is to improve the state of the world, and the the group recently released a report reflecting a range of views on future technological tipping points.\n\nTo gather data for this report, the WEF’s Global Agenda Council on the Future of Software and Society ran a Technological Tipping Points survey. A community of 816 executives and experts from the information and communications technology sector were asked for their views on 21 “tipping points,” which are defined as “moments when specific technological shifts hit mainstream society.” Answers ranging from “never” to “it has already happened” and “20+ years” were available, creating a realistic view of industry executives' perceptions of when these tipping points would occur.\n\nThe data shows that respondents feel the tipping point for the Internet of Things is in 2022, and driverless cars will take until 2026, Bitcoin and the blockchain came last on the chart, in 2027. While fewer respondents were confident about bitcoin, more of them were confident that governments would make use of the blockchain four years sooner, most likely collecting taxes via a blockchain of some sort.\n\nMainstream adoption of bitcoin, for this survey, is the point when 10% of Global gross Domestic Product (GDP) is “stored on blockchain technology.” 57.9% of respondents believe it will happen in 2025, with 20.4% of the respondents stating that it will never happen.\n\nThis compares to the 73.1% who believe that tax will be collected for the first time by governments via a blockchain in 2025, while only 12.3% believe that the government will never collect taxes via a blockchain.\n\n- WEF Survey report\n\nIn a recent conference hosted by the Commonwealth Virtual Currencies Working Group, aimed at investigating the benefits and risks of virtual currencies among Commonwealth nations, the Group found that bitcoin had potential benefits, including driving development, but adoption within the Commonwealth States has been slow.\n\nWith so many of our world leaders agreeing that Bitcoin is going to be a part of our future, but will take a long time until it gets here, the question of when it will cross into the mainstream is a constant topic of conversation throughout the financial and payments space.\n\nThe Gartner’s Hype Cycle is one of the most popular, and perhaps the best frame of reference for discussing and figuring out where bitcoin currently is on its path to becoming mainstream. It’s a simple chart where the US IT research and advisory firm, Gartner, suggests the typical path that all new technologies take on their ascension to mainstream usage, and generally proves to be accurate in most technology cases.\n\nThe latest Hype Cycle places cryptocurrencies at the edge of the phase called ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’, unchanged from the previous year.\n\nHowever, bitcoin’s circumstances are more closely related to the characteristics of the next phase, called ‘Trough of Disillusionment’ which Gartner defines as the stage where “interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver.” The characteristics of this phase are very similar to those bitcoin experiences, including receiving negative press, having supplier failures, and advanced rounds of venture capital (VC) funding\n\nThroughout most of 2014, and some of 2015, Bitcoin's ecosystem appears to have gone through all of the painful parts of the 'Trough of Disillusionment'\n\nBitcoin definitely has its share of negative press, the press has claimed “bitcoin has died” 74 times so far, and talking heads such as Paul Krugman still never miss an opportunity to bash bitcoin publicly.\n\n‘Supplier Consolidation and Failures’ has certainly been breached as well. Consider the bitcoin mining industry, which has had failure after failure from companies like GAW miners, Hashfast, Butterfly Labs, to name a few. Exchanges, such as MtGox, and even some of the smaller wallet providers have also had their failures, and each time Bitcoin has become stronger as participants learn from their mistakes.\n\n‘Second/Third Rounds of venture capital funding’ is also well on track, with several large Bitcoin companies, including Circle, Coinbase, and Bitfury all receiving their third round of VC funds. 2015 is also on track go down in history as the year the industry received its first US$1 Billion in VC funding.\n\nLast but not least, a recent report by Acquity Group, on Next Generation Commerce, finds that 3 percent of consumers would switch retailers if they accepted bitcoin or other digital currencies. This finding supports the fact that less than 5 percent has fully adopted bitcoin.\n\nAs bitcoin’s price plummeted after its peak in 2013, other major failures followed. The fall of MtGox, the Silk Road, and several mining companies had taken its toll on the price and enthusiasm of the community.\n\nIn 2015, the volatility in bitcoin’s price has greatly stabilized and investments into the space are approaching US$1 Billion, bitcoin’s price chart appears to have ended its downward trend, swinging up towards the ‘Slope of Enlightenment.’\n\nAccording to Gartner, once a technology has reached the 'Plateau of Productivity' stage, it is considered mature and mainstream adoption starts to take off.\n\nGartner expects cryptocurrencies to reach maturity in five to ten years, or between 2020 and 2025, which is marginally more optimistic than the WEF's respondents expectations, which predicted mass adoption happening in 2027.\n\nHowever, many good arguments exist in the bitcoin community for why bitcoin is further along in the cycle than Gartner predicts for cryptocurrencies.\n\nOne well-formed argument is from Simon Dingle, Luno former product designer. This speaker, advisor, broadcaster, and AlphaCode Club thought leader presented his findings on this matter at Bitcoin Africa 2015.\n\nThe event is a world-class Bitcoin conference attended by the South African Reserve Bank, the South African Treasury Department, the Financial Intelligence Agency, banks, entrepreneurs, investors and more. Dingle made the case that Bitcoin is already in the later stages of the ‘Trough of Disillusionment.’\n\n- Simon Dingle\n\nIt is easy for many in the community to see Dingle’s viewpoint, specifically because Bitcoin has barreled through the whole set of discouraging predictions on the downturn through the ‘Trough of Disillusionment.’ Still, Dingle’s chart doesn’t address the large obstacle in the way of further adoption that Bitcoin faces if he’s right: The Chasm.\n\nThe chasm in Moore’s work is a direct reference to the turning point in a Technology Adoption Lifecycle, which describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation on a Bell curve, and is often confused with the Gartner Hype Cycle.\n\nFor high-tech markets with disruptive innovations such as Bitcoin, there is a big difference in characteristics between ‘Early adopters’ and ‘Early majority’ participants, with the latter being much more conservative, risk-averse, and substantially more practical. This difference gives rise to a critical gap, called the 'chasm', which represents an adoption hurdle between the ‘Early Adopters’ phase and ‘Early Majority,’ or mainstream markets.\n\nThis theory was proposed by management expert Geoffrey A. Moore, who also wrote a book on the subject called 'Crossing the Chasm,' which sold more than 300,000 copies. According to the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, it took from inception in 2008 until early 2013 for Bitcoin adoption to transit from ‘Innovators’ to ‘Early Adopters.’\n\nAlthough the Gartner’s Hype Cycle and Moore’s Crossing the Chasm models are different, they can be used together to show a combined picture of market expectations, as well as expected technology adoption rate. The Hype Cycle was created to measure and predict expectations of new technologies, and is therefore only valid for the early stages of the Technology Adoption Lifecycle, including the chasm.\n\n- Kurt Shuler VP of marketing at Arteris\n\nThe idea that the Gartner’s Hype Cycle ends at the chasm is presented in more industries than just cryptocurrencies. Chris Nunes chairs the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) working group on Augmented Reality, and in his presentation at Augmented World Expo 2015 in Santa Clara, he showed that 90 percent of the Hype Cycle is before the chasm.\n\nShuler and Nunes agree that these two cycles work together for any emerging technology, and it would appear to be a good explanation of Bitcoin’s current position as well.\n\nWhen taken together, this body of evidence indicates that cryptocurrencies are either on their way across the chasm presently or are soon to cross, in less than the five to ten years that Gartner’s Hype Cycle suggests. Therefore, mainstream bitcoin adoption would inevitably be reached much sooner than the World Economic Forum survey predicted."", ""The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rose to $247.57 today, its highest total since 18th August.\n\nThe day's price movement began at roughly 12:20 UTC, but accelerated at 14:00 UTC when the price jumped from $243.01 to $246.15 over a 15-minute span.\n\nThe daily high was reached at 15:30 before prices began to edge downward.

This continued decline means the bitcoin network – which finds strength in its distributed design – is becoming less stable.\n\nThe post reads:\n\n""Bitcoin full nodes help preserve the health of the bitcoin network by validating blocks and transactions, and then serving those validated transactions to lightweight clients and other full nodes ... As lightweight clients currently make up a significant and growing part of the network, it’s essential that we help them maintain their high level of security – which means maintaining a critical mass of full nodes.""\n\nTo do this, 21 has partnered with the BitNodes project, created in 2013 by developer Addy Yeow to assess the health of the network by finding all its reachable nodes.\n\nAccording to the blog post, Yeow\'s index, which crawls the network every five minutes to tally up the number of functioning full nodes, will now be hosted by the firm ""in perpetuity"".\n\nIncentives\n\nUnlike miners, who earn freshly-minted bitcoins for their computing power, nodes receive no compensation: often, they are run by enthusiasts altruistically.\n\nTo counter this, Yeow created his own Bitnodes Incentive Program, which allows nodes to get a bitcoin reward. This weekly incentive increases as they join the network, for example with 5,000 or more it will be $10, and with 9,000 or more it will be $30.\n\nIt\'s not currently clear if the program is paying out, as it lists only 175 eligible nodes of the 5,974 on the network at press time, while the lowest parameter is 5,000. However 21 is promising to extend the scheme to buyers of its 21 Bitcoin Computer, its first consumer product which debuted two weeks ago to mixed reviews.\n\nThe blog post reads:\n\n""As a generalization of the Bitnodes incentive scheme, you will be mining more bitcoin on a 21 Bitcoin Computer if you run it in full node mode. Think of this as the extra BTC that you earn for being a good member of the Bitcoin community.""\n\nThe company says all its products will include full node functionality as standard, however it\'s unclear whether compensation for users of 21\'s computer is contingent on Bitnodes reaching a certain figure.\n\nBack in February, Yeow told CoinDesk he was funding the program himself. Whether 21 will now provide these rewards remains unclear.\n\nFoundation\'s exit\n\nUntil last month, the BitNodes project had received support from the Bitcoin Foundation, however director Bruce Fenton told CoinDesk its sponsorship was not renewed due to ""budget and focus considerations"".\n\nFollowing a messy and very public rethink last year – the ""lean"" organisation is now focused on core development, he said, as its upcoming DevCore workshop indicates.\n\nThough he expressed a wish for projects like BitNodes to be funded in a \'decentralised\' manner – ie companies supporting projects they like – he added:\n\n""A non-profit organisation can do some things that a for-profit organisation cannot and can sometimes help with convening power and neutrality.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It\'s a great opportunity to actually write the laws on these issues.""\n\nCovered entities include digital currency converters, exchanges, gateways, payment processors and ATMs, according to the draft, though three article subsections are reserved should additional sub-industries need to be considered before the bill\'s completion.\n\nThe current version suggests the ULC intends the final version of its bill to mirror draft regulation released by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors in September 2015, however, the ULC noted differences between the two sets of recommendations.\n\nFor example, the ULC draft document has included a provision that calls for states to enact ""onramp options"" for smaller startups, such as the conditional licensing established in New York by its BitLicense regulation enacted in June 2015.\n\nElsewhere, the ULC draft made clear it has yet to resolve its opinion on a number of issues, including the types of permissible investments digital currency firms can use as a means to hold corporate funds, and how such entities could appoint authorized delegates, or other businesses that perform money transmission services under another entity\'s license.\n\nAs with all of the provisions in the draft bill, the ULC may revisit deliberations on any issue included in the initial draft, with the goal of releasing the final recommendations in 2016.\n\nOnce submitted for approval, the ""Regulation of Virtual Currencies Act"" would then need to be approved by the ULC for an annual meeting, with a final vote taking place in which a majority of the 50 states approve the measure for enactment.\n\nReciprocal licensing\n\nPerhaps most notable among the ULC\'s proposals is a section on reciprocal licensing, which would allow digital currency businesses governed under the law to engage in services without going through the full licensing process in other states.\n\nSuch an agreement would require an unspecified fee, the completion of a license application form and a certification of license history by the applicant, but could potentially establish a framework for organizations that have obtained a BitLicense in New York to more easily become operational in other US states.\n\nThe measure could be viewed as positive for startups in the eyes of industry advocates, many of whom have been vocal about how the high costs of industry-specific licensing could effectively price startups out of operation should they be mirrored by other states.\n\nUnder the current bill, state commissioners who grant reciprocity and issue a license to a business would need to do so within 30 days, the draft law reads. As part of the arrangement, state commissioners would, the bill suggests, also be able to waive duplicate bonding, net worth and other capital mandates.\n\nInitial feedback from Santori and other industry veterans indicates that the draft repeats language often previously attacked as vague by technology proponents, suggesting that more cumbersome parts of the BitLicense and other existing model regulations could be cemented across the US should the current version be enacted.\n\n""As its drafted now, it\'s overly broad and brings in people with no business being regulated,"" Santori said. ""It repeats a lot of mistakes from the early BitLicense.""\n\nImpetus to act\n\nThe ULC release marks the end of a process began in late 2014, when the committee called for draft legislation to be prepared and released no later than July 2016.\n\nAt the time, the committee called for the ULC to expedite its draft regulation process citing the increasing number of brands and consumers seeking to engage in digital currency transactions, as well as actions by groups such as the Conference of State Bank Supervisors to issue similar guidance to state regulators.\n\nThe agency said its goal was to strike a ""balance between a law enacted in 53 jurisdictions but flexible enough not to frustrate innovation"".\n\n""Because virtual currencies do not enjoy comparable statutory or regulatory underpinnings to other payments systems, the states are under pressure to act,"" the group wrote.\n\nFurther highlighting the need for swift action, the group argued, was that California, New York, North Carolina, Kansas and Texas were already considering enacting regulatory schemes, which it suggested could be disparate in their composition.\n\nLawyers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

10/07/2015,"['Global movie and TV powerhouse Lionsgate Home Entertainment (NYSE:LGF) has announced that through its partnership with digital payments processor GoCoin, it is now accepting bitcoin payments at its online shop.\n\nLionsgateShop.com is the primary outlet for the companies DVDs and Blu-rays. The selection, although limited, includes hits like Hunger Games - MockingJay Part I, Divergent, John Wick, and box sets for Orange is the new Black, and Mad Men.\n\n- Michael Burns, Lionsgate Vice Chairman\n\nThe partnership was first announced in late April, at the convention InsideBitcoins New York, by GoCoin Founder and CEO Steve Beauregard. Bitcoin payments were enabled on the website today, along with a 25% off offer.\n\nLionsgate is the latest company in Hollywood taking a liking to bitcoin. This June the Bitcoin world was thrilled with the theatrical release of the film Dope, which was not only accepting bitcoin for movie tickets at its launch, but actually included bitcoins in the plot. A surprisingly good movie, Dope went on to gather rave reviews and the very fresh score of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n- Dope\n\nMovieTickets.com was the place to go for bitcoin fans, the site accepted the digital currency during the films promotion, and has continued doing so ever since. Using their service, which claims to be “the Largest Advance Movie Ticketing Platform in the World with 28,000 Screens,” anyone can now purchase movie tickets with bitcoin at “more than 900 screens in the US.”\n\nLionsgate, however, is a substantially bigger deal for bitcoin in Hollywood. For its home entertainment business, the Hollywood bedrock owns and distributes a library of approximately 16,000 motion picture titles and television programs. Lionsgate leads the industry with its box-office-to-home-entertainment conversion rate, of about 15% above that of the industry average in 2014.\n\nLionsgate\'s many businesses include motion picture production and distribution, television programming and syndication, home entertainment, digital distribution, news channel platforms, video games and international film distribution and sales.\n\nIn 2014, the company had approximately 7 percent of studio market share and reported revenue of US$2.4 billion for the fiscal year 2015.\n\n- Mr. Burns\n\nEven though Lionsgate is only offering a bitcoin payment option for LionsgateShop at this time, the company has many other distribution platforms that could integrate bitcoin payment options in the future.“Lionsgate is also continuing to explore additional opportunities to integrate bitcoins and its underlying blockchain technology into its merchandising and sales activities,” a company press release stated.\n\nPayments partner GoCoin has made it their mission to allow merchants to accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin payments, charging only 1% in fees. The company has been focused on serving the entertainment and gaming industry, being the first e-commerce payment solution to process digital currencies for industries where traditional payment networks are considered high risk.\n\n- Steve Beauregard, GoCoin Founder and Chief Executive Officer\n\nToday, GoCoin has approximately 11,000 merchants and processes roughly 100,000 monthly transactions across three different blockchains.

Over the past 10 years, the company’s television programming has won 25 Emmy Awards, earned 161 nominations, and has been nominated and won numerous Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Thier most recent popular series include the hit series Orange is the New Black, Nashville, The Wendy Williams Show, Manhattan, The Royals as well as the multiple Emmy Award-winning drama Mad Men.\n\nWith its fingers in so many customer-facing pies, it’s hard to think of a better company to champion Bitcoin use throughout their organization in terms of helping speed up adoption.', 'Like most emerging technologies, bitcoin exists in a gap between what could be possible should the technology mature and its abilities today.\n\nFor instance, there may be no older and bigger \'buried treasure\' use case for bitcoin than its ability to serve as a protocol for micropayments. Compared to credit cards and PayPal, the latter of which defines a micropayment as less than roughly $5, bitcoin is divisible into 100 million smaller units called Satoshis, valued at $0.000002 at today\'s price levels.\n\nProponents have long theorized that this divisibility, coupled with a wider adoption of bitcoin, could create conditions under which all manner of digital media, now largely subsidized by advertising and events, might be paid for through bitcoin micropayments.\n\nEstimates seeking to quantify the size of this untapped market are so far scarce, though Wedbush Securities has forecasted bitcoin micropayments could be a $925bn market by 2025. ""Previously impractical, electronic payments of <$1 could broadly change content monetization on the web, possibly supplanting ads,"" a July report theorized.\n\nHowever, despite this promise, the network today can\'t send satoshis at an affordable price.\n\n""The first day you read the [Bitcoin white] paper, you\'re like \'Oh amazing micropayments,\' then you realize it doesn\'t work at all,"" developer Thaddeus Dryja told CoinDesk.\n\nUsers who want to send one-tenth of a cent ($0.001 US dollar or 400 Satoshis) through the bitcoin network, for example, can\'t do so. Today, the minimum output size is 5,430 Satoshis, or about 1.3 cents, which would incur a mining fee of 2 or 3 cents.\n\n""Your fee is 200%+ of your actual payment,"" Dryja noted.\n\nStill, Dryja is one of the developers seeking to bring about a future where bitcoin\'s technology can fulfill its promise. As the co-creator of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, first proposed in February, Dryja and Joseph Poon kickstarted a conversation about how bitcoin\'s technology could be upgraded with payment channels.\n\nIn its simplest form, a payment channel would allow a user to send a certain amount of bitcoin, say $10, to a multisig wallet controlled by two parties. The channel is represented on the blockchain, and an initial funding balance is established. Balances would then adjust between parties as they transact and bitcoin\'s nLockTime parameter would ensure that before a specified time, balances could not be entered into a block.\n\nThe developers argue that this system replicates many positive benefits of bitcoin – finalizing transactions against the ledger without requiring a trusted third party, while allowing the majority of such exchanges to take place off of the main blockchain, which currently capped at 1MB of data per block.\n\nThe Lightning team isn\'t the only group of developers working to propose how payments channels would work on the blockchain, however. A similar proposal was put forth by researchers are the Distributed Computing Group of ETH Zurich in a September white paper on Duplex Micropayment Channels (DMC).\n\nBoth proposals have come to be viewed as ones that could scale the bitcoin network for if and when user demand increases in line with speculation, keeping the size of bitcoin\'s blocks lower and limiting the size of the bitcoin blockchain so nodes can store full versions more efficiently.\n\nLightning development progresses\n\nAs the earliest and most prominent iteration of this idea, Lightning is now supported in part by Blockstream, a startup that raised $21m in funding in late 2014 for its signature sidechains project, which seeks to enable interoperability between blockchains.\n\nBlockstream core tech engineer Rusty Russell, who joined the company in March, is now working full time on the Lightning network. Unaffiliated with the startup or its funding, Dryja and Poon are currently seeking to develop a formal business entity around the project.\n\nIn interview, Dryja and Poon suggested that, despite assertions project development could take years, Lightning could take as little as six months to be ready for launch.\n\nBoth stressed they are seeking for Lightning to be decentralized, and that this is the primary complicating factor in terms of rollout.\n\n""What is really taking up time and why we have to do it right is you have to make it so that it\'s open access in order to participate and that it\'s easy to participate across the spectrum of how you want to participate,"" Poon said, adding:\n\n""It can\'t be a system that centralizes, Lightning needs to exist in such a way that everyone can participate and run a node.""\n\nIn practice, that means crafting the rules for how two parties can transact in the system, overcoming adjustments that need to be made to the protocol and establishing how data moves between parties.\n\nFirst in its order of challenges is create a system of two-hop payments, whereby two users can establish recurring payments within a channel, and these communications can pass through one or more additional intermediary nodes.\n\n""That\'s the minimal case where this is starting to be the Lightning,"" Poon continued.\n\nThe parties then need to be able to prove to each other that a transaction occurred, within a certain period of time. Further, either party will need to settle terms, with penalties coded to ensure that contracts are followed, without such communications being interrupted by intermediaries.\n\nThis is a challenge as data needed to process the payments would route through an unknown node operator.\n\n""Let\'s say you wanted to pay for an article, you would be connected to some random node on the network. They\'d be connected to someone else and then it routes through random computers on the Internet,"" Poon explained.\n\nVersions of Lightning are currently being created in C, Java, Go and Python, and according to developers, code is operational.\n\n""Right now people are kicking the tires, in terms of user testing and having spending between each other,"" Dryja said, adding that such experimentation is ongoing on Testnet3, an alternative blockchain that replicates network conditions without using real bitcoins.\n\nLarger network improvements\n\nOne speed bump to the Lightning vision is that soft forks are required for it to be implemented. Less stringent than a hard fork, such as would be required with an increase to the blocksize, soft forks only require a majority of miners upgrade their software to comply with new rules.\n\nIn his April evaluation of the white paper, Russell noted soft forks would be required to protect against transaction malleability issues and allow new signature modes. Additionally, he noted that a rating system would need to be devised for Lightning nodes, wallets would need to be made interoperable with the network and a server implementation would have to be created.\n\nTransaction malleability, the process by which transactions can be altered before entering a block of data on the blockchain, is also an issue, though one the team is confident will be solved by the development community.\n\n""You could build Lightning today, but what happens is that funds could be held up by one of the parties and locking up funds is not sufficient. It creates a hostage scenario. You want to minimize trust in the system,"" Poon said.\n\nAdditional updates could be made to bitcoin\'s scripting language to circumvent a malleability fix. Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs), which would allow payments to be routed across untrusted parties, yet only be executed when the recipient provides a unique hash to the sender, need proposed updates such as CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.\n\nAfter the soft forks are updated (a process they said should be ""measured in months""), the team suggested wallets providers would need to perform updates necessary for Lightning to be used, a process they acknowledged could take longer.\n\nBoth suggested a routing protocol that would govern how nodes process information would also take significant development effort.\n\nDMC emerges\n\nElsewhere, in Europe, the Duplex payment system is working toward similar goals. ETH Zurich\'s Christian Decker and Professor Roger Wattenhofer, best known for research on the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, proposed DMC in September to lesser fanfare than Lightning.\n\nDecker sees Lightning and DMC as the first proposals that would allow ""secure off-blockchain routed payments"", though there are differences in each approach. A core variation, Decker said, is that while Lightning requires that private keys be exchanged to change a state of the contract, DMC uses decreasing timelocks.\n\nIn essence, DMC proposes that payment channel agreements can be updated by changing the time at which they are scheduled to be committed to the blockchain, rather than exchanging private keys to invalidate transactions.\n\n""Transactions representing a later state simply have smaller timelocks that allow them to be valid before the old state is valid,"" he explained.\n\nDecker argues that this would allow DMC to be more easily audited. ""This is a core difference to Lightning where the components are tightly coupled and are not usable individually,"" he said.\n\nLike Lightning, DMC would also require a malleability fix to be implemented. Decker has also submitted a bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP), currently in draft, that would allow unsigned transactions to be built upon with subsequent updates.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the implementation is currently moving forward and will be open sourced when a working proof-of-concept has been developed.\n\nOff-blockchain micropayments\n\nBoth projects stand in contrast to other methods that micropayments are being made possible today. For example, tipping platform ChangeTip conducts its bitcoin tipping off-chain, while social network ZapChain uses BlockCypher to dynamically insert small transactions.\n\nMore top secret and potentially more impactful is a project in the works at bitcoin startup 21 Inc, which has so far raised the most VC funding in the industry.\n\nIn November, 21 announced it would release a ""Bitcoin Computer"" that aims to provide small amounts of bitcoin to users continuously through an embedded mining chip. As expressed in the company\'s communications, the miner is not meant to be speculative, but to encourage developers to create apps and inventions that need bitcoin to operate.\n\n""Specifically, we want to make it possible for you to turn your bright idea into passive income by selling bitcoin\xad-payable goods, games and services over the Internet through a 21 Bitcoin Computer,"" CEO Balaji Srinivasan wrote at the time of the product\'s unveiling.\n\nKey to its functionality is a built-in ""21 micropayments server"", a feature whose impact Srinivasan hinted at on Twitter.\n\n.@derosetech @manan19 @StartupLJackson The goal: flick on a new paid internet service like you turn on a new lightbulb. No ads, no signup. — Balaji S. Srinivasan (@balajis) September 22, 2015\n\nHow exactly such microtransactions would interact with the blockchain is unclear, though such transactions may take place off-chain, or within 21 Inc\'s ecosystem, only to be applied to the blockchain later. Both Poon and Dryja said they had not been contacted so far by the company.\n\nRegardless of 21\'s ambitions, however, both developers suggested they believe improvements to bitcoin\'s core technology are needed.\n\n""Most people, not super technical people, think bitcoin already does this stuff. In 2013, there was a lot of press, people were saying zero-fee, free transactions, micropayments. Bitcoin doesn\'t really do that,"" Dryja said, concluding:\n\n""A lot of people thought you can do a lot of things with bitcoin and we need to deliver on that.""\n\nServer images via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If you broke the rules, you'd have all kinds of things done to you.'\n\nForrest said she was 'blown away in fury' at the 'breathtakingly irresponsible' Internet postings of a doctor who advised customers on Silk Road about the effects of various drugs.\n\nProsecutors cited at least five deaths traced to overdoses from drugs bought on Silk Road, and two parents who each lost a child spoke in court.\n\nBefore the sentence was announced, a sniffling and apologetic Ulbricht told Forrest he's a changed man who is not greedy or vain by nature.\n\n'I've essentially ruined my life and broken the hearts of every member of my family and my closest friends,' he said. 'I'm not a self-centered sociopathic person that was trying to express some inner badness. I do love freedom. It's been devastating to lose it.'\n\nHis hands folded before him, Ulbricht was stoic as the sentence was announced. As he left the courtroom, he carried with him photographs of those who died as a result of drugs purchased on Silk Road.\n\nSerrin Turner, a prosecutor, had sought a lengthy prison sentence above the 20 year mininum. While he acknowledged Ulbricht's politics might have factored into his motivations, Turner said 'he did not do it for idealistic motive,' but to make money.\n\n'This was not some disinterested do-gooder,' he said. 'What he did was allow anyone anywhere in the world to obtain any drug they wanted as long as they had a computer and shipping address.\n\n'If he wanted to pursue a political agenda, he could have done so through the political process.'\n\nSilk Road operated for more than two years, allowing users to anonymously buy drugs and other illicit goods and generating over $214 million in sales in the process, prosecutors said.\n\nThe online virtual currency allows people to trade goods and services anonymously\n\nThe online black market was shutdown in October 2013, when authorities seized the website and arrested Ulbricht at a San Francisco website.\n\nProsecutors said Ulbricht operated the website under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, a reference to a character in the 1987 movie 'The Princess Bride.'\n\nThe website relied on the Tor network, which lets users communicate anonymously, and accepted bitcoin as payment, which prosecutors said allowed users to conceal their identities and locations.\n\nProsecutors said Ulbricht, who grew up in Austin, Texas, took extreme steps to protect Silk Road, soliciting the murders of several people who posed a threat. No evidence exists the murders were carried out.\n\nAt trial, Joshua Dratel, his lawyer, said Ulbricht had indeed created what he intended as a 'freewheeling, free market site' where all but a few harmful items could be sold."", 'MasterCard has been feeling the heat of Bitcoin for over a year now. Bitcoin has become big enough worldwide so that it can no longer be ignored as a viable payment option and currency. In a state-of-the-business interview with the International Business Times, Ann Cairns, president of international markets for MasterCard was asked directly about Bitcoin and how it compares to MasterCard.\n\nMasterCard is feeling the pressure from Bitcoin’s innovations\n\nMasterCard and their executives have been thinking long and hard about Bitcoin for over a year now since it became a major economic force in Australia. Last year, Australia had as much as 7% of the world’s Bitcoin market under consumer control, and the Senate was considering making legal accommodations to the digital currency. That’s when MasterCard attacked.\n\nThey launched an aggressive lobbying campaign directly with the Senate against Bitcoin and its unregulated nature. MasterCard also crafted an explainer video, designed to tear its image down. With a coordinated banking effort to thwart Bitcoin exchanges by closing associated banking accounts for the industry last month, the Bitcoin wave of support seems to be subsiding, but MasterCard definitely felt threatened.\n\nCairns:\n\n""Bitcoin in its current incarnation is slow in the sense of being able to do a transaction and have it properly authenticated, which can take quite a few minutes. It doesn\'t really work in today\'s fast-paced shopping environment; even more so in train stations and so on when you have got millions of people trying to go through turn-styles – there you need real-time, instantaneous authentication, and delivery.”\n\nCommercial banking and merchant payment interests like MasterCard have a major problem with the cryptocurrency’s lack of regulation. MasterCard doesn’t want to get steamrolled by its decentralized nature like newspapers did versus the Internet.\n\n“I don\'t see that the world\'s financial systems will allow that to continue unregulated. It would be difficult for economies to run themselves if that was the case,” Cairns continues. “In terms of regulation, in terms of law and order, in terms of the way people run their economy on any massive scale - Bitcoin will have to evolve and change in order to have massive global adoption.”\n\nOne clear advantage Bitcoin has over traditional card payment systems is the matter of consumer identity theft. In the U.S., credit card fraud is on the rise, too. About 31.8 million U.S. consumers had their credit cards breached in 2014, more than three times the number affected in 2013. That doesn’t include debit card fraud statistics. Many traditional payment programs still use unencrypted, insecure programs like email.\n\n""If you do a transaction over email it\'s not very secure. It\'s un-encrypted, it goes out into the ether sort of free and people can read it and so on, which is becoming quite a big issue now for many people,” states Cairns.\n\nWith Bitcoin, a consumer’s identity is never tied to each transaction, like a card purchase, creating a huge safety net. MasterCard is working on improving their consumer protections and is even beginning to use encrypted technologies that Bitcoin has used since its inception to protect consumer information, starting with MDES, or MasterCard Digital Enablement Services. This retains your 16 digit card credentials in a container and sends an encrypted version of them instead.\n\nShe sounds like she’s talking about Bitcoin in describing this system’s use in the marketplace.\n\n""Once that starts to be used ubiquitously that will be a very simple and easy thing to do. At this stage, it\'s just starting to happen; the banks are starting to adopt it, the merchants are starting to adopt it,” said Cairns.\n\nECG monitoring? Is this what’s needed to have secure card purchases?\n\nIn order to protect traditional payment systems, MasterCard and other merchant services providers are left to take more, not less, consumer information, including biometrics.\n\nMany smartphones now use fingerprint scans, but where those scans end up being stored and protected is most likely a centralized server that may be compromised. MasterCard Identity Check takes selfies of consumers to authenticate transactions. Cairns also mentions the Nymia wristband, measuring the users’ heart and ECG to authenticate use by constant user surveillance.\n\n""With this persistent authentication you don\'t even have to do anything, you have got this wrist band on and when you make a payment you can just communicate with a terminal or something and say that\'s me,” says Cairns, clearly impressed by the innovative use of biometric technology.\n\nIt seems a consumer’s personal information dispensed into the global ether is not being reduced but increased to protect merchant account systems like MasterCard from fraud liability. Bitcoin is not perfect, but it certainly has that part right. It sounds like desperate companies do desperate things to keep you secure. Somehow, the level of card user security will be directly tied to how much more personal information the user provides to make that happen.\n\nDoes that make you feel more secure? Data breaches are going global, and card companies now want your fingerprints, pictures, phone information, and now ECG monitoring, for your own good?\n\nYou know what they about teaching an old dog new tricks. The trick seems to be on the consumer and their personal information being sacred. MasterCard has some unproven security ideas, but for everything else, there’s Bitcoin.', 'NeuCoin (NEU), a cryptocurrency specifically designed to aid the implementation of online microtransactions and tipping within online products and services, finally launched September 23.\n\nThe event was followed by co-founders Daniel Kaufman and Johan Sandstrom holding an open Q&A with the Bitcoin community via Skype. Kaufman and Sandstrom believe that Bitcoin will remain the major cryptocurrency in mainstream use, but that there is nonetheless room for altcoins that successfully target specific practical niches.\n\nTaking part in the Q&A session was Bitcoin expert Tone Vays, Head of Research at BraveNewCoin. In response to his question as to whether NeuCoin’s founders want to see Bitcoin become irrelevant and for everyone to use NeuCoin instead, Kaufman said:\n\n“We believe that NEU will have more consumers using it than BTC within one year.”\n\nWhile the reception to the launch was generally positive, Kaufman and Sandstrom went on to address skeptics, explaining the reasoning behind issues such as the presale of the coin, how its price was going to be supported, who the first investors were and how ordinary users could get involved.\n\n“[A] small amount of NEU [will be released] as “freemium” to get consumers outside of crypto to try it out,” Sandstrom explained.\n\n“Imagine...a random guy who knows nothing about crypto happens to win some NeuCoins by playing a Facebook game,” he continued. “One click later and he\'s on MyNeuCoin ... one more click and his coins are ‘growing.’ Then he uses a few coins in another game to buy a power-up. A lot better than paying US$5 with iTunes! Next he challenges his friend to the game, and they both get coins.”\n\nFoundations to support\n\nNeuCoin’s development and projects to increase the coin’s utility is handled by three independent non-profit foundations (the so-called Code, Growth and Utility foundations) based on the Isle of Man. The foundations were created with the objective of making support for the cryptocurrency decentralized.\n\nAccording to official NeuCoin summary: “The foundations are overseen by independent Council Members and Advisors, but are ultimately controlled by coin holders (1 coin = 1 vote). This structure makes NeuCoin more decentralized and accountable than Bitcoin, Ripple or Stellar.""\n\nIn light of the launch, various services will continue to be developped and new developers brought on board. Kaufman continued:\n\n“We are going after third party game developers. Anyone who develops a service that makes NeuCoin more useful can get rewarded by NeuCoin utility foundation.”\n\nNeuCoin already sold 200 million coins to angel investors in 2014. In April 2015, coins were also exchanged for bitcoin to future users at the rate of 25,000 NeuCoin for 1 bitcoin. In total, team, angel investors and users who exchanged bitcoins for NeuCoins have given the NeuCoin Project a capital of US$2.25 million and 4,012 bitcoin.\n\nTo make NeuCoin a stable and secured currency, team and angel investors have committed themselves to respect strict conditions for resale of coins. Terms of re-sales are strictly limited to a period of 5 years (for example, NeuCoin owners will be able to sell only 2% of its coins a month during the first year, and 6% on the sixth year).\n\nThese limitations also mean that team and angel investors are tied to the currency for a long time and are interested in the growth of the market value of the coins over the years.\n\nAccording to Sandstrom:\n\n“Foundation coin holdings are projected to peak around year five, then decline slowly and ultimately stabilize at under 5 percent of the total supply. By year three they will no longer own a majority if the coins, and by year 10 they will own less than 5 percent of the coin supply.”\n\nDecentralized Shares\n\nThe fact that team and angel investors can not sell their coins easily in the first 5 years period should help to avoid many problems that many other altcoins have faced – sometimes large investors simply liquidated their coins resulting in the so-called pump-n-dump and the ultimate demise of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, Kaufman explained that “nobody has any control over the price of NeuCoin after it starts trading.”\n\nDuring the exchange with NeuCoin’s founders Bitcoin expert and Bits.media founder Ivan Tikhonov reiterated that almost every other cryptocurrency whose owners promised a guaranteed starting price and attempted to support it through public trading ultimately failed to uphold the stated price.\n\nKaufman rebutted that while other coins had promised a guaranteed starting price and failed to uphold it, NeuCoin was not promising to set a price or support a floor. Like any coin traded freely on exchanges, he said, the market will determine the ultimate value.\n\nUnfortunately, NeuCoin’s technical developer didn’t take part in the conversation. The question about the technical aspects of NeuCoin from Bytecoin core developer Joseph Lin went unanswered. For example, it’s still not clear how does NeuCoins\' protocol deal with all questionable features that PoS has or how NeuCoins\' model neglects the fact that an attacker, who owns several % of stake now, can inhibit growth of valid blockchain.\n\nHave you tried Neucoin? Do you think it has a future in the crypto space? Please share your thoughts below.', ""For the past several days*, the Bitcoin network has been plagued by a so-called “transaction malleability attack.” Bitcoin users have experienced a number of annoyances, causing confusion and frustration. And while the transaction malleability issue is well-known and has plagued the Bitcoin network before, to many it is still unclear what it is, why it is a problem, who is causing the attack right now, and what can be done about it.\n\n*According to the claimed attacker (see below), the attack is currently paused at the time of writing, but could and probably will be continued at any time.\n\nWhat is transaction malleability?\n\nIn order to understand the transaction malleability attack, it helps to first understand the basics of how Bitcoin transactions work. In simplified form, each transaction over the Bitcoin network consists of different types of data. This includes transaction inputs (refering to the addresses bitcoin come from), transaction outputs (refering to the addresses bitcoin are sent to), the amount of bitcoin sent, and more. All of this data is cryptographically signed, combined, and scrambled (“hashed”) into a unique and smaller piece of data: a hash. This hash is essentially the transaction ID. If a miner confirms the transaction, the transaction ID is included in a block and stored in the blockchain.\n\nThe problem that enables transaction malleability, however, is that effectively identical signatures can result in completely different hashes. The specifics of this are deeply cryptographic, and are very hard – if not impossible – to explain in plain English. But as one extremely simplified example to get an idea of the problem, a comparison would be that the numbers “145” and “0145” are effectively the same number in many cases. But when hashed, “145” and “0145” might actually produce completely different results.\n\nIn the case of the ongoing transaction malleability attack, the attacker picks transactions from the Bitcoin network, and tweaks signature data. As a result, all sorts of transactions have two completely different transaction IDs circulating on the Bitcoin network. And since a specific transaction can confirm only once, just one of the transaction IDs will be included in a block, while the other will be ignored.\n\nAre transaction malleability attacks a problem?\n\nThe essence of the transaction malleability problem arises when someone uses the transaction ID – and nothing but the transaction ID – to check whether a transaction has been included in a block. This is a problem, of course, because the transaction ID may have been changed by the attacker, and his new transaction ID could have been included in the block rather than the original transaction ID. It might then seem as if the transaction itself never went through – though it effectively did.\n\nThis can be problematic for several reasons.\n\nFor one, it complicates writing wallet software. This is a problem in particular for Bitcoin companies that use their own software, which several of the bigger businesses in the space do.\n\nThe best-known and most infamous example of such a company would be Mt. Gox, the world's first bitcoin exchange that spectacularly failed in 2014 as it claimed to have lost most of its customers’ funds. Mt. Gox claimed it lost this money because it fell victim to a long-lasting malleability attack, which messed up its bookkeeping. With it seeming as if transactions never confirmed, users are said to have been able to withdraw more bitcoin than they owned. Whether this is really why Mt. Gox lost so much of its customers bitcoin remains unclear, but it could – at least theoretically – be true.\n\nThis is an extreme example, as Mt. Gox asserts to have automatically re-sent bitcoin merely based on the transaction IDs – not a smart thing to do. But transaction malleability could complicate matters for Bitcoin companies with a more sensible payout policy, too. If they, like Mt. Gox, run software that keeps track of transaction IDs for bookkeeping, the transaction malleability attack could severely damage their records. Even if they do not automatically resend transactions, and, as such, don’t lose any, it’s still a nuisance.\n\nA less urgent but potentially bigger problem is that transaction malleability impedes on chained transactions. Chained transactions are transactions that use an unconfirmed output as its own input, or in other words: They spend bitcoin balances that have not been confirmed yet. But if they spend transactions of which the transaction IDs are changed, they – and all subsequent chained transactions – become invalid all at once.\n\nChained transactions come in a lot of shapes and forms. The most common might be bitcoin spent from change addresses. But chain transactions also form the basis of more fancy bitcoin use cases, such as payment channels. Indeed, the transaction malleability issue is one of the reasons advanced scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network are not quite ready to be deployed yet.\n\nIt bears noting, however, that transaction malleability is no existential problem for Bitcoin. Only the transactions IDs can be changed, not the transactions themselves; no one can steal funds from anyone else, and no one can reverse or block transactions. Moreover, the current transaction malleability attack doesn’t really make the deeper problems with transaction malleability worse. These risks would have existed with or without the current attack.\n\nWhy is the Bitcoin network being attacked?\n\nA short answer would be that it's hard to know for sure, as it is hard to determine who is carrying out the attack – let alone why.\n\nBitcointalk.org user “amaclin,” however, has claimed to be behind the attack. Amaclin, who is probably Russian (or at least speaks Russian), announced his involvement in the malleability attack shortly after it was first noticed on October 1.\n\nAmaclin says he has carried out the attack, essentially, out of boredom. Additionally, amaclin argues that Bitcoin is fundamentally broken. He specifically points out that the incentive structures of Bitcoin’s development process do not align well, as users are not incentivized to reward developers for their work building and maintaining Bitcoin. By attacking the network, amaclin believes he is revealing that only a small number of developers can fix the issue, while most Bitcoin users expect them to do so for free. That is an unsustainable proposition, amaclin says.\n\nAmaclin claims that he is not attacking the network in order to gain financially in any way. He also denies attacking any specific business in order to defraud them or otherwise. He has, however, posted two donation addresses in his forum signature: One is labeled a vote for the attack, while the other is labeled a vote against. At the time of writing, both addresses have had one transaction sent to them, adding up to 300 bits, worth less than 10 cents in total.\n\nWhether amaclin is telling the truth is hard to verify. But the fact that he could be telling the truth, the fact that a networkwide attack on the Bitcoin network could be carried out by a bored individual with some coding skills, is probably quite telling in itself.\n\nCan the problem be solved?\n\nThe good news is that the transaction malleability issue could likely be solved eventually. BIP 62 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 62) in particular is intended to prevent malleability attacks by narrowing down the types of data that can be included in Bitcoin transactions. BIP 62 could be implemented as a soft fork, which means that it would then be up to miners to adopt the changes.\n\nThe bad news is that the issue is still pretty far from actually being solved. The transaction malleability problem is quite complicated, and some solutions might create other – even bigger – problems for the Bitcoin network. BIP 62 currently is still in draft stage, and not ready to be implemented in Bitcoin Core yet. Moreover, it is far from clear that BIP 62 does or even can tackle all possible malleability issues. It is possible that additional exploits have not yet been found, and have, therefore, not yet been countered by proposals included in BIP 62.\n\nWhile fixing the malleability issue is widely considered to be a problem that needs solving, it might take a while before a definite solution is ready – if one ever is. For the foreseeable future, wallet software will have to tackle the problem using workarounds.\n\nThanks to Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd and Bitonic CEO Jouke Hofman for providing feedback."", 'Just last week, distributed ledger startup R3CEV triggered a wave of excitement when it announced an additional 13 banks had joined its project to bring blockchain technology to Wall Street.\n\nWith a total of 22 banking partners, R3CEV\'s announcement is the latest sign that blockchain technology is enjoying increasing popularity among the world\'s biggest banks – some of which had gone public with their interest in it in the past – but the truth is that blockchain technology seems to have everyone talking.\n\nWho\'s said what and why? CoinDesk has rounded up some of the most interesting crypto-related comments made by figures from the world of finance.\n\n1. Jamie Dimon\n\nJamie Dimon, the chairman and president of JP Morgan Chase reportedly worth $1.1bn, is notorious for his skeptical comments about bitcoin made during an interview with CNBC\'s Andrew Ross Sorkin, during which he told the reporter that the digital currency was ""a terrible store of value"" that could be replicated ""over and over"".\n\nIn April this year, Dimon spoke about bitcoin again, commenting on the digital currency in his annual letter to JP Morgan shareholders:\n\n""You all have read about bitcoin, merchants building their own networks, PayPal and PayPal look-alikes. Payments are a critical business for us – and we are quite good at it. But there is much for us to learn in terms of real-time systems, better encryption techniques and a reduction of costs and \'pain points\' for customers.""\n\nMore recently, the financial bigwig spoke about bitcoin and its underlying distributed ledger during a 40-minute question-and-answer session at the Barclays Global Finance Services Conference.\n\nDuring his talk, Dimon alluded to the fact that blockchain technology was enjoying increasing attention from many of the world\'s banks. He said: ""We have a study group on this whole thing. I think most of the banks do at this point.""\n\n2. Blythe Masters\n\n\n\nBlythe Masters, a former JP Morgan senior executive – who famously swapped Wall Street for a crypto startup earlier this year – has spoken about the potential of blockchain technology on various occasions.\n\nMasters, credited with creating the credit default swap, said she had been initially surprised by the way in which blockchain technology could potentially solve many of the issues currently plaguing the financial system at Consensus 2015 – CoinDesk\'s inaugural conference, held in New York.\n\nEarlier in the year, Masters spoke at the Exponential Finance Conference and said:\n\n""Distributed ledger technology does have the potential to be disruptive of certain business models. But it has at least as much potential to be enormously empowering of existing business models in terms of making them lower cost, more efficient and less risky.""\n\n3. Mariano Belinky\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, back in April, the managing director at Santander InnoVentures – the megabank\'s venture capital fund – shared his his opinion on cryptocurrency technology and commented on why he thought consumer adoption did not currently matter.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Belinky emphasised the potential of bitcoin\'s underlying distributed ledger:\n\n""We shouldn\'t be focused on the adoption of a digital currency. The underlying technology is a powerful one and I think that we will see adoption of that technology much sooner.""\n\nFollowing this, Belinky told Business Insider that the bank had identified 20 to 25 use cases where blockchain technology could be applied.\n\n4. Debra Brackeen\n\nThe global head at Citi\'s Innovation Center also discussed bitcoin and its underlying technology during her session at Consensus 2015, noting that there had been a transition from speaking about the digital currency to now focusing on blockchain technology.\n\nShe said:\n\n""I don\'t know whether I would agree that banks have been quick to engage. If the world is moving faster than you, then that\'s a big disadvantage. I think there is a general trend, specifically about blockchain. I think there is every reason for financial institutions and banks to be looking at this [blockchain technology].""\n\n5. Alex Batlin\n\nSwiss investment bank UBS surprised many earlier this year when it announced plans to open a blockchain research lab in London\'s Canary Wharf district.\n\nAlex Batlin, the former engineer heading up UBS\' London-based blockchain innovation lab, told CoinDesk:\n\n""In principle it\'s [blockchain technology] probably one of the biggest confluences of technology and business right now.""\n\nBusiness people image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In this context, value does not necessarily equate to price. The price of Bitcoin in terms of its relative value to other currencies can and will fluctuate, but in the long term its real value will be determined by how many people perceive it as being useful for exchanging goods and services. That perception of value has been given a couple of huge boosts in the last few months by the launches of several hardware wallets.\n\nWhen you break it down, there are two things that give a currency, any currency, value. The first is trust. Those using a currency have to have a way of storing and transacting with it that they believe is relatively secure, and they have to believe that others feel the same way and will accept it as payment. In addition they must have faith that the currency will retain its value in terms of the goods and services it will buy.\n\nThe second is what economists call the network effect. In other words, the idea that others use the same token for exchange, and the more any given token is used, the more value it has. This concept and how it applies to Bitcoin is explained well in this Ybitcoin article by David Perry. The article also explains that the network effect depends on ease of use. Indeed that is why currency came about in the first place. In a barter system, exchanging chickens for milk is a hard thing to do if the milk farmer already has enough chickens, but it is easy when a currency that has value in terms of both, and just about anything else, is used.\n\nThe retention of value over time is, in theory at least, built into Bitcoin. The limited supply and reduction in the rate of issue that is built into the protocol should ensure that as economies grow the currency increases in value. There will be an expanding amount of goods and services, but a finite amount of Bitcoin. The amount of things that each coin can buy, therefore, will increase. That is only true, however, if the first and second criteria for value in a currency are met, and that is where hardware wallets come in.\n\nThese wallets allow you to store your Bitcoin securely and in some cases still carry them around for easy use in physical locations as well as for purely online transactions. One of the latest and, according to some reviews such as this one at Techcrunch, maybe the best is the Case, but there are several others, most notably Trezor and Ledger Nano. I haven’t used Case, but the multi-sig security, fingerprint technology and network connectivity all make it sound like a winner. Whichever is your preferred model, however, the increased security and usability that the new hardware wallets offer are major steps forward for Bitcoin, and are likely to increase that elusive trust in the currency.\n\nThe second requirement for value in a currency, the network effect, can only really come when the first, trust is achieved. Having a storage system for Bitcoin that is in many ways more secure than those offered for conventional currency and yet offers almost equal portability and ease of use is a huge step in that direction. In the immediate future the price of Bitcoin may go up or down, but as the businesses surrounding it continue to innovate and the resultant trust spurs the network effect, the long term value of the currency looks likely to keep increasing.""]"
10/08/2015,"['This is a guest post by Michael Haley, Operations Manager at AlphaPoint. AlphaPoint is a financial technology company that powers digital currency exchanges and provides institutions aggregate access and order routing to digital currency markets.\n\nRight now, there are active digital currency markets running 24/7 in at least 45 national currencies.1 That is, there are digital currency markets in one quarter of the 180 national currencies recognized as legal tender by the United Nations. 2\n\nSeven years into the onrush of Nakamoto’s protocol, we think it makes sense to ask: Why does this matter? Why is closing the gap on the remaining three quarters important? What opportunities reside there?\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nIt matters in the first case because the geographic distribution of these markets is misaligned with the distribution of bitcoin market potential. At any given point in time, it is difficult to establish a bead on the aggregate global exchange count. Small exchanges crop up with little media presence and volunteer-run indexes have difficulty staying current.\n\nThe pattern, nevertheless, is clear enough: Europe and North America are each serviced by more than 30 exchanges, and East Asia by roughly 20, concentrated in China. Conversely, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America have nothing approaching this density. Further, exchange volumes today correlate with exchange count, with the staggering majority of digital-fiat conversion hosted in the Chinese yuan, U.S. dollar, and euro. The overwhelming majority of bitcoin-fiat trades is against the yuan, virtually all of it at zero-fee exchanges, creating masses of volume whose validity is difficult to pinpoint.3 Beyond this, American dollars and euros come second and third, respectively. Other currencies in aggregate scarcely register.\n\nAnd yet, digital currency’s greatest mainstream potential and most compelling use cases tend to reside outside of North America, Western Europe, and East Asia.\n\nInstead, the greatest potential beneficiaries tend to be concentrated in national markets whose fiscal, political, and infrastructural histories have rendered basic financial services out of reach for many businesses and individuals: Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Belarus, etc.\n\nEconomist Garrick Hileman provides a useful snapshot of this distribution in his Bitcoin Market Potential Index (2014). Of the highest-ranking markets in the index, more than half are based in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Likewise, there are indicators that regulatory clarity is improving in these regions -- in Chile and Nigeria particularly -- at the same time beneficial frameworks continue to elaborate themselves in more established hubs -- places such as Singapore, the United Kingdom, or Luxembourg.4\n\n“We’re working in markets where it’s impossible for companies to sell online without giving away more than 5 percent of their business to payment processors,” said Gabe Abed, co-founder and CEO of Bitt, a non-bank financial institution (NBFI) and universal Bitcoin services firm based in the Caribbean. “Individuals sending money from one island to another routinely lose 12 percent on fees. Credit card acceptance is low, and yet there’s a very high penetration rate for mobile Internet -- so there’s this gap, which is precisely what we’re aiming to fill.”\n\nOpportunities Across Global Markets\n\nThis gap between solutions offered by legacy systems and those made possible by the blockchain is falling into sharper relief for consumers and enterprises alike, and the opportunity is massive.5\n\nTo put matters in perspective: More than 50 countries host over $1 billion in daily foreign exchange volume. 6 In sum, there is more than $5 trillion in global FX trading per day. Even 1 percent of this total is $50 billion -- more than 1,500 times the current daily total for digital currency trading.\n\n“In the Bitcoin community, we’re used to talking about underbanked people,” said Gabriel Miron, CEO of Mexico City-based meXBT. “But more and more, we’re finding that underbanked businesses are key.” In moving funds between Mexico and, say, China or Brazil, banks perform FX conversion at a loss through the U.S. dollar. “And if you’re not one of a bank’s largest customers, this process can take weeks. Using bitcoin as the rails, we can settle in under 24 hours. Existing bank infrastructure can’t get close to that.”\n\n“We’re seeing that larger firms are particularly interested in more efficient settlement,” said Jesse Chenard, founder and CEO of MonetaGo, adding that smaller enterprise clients are more interested in availing arbitrage opportunities in bitcoin markets to drive down fees. “On a recent $13,000 intracompany transfer, we saved the client $600 in fees they would have otherwise had to pay to Bank of America.” In so many words, the needs and corresponding solutions are diverse, a point recently echoed by Andreas Antonopoulos.7\n\nBuilding Momentum\n\nThe opportunities we see can be spaced across two fronts: (1) making digital currencies more widely available, and (2) leveraging them to streamline international transfers. Yet we see these as part of the same movement, as two sides of the same coin -- both predicated on active, stable markets across effectively all national currencies.\n\nMore often than not, the speed and cost benefits offered by digital currency will be most dramatic in south-south transfers (between countries in Africa, Latin America, South Asia, etc.), where bitcoin (or other digital currencies) can facilitate FX conversion without needing to move through the U.S. dollar, radically reducing both costs and settlement times.\n\nAs markets expand and access improves, and as regulatory frameworks fall into sharper relief, we believe more and more businesses and individuals will recognize these benefits, that south-south trade will help drive adoption forward in the months and years ahead, and that this demand will help make digital currencies more available to the populations that stand to benefit from them most.\n\n1 This number is per publicly available data from bitcoin charts , Bitcoin Average , bitcoinity , Coin Market Cap , and elsewhere. An asterisk: Of course there are national markets for Litecoin, Ripple, and the like, and of course there are reasons to believe DAAP coins will become a bigger part of volumes in the near future. But the fact remains that Bitcoin’s market capitalization dwarfs that of its competitors. Currently BTC capitalization is fifteen times that of XRP. And of course there are informal and P2P markets for digital tokens of all kinds. But here I am defining ‘active markets’ as those serviced by at least one order matching service (one exchange), because informal markets tend to be erratic, illiquid, and difficult to quantify.\n\n2 Source: United Nations Treasury\n\n3 See, e.g. “80% of bitcoin is exchanged for Chinese yuan ” (Mar. 10, 2015 -Quartz)\n\n4 Thanks to Adam Vaziri, Director at London-based DIACLE, for his input.\n\n5 Particularly given how closely exchange distribution correlates with the distribution of the network itself and of merchant adoption. Note, for instance, the overlap between nodes and merchants, visualized on BitNodes and CoinMap , respectively. We would argue the connection is not simply correlative but causal, that mining and exchanges are preconditions for broader use. 6 Source: Bank for International Settlements Triennial Survey (April 2013) 7 IDEO Futures podcast Episode 21.5 (August 2015)', ""Luis Buenaventure, co-founder of one of the best known bitcoin remittance companies in the space, Rebit.ph , has published a blog post on Medium claiming that the cryptographic currency does little to help cheapen remittances.\n\nBitcoin remittances, better known as “rebittances” (a term Buenaventure claims to have popularized), allow customers to send cash to friends or family abroad. Effectively, this means that only the rebittance service itself uses bitcoin, both the sending and receiving end of the transaction merely touch cash. Since it is cheaper to send bitcoin around the globe compared to fiat currency, companies such as Rebit.ph aim to compete with existing remittance giants like Western Union and MoneyGram.\n\nIn his sobering blog post, however, Buenaventure severely nuances the advantages of using bitcoin in this manner. According to the Rebit.ph co-founder, who departed the company last August, bitcoin doesn't really enable cheaper remittance from a customers' point of view. This is because nearly all of the costs made by remittance (or rebittance) companies are in “the first and last miles” of the process anyway. In particular, it's converting digital money into physical cash, and distributing this cash to the different end-points to be picked up locally, that bears most of the cost. Buenaventure says it makes little difference whether the funds made it there as digital dollars or as digital bitcoin.\n\nIn the case of the Philippines, where Rebit.ph is most active, the end-points consist of local pawnshops that hold a firm grip over the national remittance market, Buenaventure explains:"", 'Bitcoin payment gateway BitPay has announced a new integration with point-of-sale terminal maker Ingenico that will allow consumers to use the virtual currency to make mobile payments at “thousands of retailer terminals worldwide”. The companies presented a demonstration of the service at Blockchain Week earlier this month.\n\n“The Bitcoin payment integration has been developed by BitPay and installed on an Ingenico terminal ICT250,” Ingenico says. “Customers can pay using Bitcoin in three simple steps. First, the merchant enters the amount of the order in his local currency. The device shows a QR code with the corresponding Bitcoin amount, which the customer then scans to pay with his mobile phone.\n\n“The project is an industry first, allowing a POS terminal device to receive a digital currency payment. While Bitcoin is most often used for ecommerce payments, the current Ingenico and BitPay project will make it possible to introduce Bitcoin payments to retail merchants on a global scale.”\n\n“At Ingenico, our mission is to be at the forefront of any payment method and to provide secure transactions for both the merchant and the end customer,” says Miguel Angel Hernandez, managing director of Ingenico Iberia. “Participating in such an important project has allowed Ingenico Group to demonstrate its leadership in the payment space and bring a safe and secure payment method like virtual currency to the end user.”\n\n“We are excited to partner with Ingenico Group, one of the leading payment processors in both physical and online commerce,” adds Tony Gallippi, BitPay executive chairman. “This integration will help us expand Bitcoin payments to thousands of retail payment terminals worldwide.”', 'Tunisia\'s post office, La Poste Tunisienne, today revealed it is testing a crypto-powered payments app for 600,000 of its customers.\n\nIn partnership with startups Monetas and DigitUs, the hybrid service provider – which runs eDinar, Tunisia\'s official mobile money – will launch a multi-purpose app for the growing number of smartphone users in the North African nation.\n\nCEO M Moez Chakchouk said in a statement:\n\n""La Poste is a very important and trusted institution and is at the heart of financial inclusion efforts in Tunisia. At La Poste we are on a transformation journey to modernize our services with innovative technologies and power the digital economy. Digital, Mobile and Internet, are all key components in this transformation.""\n\nThe app, which runs on Monetas\' crypto-transaction platform, will launch as a pilot for ""friends and family"", the startup said. Once the integration is complete, it will be rolled out to 600,000 eDinar users.\n\nOnce live, La Poste customers will be able to action instant money transfers, remittances and purchases in-store and online via QR codes. It will also give them the ability to pay bills and even manage their government ID documents.\n\nTransaction fees will be negligible – with the maximum amounting to under one third of a Dinar (11p). To prevent illegal use, issuance and circulation will be controlled by La Poste, Monetas said.\n\nDigital notary\n\nThe app is the first public release from the Swiss software firm, which CMO Vitus Ammann claims has raised over $6m from angel investors to date.\n\nMonetas calls its platform a ""cryptographically secured digital notary"" that records but never touches value. Monetas effectively offers white-label solutions to its partners, who will run it day-to-day to ensure they comply with AML and KYC standards in their market. In this case, this partner is DigitUs.\n\nThe firm is also looking to expand further into Africa over the next year, followed by Latin America and Asia – where smartphone penetration is surging but access to financial services remains poor.\n\nAmmann told CoinDesk:\n\n""Monetas wants to focus on where we can have the greatest impact. Although Monetas software is intended to change the entire world, we believe the best place to start is where transaction costs are highest and access to banking is very low.""\n\nHe added:\n\n""We believe that mobile financial services is rapidly growing in the region, and Monetas software means individuals will prosper with a transaction platform that is magnitudes cheaper than any alternative, and able to operate across mobile networks and access new financial tools.""\n\nFeatured Image: posztos / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The financial crisis was just coming to a boil, leading people to question the competence of central banks and major financial institutions.\n\nWhen bitcoin began to enter the mainstream consciousness in 2011, such skepticism was still very much alive. The European debt crisis was just getting underway. And Wikileaks’ publication of U.S. state department cables followed by the blacklisting of the group by payments companies at the urging of the federal government showed the world just how much power the government could wield over an individual’s ability to spend his own money.\n\nThe idea that bitcoin is an unstoppable force that would ultimately be used to wrest power from the establishment was championed by the media, which loves a good David vs. Goliath story. And a small group of dedicated users are still clinging to that notion. But as countless economists, financiers, and other naysayers have pointed out, revolutionizing the global financial system requires more than just the earnest intentions of a couple hundred thousand believers. In the real world, Goliath almost always wins.\n\nBitcoin and the blockchain technology that supports it, however, remain ingenious inventions. And this has not escaped the many establishment figures who are trying to use blockchain technology for non-revolutionary aims. As a distributed ledger of transactions that is public to everyone on the network, a blockchain is valuable to any network that wants to trade a commodity or currency. One of the more interesting companies trying its hand at this mission is itBit. The company is launching its product Bankchain as a clearing and settlement network for the gold market, to help shorten settlement times and improve record keeping for institutional traders, later this year.\n\nGiven how large and opaque the market for gold is, the appeal of grafting a distributed ledger on top of it is obvious. Bankchain will enable instantaneous delivery and payment in a market where trades are done over the phone and delivery is measured in days rather than minutes. But itBit’s plan is most definitely not to use bitcoin to trade gold. It is creating a technology inspired by bitcoin’s blockchain and allowing a small number of incumbent players to use that technology, for a fee. What’s more, itBit is the only bitcoin exchange with a banking charter in the state of New York, which will allow the company to help its customers settle their transactions in U.S. dollars.\n\nFor bitcoin enthusiasts, the idea of a blockchain-inspired technology that is privately owned is heresy. When the bitcoin website Coindesk first reported the idea back in August, readers were incredulous. “What good is a private consensus-based ledger system; if it is private and closed source, it can be manipulated by whoever owns it,” seethed one reader. Another called it a “marketing gimmick,” arguing that itBit is “running a private database and they use a bunch of buzzwords to try to make it look like a new technology.”\n\nThe bitcoin faithful argue that itBit misunderstands what makes the blockchain a useful technology, but in reality they misunderstand why such a technology would be useful for an opaque market in which trillions of dollars in gold changes hands, figuratively speaking, each year. itBit’s plan to graft blockchain technology on existing markets like gold, and later for unregistered securities, has attracted some big establishment names to join its board, like former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley.\n\nWhether or not Bankchain will be a success remains to be seen. But it is a clear example of why investors like Marc Andreessen have been bullish on bitcoin while others like Warren Buffett have been scratching their heads. As I wrote last year, when Andreessen criticized Buffett for his skepticism:\n\nIt’s not that Buffett is ignorant about technology. It’s just that he understands that it’s impossible to know which specific investments will benefit from a technology’s widespread adoption, even if you are prescient enough to know what technologies will revolutionize the world and how they will do so.\n\nWe’re seeing some interesting applications of blockchain technology. But those who followed the lead of cheerleaders like Andreessen and bought actual bitcoins thinking their investment would appreciate are still waiting for their big payday. Meanwhile, those who appreciate bitcoin for its anti-establishment possibilities are still waiting for the revolution.\n\nIn an ironic twist, many of these folks, with their love of hard money and distrust of centralized power, could very well see blockchain facilitate big banks’ trading of the ultimate hard money, gold. It might not rise to the level of a Sex Pistols credit card, but it’s close.', '21 is a mysterious Bitcoin hardware and mining startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz that unwrapped its first product earlier this year. A few weeks ago, they unveiled and began pre-selling a computer that has native hardware and software support for the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nCo-founder Balaji Srinivasan, who previously started bioinformatics and gene testing company Counsyl, said the vision is akin to how PCs and operating systems like Windows 95 began to include TCP/IP support natively in the 1990s, opening the door for widespread Internet adoption. If machines and phones start having native Bitcoin support, it enables them to support infinitely small transactions off the Bitcoin protocol in exchange for whatever goods and services a person or machine wants. One popular example idea is requiring infinitesimally small payments for e-mail, which would curb spam.\n\n“First, you had the worldwide Internet. Then the social Internet,” Srinivasan said. “Then this is the machine payable Internet.”\n\nIt also cuts the barrier to participating or developing with the Bitcoin protocol dramatically. Srinivasan said that there are maybe 1,000 developers worldwide who really know how to work with the protocol.\n\n“There’s a tiny number of Bitcoin wizards, and an enormous number of smart developers that have no on-ramp to Bitcoin,” Srinivasan said. “We need to make that onramp easier.”\n\nToday, after unveiling the first device, 21 has hired Saivann Carignan, David Harding and Will Binns, three of the top contributors to Bitcoin.org. They’re opening an education platform that 21 is using to make software development for the Bitcoin protocol much more accessible and easier to understand. It will cover topics from digital signatures to mining.\n\nThat will help developers, who want to use 21’s computer, level up with their software skills.\n\n“Our computer is the easiest way for a developer to get started writing software for Bitcoin,” he said. “You don’t have to spend days downloading the blockchain, which is like going and buying some floppy disks and going through an installation process.”\n\nTo expand all of the tutorials, 21 is paying contributors from anywhere in the world a small fee of up to $200 in Bitcoin if they translate or add documentation.\n\nSrinivasan envisions the tutorials as a way of teaching and familiarizing a whole army of Bitcoin developers. “We have the investors or connections to get our chip baked into a line of electronics by default. But we also need enough developer traction over the next year or so.”', 'Blythe Masters, the Wall Street executive who became the youngest managing director of J.P. Morgan, likes the blockchain. However, the Chief Executive Officer of the startup Digital Asset Holdings doesn’t pay much attention to Bitcoin. The former credit derivative product manager told Bloomberg Markets Most Influential Summit, “I never became particularly enamored with cryptocurrency.”\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Business: Why don’t most Businesses Accept Digital Currency?\n\nMasters gained a lot of her experience with over two decades with J.P. Morgan — being the youngest women hired for her status at age 28. Earlier in 2015, she told a crowd at the Exponential Finance Conference her positive outlook on distributed ledger technology. At 46 years old, she is the oldest member of Digital Asset Holdings, and sees some contrast between tech entrepreneurs and Wall Street executives.\n\nAfter the financial crisis of 2008, many blamed Masters for playing a key role in the derivatives market. Masters was once described by The Guardian as “the woman who invented financial weapons of mass destruction.” The J.P. Morgan executive immediately struck back, detailing her beliefs in that market saying, “I do believe credit default swaps have been miscast.” With Digital Asset Holdings, the company will focus in on the creation of two initiatives Hyperledger and Bits of Proof. Both of these companies provide a blockchain solution to both the recording and settlement of assets.\n\nThe former Wall Street derivatives manager is a strong believer of distributed ledger technology, and she and her colleagues aim to show this interest. Masters is the on the Board of Santander Consumer USA, a full-service FinTech company. Just a month or so ago, Santander bank said that blockchain technology can save banks $20 billion a year in a paper from its Innoventures outfit. Masters told a crowd back in August,\n\n“When you move away from proof of work to something that has to be ultimately protected by firewalls within a network of trusted counterparties…. I’m pretty sure most banks are willing to trust other banks to do the right thing. But i’m not sure that all of you people trust us.”\n\nThe thing with Masters is, people don’t trust her associations due to being heavily involved throughout the subprime mortgage fiasco. People are also not too keen on using the blockchain without Bitcoin; with Masters’ simple explanation of Bitcoin’s underlying technology, it’s hard to know if she grasps the aspects of it at all. It’s possible that Masters and many Wall Street types seek the blockchain as proof of digital integrity. The can envision their centralized services running on top of distributed ledger technology but not the decentralized version. Masters tells Bloomberg,\n\n“At its simplest level, a blockchain is nothing much more than a fancy kind of database,”\n\nMasters doesn’t care for cryptocurrency — just like her banking buddies. A total count of 22 banks are currently looking into to underlying tech behind the cryptocurrency, but not Bitcoin itself. This includes firms such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Citi, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Bank of America, SEB and the National Bank of Australia. With the blockchain being at the forefront of their minds, will they forget where the technology came from? Is decentralization so bad they must dismiss the network effect and the longest digital ledger in the world? The answers are becoming clearer…\n\nWhat do you think of Blythe Masters not caring about Bitcoin? Do you care? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock, Redmemes and Wiki Commons\n\nOriginally posted on: The Blythe Masters Philosophy: Pay no Attention to Bitcoin', 'Japanese cryptocurrency management service provider and SmartCoin operator Orb has raised US $2.3 million in seed funding from leading Japanese venture capital firms and angel investors including SBI investment.\n\nWith the new financing, the Orb team plans to allocate its funds to the development of Orb’s cryptocurrency management platform, which is currently in private beta.\n\nThe Orb team will also use the funds to continue the development of their newly launched decentralized cloud computing system, which allows users and developers to authenticate assets and transactions on the blockchain. Orb co-founder and CEO Masa Nakatsu firmly believes that Orb is a great contribution to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and will become one of the main competitors of Chain, Ethereum and 21 Inc.\n\nPrior to the development of Orb, Nakatsu has cofounded several multi-million dollar ventures in Japan and Silicon Valley. Nakatsu founded Japan’s largest social lending platform Maneo, with which he raised more than $140 million in funding.\n\nOver the past few decades, Nakatsu has focused on the search of solutions toward the problems of traditional currency systems. Nakatsu founded Musavy, a content curation venture in Silicon Valley and worked with the Business Development department of Groupon.\n\nWith his expertise in finance, eCommerce and online payments, Nakatsu plans to grow Orb into a prominent cryptocurrency platform in the near future.', 'Russia’s largest search engine and Internet-based services provider Yandex is interested in integrating bitcoin to its financial platform Yandex.Money, to allow its merchants to accept payments in bitcoin.\n\nAt the Finnopolis FinTech Forum held in Kazan, Yandex.Money CEO Maria Gracheva announced that the company is looking forward in supporting bitcoin payments. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine , Nora Kirkizh, media relations manager of Yandex.Money further explained that bitcoin fits perfectly with the payment solutions offered by Yandex.Money, ranging from the online payment solution used by more than 76,000 online stores, e-wallets, online banking services, etc.\n\n“We are definitely paying close attention to cryptocurrencies,” the Yandex team told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n“The technology on which they are based can be used as the foundation for lots of different products,” said Kirkizh. “For example, Yandex.Money offers online stores Yandex Payment Solution. With this service they can accept payments from customers via bank cards, e-wallets, online banking accounts and other possible payment methods. Currently, over 76,000 online stores use Yandex Payment Solution to process their payments. Indeed, bitcoin would fit this range of methods perfectly. If it was one of the options in Yandex Payment Solution, users could easily use it to pay for goods on any website. Nevertheless, until cryptocurrencies are regulated by Russian law, we cannot work with them viably.”\n\nLegality of Bitcoin\n\nDespite the company’s interest in bitcoin and its advantages, the legality of bitcoin in the country is still undecided. While the Russian Central Bank prohibits the use of bitcoin, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that bitcoin can probably be used in “some account.”\n\nDue to this uncertainty, the Yandex team plans to wait until the authorities and the government approve the use of bitcoin for corporations and organizations.\n\n“Different institutions have different attitude to bitcoin. Russian Central Bank prohibited this currency in the country, for instance, although other organizations were interested in bitcoin and suggesting to know it better. We still do not know what bitcoin will be in the near future, and there is not an opportunity to work with it legally,” said Kirkizh.\n\nYandex.Money currently has more than 22 million users, with more than 12,000 new accounts opened daily. Yandex believes that bitcoin’s efficiency in processing payments and transactions could greatly benefit its financial platform and could be offered as an alternative to credit card and bank payments.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies have their pros and cons. On the one hand, it’s an inexpensive technology and it’s very easy to implement, and so as soon as it becomes legal to work with them, basically any payment service will be able to quickly implement the technology,” continued the Yandex team.\n\nHowever, the Yandex.Money team is still worried that most of their users will not want to take the initiative to convert fiat-money to cryptocurrencies. Yandex will consider integrating bitcoin across their platforms as soon as bitcoin becomes legal and the bitcoin industry in Russia starts to grow.\n\n“The audience for cryptocurrencies is still quite small and it seems like making simple and easy-to-understand products based on “real” money will still be the logical thing to do for some time to come. In order to convert live money to cryptocurrency, users will need some sort of extra motivation and a good amount of time. That will hold back the growth of blockchains,” said Kirkizh.', 'Ripple Labs shortened its name to Ripple this week, a move which according to company officials, signals its products are now ""out of the lab"" and ready for use.\n\nLong one of the more well-funded startups in industry, Ripple was arguably the first to focus on use cases for distributed ledgers, introducing an alternative ledger that deviated from bitcoin\'s method for consensus and featured its own unique digital currency, XRP, as early as 2012.\n\nSince then, Ripple has increasingly put forth in its public messaging that it is seeking to realize an ""Internet of Value"", a term that denotes a time when money could move as quickly as information does today. As a building block for this future, Ripple has introduced the Interledger protocol (ILP), which intends to act as an arbiter for all types of ledgers, both those that are distributed and traditional centralized alternatives.\n\nRipple CTO Stefan Thomas explained that ILP itself is not a ledger, as it does not seek consensus toward any state. Rather it provides a top-layer cryptographic escrow system that allows funds to move between ledgers with the help of intermediaries it calls ""connectors"".\n\nFurther, ILP has no native token, so individual ledgers operating its protocol will still hold balances in their native units of account. Thomas contends such interoperability solves the issue of one specific payment network – be it Ripple or Visa – needing to reach global ubiquitousness.\n\nThomas told CoinDesk:\n\n""As long as your ledger supports [Interledger], you can participate in a payment and someone will be able to provide liquidity. It can be PayPal, Alipay, bitcoin, bank ledgers or Skype, anywhere people hold balances, they have a ledger.""\n\n""Interledger is a protocol in a true sense,"" VP of marketing Monica Long added. ""It creates ways for ledgers to interact. Bitcoin and Ripple are payment systems, [they] require everyone to adopt that system for users to interact.""\n\nILP is also a bid to offer Ripple\'s enterprise customers a solution that they argue maintains customer privacy, allowing users to keep aggregate transaction data off a public blockchain by using a connector to move funds between private versions of the Ripple network.\n\nWith this in mind, ILP features two modes – Atomic and Universal – with the former using a selected group of ""notaries"" to approve transfers and the latter an incentive structure to allow untrusted institutions to fill the role.\n\nRipple contends ILP is also easy for any of its partners to adopt. ""If you\'re PayPal, all you would need to do is add a new payment to your API,"" Thomas said.\n\nToday, Ripple said Interledger works with any ledger or payments system and that open-source reference implementations are to be released later this month.\n\nCrypto escrow\n\nAs described in the official white paper, connectors would facilitate transfers between ledgers, performing the same function that companies today might achieve with market makers when they exchange currencies for business purposes.\n\nUnlike traditional systems, however, Ripple says ILP removes the need for transaction participants to trust that the connector will not lose or steal the money, meaning such exchange doesn\'t need to be protected by legal contracts.\n\n""Ledger-provided escrow guarantees the sender that their funds will only be transferred to the connector once the ledger receives proof that the recipient has been paid. Escrow also assures the connector that they will receive the sender’s funds once they complete their end of the agreement,"" the paper states.\n\nIn interview, Thomas suggested entities acting as connectors would also benefit from lower barriers to access.\n\n""In order to lower the barrier, the first thing you have to do is so the connector doesn\'t have to be trusted, they can provide liquidity without being that well-vetted,"" he continued.\n\nMore uncertain, Thomas suggested, was who might serve as a connector on ILP, though he said digital currency exchanges could fill this role. ""Those kinds of systems could adopt the tech and adopt that standard to expose their liquidity in a standardized way,"" he said.\n\nIn terms more familiar in the industry, Thomas compared ILP to Blockstream\'s sidechains project, which is seeking to extend the functionality of the bitcoin network by allowing bitcoin assets to be moved back and forth between altnerate cryptographic ledgers and the public blockchain.\n\n""Interledger is a complement to sidechains,"" he said. ""Sidechains is about how do you create these ledgers, ILP is putting them together. At ILP we\'re mostly thinking about if you\'re trying to connect a bitcoin sidechain and a PayPal ledger, how do you get from one place to another.""\n\nW3C inspired\n\nRipple indicated that, while not affiliated with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ILP grew out of its participation in its Web Payments Interest Group, which is seeking to develop standards for payments on the web.\n\nFounded by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, W3C is a member organization that connects Internet industry stakeholders in an effort to develop open standards for everything from online payments to connected cars.\n\n""We\'ve been involved [with W3C] since 2013, and we\'ve been in touch with them based on the [ILP] idea, making a payments standard to create open, free payments,"" Thomas said.\n\nCurrently, Ripple indicated it is workshopping the protocol in a W3C community group, with the goal for it to potentially be considered as a standard for web payments.\n\nMembers include representatives from the National Association of Convenience Stores, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Eris Ltd.\n\nYet, the development also seeks to help enhance the competitiveness of Ripple\'s products, which Thomas said banks have criticized due to potential issues with scalability. Thomas indicated that banks believe that, as with the introduction of the Faster Payments network in the UK, lower costs systems inevitably produce a higher volume of transactions.\n\n""When you bring costs down, volumes increase dramatically,"" Thomas said. ""The key to scalability is to have something that doesn\'t rely on one global system. That was also a great solution for some of the things W3C had.""\n\nThomas said that, as with sidechains in bitcoin, this would potentially enable ""horizontal scalability"" so that the global transaction system can increase its total processing power.\n\nTesting ground\n\nThomas and Long also expressed their belief that ILP – by placing ledger systems side by side in a market – would serve to highlight which of these are the most efficient, something they suspect will be advantageous to distributed ledger providers.\n\nIn this light, Thomas suggested ILP will help promote other new Ripple products, including its Cross-Currency Settlement and FX Market Making solutions, introduced on Tuesday.\n\nBoth solutions, Long said, are software products that interact with Ripple and are packaged together. Customers are able to purchase the products for a license fee. Ripple earns added revenue from integrations, and said pricing is currently customized depending on the partner.\n\nThe products also position Ripple and its asset XRP ""as a bridge"" that can reduce the cost for cross-border settlement, according to the company. Long said that the Cross-Currency Settlement product, for example, would improve the information available for end-consumers in the foreign exchange process for when removing privacy restrictions is beneficial.\n\n""Today, a bank can send payment instructions to a receiving bank, but there\'s no way for the recipient to send information back. The sending institution can\'t give its customer accurate pricing for the transaction and can\'t give the customer accurate confirmation that the payment got there,"" Long said.\n\nMarket validation\n\nGiven its status as an early partner for financial institutions, and the rising interest among these entities in blockchain and distributed ledger solutions, Long suggested Ripple sees developments in 2015 as a validation of its market strategy.\n\nLong claimed Ripple has 30 banks currently experimenting with its technology, and that the announcement on how this is being used would be forthcoming.\n\nOverall, Long spoke positively of developments such as R3\'s recent partnerships with major banks, indicating that both groups seem to be focused on separate use cases, Ripple on cross-border settlement and R3 more on interbank settlement.\n\nWith the changes in the space, Long positioned ILP as part of the expanding use cases in the ""distributed financial technology"" industry, a definition she feels best captures projects that are not wholly blockchain-based but seek goals concurrent with the community.\n\nLong concluded:\n\n""Blockchains are a part of that, but it\'s about moving away from centralized systems.""\n\nConnection visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

10/09/2015,"['Dorian Nakamoto’s life was turned upside down with Newsweek journalist Leah Goodman published an article proclaiming the Los Angeles area man the founder of Bitcoin. Dorian recently pursued legal action against Newsweek proclaiming the story hurt his family. In the weeks after the article, the Bitcoin community setup funds as a nice gesture for Dorian.\n\nDorian recently clarified his thoughts on the crypto-currency in a Reddit AMA. He holds some fears about power within the Bitcoin ecosystem being consolidated. He expressed strong opinions about the structure of society in which few govern the many. As Dorian expressed:\n\nWe should protect Bitcoin from take over by the few. Its function should flow free as the Volga River despite the centuries of Tsars, Mongols, Vikings, Swedes, and the Communist regime rule. We need to toss out any thinking of the apparent treasure in the boat over the the river as the Stenka Razin did to keep the boat rower and citizens free. Keep the flow free and wide.\n\nThe Stenka’s men were able to trust him to navigate the river and to support the poor. In our case, Bitcoin does have a few generals to serve the crypto math, with many rowers (the open source programmers) to float in the river. The concept of the Bitcoin is the captain of the ship. Not a single or a group of people, which they may call themselves Oh, NO: A board of Directors\n\nWe need to preserve this structure. No board of directors. A few, governing many to navigate in their own purpose, their own ports to deposit goods, … must not be allowed.\n\nI see this happened to our great nation of USA. 535 legistrature governing 320 million of us making us poor with their dealing with passing the measures put forth by another group of the few for (subprime, derivatives, mortgage backed trust …) and finally, the mandatory Obama care, making e.g., drugs more expensive for the poor.\n\nSame for the State, County, and down to the town/cities. In our town, 5 counsel staff fooled us to choke the already congested main street of Las Tunas by reducing the lane from 2 lane ea. with diagnal parking, metering out our property money trickled down from the state to county just to hand out contracts to more than one ‘traffic study group and beautification firms’ against our citizen voices. Same happening at our next door neighboring towns. A few 5 counsels voting themselves against 35K town citizens on allowing to build Monster houses as already done in our town. It’s too late for me to understand the ‘flow’. The consel making this decision should of been stopped at the money flow. As they say, follow the flow of $$. From the State, County, then to the town. It should of stopped at higher level. That Las Tunas drive portion belongs to my town but it is a thoroughfare used by the thousands of commuters coming from the east side, like Pomona, San Dimas, … to downtown LA. I’ve mentioned this in the counsel meeting but was ignored. Call to the LA supervisor’s office of Antonovitch was met by ‘Oh, it doesn’t belong to the county, it belongs to your town’. Yet, the county office metered out the $10 millions to do the diagonal parking.\n\nI see the same for our corporate (capitalistic) structure. A few, say 5 – 10 board of directors governing the fate of all those who actually working day n’ night, week after week with little pay and little time off decide to send work out to Shanghi, laying off thousands of US workers while they get millions in their salaries, compensations, bonuses, … and more raises voting themselves.\n\nSame for our Japanese American community, a microcosm level – Selling off Keiro Retirement Home complex by the few, the home’s board of directors and the CEO. They had no right to determine the fate of the all those senior residents, some in dire conditions and to their families and the seniors in waiting to get in by outright selling the facility without allowing the most important people to vote for no. The proceed of $41 million was said to be used for educating about aging (huh?). The $$ should be used to create new Retirement home without the board of selfish directors or CEOs. Let the citizens make the laws and govern themselves without the greedy few.\n\nCampigns, voting? Elections? do these matter as the outcome of our citizens well being, both emotionally (promises), health and financial security?

This week, some changes have taken place.\n\nAmagi Metals has relaunched after some time offline due to internal issues. Under new management, Amagi Metals is hoping to win the trust of the precious metals retail scene, even if it is slowly.\n\nAmagi Metals relaunched under the management of Anthem Vault. As a representative posted to Reddit:\n\nHello r/silverbugs – I want to introduce the new Amagi Metals brand that is being released under the ownership of Anthem Vault – a precious metals storage company and financial tech leader with a great reputation. We understand that customer service, awesome deals, and reputation is highly regarded in this community. We don’t expect you to flock quickly to the new Amagi Metals, as we understand that previous ownership has left some users with bad experiences fresh in the mind. We will be here though, with an expanded customer service staff, a Bitcoin payment option, and quality bullion at great prices. We’d like to offer free shipping and a free copper round in every Silverbugs’ order from now until Saturday, with more deals to come. Code: REDDIT10 (you’ll see the free ship option at the end of checkout) We are standing by to answer questions on the new ownership. We understand there has been a lot of confusion and we would like to help in any way we can. If you have an order that has not been fulfilled from Amagi Metals – we would like to help you with that as well. Thanks for your time, Anthem Vault Team\n\nOn why Anthem Vault kept the brand:\n\n“Contrary to this very great point, Amagi still has a great reputation in many places of the Bitcoin world. It has a great presence online and a boisterous data base of leads and infastructure: logos, videos, etc.”\n\nAs for whether or not Amagi will stop accepting US Dollars, as they announced late 2014, the answer is no:\n\nAs of right now we have not adopted this goal as a company. As an individual I hope we can make it happen, but realistically it may not happen.\n\nFormer Amagi Metals CEO Stephen Macaskill is no longer a part of AMagi Metals. Anthem Blanchard is now the CEO.\n\n“Our goal is to provide the precious metals community with a trusted way to accumulate gold and silver,” said Anthem Blanchard, founder and CEO of Anthem Vault. “When customers find their gold and silver stacks too precious to be held in their own home, we can take on the storage and security at Anthem Vault. Amagi Metals ships quality silver and gold straight to the customer. These may include special years of Gold Eagles and Morgan Dollars as well as popular silver bullion; There is something for everyone.”\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Amagi Metals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Back in May, New York District Court Judge Katherine Forrest sentenced Silk Road website founder Ross Ulbricht to life in prison. For a first-time offender and a non-violent offender at that, the sentence seemed somewhat excessive to many within and outside of the Bitcoin community. The reasoning behind Judge Forrest’s sentencing has now been unsealed for public review.\n\nRoss Ulbricht Sentencing\n\nMassive sentences for non-violent drug offenses has been controversial\n\nThe explosion in the prison population within the United States has reached alarming proportions. More than 2 million citizens are currently in prison, by far the largest prison population for any nation. According to the latest statistics, the U.S. accounts for about 5% of the world’s population, but about 25% of the world’s prison population.\n\nThis has largely been due to “The Rockefeller Laws” and “The War on Drugs” starting in the mid-1980’s. Over the last 20 years, the U.S. prison population has more than doubled. The sentencing in the Silk Road case is another example of how this happens so quickly in “The Land of the Free.”\n\nBefore Ross Ulbricht’s sentencing on May 29, 2015, Judge Forrest spent the better part of an hour defending current drug laws and deriding Ulbricht’s crimes and defense. After spending over 100 hours pondering an appropriate sentence, and reviewing almost as many letters of testimony to the character of Ulbricht from friends and family, Judge Forrest stated:\n\n“What Silk Road really was, was a social market expander of a socially harmful drug that we have deemed in our democratic process to be unacceptable and it was an enabler of those trying so very hard to get away from it. What you did in connection with Silk Road was terribly destructive to our social fabric.”\n\nJudge Forrest saw the defense’s arguments as somewhat offensive, attacking the validity of the laws referenced in this case. Forrest seemed to use Ulbricht’s education and solid upbringing as reasons to be harsher with the defendant.\n\n“No drug dealer from the Bronx selling meth or heroin or crack has ever made these kinds of arguments to the Court,” Judge Forrest said. “It is a privileged argument, it is an argument from one of privilege. You are no better a person than any other drug dealer and your education does not give you a special place of privilege in our criminal justice system. It makes it less explicable why you did what you did.”\n\nJudge Forrest saw the case being so widely publicized as an opportunity to use the sentence as a deterrent against future offenses of this nature. She also saw Ulbricht as someone who thought he was “above the law” in building Silk Road for drug sales, so her final sentence was as severe as any ever handed out to an online webmaster.\n\nAs we’ve reported here, Ross Ulbricht received two concurrent life sentences for narcotics trafficking, narcotics conspiracy and distribution of narcotics by means of the Internet. Three other counts included one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking (5 years), one count of conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent identification documents (10 years), and one count of money laundering conspiracy (20 years). In addition, Ulbricht was fined US$183,961,921. Ulbricht is currently appealing his sentencing.\n\nRoss’s final statement to the court before sentencing was also released, and Ulbricht showed much contrition, even breaking down into tears, at one point. He apologized to the families of those who died from the drugs sold on Silk Road, as some spoke against him before sentencing. His time in jail since his arrest in the fall of 2013 gave him time to reflect, and gain respect for the laws he is said to have broken.\n\n“One of the things I have realized about the law is that the laws of nature are much like the laws of man,” said Ulbricht in court. “Gravity doesn't care if you agree with it––if you jump off a cliff you are still going to get hurt. And even though I didn't agree with the law, I still have been convicted of a crime and must be punished. I understand that now and I respect the law and the authority now.”\n\nIssues with how the case was handled\n\nThe court case and its handling was soundly ridiculed by filmmaker Alex Winter, who attended the court proceedings in person. He went on to chronicle the background of the case in his biopic “Deep Web”. He was of the opinion that Ulbricht’s defense team never received a fair opportunity to defend Ross, as any defense levied was thrown out by Judge Forrest in Winter’s view as a spectator.\n\n“I hope to see (the defense) get their day in court. That was the part that was very chilling and frustrating when I was in the courtroom,” Winter told Joe Rogan on Rogan’s podcast in April. “It was like, the prosecution said their piece, the defense was about to, bam, they got blocked (by Judge Forrest), it was over. (The defense) was unable to call expert witnesses, discuss the complexities of Bitcoin. I would just like to see the defense have its day.”\n\nRegarding issues with non-violent drug offense sentencing, Vice recently aired a special featuring President Barack Obama going to El Reno Federal Prison in Oklahoma regarding this exact issue. Called “Fixing The System,” President Obama was the first sitting President to ever visit a federal prison with the intent to talk to inmates and learn more about the societal byproducts of “The War on Drugs.” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was also interviewed by Shane Smith of Vice for the report.\n\n“Nobody ever lost an election because they were too tough on crime,” said President Obama to Vice’s Smith in El Reno. “Nobody stepped back and asked ‘Is it really appropriate for someone who is engaged in a serious, but non-violent, drug offense, to get more time than a rapist?"", 'In the next few weeks a company is going to list on the Australian Stock Exchange. This company is hoping to raise $20 million. That’s fiat money, just so you’re aware.\n\nI bring up the point that it’s fiat money because this company is all about Bitcoin. And Bitcoin is inherently anti-fiat money.\n\nYou see, the company that’s going to list on the ASX is the Bitcoin Group Limited. They are a Bitcoin Miner. What is a Bitcoin Miner you might ask? Good question, and I’ll get to that in a moment.\n\nBut what I want to do before is to let you in on a secret.\n\nThe very fact this company will list on the ASX completely contradicts the purpose of Bitcoin. Not only could this be the most controversial listing in the history of the ASX. But it could also be one of its most spectacular failures.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Miner?\n\nLet’s get one thing straight. Bitcoin exists solely in the digital world. It is, in its most basic description, a digital currency.\n\nAlthough in the US they have decided Bitcoin is a commodity. Just like gold and oil. And in Russia they have decided to ban Bitcoin completely. Oh, and the Aussie banks have put a ban on supplying services to Bitcoin companies. And even in Australia the government, ATO and ASIC still really don’t know what Bitcoin is or isn’t.\n\nTo actually define Bitcoin isn’t that easy. And that alone sets off warning bells.\n\nBut let’s look at the very origin of Bitcoin. When it entered our digital world in 2008/9 it had a purpose. In the whitepaper ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’, Satoshi Nakamoto explains, ‘We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.’\n\nIn other words a digital unit of exchange free from government intervention. Its decentralised nature makes it free from monetary control, and free from the meddling of central banks.\n\nHe might not have known what he was starting. But its essence is that Bitcoin is anti-fiat money. It’s the ultimate libertarian currency.\n\nIts core technology is something we call the ‘blockchain’. Now this blockchain is a potentially world changing technology. It’s a giant online ledger that records all transactions but keep the parties anonymous. At the moment it’s only really used for Bitcoin. But over the coming years, blockchain could be used for much more.\n\nThe possibilities include an ‘Internet of Things’ blockchain. Or perhaps a stock market blockchain. The NASDAQ is currently trialling blockchain technology on its pre-IPO private market. My bet is one day they’ll use it for all NASDAQ trades.\n\nThe way I see it the real tech game-changer here is the blockchain. And when a legitimate blockchain company decides to list, then we’ll be having a different conversation.\n\nNow that’s not to say Bitcoin isn’t a game changer. It is – unless capitalism tears it down.\n\nAnyway, let’s get back to Bitcoin mining.\n\nWe need power. Lots of power.\n\nTo ‘mine’ Bitcoin you need a computer. A really powerful computer. Or in the case of a mining business, lots of powerful computers working together. Or even many users with powerful computers connected together to create a mining ‘pool’.\n\nThe reason you need powerful computers is that to ‘mine’ and receive a Bitcoin for your efforts, you need to solve a complex algorithm. The more powerful computers on the Bitcoin network, the harder it becomes to mine coins. Hence you need ever-more powerful computers. It’s a bit of a computer-power arms race between miners, really.\n\nSo to stay ahead of the game you need power. Lots of power.\n\nBack when Bitcoin first came about you could mine with a normal computer. Then later you needed a pretty decent graphics card to keep up. Now there are dedicated ‘mining rigs’. These are borderline supercomputers. It’s expensive and capital intensive to stay competitive as a miner.\n\nHowever if you do solve the algorithm your reward is a block of Bitcoin. Currently one block is 25 coins. In Aussie dollar terms that’s $8,447 (1BTC = $337.88). The more blocks you mine, the more money you make.\n\nIt’s also important to remember Bitcoin in dollar terms has been as low as 1 cent and as high as $1,250. The volatility in price is alone a risk no one should mess with.\n\nBut here’s the real problem for ‘miners’. Around June next year the reward will halve to 12.5 Bitcoin. A guaranteed 50% fall in revenue. Oh no!\n\nThat will halve again to 6.25 Bitcoin. But it’s estimated not to until around 2021.\n\nSo diminishing revenues are a guarantee if you’re a Bitcoin miner. That is unless you get more power. More power means a better chance of solving the algorithm. And more blocks.\n\nBut more power means more hardware, more electricity and more money.\n\nAnd any sharp drop in the price of Bitcoin all of a sudden means costs outweigh reward.\n\nHowever, all this pales into insignificance. The really big problem with a public traded Bitcoin mining company goes back to why Bitcoin even exists.\n\nWhy do companies go public?\n\nWhen you’re a private company you go public to raise capital. You use this capital to expand and grow the business. And your responsibility is to maximise return for shareholders.\n\nAnd if you’re an ASX listed company, that ‘return’ comes as an increase in the price of your stock. That way investors buy in, hopefully sell higher, and make a profit. But this is all in Aussie dollars. So to make returns on your income sheet you need to be making Aussie dollars.\n\nStill with me? OK. Here’s where things get a little contradictory.\n\nIf you’re mining Bitcoin to make returns in Aussie dollars to maximise returns for shareholders, you have to sell Bitcoin. That means you have to sell it back to dollars, back to fiat money. That’s pretty straightforward.\n\nBut the whole purpose of Bitcoin is not to peg it to a fiat currency. Not to sell it back into any kind of dollar. Its whole origin is as a decentralised unit of exchange over the internet.\n\nThe bigger picture when it all began was to have a world where you would buy and sell goods in Bitcoin. You could get your income in Bitcoin even. The whole idea was to wrest control away from government cronies and to have no restriction on where you could or couldn’t use it.\n\nThe way I see it, if you become a publicly traded Bitcoin mining company you completely fly in the face of the whole point of Bitcoin.\n\nThat indicates to me you don’t believe in the bigger picture of Bitcoin. And by intrinsically having to peg it back to a fiat currency, you’re helping to destroy its very purpose.\n\nSo if you’re one of those people, like the Prime Minster of Australia, who’s investing in Bitcoin Group, be aware of the high — the very high — risk.\n\nOf course, whether you choose to invest in this ASX IPO is entirely up to you.\n\nBut do your research and understand what’s really going on. At a bare minimum understand what Bitcoin is and its intention. And only then should you make a decision.\n\nRegards,\n\nSam', 'The final chapter in the case of the United States of America vs Ross Ulbricht’s assets, from the Silk Road seizure, is coming to a conclusion in a few short weeks. The US Marshals Service (USMS) has now announced that the remaining 44,341.55308401 BTC, held in connection with the criminal conviction and civil forfeiture action against Ulbricht, will be auctioned off in early November.\n\nOut of the total bitcoin seized, approximately 29,655 were recovered from servers used to run the Silk Road website, and approximately 144,336 were from computer hardware belonging to Ulbricht, and were seized when he was arrested.\n\nThere have been four USMS auctions for bitcoin relating to Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road case, two in 2014 and two in 2015, with the very last auction scheduled for November 5. All auctions are online-only, and bidders must be pre-approved by the USMS.\n\nBefore the first auction, all of the bitcoins that were part of the civil forfeiture and criminal action brought against Ross Ulbricht, and the assets of Silk Road previously held in an FBI wallet, were transferred into two U.S. Marshals wallets. The first wallet held bitcoin for the first auction, and the other wallet held approximately 144,342 remaining bitcoins.\n\nThe first auction took place on June 27, 2014, from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. EST, lasting 12 hours. Almost 30,000 bitcoins were auctioned in 10 blocks, and the duration of this first auction was twice as long as the other auctions. The price of bitcoin dropped before the end of the auction but rose substantially by the end of the auction period.\n\nAt the end of that historic first auction, the USMS said on their website that one bidder had stepped forward to pick up all of the blocks, worth about US$17.7 million. A few days later, on July 2, Bitcoin VC Tim Draper announced to the world that he was the winning bidder, and would be using those coins for liquidity on the OTC derivatives platform Mirror. July 2 was another bullish day for bitcoin, with a similar volume spike.\n\nThe second auction came almost six months later, on December 4, 2014, from 8:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. EST, when exactly 50,000 bitcoins were auctioned in 20 blocks. This time the auction lasted only six hours, and similar to the first auction, the price of bitcoin rose, although a major selloff had occurred just two hours before the auction commenced.\n\nAlmost immediately after the second auction the winner of 19 of those 20 blocks, worth about US$18m, revealed themselves. It was a syndicate of 104 investors pooling their money together to buy some cheap coins, all led by bitcoin advocate and Venture Capitalist Barry Silbert.\n\nThe following day the USMS confirmed it was Silbert’s group, saying ""Because SecondMarket has voluntarily come forward, we can confirm that it was the winner of 48,000 bitcoins, and the transfer of those bitcoins was completed Monday.” They also revealed that the number of bidders registered for the second auction was about a quarter of the number of those registered for the first. We later learned that the remaining block of 2,000 bitcoins had been picked up by Tim Draper, adding to his holdings.\n\nThree months later, on March 5, and also for six hours between 8:00am EST and 2:00pm EST, the USMS auctioned the third batch of 50,000 more bitcoins, which were put up for auction in 20 blocks. The price of bitcoin dipped slightly during the sale, only to shoot up soon after the auction. Again, a major selloff preceded the auction, this time by 15 hours.\n\nLess is known about the winners of this auction, except that there were three winners, and New York-based exchange itBit reported that it had picked up the first 3,000 coins. The second winner is completely unknown, but the final winner is suspected of having ties to a mysterious company called Cumberland Mining & Materials LLC, which has a very cryptic website displaying a mining cart and an email address. So basically, there are 47,000 bitcoins out there from this auction that are no longer in the government’s hands, but only the USMS knows the real identity of their owners.\n\nHere we are, almost eight months later, and the final auction for 22 blocks of bitcoins is round the corner. Like the two previous auctions, this auction will be for six hours, and run from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. EST on November 5.\n\nAs with previous auctions, interested participants must first pre-register through the USMS website, between October 19 and November 2. Potential bidders must have completed all registration requirements and received an official Bid Form from the USMS to participate in the auction. Bids will only be accepted by email, and foreign citizens can participate as long as all deposit and purchase funds are from a US bank.\n\nAfter this auction there should be no more large caches of confiscated, federally held bitcoins, as the US Department of Justice has not announced any more substantial bitcoin seizures. In addition, the USMS has not announced any more holding of bitcoins either. Therefore, the risk of the US government releasing a substantial amount of bitcoin, flooding the market and sending the price of bitcoin on a downward spiral at exchanges, should soon be eliminated.\n\nWith the potential risk of bitcoin flooding the market substantially reduced, investor confidence in the price of bitcoin should improve to some extent. As we’ve seen in the three previous auctions, some sell-offs were observed either before or during the auction, but bitcoin prices eventually finished higher during or soon after the auction period.', 'Tunisia is using elements of a decentralised ledger system to replicate the success of mobile money system MPesa, with a more interoperable e-cash protocol backed by La Poste Tunisienne and the country\'s central bank.\n\nMonetas, the software provider in this case, told IBTimes: ""The Monetas platform offers a future proof architecture which could enable La Poste Tunisienne to one day connect to open standard distributed ledger systems such as the bitcoin blockchain.

Today that is in the form of eDinar which is a kind of a card based online payment tool and now with our system they will issue that on mobile phones as well.\n\nAmmann said DigitUs, La Poste and the central bank will act as a notaries handling the transactions, and over time more notaries will be pooled together working in parallel in a distributed ledger model.\n\nHe said: ""What we are launching today is basically the first level of that - where you have one notary which is managed by the public/private ownership of La Poste so that you get this distributed ledger system.""\n\nThe aim is for mobile operators to join the system so that different players in the market can all work on the same platform.\n\nAmmann also said the Monetas model would work out cheaper than mobile money systems like MPesa.\n\n""The minimum fees which Mpesa and similar systems are charging are something like 20 to 30 cents a transaction.

10/10/2015,"['An Australia-based startup has announced plans for a digital currency called Identabit that will enable regulatory acceptance by way of user association. The startup, Thinking Active, characterizes Identabit as the first identity-ensured, decentralized currency. It represents a way to liberate decentralized currencies and will be an alternative to bitcoin, according to a recent press release.\n\nIdentabit is the result of a collaboration between Thinking Active, owned by New York software entrepreneur John Underwood, and Cryptonomex, a Virginia-based software company led by Dan Larimer. The press release identifies Larimer as the principal architect of the Blockchain 2.0 project, BitShares. (Bitshares, according to the release, was the first chain to introduce decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs), smart contracts, a decentralized exchange and delegated proof of stake (DPoS), a scalable way to confirm block chains.)\n\nIdentity-Ensured Bitcoin Alternative\n\nOne goal of Identabit is to protect decentralized currencies with what Underwood calls an identity-ensured bitcoin alternative.\n\nWith the increased regulatory attention directed at bitcoin, brought on by the stream of crime empowered by anonymity, we concluded that there was a need for a chain that enabled AML/CTF compliance, enhanced funds security, denial of crimes empowered by anonymity, and ensured security of transfer by way of user association\n\nUnderwood said.\n\nThe Identabit website states that bitcoin’s fight to be accepted by regulators has been lost and is hurting the chances for a neutral global currency to gain acceptance. Governments will not ignore issues related to anonymous cross-border transactions. A decentralized alternative is needed or banks and centralized operators will suppress decentralized technologies.\n\nUnderwood said Identabit can be described as a permission-based ledger that allows proof of reserve that does not subject transactions to public scrutiny. He said there are benefits in offering a choice between anonymity and identity.\n\nIdentabit also addresses P2P/AML/CTF compliance, user-issued funds transfer, privacy and transparent governance.\n\nAlso read: Bitshares exclusive interview – on decentralized autonomous companies\n\nIdentabit Poses Development Challenges\n\nUsing a decentralized block chain to provide an identity-ensured currency has posed its development challenges, the website notes. The website expands on the challenges of transaction identification, block chain auditability, transaction privacy, theft prevention, decentralized governance, institutional integration, simplified registration, reversible transactions and more.\n\nAn important Identabit feature is transaction scale, the release notes. Using DPoS, the team has been able to benchmark transaction capacity that exceeds that of Mastercard’s claimed 24,000 TPS. Such cale is important if IDentabit is to replace existing payment networks with P2P transactions.\n\nUnderwood said the growing interest from institutions in block chain technology has motivated the timing of Identabit’s release. He noted many institutions are collaborating with IBM and Ethereum. These teams are interested in building institutionalized identity-based alternatives.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Many people interested in Bitcoin have a less than optimistic view about the health of the global economy. This skepticism — in some cases pessimism — is fueled by a controversial business cycle theory that is fairly popular in Bitcoin circles. This theory holds that the easy money created by central and fractional reserve banks induce entrepreneurs to embark upon projects that are are not actually profitable. This action sparks a series of events, in which the economy booms, reaches a peak, and then comes crashing down.\n\nAlso read: The Blythe Masters Philosophy: Pay no Attention to Bitcoin\n\nAlthough this theory is highly contested in academic economics circles, a sizeable portion of the Bitcoin community stands by it; I happen to agree with this theory as well. Thus, believing this theory to hold valuable information about real world markets, us Bitcoiners often wonder about what will happen to our beloved digital currency if the “big one” comes — a recession so bad that the traditional financial system goes offline for good.\n\nBitcoin supporters tend to view such an event as a devastating blow to society, but a potential opportunity for Bitcoin to prove its salt. As the old fiat currencies collapse, people will flock to Bitcoin as a modern safe haven asset — the 21st century version of gold. Consequently, Bitcoin will see an eruption in purchasing power and global acceptance, quickly becoming the global currency of choice in a post-collapse economy.\n\nThere have already been some smaller-scale demonstrations of this potential. In 2013, the government of Cyprus announced a radical move, in which it would tap into the personal bank deposits of citizens as part of a bail out plan. Cyprus residents flocked to bitcoin as a way to keep the government away from their wealth; the bitcoin price and trading volume soared in response to this demand from Cyprus. Two years later in the Summer of 2015, Bitcoin faced a similar situation when the global economy threatened to take a turn for the worst. Greece faced a debt crisis and a possible exit from the European Union, while the Chinese economy took a nasty fall. The bitcoin price took off when many Chinese citizens — in addition to people speculating about a grexit — rushed to the Bitcoin markets to shore up their wealth.\n\nAnd so many Bitcoiners lie in wait, strongly believing that the next global downturn will be the seminal turning point in Bitcoin’s history.\n\nThese people may be in for a disappointing reality though, because it’s possible that traditional finance’s fall will be anticlimactic, while the rise of bitcoin fails to happen overnight. Although many people think that recessions will get progressively worse until the economy collapses, economic theory suggests multiple ways for recessions to vary in length and intensity. The next recession could be extremely severe, or it could be relatively mild — past recessions do not determine the severity of future downturns. Consequently, Bitcoin’s adoption rate in response to recessions will not necessarily be linear. If a recession is particularly bad, Bitcoin might get a significant bump in use. On the other hand, smaller recessions might not worry people enough to consider using a different currency.\n\nSo, does this mean that mass Bitcoin adoption is an enthusiast’s ? Not exactly. Undoubtedly, traditional finance is not in good shape. It took 6 years for the US unemployment rate to reach the Federal Reserve’s target of 5.5%, and a large chunk of that lowered rate came from people dropping out of the workforce altogether rather than finding jobs. Furthermore, jobs reports have been mixed; some months saw higher than expected growth, while other months have been less than stellar. Outside the US, the rest of the world’s economy is shaky at best. China’s economy has plummeted, with the People’s Bank entering damage control. Greece and Puerto Rico both face potential debt crises, which could rock global markets. Meanwhile, central banking policy seems to be losing its bite; the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at near 0% for almost 10 years, with not much to show in the post-2008 economy. Traditional fiat may very well fall at some point, but it could be a slow burn. Thus, Bitcoin still has plenty of room to become a fiat-killer, just maybe not as soon as some people would prefer.\n\nOf course, we could still have the “big one.” We might experience a depression so severe that the public flocks to a new monetary system en masse — with Bitcoin being a good candidate. But we must understand that doomsday might not come, and Bitcoiners might have to endure a long and bumpy ride. The world might have to give up on traditional finance bit-by-bit, with Bitcoin offering itself as a worthy alternative.\n\nDo you think there will be a huge crash that will catapult Bitcoin into the mainstream?

In a post-BitLicense environment, many companies have decided to exclude New York state clients, the home of Wall Street.\n\nThere are a handful of companies that have taken the road less travelled. itBit and Gemini have obtained Trust Charters, avoiding the BitLicence altogether, which allows them to offer services in one of the world\'s most lucrative markets. itBit obtained its charter in May, and started operating a fully compliant and regulated bitcoin exchange, Gemini has has now joined them.\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss are venture capitalists, internet entrepreneurs, and the driving force behind Gemini, Latin for “twins.” The brothers first discovered bitcoin in 2012. “We were immediately taken in by Bitcoin\'s elegance and enormous promise, and as we started to learn more, we became convinced that Bitcoin was the future of money,” Tyler stated in a Reddit Ask Me Anything\n\n- Cameron Winklevoss\n\nTrust Companies are granted charters by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a regulatory body that supervises a number of different types of institutions, from private bankers to Credit Unions, Banks, and Trust Companies. “A trust company is an entity that is authorized by the Superintendent to exercise fiduciary (trust) powers,” states the NYDFS.\n\n- NYDFS\n\nAs Trust Companies, itBit and Gemini act as a custodians for their US customers assets. All deposits must be backed with capital reserves and the exchanges have a legal duty to act on behalf of their customers interests. itBit explains that, “the trust charter application process is far more rigorous than that for obtaining the BitLicense or money transmitter licenses.”\n\nAccompanying their launch, the twins conducted an ‘Ask Me Anything’ on reddit. They explained that Gemini has been built on top of four key tenets, product, security, compliance and licensing.“Our view of the world is that you have to get all four completely right,” said Cameron.\n\nCameron stated they have taken licensing requirements very seriously, along with a secure cold storage vault system, “which should hopefully be music to most people\'s ears,” said Tyler.\n\nWith what the twins call a ‘security first’ mentality, some of Geminis very first employees were security experts. Their Chief Security Officer, Cem Paya, has worked with AirBNB, Google Wallet and Microsoft’s security group. “We\'ve used the best practices, multi-signature technology, hardware security modules, geographically distributed vault systems we\'ve spent about a year and a half building,” said Tyler\n\nThe twins advise that they are currently operating in over half of the States in America, and are committed to being fully operational in all 50 states at a later date. According to Cameron Winklevoss, some states will require the exchange to file as a Money Transmitter, “but that was something we couldn\'t do until we were licensed in New York”\n\n- Cameron\n\nAccording to their website, itBit are able to provide services to customers across the US and globally, out of their head offices in New York and Singapore. “With the trust, itBit is the first regulated bitcoin exchange based in New York State able to accept customers from across the United States,” states the company site. “itBit works with regulators around the world to shape the future of bitcoin and digital currency regulation. We are focused on meeting global regulatory requirements while adapting to the ever-changing compliance landscape.”\n\nGemini will follow suite in suite in due course, expanding into Europe and Asia, while also building upon its services. This includes considering other digital currencies. “You\'ll notice that we didn\'t put the name \'bit\' in our name on purpose – with that said, we\'re going to wait to an extent to see what the users are demanding and what people are asking for, rather than try to guess ourselves,” said Cameron\n\n- Tyler Winklevoss\n\nitBit, on the other hand, recently announced that their new project will use its own proprietary token. Set to launch at the end of this year, Bankchain will will focus on the precious metals industry.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of itBit, Charles Cascarilla told the International Business Times, ""The fact is that in the current gold market there is no delivery versus payment. Payments are happening either one day to five or six days difference from the movement of the asset. So that creates a lot of risk in the market and it\'s a big market. It trades $250bn a day which is more than US equity market. It\'s like the fifth or sixth largest asset class in the world - US dollar versus gold.""\n\n- Charles Cascarilla, itBit CEO\n\nGemini’s upcoming Exchange Traded fund (ETF) garnered a lot of interest from the Reddit crowd. This type of fund owns tan underlying asset, such as stocks, oil, gold bars or in this case, bitcoin.\n\nThis provides ETF shareholders with exposure to the underlying assets price movements, but without the need to purchase, store or handle the physical resource. The twins advised that they are unable to publicly discuss the ETF regulatory process, “but rest assured we\'re working as hard as possible to make it happen and we want this as much as anyone else.”\n\nCameron compared the current state of bitcoin to that of pre-broadband internet, describing how hard it would have been to imagine the internet of today 20 years ago.“right now there\'s lots of companies like Gemini trying to build the bridges and tunnels and connect the island of bitcoin to the mainland of finance and bringing people into the system.”\n\nWhile itBit and Gemini both circumvented the digital currency focused BitLicence, there is one company that didn’t. Circle Internet Financial recently became the first company to be approved for the license and itBit see this as a positive move, “The BitLicense is an important step forward in encouraging wider consumer confidence and industry acceptance of digital currencies and technology. We understand there’s various levels of enthusiasm for it but, net-net, this is a positive for the industry.”', 'Three months ago, Chris Gledhill was an innovation technologist at one of the UK\'s largest banks, Lloyds.\n\nWhile it was a great job, he told CoinDesk, it was also incredibly frustrating. The scale of the bank meant he had insight into clear problems with the financial system, but it also meant he lacked any ability to change them.\n\nSo, he quit. Now, with the help of three (unnamed) co-founders Gledhill is building a \'blockchain-inspired\' challenger bank, Secco.\n\nThe aim is simple, he says: ""To disrupt banking from the outside in, rather than the inside out.""\n\nBanking on bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, like many FinTech projects, owes much of its origin story to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nAlthough bitcoin\'s first users sought it out as an alternative to a \'broken\' financial system, six years on its technology is now in the hands of their enemies: the banks.\n\nJust last month, a further 13 joined startup R3CEV\'s campaign to establish a set of blockchain standards for the industry. (Lloyds is so far absent from its list.)\n\nFor Gledhill, this and other efforts, including VC investment in startups, simply aren\'t enough. He\'s ""largely frustrated"" at the level of innovation seen both inside and outside the world\'s largest financial services firms:\n\n""It\'s been incremental at best ... They\'re all saying \'OK, let\'s put it on the blockchain\', but nobody is having a real look at whether that\'s still the ideal construct for how we go about financial services.""\n\n""Even outside [the banks], the FinTech communities are innovating around existing financial protocols – making them cheaper, faster, better. They\'re not trying to actually reinvent these things,"" he added.\n\nThis includes things like loans, mortgages and current accounts – the contracts for which are often centuries old, according to Gledhill.\n\nWhile he maintains it\'s not enough to simply tag these products onto new rails, a growing number of blockchain startups and R&D teams are now attempting to do just this.\n\nItBit\'s Bankchain and Blythe Masters\' Digital Asset Holdings are among those digitising financial assets, while startups like Everledger are targeting physical goods in the supply chain, or in CEO Leanne Kemp\'s words, putting ""bling on the blockchain"".\n\nHow Secco works\n\nHow will Secco be different, then? For a start, Gledhill said, it won\'t be anything like the image of a bank you\'ve got in your head.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it won\'t have branches – challenger banks don\'t tend to – but it also won\'t have an app, nor an interface to speak of.\n\nInstead, Secco will operate as an \'underlying\' service hidden in all the apps and social platforms we use day-to-day. The aim of the game is ""customer disengagement,"" Gledhill said.\n\n""We\'ve been almost deliberately disruptive in that we\'ve taken what makes a bank today and pushed the needle in the opposite direction. The right answer is probably in the middle somewhere.""\n\nIt\'s not all about money, either. Down the road, Secco wants its users to become \'data brokers\' – treating their data as a currency to spend, lend and invest.\n\nSecco and its users will each hold a cryptographic key, and both will be needed to confirm a transaction, in Secco\'s in-house token-based digital currency, from which the bank will take a small cut.\n\nThe bank will be built around a distributed database, which functions in a similar fashion to bitcoin\'s blockchain. The entire data of the bank is spread around everybody\'s phone, so it\'s owned by everybody and nobody.\n\nHowever, it will run on something Gledhill calls a \'blocktree\', currently awaiting patent, which he claims will solve a lot of the problems that come with bitcoin\'s technology.\n\n""The blockchain is a linear structure, it\'s very rigid. A blocktree gives you the ability to branch off these separate, mini blockchains to do offline transactions which can be merged at a later date.""\n\nDue to the patent process, Gledhill said he cold not divulge further details about the technology, but hinted it would be a fairly open platform for people to challenge Secco\'s standards.\n\nChallenging circumstances\n\nIn recent months, a number of so-called challenger banks have arrived to take on the UK’s ‘Big Four’: Lloyds Banking Group, RBS, HSBC and Barclays.\n\nWhile insiders have described the digital revolution as ""seismic"", it appears customer habits in the nation could prove challenging to break.\n\nStatistics from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority indicate 37% of consumers have held the same account for 20 years or more. Meanwhile, only 3% switched banking providers in 2014.\n\nIf customers are loathe to switch their provider, how will they be convinced to go with an app-less, branch-less alternative?\n\nGledhill says it\'s a tough sell, however Secco – which is currently ""receiving interest"" from investors – won\'t drop consumers in at the deep end too soon.\n\nNext year, the firm will introduce users to its initial product, Aura, a location-based app that gives users the ability to trade data with others in a range of 60 meters.\n\nFor example, a user could receive a restaurant voucher in return for a tweet, or a number of other non-financial transactions.\n\nAlthough far from Secco\'s utopian vision, Aura is needed to ""lasso these giant concepts into something that makes sense for people,"" Gledhill said.\n\n""There is a customer journey we need to take people on, you\'re not going to get everybody suddenly throwing away all their money ... and become a data broker of themselves. We have to articulate that value for them.""\n\nHe added:\n\n""If people are not sure what we are, we believe we are onto something. If they don\'t think we are a bank that\'s potentially a good thing.""\n\nCanary Wharf image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

They are completely different from bitcoin and other altcoins that are based on it. These new digital currencies are known as identifiable digital currencies. Unlike bitcoin, identifiable digital currencies require the users to provide their identity and verify the same before executing any transaction.\n\nNobody cared about bitcoin in the early days. Bitcoin, when it was first introduced was categorized along with other digital game currencies back then. The main reason for bitcoin to gain popularity, or should we say notoriety was its widespread adoption among deep web users because of a certain degree of anonymity associated with it.\n\nBitcoin has come a long way since then. Bitcoin community is growing in a rapid pace and the digital currency is now widely used across the world. With increasing bitcoin usage, the very property that led to its popularity has now become a cause of concern. Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature. Even though bitcoin transactions are transparent and can easily be tracked to wallets, identifying the person or an entity owning a particular wallet is not an easy task. It requires a lot of resources and time to come up with an ID.\n\nREAD MORE: Bitcoin Community to Hit 5 Million Mark by 2019\n\nBitcoin has been increasingly used by criminals and money launderers, which has led to bitcoin being referred to as the most preferred currency of the criminals. Increasing instances of cybercrimes alongside regular crimes involving bitcoin in one way or another has forced many governments and law enforcement agencies to put their foot down on bitcoin and other digital currencies. As the regulatory noose tightens around present day digital currencies like bitcoin, their growth and potential to do good is also hampered.\n\nIdentifiable digital currencies requires the users to furnish some kind of identification information, maybe their email id, phone number etc. in order to be able to conduct transactions. Users will be able to transfer these identifiable digital currencies by sending it to associated email id or phone number instead of using a long string of characters as in bitcoin wallet address. This will make transactions a lot easier and user friendly. It will also deter criminals from using these identifiable digital currencies for unlawful activities or for transferring ill-gotten wealth. These new breed of digital currencies can be made AML and CTF complaint by default, with records maintained under strict privacy controls by associated platforms will make it more regulation friendly. This will provide a much needed leeway to alternative digital currency to offer its services across the world while complying with existing regulations.\n\nThe very concept of identifiable digital currency may sound blasphemous to many ardent followers of bitcoin and proponents of anonymity and privacy. And there is still no clarity regarding its reception among the masses as these identifiable digital currencies are either still in development or pilot project stages.\n\nREAD MORE: Identabit — A New Take on Digital Currency', '21 Inc es una de las empresas más importantes en el ecosistema Bitcoin.

After a gap up opening on Monday morning to start the week, the market made higher highs and lows every day ending the week at SPX 2015. For the week the SPX/DOW gained 3.5%, the NDX/NAZ gained 2.5%, and the DJ World index gained 4.4%. Economic reports for the week continued their neutral to negative bias. On the uptick: wholesale inventories, the WLEI, GDPn and weekly jobless claims improved. On the downtick: ISM services, consumer credit, export/import prices, the MMIS and the trade deficit expanded. Next week, a busy week, we get Industrial production, the FED’s Beige book, and Retail sales.\n\nLONG TERM: bull market\n\nWe continue to count this six year bull market as Cycle wave [1] from the SPX 667 Super cycle low. Cycle wave bull markets unfold in five primary waves. Primary waves I and II completed in 2011, with Primary II taking the form of an elongated flat. Primary III completed in May 2015, and Primary IV probably completed at the August lows. If not, it will likely extend for a few more months, due to alternation, before it does complete. Primary V is now the main focus, because when it ends so does the bull market.\n\nThe day after the SPX 1872 retest of the August SPX 1867 low we posted two possible counts. Primary IV ended in August and Primary V is underway, (hourly/weekly charts), and Primary IV may still extend for a few months longer to satisfy P4 v P2 alternation, (daily chart). The deciding factor, as noted, would be determined by the current uptrend. Should the uptrend impulse higher Primary V is underway. If not, Primary IV continues. The current uptrend clearly appears to be impulsing. With the SPX 1867 low in mind we posted some potential targets for Primary V. They are noted on the weekly chart above.\n\nMEDIUM TERM: uptrend\n\nThe main advantage of OEW over EW is that it quantifies all medium and long term waves. We can’t just place a label on the weekly chart because it looks right. We can only place labels where there are actual, quantified, turning points. This does not mean we always know where the market is heading in advance. No one does. What it does provide is a view of the most obvious future path of the market medium and long term.\n\nJust after the late-September SPX 1872 retest of the low OEW confirmed an uptrend. As noted in the previous section, this suggested two possible paths. We somewhat favored the Primary IV low in late-August, because this would satisfy the P4 v P2 alternation now. This is why we posted that count on the hourly/weekly chart. Despite the mixed signals from other indices and indicators, the DOW/NDX/NAZ clearly displayed the potential for the low in August.\n\nSince this uptrend had quite an odd, and somewhat confusing, beginning we will explain the count. From the SPX 1867 low the market rallied quickly in five waves: 1915-1880-1990-1948-1993. We had labeled this Major wave 1. Then Major 2 went into a long extended corrective pattern: 1903-2021-1872. We labeled this as an irregular zigzag. Does it look right? No. But that is the pattern the market presented.\n\nWhen the market started to rally off the SPX 1872 low it started off with a similar irregular pattern, but on a much smaller scale. The market rallied to SPX 1917, then did an irregular flat for the pullback: 1897-1927-1894. After that it advanced to SPX 1992-1972-1999 by Wednesday this week, completing another five waves up. Clearly this uptrend is looking impulsive. More on this below. Medium term support is at the 1973 and 1956 pivots, with resistance at the 2019 and 2070 pivots.\n\nSHORT TERM\n\nWith Major wave 1 @ SPX 1993 and Major 2 @ SPX 1872, Major wave 3 has been underway. Thus far we can count five waves up from SPX 1872: 1917-1894-1992-1974-1999. We have labeled this Int. i of Major 3. Then we labeled the pullback to SPX 1976 as Int. ii. Intermediate wave iii should now be underway from that low. When it completes, there will be an Int. iv pullback, then an Int. v rally to complete Major wave 3. We will count the waves, and note them on the daily updates as the uptrend unfolds. Thus far Int. iii has rallied to SPX 2020 in just one wave from the SPX 1976 Int. ii low. There should be five waves up before it concludes.\n\nShort term support is at SPX 2000 and the 1973 pivot, with resistance at the 2019 pivot and SPX 2040. Short term momentum ended the week just above neutral.

Abundant supply + sagging demand = declining prices.\n\nEventually, prices rise to a level that is unaffordable to the majority of potential buyers, with demand coming only from the wealthy. That’s the story of housing in New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area and other desirable locales that are currently magnets for global capital.\n\nIn the normal cycle of supply and demand, new more affordable housing would be built, and prices would decline.\n\nBut that isn’t happening in hot real estate markets in the U.S. What’s happening is rental housing is being built to profit from rising rents and luxury housing is being built to meet the demand from wealthy overseas buyers.\n\nWith limited land in desirable urban zones and high development fees, it’s not possible to build affordable housing unless the government subsidizes the costs.\n\nMeanwhile, the supply of existing homes for sale is limited by the owners’ recognition that they won’t be able to replace their own home as prices soar; it makes financial sense to stay put rather than sell and try to move up.\n\nSome homeowners are cashing in their high-priced homes and retiring to cheaper regions. But this supply is being overwhelmed by a flood of offshore cash seeking real estate in the U.S.\n\nThis is part of the global capital flows I described in my recent analysis What Happens Next Will Be Determined By One Thing: Capital Flows. As China and the emerging market economies stagnate, capital that was invested in these markets in the boom years is moving into dollar-denominated assets such as bonds and houses.\n\nThis globalization of regional housing markets is pricing the middle class out of housing in areas that also happen to be strong job markets.\n\nMany commentators are concerned that a nation of homeowners is being transformed into a nation of renters, as housing is snapped up by hedge funds and wealthy elites fleeing China and the emerging markets.\n\nBut will current conditions continue unchanged going forward?\n\nLet's start with the basics of demographic demand for housing and the price of housing.\n\nDemographics & Housing Valuations\n\nThere are plenty of young people who'd like to buy a house and start a family (a.k.a. new household formation), but few have the job or income to buy a house at today's nosebleed levels -- a level just slightly less insane than the prices at the top of Housing Bubble #1:\n\n(Charts courtesy of Market Daily Briefing)\n\nThe current Housing Bubble #2 (also known as the Echo Bubble) certainly isn’t being driven by rising household income, as median household income has declined when adjusted for inflation:\n\nWhat enabled households to buy homes as prices pushed higher? Super-low mortgage rates:\n\nNow that mortgage rates have hit bottom, there’s not much room left to push housing valuations higher by lowering rates. No matter how solid the buyers’ credit rating, mortgages remain intrinsically risky, as unexpected medical emergencies, job losses, divorces, etc., trigger defaults in the best of times. In recessions, job losses typically cause defaults and lenders’ losses to rise.\n\nAll debt, including home mortgages, is based on household income and debt levels. The higher the debt load, the more money the household must devote to debt service. That leaves less to spend on additional debt or other spending.\n\nAs this chart shows, the ratio of debt-to-earned income (wages and salaries) has declined since the speculative frenzy of Housing Bubble # 1, but it remains almost twice the levels of the pre-bubble era:\n\nBased on the fundamentals of domestic income -- debt levels and current home prices -- only the top 10% of households has much hope of owning a home in globally desirable regions:\n\nIf domestic buyers can no longer afford to buy, then who’s left? Cash buyers from overseas is one answer.\n\nCapital Flows into U.S. Real Estate\n\nChinese millionaires buying homes for cash in the U.S. and Canada have been voting on conditions in China with their feet. The tide of money leaving China has turned into a veritable flood, with hundreds of billions of dollars leaving China in the past year aone as economic conditions there deteriorated.\n\nThis flood tide can be seen in real estate transactions, not just in the U.S. but in Australia, Canada and the U.K.:\n\nThese cash purchases by wealthy foreign nationals are creating a bifurcated housing market. In areas deemed desirable, Chinese and other foreign nationals are dominating the market (see: 80% Of All New Home Buyers in Irvine, CA Are Chinese).\n\nIn regions that are below the radar of offshore buyers, for example, broad swaths of the Midwest, home prices remain more affordable.\n\nBut even domestic markets with relatively few foreign buyers have seen soaring home prices if there is strong job growth and limited land for new development.\n\nA Bifurcated Housing Market: The New Normal?\n\nThese dynamics have created islands of strong job growth and global/domestic demand for housing in which only the wealthy can afford to buy and everyone else is a renter for life. These islands are surrounded by a sea of lower-cost housing in regions with weak job growth and stagnant wages.\n\nIs this bifurcation the New Normal? Or is Housing Bubble #2 heading for the same shoals that popped housing bubble #1 in 2007-08?\n\nRight now, the general consensus is that housing prices “will never decline” in New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, etc.—the islands of job growth and high valuations--due to the strong U.S. economy and capital flows into USD-denominated assets. But if the bulk of this capital flow has already occurred, and capital controls and clawbacks become the order of the day, this prop under current nosebleed housing valuations might be kicked away far sooner than anticipated.\n\nIn Part 2: How A Major Housing Correction Can Happen Over The Next 1.5 Years we examine the strong argument can be made that conditions are far more fragile in this Bubble #2, as the global recession that is rapidly spreading around the globe can’t be reversed with the same bag of tricks that worked in 2008-09.I expect home valuations to fall rather quickly once capital flows out of China drop off and the recession swamps America’s economy.\n\nHistory suggests that the markets that soared the most are also the ones that collapse the farthest.\n\nClick here to read Part 2 of this report (free executive summary, enrollment required for full access)\n\nBy Charles Hugh Smith\n\nhttp://www.peakprosperity.com\n\n© 2014 Copyright Adam Taggart - All Rights Reserved\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

Since World War II, the average length of time between recessions is about 58 months. With the current cycle clocking in at 81, it’s natural to wonder if the next downturn is imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, a worrying level of data from abroad shows that the troubles in emerging markets are beginning to affect the developed world:\n\nIn Germany, Europe’s strongest economy, exports fell 5.2% in August from the previous month, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden announced on Thursday.\n\nIn the U.K., where growth had been outstripping most of the rest of the developed world, recent data shows output in Britain’s construction sector plunged by 4.3% in August, the sharpest monthly drop since 2012.\n\nIn Japan, things don’t look much better. Serious declines in industrial output over the summer suggest to some that the world’s third largest economy has already fallen back into recession.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also sees global economic trouble up ahead. In an op-ed published on Thursday titled “The global economy is in serious danger,” he argues that rising economic inequality, slowing population growth, and the increased need for financial regulation, and the fact that the innovation that is taking place isn’t very labor intensive all point to a slowdown.\n\nAnother analyst asking whether we are headed for, or already in, a global recession is Willem Buiter, Chief Economist at Citigroup.\n\nBuiter relies on a different definition of global recession than what is used to define such an event in a single advanced economy like the United States. While he doesn’t see global growth contracting, he does believe that growth has already fallen below its potential, and that the problem is only going to get worse. In a note to clients this week, Buiter writes:\n\nActual global output growth, although positive . . . is already below likely potential global output growth, which we estimate at 3%, meaning that the output gap is widening. Another year of sub- potential growth would therefore imply that the world economy would probably be back in recession according to both our criteria.\n\nSummers thinks the worrying economic data we are seeing is just the beginning of troubling economic times, because none of the factors contributing to what he has called “secular stagnation” are set to dissipate anytime soon. He argues that the only thing propping up the global economy since 2008 has been “the strength of emerging markets.” But investment there is quickly reversing course, finding its way back into developed bond markets, pushing interest rates even lower than they already are. Summers writes:\n\nThis is no time for complacency. The idea that slow growth is only a temporary consequence of the 2008 financial crisis is absurd. The latest data suggest growth is slowing in the United States, and it is already slow in Europe and Japan. A global economy near stall speed is one where the primary danger is recession.\n\nIn his op-ed, Summers argues that the wealthy world needs to take the lead in preventing this outcome, first by keeping interest rates near zero until there is a clear sign of inflation. More important, however, is to implement “expansionary fiscal policy,” or borrow at the low rates the global economy is offering governments like the U.S., Germany and the U.K. to invest in infrastructure.\n\nUnfortunately for those who agree with Summers, more government spending doesn’t appear to be coming anytime soon. For years, Germany has resisted calls to spend more, while the conservative parties in the United States and the U.K. are doing their best to cut budgets, not expand them.\n\nFurther hurting Summers’ case is the fact that the United States is not seeing the same signs of slowing growth as the rest of the world. Sure, September’s jobs report was disappointing, and the S&P 500 has been moving sideways all year. But job growth in 2015 still sits at just under 200,000 new positions per month, while home sales and housing starts figures have been on the upswing. And auto sales just hit a new 10-year high.\n\nMost economists still see the U.S. avoiding recession for at least another year. Last month, Bloomberg surveyed a group of 31 economists, and eight predicted that a recession would hit the United States before 2018. But as troubles in emerging markets bring economic woes to Japan and Europe, it makes sense to question the conventional wisdom.', 'Shaving is a pain. Razors cause nicks, cuts, skin irritation, and razor burn.\n\nBut two Swedes think they have a solution: A razor that shaves hair with a laser, not a blade. They call it the Skarp Razor.\n\nThe project went nuts on Kickstarter but has now been kicked off the crowdfunding site over concerns that it didn\'t have a working prototype.\n\nAs we previously reported, in its first 10 days, the Skarp raised $650,000, blowing by its funding goal of $160,000.\n\nWith eight days left, the project has now raised nearly $3.9 million.\n\nPeople were excited because one of the razor\'s inventors, Morgan Gustavsson, already invented the laser used by many professional laser hair-removal services.\n\nBut that laser has a limitation. It can only identify and cut dark hair. So it can\'t be used to cut light, white, or gray hair.\n\nHe always wanted to invent a consumer razor but needed to solve the light-colored-hair problem first. Now he and his partner Paul Binun say they have.\n\nThey said they have found a part of the hair molecule, no matter what color, that can be identified and cut by a particular wavelength of light.\n\nRaising so much money left the creators feeling ""overwhelmed"" by the response, they said in a new video.\n\nTheir video also addressed some concerns raised in the comments, such as ensuring the laser is safe and that it will only cut hair and not other body parts. They also talked about and how fast they can get the razor from prototype to product and promised to have the Skarp razor out by March 2016, costing $159.\n\nThat wasn\'t enough for the Kickstarter, who booted it from the site, saying the project\'s lack of a working prototype violated the site\'s rules. So the project\'s creators moved to Indiegogo, a site that\'s more known for its buyer-beware fundraising terms of use, where it is still going gangbusters, already raising over $100,000 in its first 10 hours.']"
10/11/2015,"['From the Grexit crisis to the recent block size split debate, Bitcoin frequently finds itself at the center of regular news cycles. As the debates about its price performance, volatility and political implications continue to mount, beneath it all lurks the less obvious but fascinating undercurrent of Bitcoin’s brand equity — and how it continues to evolve under the auspices of a nebulous and often unpredictable entity.\n\nAs a private currency, Bitcoin is ultimately a “consumer product” and, like any other, its success is in large part determined by the engagement it can build with consumers in a free marketplace. To succeed in this has traditionally meant to succeed in marketing strategy — the deliberate discipline of identifying which consumers to target, understanding their deepest emotional needs and communicating how the product in question can meet those needs better than any available alternative — stewarded in a command-and-control fashion. As an inherently leaderless entity, Bitcoin’s brand equity is not stewarded. Ironically, therein lies its greatest strength.\n\nUnderpinning The Consumer Psychology\n\nFrom Coca-Cola (helping consumers find “moments of happiness”) to Harvard (providing one of the highest signals of personal value), brands with the strongest equity have always been those that succeed at aligning themselves with our deepest emotional needs. And that’s what Bitcoin’s message does — that’s its very purpose. Bitcoin is about freedom.\n\nThe Currency Of Freedom\n\nAristotle said, “Wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else.” People use any currency merely as a vehicle to achieve an end goal. And for most of us, that goal is freedom — freedom to choose, freedom to do whatever we want. Why not extend freedom of choice to currency? The idea is not new, but Bitcoin arrives at a moment of unstable economies, growing government reach and a burgeoning global libertarian movement.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin’s brand message so thoroughly, clearly, succinctly and intuitively communicates freedom of choice that its fame can grow through peer-based brand building. The “plan” executes itself, without need for a top-down control.\n\nBrands that embrace freedom win.\n\nCertainly, the phenomenon carries inherent risks. Bitcoin has been mired by its share of scandal, breakdowns and resets. For example, when the exchange Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy in 2014 after $460 million was apparently stolen by hackers, the negative publicity rippled through the currency itself. The notoriety was especially damaging for many members of the general public, already confused and suspicious even about exactly what Bitcoin was.\n\nNonetheless, through it all, Bitcoin has continued to grow its brand equity in the marketplace. Volatility has stabilized. Its legitimacy is increasingly accepted by financial institutions and even governments such as Britain’s. It has attracted Wall Street, with the development of exchange-traded fund–like vehicles, including one by financial celebrities Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Even retailers are coming to accept it.\n\nA Lesson For Brands Everywhere\n\nAll this makes the Bitcoin saga fun to follow in its own right. But it also surprisingly reveals important considerations for other brands universally.\n\nFirst, the success of the freedom message. Freedom is among the most fundamental of human needs. It is perhaps no coincidence that some of the greatest brands of our time are in fact stories of expanding access to freedom. Apple sells freedom of information access with style and ease. Uber sells the freedom of private transportation at your fingertips. American Idol sells the freedom to dream.\n\nSecond, the success of the freedom channel. With the rise of social media, consumers direct the brand message as much as and sometimes even more than the brand stewards. Strategies that encourage consumers to engage with a brand organically lead to lasting loyalty, and even advocacy, in ways never before possible. Brands with conviction in the relevance and loyalty of their equity among consumers have made this transition in marketing mindset well, from Starbucks’ Meet me at Starbucks campaign to Warby Parker’s Home Try-On program. Others, like McDonalds’ infamous Twitter campaign gone awry, have struggled.\n\nThere’s no telling what will drive the next set of news cycles around Bitcoin, nor how the currency will ultimately fare. But until then, it shines a powerful spotlight on a fundamental yet sometimes overlooked tenet of consumer psychology and how to win it: Brands that embrace freedom win.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'Travis Patron is a digital money researcher and curator of the 2015 Bitcoin Investor’s Report. Here he argues that, due to the introduction of blockchain technology, corporations will see computers not only take over as employees, but as customers too.\n\nCorporations are devoting a larger share of capital to automation technologies within businesses across almost every type of industry and sector. Technological innovation, both by way of employee input and customers\' expected output, is undergoing a transformation.\n\nIt\'s an organizational change that reassigns the role of the employee and customer to the domain of computer technology outside the grasp of human intervention with the introduction of blockchain technology and smart contracting systems. Blockchain technology stands to radically transform our concept of the corporation where machines, not humans, are both the customers and employees.\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations\n\nThe World Economic Forum estimates that by 2027, 10% of global GDP will be stored on a blockchain network. In such a world, it will be clear that corporations are less reliant than ever upon humans to survive and prosper. If anything, this solidifies blockchain technology as the blueprint for a type of corporation that is light-years ahead of its 20th century predecessor in terms of resource allocation and communication methods.\n\n20th century business models were characterized by owning rather than sharing, specialization rather than automation, and centralized over decentralized decision making. The bitcoin blockchain economic model does away with all these conventional notions and provides us the blueprint for a 21st century digital paradigm – non-exclusive, decentralized, autonomous corporations.\n\nThis type of corporate model is fundamentally different in its makeup and functionality because, among other things, it is independent of human intervention while simultaneously owned by no single party.\n\nIn the bitcoin digital economy, machines are the employees rather than humans, which were in the industrial age. The role of the employee, and the producer of labour, falls solely on the cryptocurrency miner. In terms of the bitcoin mining function, the product of labour would be the hashing power necessary to verify transaction blocks. The compensation for each employee? The network pays each node compensation equal to the current block reward roughly every 10 minutes.\n\nWhen we come to understand this shift in the makeup of the corporation, we see that the core of its function has undergone a significant change. The blockchain network concept is such an altering framework for conducting business that it shakes the very foundations of what we believe to be a legitimate corporation. Truly, the blockchain network concept represents a milestone in technology innovation.\n\nWhile machines are now becoming employees, customers remain human, but these may soon become machines too, with the implementation of self-executing smart contracts.\n\nUncheatable smart contracts\n\nNetworks of smart contracts have empirical objectives. That is, they\'re functionality will be understood through examination of the source code which it operates by. As it applies to smart contracting systems of the future, open-source systems make for an entirely transparent and uncheatable form of governance. The instances of misuse will come from failing to understand the objectives of the contract or network.\n\nIt is crucial that we note the computing revolution is well past an inflection point. When such technologies first began use in universities and large organizations, they were under the control of many, many humans who all shared one machine. With bitcoin, we have one large, interconnected computer network which controls many, many human counterparts.\n\nMore importantly, it controls one of the most precious aspects of our lives – financial livelihood. An exact reversal of how the computing revolution began is characterized by an inflection point of control which has just recently passed. First we shape our tools, thereafter our tools shape us. As Alan Turing said in his essay Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory, in 1951:\n\n""Once the machine thinking method has started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. ... At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control.""\n\nConclusion\n\nYou can be certain that, just as one computer would work for many humans in times past, many humans will come to work for one main network of machines. Computer technology is capable of achieving this dominance because it rewrites the laws of society with something based on mathematics and science rather than steel and paper.\n\nThe blueprint of blockchain technology represents an important milestone in computing innovation – one which allows digital systems, whether they be for commerce or communication, to operate independently from conventional forms of law.\n\nAs is with the current landscape of bitcoin today, the miners are the employees of the corporation. Mere years ahead however, lies a paradigm where smart contracting begins to populate the role of customer as well.\n\nFeatured image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Setl, a London-based group founded by a group of hedge fund investors and trading executives this year, is also in discussions with about 20 institutions to develop the prototype as a way to standardise processing of payments, from foreign exchange trading to consumer loans. Its move comes as most of the world’s biggest banks are exploring, both individually and collectively, how they can harness blockchains, the algorithms that allow so-called cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to be traded and verified electronically without a central ledger. Using large-scale computing power and decentralised networks for payments and settlement could help banks save billions of dollars a year by improving and outsourcing slow and inefficient back-office settlement; this would cut the amount of collateral held up in global payment systems and reduce transaction costs. The total cost to the finance industry of clearing, settling and managing the post-trade environment is estimated at between $65bn and $80bn a year, according to a report by Oliver Wyman. Existing bitcoin blockchains also fully process and verify payments once every 10 minutes or so, making it unworkable for large-scale use in financial markets. A report by Capgemini and RBS Worldpay this year estimated that just over a billion non-cash payments take place every day. Peter Randall, chief operating officer, said the Setl blockchain was the first to demonstrate that the technology could handle the volumes required by the financial services industry, “where speed, capacity and reliability are crucial”. He said: “Our processing capacity now exceeds the volume of every electronic payment made globally on a live-time gross basis.” Setl, its founders say, is built specifically for financial markets as it settles payments in central bank money and not a cryptocurrency. To test its efficacy, it has created a blockchain engine and simulated real-world payments. It is based on data from the UK payment system, including networks such as Link, CHAPS, BACS and CLS, which settles foreign exchange deals. Despite the buzz and involvement of high-profile individuals such as Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker, banks have been split over how to create a workable blockchain. Some start-ups offer ways to use the existing bitcoin network, but many financial services companies are wary of its past controversies involving theft, money laundering and drugs. Last month Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, described the technology as having “real potential” but added: “Whether a variant of this technology could support central bank-issued digital currency is very much an open question.” Mr Randall co-founded Chi-X Europe a decade ago; it has since become Europe’s largest stock exchange by trading volume. Commercial and investment banks as well as market settlements houses are interested in the technology, he said.', 'Bitcoin mining has become a costly affair. Unlike the initial days bitcoin mining now requires specialized hardware with lots of processing power, which has made individual mining highly uneconomical.\n\nAs we know, most of the bitcoin mining is carried out by big mining companies with dedicated data centres running high powered bitcoin mining application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Few cloud mining companies like Hashnet and ZenMiner had earlier offered options of individual users to buy hashrate and gain returns, proportional to their contribution of processing power to the mining pool. However, this model has failed to catch people’s attention especially after few companies suddenly shut shop in the past.\n\nIndividual bitcoin enthusiasts don’t despair, as there is still hope for you to be involved in bitcoin mining (either directly or indirectly). BITMIN, is a bitcoin mining project initiated by Sathes Kumar, a Chennai, India based techie. The BITMIN project involves setting up a high powered bitcoin mining setup with the help of funds raised from individuals over a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nAccording to press release and other available reports, the BITMIN pool mining initiative is different from other pool mining concepts in terms of investment and returns mode. Conventional bitcoin pool mining model involves miners receiving bitcoin returns depending up the amount of processing power they have contributed to the mining operation. However, with BITMIN, pool miners will be receiving returns in the form of mined bitcoin proportional to their monetary contribution for which they will receive shares.\n\nBITMIN project is currently a two member team who have recently created a fundraising campaign over Indiegogo a well-known crowdfunding platform. BITMIN is looking to raise $50,000 in the first round of crowdfunding campaign. Money raised from this round will be used to build mining rig of 50 TH/s capacity. As it grows, they plan to increase capacity gradually.\n\nAccording to the timeline available on BITMIN’s Indiegogo campaign page, initial BITMIN setup and testing phase is completed. We can expect BITMIN to hit full potential by the end of this year.', ""At a Commonwealth of Nations meeting last week, with senior finance officials and central bank governors, Digital currencies were a topic of discussion, and this time they were brought up as a possible solution to many existing problems.\n\nThe Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 independent and equal sovereign states, home to 2.2 billion citizens. Governor of the Central Bank of Bangladesh, Atiur Rahman, chaired the meeting, and London School of Economics (LSE) Professor Dr. Garrick Hileman gave a presentation on the state of digital currencies. This year’s meeting was a two-day event in Lima, Peru, ahead of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings.\n\nThe discussion quickly focused on the use of digital currencies for remittances, a classic scenario that highlights bitcoin as a cost-effective alternative to current international money transfer channels.\n\n- Samantha Attridge, Commonwealth Secretariat Head of Finance\n\nThere is an increasingly dire global remittance problem. A recent spate of 'de-risking' actions, taken by large international banks, has included closing down Money Transfer Operators' (MTOs) bank accounts, also known as “de-banking.”\n\n- Atiur Rahman, Governor of the Central Bank of Bangladesh\n\nThis trend has central bank governors deeply concerned about the adverse effects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) regulations.\n\nThe problem is advancing as more banks try to avoid large fines and sanctions, by de-banking high-risk customers such as MTOs. De-banking is increasing in frequency, “spreading to more countries,” where it did not exist before, and is “driving people to use informal money transfer channels,” warned Attridge.\n\nLast year two major banks in Australia, the Commonwealth Bank and the National Bank, both closed the accounts of several MTOs. Joining them, the Australian banking giant Westpac closed the bank accounts of MTOs specifically offering services for Somalia.\n\n- Sonia Plaza, World Bank Senior Economist\n\nAt the start of this year, Merchants Bank of California, which handles 60 to 80 percent of the remittances sent to Somalia from the United States, also announced account closures to companies that transfer money on behalf of Somali immigrants, this time from the United States.\n\nA similar situation in the United Kingdom, during 2013, prompted a London High Court to order Barclays PLC to re-bank a small service provider called Dahabshiil, which helps transfer money to Somalia from emigres living all around the world.\n\nBarclays wanted to stop the service after seeing competitor HSBC fined billions, for allowing money-laundering to occur within its bank. Dahabshiil’s service was used by more than 100,000 Somalis living in the United Kingdom alone.\n\nWhether to reduce competition, cut costs, or to comply with regulations, closing MTO bank accounts will force these smaller companies out of business. As discussed by the central bank governors at the Commonwealth meeting, reduced competition leads to increased remittance prices, hitting those in need hardest. According to the World Bank, the average global cost of sending remittances is 7.68%, as of June 2015.\n\nUsers who rely on remittance providers are left with two option, transfer money through banks at a much higher cost, or turn to underground operators, which are usually more difficult to track and monitor for suspicious activity.\n\nAlongside countries like Somalia, Commonwealth small-island developing states, such as Samoa, suffer the most from de-banking actions. “Maiava Atalina Ainu'u-Enari, the Central Bank Governor of Samoa, informed delegates that all money transfer businesses in her country had been shut down,” states the Commonwealth Meeting Report.\n\n- Maiava Atalina Ainu'u-Enari, Central Bank Governor of Samoa\n\nThe chair of the Commonwealth meeting, Bangladesh’s Rahman, called for immediate action to protect legitimate money transfer channels, with international and national policy actions to protect remittance flows to developing countries. Remittances are a significant source of external finance for many Commonwealth developing countries, and a lifeline for millions of families.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, among developing Commonwealth countries, India is the top receiving country with remittance inflows of over $70 billion. This far exceed overseas development assistance and direct foreign investment.\n\nRemittances are even more important for Commonwealth small states, and can make up a significant proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In Lesotho, a country in southern Africa, remittance accounts for 41 percent of GDP.\n\nWhile it may be inevitable that remittance services will always be exploited by criminals, the negative impact of regulations designed to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing was destroying the traditional remittance market long before digital currencies came along.\n\n- Commonwealth Central Bank Governors Meeting report\n\nCommonwealth central bank governors were keen to investigate using new monetary technologies, such as bitcoin and other digital currencies, as a possible cost-effective, alternative to traditional money transfer channels.\n\nLSE Professor, Dr. Hileman updated the governors on the latest developments in cryptocurrencies, concluding that “the technology is still regarded as unconventional.” However, he did put forward an idea which will allow for greater transparency, suggesting that “governments could create their own virtual currency.”\n\n- Attridge\n\nExploring the benefits of digital currencies is not a new topic of discussion among Commonwealth Nations. In a 2014 report, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) stated that digital currencies could facilitate international remittances and serve the under-banked.\n\nOnly two months prior, the new Commonwealth Virtual Currencies Working Group concluded that digital currencies have many benefits, one of which is driving Member States’ development. A clear call to action was “the Commonwealth Secretariat should create a digital repository of best practice and model regulations as part of an online community to assist Member States in developing policy.”\n\nWhile Commonwealth central bank governors are keen to find a solution to the remittance problem, the concept of using digital currency technology was considered a “futuristic” proposal, but not to be dismissed. Meanwhile, delegates were concerned that there is not enough information about the impact of digital currencies on monetary policy and financial stability.\n\n- Jwala Rambarran, Central Bank Governor of Trinidad and Tobago\n\nFor now, using digital currency for remittances is considered a long-term possibility for Commonwealth central bank governors, who were focused on a more speedy solution to solve the escalating problem at hand. “Perhaps we should concentrate on low-hanging fruits,” Rambarran conceded."", 'In times when most of the digital currency projects grow up to be nothing but farce, new investors find themselves doubting even the ones that promises some potential. Over the years, Bitcoin has inspired many developers to experiment with its open source code to execute something really innovative. But, in reality, only a few have managed to really bring out technologies that can improve upon Bitcoin.\n\nThis is the only reason why a new cryptocurrency like NeuCoin will be faced with doubts initially. But if one sees beyond its “altcoin” tag, he/she can see a hoard of talent working towards bettering this innovative take on Bitcoin.\n\nBefore its launch, the NeuCoin has managed to attract cryptocurrency veterans like Bitcoin Foundation chairman Brock Pierce to be strategic advisors to the project (during pre-launch, Jackson Palmer, the Dogecoin’s creator, was also a strategic advisor). What’s further attractive about NeuCoin is the team that has been associated with the developments of some of the highest visited projects.\n\nMoreover, the digital currency project is also backed by investors like a co-founder of King, the company who created Candy Crush Saga, Rob Goldman (Head of Growth at Facebook), Emil Michael (Uber’s senior vice president of business), and many other key professionals.\n\nTill date, Neucoin had raised around $1 million from several dozen of such veterans, of $2.25 million in total investments, proving its mettle in an often slow altcoin industry. It is one of the many reasons why someone would likely to put his stake in a project which is backed by some of the leading A-grade veterans of Bitcoin industry.\n\nTo know more about this new altcoin project, visit here or read this article.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of NewsBTC or any of its team members.

Five years on and the Government Digital Service has established itself as a model of central control over IT strategy and spending, admired and emulated by countries including the US and Australia. The question, set to be resolved in the coming spending round, is whether it will continue to wield this level of power over individual departments, in defiance of Whitehall’s traditional federal structure — or face a diminished role as a policy, rather than a delivery, unit. The uncertainty over the agency’s future raises wider issues about the durability of the approach pioneered by former Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, based on curbing departments’ autonomy in the interests of more efficient use of taxpayers’ money. The establishment of GDS owed much to Lord Maude’s political support — and his willingness to risk the ire of ministerial colleagues and officials by enforcing a centralised approach to spending and strategy. Its biggest successes include Gov.uk, an award-laden cross-government website, and enabling consumers to carry out important functions, such as managing driving records, online. However, it has also had its failures such as technology for dealing with subsidy claims from farmers that had to be ditched in favour of a return to a paper-based service. It has also frequently ruffled feathers within Whitehall. Even some very senior civil servants have resisted a model that encroaches on departmental sovereignty; others have found the agency difficult and, at times, confusing to deal with. GDS is understood to be working on these problems and trying to build better relationships across Whitehall. Industry, too, has often struggled to come to terms with its approach to technology procurement, according to Jessica Figueras, of Kable, a consultancy, who has recently completed a report into the agency. She said GDS had forced the IT industry to adapt to a different way of working. Departments had less autonomy than in the past, “so suppliers now need to consider not just what their clients say they want, but also what GDS will approve”. If you’re serious about making savings, you need to have standard elements of the various processes the government runs; whether it’s paying students or paying companies or receiving money from its citizens Daniel Thornton, Institute for Government So far, however, the agency believes it has only scratched the surface of what can be achieved. In an interview with the Financial Times this year, former GDS director Mike Bracken spoke of the “hundreds” of different versions within Whitehall departments and agencies of basic functions such as payment processing. Daniel Thornton, programme director at the Institute for Government, explains: “If you’re serious about making savings, you need to have standard elements of the various processes the government runs; whether it’s paying students or paying companies or receiving money from its citizens.” However, departments, under pressure to deliver cuts of up to 40 per cent, would “struggle” to develop these standardised systems without a push from the centre, “however good the digital teams are in the departments”, Mr Thornton warned. This explains why some are concerned its ability to deliver the next tranche of savings could be at risk if it were to lose its central sway over Whitehall. Noting that Matthew Hancock, Lord Maude’s successor, had emphasised the importance of digital approaches to securing £20bn in savings, Mr Thornton said: “I think they’re at risk of willing the ends but not the means at the moment.” Some within GDS clearly feel that the civil service has to change the way it works far more profoundly if it is to embrace the full potential of technology to deliver better services within reduced budgets. One symbol of these tensions is a debate over whether key registers of information, such as car or company ownership, should — as GDS would like — be held and managed centrally, rather than within a single department. If implemented, this would challenge the established institutional architecture of Whitehall, where it has not found favour. In a valedictory blog, Tom Loosemore, deputy director, who left GDS without another job to go to, praised the “wise leadership” of Mr Bracken’s successor, Stephen Foreshew-Cain, but indicated far more radical changes were needed to attitudes and approaches among the mandarins. “Bold, brave, reforming leadership from the centre” was required “to successfully challenge the shape, the size and the dominant culture of Whitehall”, he wrote.

It\'s natural to take it slow and wait for instruction. If you want to move up, however, make it your goal to be seen as the office rock star.\n\nRock star picture from Shutterstock\n\nAs business advisor and writer Guy Kawasaki explains, when you\'re interning or working an entry level job, the impression you make in your first six months can determine where you go in the future. Even if you\'re assigned to fetch coffee or do grunt work, working to impress your bosses will give you the opportunity to move up quickly.\n\nBy the last day of your internship, your boss should be begging for you to stay. She should be saying things like, ""What are we going to do without you?"" That is a lasting impression. That is a reference nailed.\n\nEven if you don\'t choose to stay at that job, that impression can follow you from one job to another as a reference. If you\'re interning, you may not know if you\'re staying when your time is up, but the impression you leave can land you a permanent job.\n\nMust Do: Intern Like a Rock Star [Guy Kawasaki]', 'ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a darkened room on a Saturday morning, a large group of students and teachers in Afghanistan line up to talk to me over Skype. Each one is eager to tell their personal story, describing ways computers have changed their lives.\n\nThe young women speak almost-fluent English, and any questions that risk being lost in the language barrier are handled by a translator. Some girls tell me they will become accountants; another, a poet; at least one young woman says she wants to be a computer programmer. One common thread throughout the conversation relates to their personal, not educational, journeys — a path that traces back to the Digital Citizen Fund, a nonprofit organization founded by Roya Mahboob, one of the country\'s first female IT CEOs and founder of software development firm Afghan Citadel.\n\nThe Digital Citizen Fund provides internet and technology training classes for young women in high school classrooms. So far, the group has built 11 internet training facilities across Afghanistan. Students learn how to use social media, blogging, photography, and software, including design programs and Microsoft Office. Some students even learn basic coding skills to build simple applications.\n\nHigh schools in Afghanistan usually don\'t have computer labs, tablets, or other electronic resources you might find in U.S. classrooms. In fact, there\'s a place in Afghanistan where villagers call a computer ""Satan\'s Box,"" and when Mahboob originally tried to set up a classroom in rural Afghanistan to teach young women about technology, the students weren\'t allowed access to the internet.\n\nTaliban rule has violently prevented young girls from attending classes in the past, and in 2002, there were fewer than 200,000 girls enrolled in schools. In 2013, that number had risen to 2.7 million. While girls\' education continues to improve, male students still significantly outnumber female students.\n\nIn neighboring Pakistan in 2012, 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head by the Taliban for going to school every day and for being an outspoken advocate of education and human rights. She\'s now a household name for both her remarkable recovery and her continued support of women\'s education around the world; last year, she became the youngest person to ever receive the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThat same year, 10 IT training centers were constructed to support Digital Citizen Fund, then known as the Women\'s Annex Foundation.\n\n""If they can assault one Malala, what about 10 Malala, what about 100, what about thousands or hundreds of thousands of Malala?"" Mahboob said in an interview, outlining her inspiration for the Digital Citizen Fund. ""The Taliban or terrorists cannot stop it…We believe if we create thousands or hundreds of thousands of Malala, it would be very difficult for people to change it.""\n\nAs one of Time\'s 100 most influential people of the year in 2013, Mahboob understands firsthand the threats educated women can receive. She said her rising popularity in her home country contributed to threats of violence, personal attacks, and efforts to block the new IT centers being built by her organization.\n\nIn the last three years, the Digital Citizen Fund has built three more IT centers and the Herat Media Center located in the heart of the city, where the Skype session is being held, and one other media center. In the process, it\'s worked with more than 55,000 young women. Most of the classes are taught in Afghanistan, but the organization also recently launched classes in Mexico and has plans to expand even further.\n\nPrograms provided by the Digital Citizen Fund bridge the gap between traditional education and technical skills: Students from different schools and backgrounds can participate in the technology training programs. Security at the schools is tight, and Mahboob says that all the courses are at the most secure institutions, so girls can learn safely.\n\nStudents are also able to make money and secure some financial independence for themselves and their families. Girls can contribute to the social media site Bitlanders and get paid in the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin for their freelance work. Bitcoin, Mahboob said, has given the young women the ability to make money without having to have their own bank accounts, an obstacle for financial stability in many developing countries.\n\n""Education in social media is very important for women, because it gives them freedom to think and freedom to talk about what is in their mind and their heart,"" Mahboob said. ""It\'s valuable for communication.""\n\nThe organization\'s most recent project, called Superheroes, illustrates the focus on empowerment and education. In Afghanistan, superheroes like the ones people grew up with in the U.S. do not exist, so teachers asked students to create their own versions of superheroes. In the eyes of the students, Afghan superheroes aren\'t necessarily strong or powerful. To them, superheroes bring peace, are kind to strangers, and help their neighbors when needed.\n\nThe students first sketched their ideas and will soon learn how to turn them into digital art. The organization wants to create comic books with the students\' designs and, funds permitting, buy 3D printers to print the girls\' creations.\n\nWhile the art is beautiful, it\'s the young students behind it who are so inspiring. Almost all the girls tell me their fathers needed the most convincing concerning their educations. Nadia, a middle school student in Herat, began taking the class without her father\'s permission. It took him witnessing how her education is improving her life before he would give her his blessing.\n\n""My mother supports me very much; she says I should go to the course because it\'s very good for my future,"" she says. ""But my father said I should be at home and do chores and said it wasn\'t good for girls.\n\n""Last week, my father had a problem with his computer, then I went to solve his problem for him, and described that it was the course that allowed me to fix it. And now he thinks it\'s a very good thing, and I should go.""\n\nRead the rest of this story at The Kernel.']"

By contrast, bitcoin\'s blockchain can process under 10 per second. The technology also presents anti money laundering and know your customer risks for these highly-regulated institutions due to its open, pseudonymous nature.\n\nFull transparency\n\nSetl, like other \'permissioned\' ledgers, is looking to eliminate these risks for banks by requiring all its users to be certified following due diligence. Additionally, regulators will be able to view real-time transactions on Setl – which will function as a series of \'linked\' blockchains – with ""full transparency"".\n\nCEO Anthony Culligan told CoinDesk:\n\n""Bitcoin is taking a particular journey, which includes it promoting significant social implications.

Not only is it preparing to take a more active role on the Bitcoin world stage, but it is also planning to release a host of new products and services in the coming months, including the 14 nanometer chips and miners.\n\n“We are very excited about the advances we’ve made,” Virgilio Lizardo Jr, Head of International at Bitbank told Bitcoin Magazine in an exclusive interview. “The chip promises to be the cutting edge technology that BW prides itself in producing. We will also be offering the 14nm chip in a miner for consumers. The power, efficiency and noise reduction benefits aims to introduce a new standard to the industry.”\n\nMore details about this new technology will be forthcoming the weeks ahead.\n\nBW was co-founded by LK Group Limited and CHBTC on Aug. 10, 2014. BW stands for Bi Wang which in Chinese literally means “Coin website.” Wenjie Zhai, one of the very first Bitcoiners in China and the CEO and founder of LK Group, is the current CEO of BW. Songxiu Hua, the founder of Bitbank, CHBTC.com, and Jua.com, acts as the CTO of BW although he is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the company; his primary role is to offer technical advice and website consultation.\n\nIn 2015, BW joined the Bitbank family of Chinese Bitcoin companies with a focus on combining bitcoin mining resources in order to find greener and more efficient ways to mine. Over the years, Bitcoin has drawn criticism for its consumption of energy. The electricity required to run and cool mining equipment is costly, in terms of both economic and environmental resources.\n\nBW points out that mining anything — metals or bitcoin — has an environmental impact. But by harnessing the plentiful hydroelectric power that is available in remote regions of China, BW’s bitcoin miners are able to put that green energy to use in a way that creates a far smaller footprint than any other form of mining. Furthermore, because of the power source’s rural locations, BW is able to get the electricity — much of which would otherwise go to waste — at a very low rate.\n\n“Hydropower offers a long-term, low-cost and stable source of electricity with the potential to increase the amount of miners in the future,” says BW. “The mining farms are located in rural developing areas. By investing there, this contributes to the local economy by creating new jobs in the area….These areas are surrounded by natural beauty and an abundance of water and we work hard to keep it this way for future generations to enjoy.”\n\nBesides taking a leadership role in preserving the natural environment, BW also wants to protect the Bitcoin environment. As it expands, and as more Chinese miners begin to take advantage of plentiful and cheap hydroelectricity, BW is mindful of the potential for centralization of Chinese mining.\n\nIn China, “most of the miners are Bitcoin enthusiasts who see the potential of Bitcoin and want to do their best to help the development of Bitcoin,” says BW. “This includes being aware of how much percentage of the network we are part of and being responsible stakeholders in the ecosystem.”\n\nThe company also credits the Chinese government with being a supportive partner. “The government has been encouraging of Bitcoin mining companies because Bitcoin is a technology that combines elements of hardware and software. They have observed the benefits and profits it has produced and have been supportive of this.” Recently, Bitbank received a grant of 50,000 Yuan and office space in a new innovation and high-tech zone built in the city of Zhongshan, Guangdong province. The city plans on investing 67 million Yuan over the next 5 years on the initiative.\n\nAt a time when the Bitcoin protocol is in a state of flux, as developers debate scalability options and the future of block sizes, BW is playing the part of the cautious observer; at the same time, as the fifth-largest mining pool in the world, it has also decided to take on more of a leadership role in the Bitcoin community.\n\n“Though Chinese miners have greatly contributed to the development of Bitcoin, we feel that there is a wall between China and the rest of the community. Perhaps even a ‘Great Wall?’” says BW. “There are many factors that contribute to this: language, culture, distance, etc. At BW we would like to work towards helping to increase communication and cooperation in the community, especially when it comes to China.”', 'Bitcoin compliance solutions provider Scorechain has raised €500,000 ($570,000) in seed funding from an undisclosed group of angel investors.\n\nThe Luxembourg-based startup is seeking to target both bitcoin companies and traditional financial institutions with a suite of services that help clients meet regulatory and compliance requirements, through business intelligence and risk analysis tools that illuminate transaction histories on the blockchain.\n\nCEO Pierre Gerard suggested Scorechain will attempt to appeal to bitcoin startups that are beginning to implement more stringent know-your-customer and anti-money laundering policies by offering a web interface as well as an API.\n\nHowever, Gerard also sees the service being useful for a market that is increasingly interested in the digital currency industry – major financial institutions.\n\nGerard told CoinDesk:\n\n""Banks are learning more about customers using bitcoin. If someone is coming with €100,000 in cash, pretending it\'s coming from bitcoin, we can allow a compliance officer from a bank to check if the person is telling the truth. All the banks today need to check where the money is coming from, if it\'s from bitcoin, we provide this.""\n\nGerard said Scorechain\'s solution is optimized for the European market, and that its service is able to build custom reports for companies in different nations, with the information it collects varying depending on local regulatory needs.\n\nThe startup\'s emphasis on Europe, he said, will also be beneficial, given there is less competition among compliance providers than in the US, which is home to startups such as IdentityMind.\n\nToday, Scorechain has four full-time employees, according to its CEO, with funding being used to expand the team to six. The service is currently operating in free beta, though Gerard said the company is now exploring pricing models.\n\nBlockchain analysis\n\nUsers of the service who want to obtain more information about a bitcoin transaction or wallet address are able to leverage its ""Lookup"" tool to see details, such as how much bitcoin was sent and the fees that were paid to include the transaction on the blockchain.\n\nBoth metrics are provided in a colorful screen layout alongside the date on which the transaction was confirmed and a chart that connects that transaction ID or wallet address to past and future blockchain movements using cluster detection and address identification.\n\nThe following example shows the Scorechain analysis for one transaction where funds had previously moved through the online black market Agora.\n\nGerard said there are some limitations to the service, as it currently relies on public information from sources such as Reddit and Pastebin to link bitcoin addresses to specific entities.\n\nThe CEO said Scorechain may work to obtain information from other companies in the industry, like bitcoin exchanges, but suggested it still needs to determine how such potentially sensitive customer information would need to be managed.\n\nImages via Scorechain\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', '""Blockchain technology"" may be the buzzword of the moment in the FinTech world, but like any blanket term, actual definitions vary.\n\nRather than any one solution, it may be beneficial to think of blockchain technology as a loosely defined set of goals financial institutions are hoping to unlock through distributed ledgers. The transition finds these entities seeking to define the attributes of the bitcoin blockchain they prefer – its secure ledger and payments rail – and the ones they don\'t – its controversy-grabbing native asset and largely anonymous miners, while determining solutions that allow them to further define these needs.\n\nEntrepreneurs are now stepping in to facilitate this education process, attempting to serve a clientele that is unique from that of the industry surrounding the bitcoin blockchain. Among them are private blockchain firms such as Blockstack, Eris Ltd and Coin Sciences.\n\nLed by CEO and founder Gideon Greenspan, Coin Sciences recently launched a new solution this summer called the Multichain Private Blockchain. The product takes what could be described as a build-your-own blockchain approach that aims to free banks from the more rigid options of competing offerings.\n\nGreenspan believes there\'s potential profit in allowing banks to experiment with the technology while gleaning insights into their observations, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""It became clear that what [banks] were doing is grabbing their best developers, pointing them at the source code for Ethereum and Bitcoin Core and telling them to start tinkering with it... We saw the opportunity to create an off-the-shelf platform where they don\'t need to spend a year breaking their heads on this stuff.""\n\nMultichain is the latest offering from Coin Sciences, following CoinSpark, a software tool for web assets and legal contracts on the bitcoin blockchain. The problem, Greenspan alleges, wasn\'t that financial institutions weren\'t interested in this solution, or removing intermediaries from financial processes, but rather they didn\'t believe the bitcoin blockchain was tested or stable enough for their needs.\n\n""It became clear people are looking for things that are similar to bitcoin but different, rather than cryptocurrencies, traditional entities are more interested in the ledger,"" Greenspan said.\n\nIn this light, Multichain emphasizes end-user choice, allowing customers to control whether the chain is private or public; the target time for blocks; who can connect to the network; how these entities interact; and the maximum block size and metadata that can be included in transactions, among other features.\n\nMoreover, Greenspan argues the offering is proving popular, having been downloaded nearly 850 times from mid-June to mid-Septemberr. He declined to mention any large financial clients that may be using the software.\n\nThe alpha version of the platform is currently available, with a beta to be released in late 2015.\n\n\'Bitcoin\'s shortcomings\'\n\nAs in the Multichain white paper, Greenspan is keen in conversation to elaborate on why his firm believes bitcoin is ill-suited for the needs of financial conglomerates, while steering clear of suggesting the bitcoin blockchain is not a needed innovation.\n\nThe paper, for example, seeks to note that bitcoin currently supports only 300,000 transactions per day due to the current limit on how many megabytes worth of data can be processed on the network every 10 minutes. Further, it argues that bitcoin\'s fees – roughly 2.5 cents for a transaction at the time of publication – are set to rise as the number of new bitcoins produced to incentivize miners for transaction processing decreases, both factors that simply don\'t appeal to institutional users.\n\nComplicating matters, Greenspan argues, is that the blockchain is designed to move bitcoins, meaning that it can only effectively exchange a record of the asset, not the asset itself.\n\n""That conceptual idea ... doesn\'t carry over to other assets. Unless another asset has been issued, like dollars onto a blockchain, you\'re never going to be directly an asset. You\'re always going to be owning a promise that that assets exists,"" Greenspan said.\n\nNotably, startups such as Symbiont are developing technology to represent asset ownership on the blockchain, though financial giants such as Nasdaq have offered a differing view. In a recent interview, Fredrik Voss, Nasdaq\'s head of blockchain strategy, for instance, argued that bitcoin representations of assets are still beneficial due to the tracking benefits shared ledgers provide.\n\nMultichain, however, believes its workaround will find a market. As described in the white paper, the technology aims to make tracking blockchain assets easier using bitcoin\'s scripting language to encode metadata in transaction outputs, which it argues allows miners to verify the quantity of an asset that differs from the network\'s native token in any transactions.\n\nCustomizable permissions\n\nLike other private blockchain solutions, Multichain aims to remove perceived problems associated with bitcoin by limiting the visibility of the ledger to certain participants, allowing institutions to set controls on transactions permitted and by forgoing distributed mining.\n\nOn the subject of privacy, Multichain allows users to set a list of permitted users that can act as nodes that refer information on the network and \'miners\' that verify transactions, including a method by which nodes can verify whether other nodes have been approved.\n\nPrivileges are granted using transactions with special metadata, and the miner of the Genesis block, the first block on the blockchain, is given all established rights on the network and acts an \'administrator\'. This administrator can then appoint other administrators on the network, with any changes to consensus needed to be validated by a set number of participants.\n\nPermissions can also be grated on a limited basis, according to the white paper, or to a fixed range of block numbers.\n\nThis differs from the current consensus strategy in bitcoin, in which a distributed community of developers must introduce changes that then require a majority or all of those processing transactions on the network to upgrade to new versions of the software.\n\nThough often not difficult technically, the challenge inherent in this approach was perhaps best exemplified by the ongoing debate on the size of blocks on the bitcoin network. Differing proposals have been introduced as far back as this summer, though no consensus on solutions has so far been reached.\n\nProof of work alternative\n\nAs miners on the multichain network do not need to conduct proof of work, Multichain has also introduced a novel way by which these entities can trust decisionmaking.\n\nCalled mining diversity, the process enables miners processing transactions to approve transactions in a random rotation. Greenspan explained a situation in which a Multichain user set a blockchain network with 10 mining entities, and set a ""relatively high"" mining difficulty by which the approval eight of these entities would be needed for a block to be recorded.\n\n""That means they have to wait eight more blocks before they sign another one. Having that, what it means is there\'s no possibility for a small group of miners to mine a chain in private, unless eight of them do it,"" he said.\n\nGreenspan argues that this structure allows more miners to participate in the approval of transactions, while ensuring there is no fixed order of verification that could be corrupted.\n\nTransaction fees and block rewards are set to zero by default in Multichain, though this is also customizable, as the white paper suggests participants could be charged a yearly service fee.\n\nStill, Greenspan believes that version of a private blockchain offers benefits over a centralized database, a claim often espoused by critics, contending that the benefits are that each participant retains full control over assets; control of the database is distributed across entities; and that, due to the mining diversity concept, the loss of any one server would not compromise the network.\n\n""This is a new type of database that enables multiple parties to share a database and to be able to modify that in a safe and secure way even if they don\'t trust each other. I think that\'s a very valid direction and new types of databases can be an extremely powerful thing.""\n\nMissing link\n\nMultichain users also aren\'t limited to the number of blockchains they create, and further, they have the ability to connect their blockchains to the bitcoin network or to a bitcoin testnet, a version of the blockchain on which no real bitcoins move.\n\nInteroperability, however, is so far limited to bitcoin, as Greenspan said Multichain cannot connect to Ripple or Ethereum, which he said were ""in a separate world from Multichain"".\n\n""Bitcoin\'s model is hugely more scalable,"" Greenspan continued. ""You can run many transactions in parallel as long as you can see they\'re not modifying the same data.""\n\nIn contrast to these alternatives, Greenspan still sees bitcoin as a preferred technology, basing Multichain off of a fork of Bitcoin Core, using the protocol and architecture as well as its command-line and API interface.\n\nIn this way, the Multichain white paper positions private blockchains as an early version of a more robust, global bitcoin blockchain, one that can allow private institutions to begin working with the technology in the way that Intranets exposed entities to the Internet.\n\n""Private blockchains will likely be a more attractive solution for financial institutions wishing to deploy this technology during the next decade,"" the paper reads, adding:\n\n""Twenty years from now, if bitcoin or another blockchain is processing billions of transactions monthly at very low cost, with mining controlled by large identifiable corporations, bitcoin may start looking like an attractive platform for institutional financial transactions.""\n\nAssembly image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The experienced entrepreneur had been looking forward to setting aside his consulting work and starting another company. “I was waiting for the right opportunity,” Mr. Jenkins told us during an interview at the company’s Williamsburg outpost, alongside his cofounder, Aaron Kaplan. “I knew it couldn’t just be a game.” He couldn’t sleep because he was thinking about ways that the video game industry could take advantage of the same technology that makes it possible for people to trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nImogen Heap wants to put the ownership of digital music on the block chain as well.\n\nDeckbound is a pre-launch digital collectible card game. It introduces the idea of players truly owning their cards, so they can trade them, sell them and use them in other games. As digital objects, the cards get stronger and improve with use. The technology that makes it possible for people to own ephemeral goods is the same system that powers bitcoin, the block chain. The game will go into a public alpha at Paris Games Week at the end of the month.\n\nTheir first game will be Deckbound Heroes. Mr. Jenkins described it as a board control game where each player’s deck is fully exposed at the outset and chance is largely removed from the fantasy-themed game, in the spirit of German style board games. Later, the company will release a solo player game using the same cards, Deckbound Quest.\n\nIn video games today, players spend millions of dollars on digital assets (everything from cards to clothes to special weaponry), but if a game shut down its servers, all the stuff they purchased would be gone forever. Deckbound will allow players to hold onto what they own locally, if they want, and will also let other developers create games around their assets.\n\nThat said, there’s no reason why other games couldn’t use the technology Deckbound has created. One fairly obvious example: Magic: The Gathering cards could come with some kind of code such that the physical cards you buy in a pack also come with a code that lets you put them into a digital wallet. Then, Hasbro (the owners of Magic) wouldn’t have to come up with the app that lets users play with their cards. Developers could compete to see who could come up with the best app, and players could play with digitized Magic cards across any of those apps, and their work would create additional demand for Hasbro’s cards.\n\nDeckbound created a platform called Bitbind that enables the creation, sale and trade of each card in the bitcoin block chain, so that there is an immutable record of each card’s ownership, its growth and when it is traded. It uses bitcoin’s block chain, but it doesn’t have to. Bitbind could work with any block chain (such as namecoin’s or dogecoin’s) or on a privately created one.\n\n“There’s all these interesting properties of having something you actually own,” Mr. Jenkins said. “Bitbind not only solved our problems but many others’ problems as well.” The team said it is in talks with other gaming companies about using Bitbind, but declined to disclose which ones.\n\nSEE ALSO: Monegraph uses the block chain to manage the sale of digital art.\n\nBy logging the card’s existence and ownership in the block chain, it becomes a digital object independent of Deckbound, the company. Which means that other game makers can create new platforms for using the same cards and people can trade, sell or lend their cards. In other words, these digital objects can be used in exactly the same way as cardboard collectible cards.\n\nDeckbound could completely shut down and users would still own the cards they had paid for.\n\nDeckbound’s revenue model is based on the sale of the physical cards, which creates an interesting problem. The company can’t give people free cards to start trying out the game with, because logging new cards on the block chain incurs a small cost for the company for each card. If it gave free cards to thousands of players who never bought any more cards, it would cost too much.\n\nThe team created an interesting solution. They call it “the nomad pool.”\n\nThe nomad pool is a place where players can share their cards with other players while they aren’t using them. This allows people to create a deck and try out the game using cards borrowed from that pool. Because cards gain experience and power with play, there is an incentive for players to share them. Stick a few cards in the nomad pool for a couple weeks and they may come back to you considerably more powerful, and, therefore, more valuable. Deckbound has also seeded the pool with cards the company owns.\n\nDeckbound has been showing off ‘Heroes’ at conventions for months now. Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Kaplan said they have had people come back to their booth repeatedly and play for hours. People who have been given pre-alpha access to the site have already purchased thousands of cards, as well, even though they haven’t been able to play with them yet.\n\nMr. Jenkins currently lives on the Isle of Man. He moved there because the country has set itself up as a bit of bitcoin mecca.', 'Poland’s Ministry of Finance has said regulating bitcoin should form ""part of initiatives at the EU level, due to the transborder character of cryptocurrency transactions"".\n\nThe ministry provided this statement in a written response to a request for information filed by two Polish Members of Parliament (MPs), Jan Warzecha and Bogdan Rzo?ca.\n\nIn their request for information, the MPs said ""piracy, cybercrime, phishing, thefts and hacking online accounts and attacks on the users of cryptocurrencies are increasingly often taking place"".\n\nMore specifically, they said that, between 2004 and 2014, the amount of detected cybercrimes increased from 404 to some 22,000.

[They say] 60–70% of the trades they could make, they can\'t take advantage of because of the settlement lag.""\n\nHill contends that Liquid will reduce the time it takes funds to move between exchanges from 60 minutes to seconds.\n\n""That in of itself is the simplest use case,"" he added.\n\nThe startups involved will participate in the operation of the sidechain, but at the same time will be customers of Blockstream, paying an undisclosed monthly subscription fee. Hill suggested that the effort is the first of what could be many commercial sidechains offerings, both from Blockstream and users of its open-source software.\n\nBlockstream suggested Liquid is set to launch in Q1 of 2016.\n\nFirst announced in April 2014, sidechains were hailed as a radical concept for boosting the functionality of bitcoin by allowing assets to move from the main bitcoin blockchain to an alternative blockchain and back through a system of two-way pegging.\n\nOnce on an alternative blockchain, the assets can effectively be governed by a different set of rules, while still maintaining their ability to be transferred back to the bitcoin blockchain at a later date, and thus redeemed via the existing bitcoin market infrastructure.\n\nBlockstream has to date raised $21m from investors including AME Cloud Ventures, Blockchain Capital, Future\\Perfect Ventures and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. Further, its team consists of some of the more noted developers in the space including Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, Matt Corallo and Pieter Wuille.\n\nLiquid in practice\n\nOn a technical level, Liquid will find partner exchanges transferring funds to a shared multi-signature wallet address, with a Byzantine round robin consensus protocol used to process transactions.\n\nTo ensure that no parties are able to block transactions, Hill explained that rules have been put in place to shield data about the transactions from network participants.\n\n""As long as the transaction is constructed and the private key is correct and the unspent transaction output is valid, then all of the signers who are running nodes approve the transaction,"" Hill said.\n\nWhile all parties in the Liquid sidechain are known and identified, Hill sought to highlight the difference between sidechains and private blockchain approaches.\n\n""Liquid does have many of the same properties, but these exchanges are running a parallel blockchain [to the main bitcoin blockchain]. We can implement all the business logic at a protocol layer, so other party has custodianship of these funds. Other attempts are centralized, we don\'t have that issue,"" he continued.\n\nHill said Liquid will integrate Confidential Transactions, meaning that exchanges can process the same transaction data without the risk that information – such as trading volumes – will be revealed in the process.\n\nThe privacy protocol was introduced in the release of Sidechains Elements, a set of initial tools for developers, earlier this year.\n\nBusiness need\n\nTechnology aside, Hill spoke to the everyday business challenges he believes Liquid will help the bitcoin ecosystem address, emphasizing the benefits it could bring to exchanges and traders.\n\n""I think it\'s showing a maturing of the ecosystem, licensed exchanges are expanding their pool of customers. They now have more demands on the functionality they offer,"" he said.\n\nHill went on to explain how previously difficult tasks, like fulfilling contractual obligations to execute orders for family offices or institutions at the best market prices, were impractical within the current exchange system. With Liquid, he said, exchanges could now take advantage of sourcing bitcoins on a competitor\'s order book, a process he said positions the ecosystem to move closer to traditional derivatives and stock markets.\n\nIn statements, other members of Liquid echoed these remarks.\n\nZane Tackett, director of product development at Bitfinex, noted that the ability to move funds between exchanges in seconds would make arbitrage opportunities more accessible to the trading community.\n\nWater splash image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It was the way it was sold: through Overstock’s new digital trading platform T0, which records securities trades through the same shared ledger technology that backs cryptographic currencies like bitcoin. Advocates of the digital ledger technology, known as the blockchain, say its use in traditional financial transactions could prove far more revolutionary than the alternative currencies for which it was first created. The main event isn’t bitcoin. It’s using the blockchain to disrupt other industries and Wall Street. Storing transactions in one automatically shared, tamper-proof database could eliminate the need for complicated procedures and clearinghouses now used to make sure banks have their records in sync, saving time and money and reducing the risk of error. And that has startups and established companies lining up to design the trading platforms, programming tools, and other infrastructure that’ll soon be needed if blockchain-based finance goes mainstream. “The main event isn’t bitcoin,” says Byrne. “It’s using the blockchain to disrupt other industries and Wall Street.” T0 takes its name from its ability to finalize transactions essentially instantaneously. Traditional stock and bond sales take three business days–or T+3 in industry jargon –to fully settle, before the assets are available in the buyer’s account and the purchase value is available to the seller.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThose traditional transfers are generally logged by an industry body called the Depository Trust Company, created in the 1970s to track the ownership of securities. But with blockchain-based securities, records are automatically shared between all of the participants in the market in close to real time, so the transaction’s effectively settled as soon as it’s recorded to that collective ledger, without the need for an intermediary like the DTC. “What blockchains do is allow for a transaction to occur between financial institutions or people but without the need of that intermediary, because you can reliably send the assets to each other very quickly and in basically near real time and without any chance of having that transaction be reversed or changed,” says Peter Shiau, the cofounder and CEO of financial blockchain startup Blockstack.io. The blockchain concept was first developed by bitcoin’s pseudonymous (and mysterious) creator Satoshi Nakamoto as a way to track ownership of the digital currency. When bitcoin owners spend or transfer the currency, their digital wallet software publishes a cryptographically signed record of the transaction to the global network of bitcoin users. Bitcoin miners are then rewarded with new bitcoin for bundling those individual records into groups called blocks and recording them to a permanent shared ledger called the blockchain. Only blocks satisfying certain mathematical properties in relation to the previous block on the chain are considered valid, making it effectively impossible to tamper with records of previous transactions. But while blockchains were first created to track bitcoin, experts say there’s no reason why they can’t be used to track other types of assets, from securities to event tickets to old-fashioned U.S. currency. “A blockchain’s just a ledger—it just tells you who has what and that someone sent something to somebody else,” says Shiau. “The ability to know with certainty that something happened is what’s critical.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nOverstock transferred the bond bought by Byrne, as well with a second “proof-of-concept” bond bought by financial firm First New York for $5 million, by recording the transaction to the actual public bitcoin blockchain, using a standard called Open Assets designed to record any kind of transfer to that shared ledger. And other companies, such as Blockstack, are developing technology to let financial institutions create their own private blockchains, changing features from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to better suit their own purposes. “If you take the software and install it in a private context, you can do whatever you want,” says Shiau. Banks might wish to adjust the size limits of transaction blocks, or the speed at which they’re added to the network, security features, or other settings, or keep their blockchains only accessible to their trading partners over a secure network. They may also incorporate support for so-called smart contracts—essentially simple programs embedded within the blockchain that define rules for when assets get transferred, allowing procedures such as dividend and interest payments and escrow arrangements to be automated with logic stored in the same shared database as the assets themselves. Some experts say the actual requirements banks have could be satisfied by data structures other than blockchains–once banks control who has access to a shared ledger, they could really rely on pre-bitcoin technology to achieve the same goals, argued Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton University, in a recent blog post. Indeed, banks might be better off in many cases just sticking with traditional database technology, says Paul Chou, the CEO of LedgerX, a startup building trading infrastructure for bitcoin derivatives.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“If you restrict access to trusted parties, then an intelligently managed shared database is a fast and proven solution—there is no need for a blockchain,” he wrote in an email to Fast Company. And if banks find they won’t benefit enough in terms of efficiency from blockchain-based systems, switching likely won’t be worth the risk, he argues. “Imagine how terrifying it is to design a whole new system from scratch with a datastore that has only been around for a few years,” he wrote. “Only if banks find a technology that can improve things by an order of magnitude, say 10 times more efficient, will it make sense to totally abandon a slow, but proven platform to gain those efficiencies. Still, Princeton’s Narayanan wrote in his blog post, the excitement around bitcoin and the math that makes it work may have motivated banks to start thinking more seriously about updating some aging technology and processes. “In my view, it’s not the novelty of blockchain technology but rather its mindshare that has gotten Wall Street to converge on it, driven by the fear of missing out,” wrote Narayanan. “It’s acted as a focal point for standardization.” And banks may end up relying on different blockchains for different purposes, says Makoto Takemiya, the chief blockchain officer at Japanese startup Mijin, which plans next year to begin beta testing its private blockchain technology with industry partners and release open source code.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“I think there’s going to be room for multiple blockchains that institutions can have,” he says. One London-based startup, called Everledger, is developing blockchain tools for the diamond industry, designed to log information on ethical sourcing, insurance claims, and theft investigations, associated with detailed digital descriptions of the valuable stones. Private information on police investigations or private transactions will be stored on a private blockchain, and information like diamonds’ conflict-free certification will be logged to the public bitcoin blockchain, says CEO Leanne Kemp. “You would be able to identify whether those diamonds are truly certified or not certified,” she says. Everledger participated earlier this year in an accelerator program backed by Barclays, the giant U.K.-based bank, as large financial institutions around the world are beginning to seriously investigate the benefits of blockchain technology. Financial technology firm R3 announced last month that it’s working with 22 major financial institutions, including Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, to develop and test software and standards the banks can use to build blockchain-based services. The firms have looked at a number of potential use cases—from issuing and settling the transfer of securities to transferring the rights to loans—but they’re focusing first on devising lower-level protocols on which those services can be built, says R3 CEO David Rutter. “We kind of think setting the foundation first is the right thing before we start worrying about the wallpaper in the bedroom,” says Rutter.\n\nadvertisement\n\nR3 aims to develop, and potentially make open source, basic blockchain protocols analogous to telephone or Internet networking standards upon which financial services tools can be built. And, Rutter says, they’re working closely with the banks to make sure those firms’ needs are met. “Let’s pause the mad rush for a second, and make sure that we have the basic requirements that are needed to build this technology, especially if we think that it’s going to be a solution that’s going to provide benefits for the next 10, 20 or 30 years,” he says. That’s not an unrealistic requirement, when the current system of securities settlement, revolving around the DTC, dates back to 1970s reforms led by Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It, too, evolved from a push for efficiency, after increased transaction volume proved too much for the paper-based stock certificate system it replaced: A Wall Street “paperwork crisis” had led to increasing numbers of errors, canceled trades, and millions of dollars in hard-to-catch fraud. Rutter says it’s still too early for the company to have had detailed discussions with regulators like the SEC, though he says a move toward blockchain could make their lives easier as well, since it’ll be easier to analyze transactions recorded in one shared ledger rather than looking at disparate databases across multiple financial firms. “You can build software that would allow regulators to peek at that data in a way that would make sense for them in a more timely fashion and with absolute confidence that what they’re looking at is a clean picture,” he says. As far as Overstock, which has said it plans to offer blockchain-recorded securities to a wider audience, Byrne says the company’s had productive talks with the agency so far.\n\nadvertisement', ""Kadhim Shubber OCTOBER 14, 2015 0 At first bitcoin was viewed with suspicion by the banking industry. The currency was known more for its association with anarchist hackers, online drug sales, and disasters like Mt. Gox than for the technology underpinning it, blockchain. Suspicion has turned into a deep embrace. Now blockchain, an innovation in running shared databases, is touted as the technology that will drag financial services into the 21st century. The world’s largest banks are taking a tool whose creator intended it as a weapon against them and adopting in a bid to reduce costs and increase profits. Few people working outside of finance would guess at the inefficiency of some banking systems. While high-frequency trading conjures thoughts of split-second trades and the breakneck swapping of shares on electronic markets, settlement is measured in days. Instead of complicated algorithms, fax machines are still in common use. The syndicated loan market is held up as emblematic of this slowness; deals can take 20 or more days to complete. Simply put, there’s a lot of financial machinery that is “very manual and typically very paper-based,” says Simon Taylor, blockchain and distributed ledger lead for Barclays, which is backing start-ups using blockchain to digitise everything from shipping documents to the diamond trade. In addition to their individual projects, the banks have thrown their weight behind R3, a company that is developing a blockchain network for use by the financial services industry. More than 20 global banks, including the likes of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, and UBS, are now backing the company as they look to blockchain as a means of upgrading that manual back-office machinery. It is not the only game in town. Nasdaq, which owns the technology-heavy US equity index and exchange, has partnered with a San Francisco start-up Chain to develop a private trading platform. Chain counts Nasdaq, Visa and Citi Ventures among its investors. Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker, is leading her own blockchain start-up, Digital Asset Holdings. She has said the benefit of such systems ultimately lies in reducing the time it takes to trade and move collateral. “If you can speed up the process via which assets change hands, capital requirements will drop because there is a resulting lower rate of operational risk and counterparty risk,” she said at a recent conference in New York, organised by CoinDesk. The savings are potentially massive. Santander InnoVentures, Anthemis and Oliver Wyman have estimated a possible $15-20bn cut in costs for cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance. Although the technology is underpinned by complex cryptography, it can be thought of as simply a means of running a database that is stored in multiple locations and is controlled by no single party. The term blockchain is sometimes interchanged with the term “distributed ledger technology”. It is the innovation that has powered bitcoin. Instead of relying on an entity like a bank to manage their money, users of bitcoin can freely access a global database, create their own cryptographically-secure account in that database, and then adjust the entries in their account (receive and send payments). In the bitcoin network, the currency is an incentive for anonymous actors to maintain the system, but for banks, the focus is on blockchain without bitcoin, or without a monetary token to incentivise users of the system. “It’s completely unnecessary in the world of banking where you have trusted relationships and a legal regime,” says David Rutter, chief executive of R3. Instead of an open system accessible to all, the efforts are focused on building closed systems that are maintained by a pre-approved group of institutional users. Few people working outside finance would guess at the inefficiency of some banking systems The hope is that building a common rail for the movement of assets, instead of each bank managing their own separate systems, own, will reduce friction in the exchange of assets. “Every bank has an accounting engine that does broadly a same thing, so does it make sense that you could share that burden,” says Simon Taylor of Barclays. There are still huge challenges to overcome and few are expecting rapid, dramatic change, or “open-heart surgery on the core engines,” as Mr Taylor puts it. Regulators are have only recently got a handle on how to treat bitcoin — the ramifications of widespread adoption of blockchain technology are just now beginning to be considered. There is also scepticism about the ability of banking to keep up with the pace of innovation bitcoin has sparked, not least from early and continued believers in the currency. Barry Silbert, whose Digital Currency Group is the most prolific investor in bitcoin start-ups, notes banks are the “slowest moving, risk averse, cautious organisations in the world”. But what’s obvious is the emergence of bitcoin and now the focus on blockchain has kicked bankers into action and has forced them to rethink the infrastructure that underpins finance. As entrepreneur David Galbraith recently pointed out, “blockchains have created the market awareness and incentives to innovate as much as the technological means.” The blockchain — Wall Street's latest buzz Play video"", 'European cryptocurrency exchange Yacuna has announced it will close next month.\n\nThe firm shared the news with customers via email this afternoon, asking them to withdraw any remaining funds before 15th November.\n\nIts email – from support@yacuna.com – read:\n\n""Bitcoin is a wonderful technology and we are proud, that we have developed one of the first European exchanges for virtual currency.

The film’s first sentence is: “I just read money as we know it is dead, soon the world is only gonna sell and buy products using Bitcoins…”\n\nMain character Malcolm Adekanbi and his friends love the 90s, even though they didn’t live through them. Malcolm thinks records came out in the nineties, like The Blueprint, although they did not. He and his friends, Jib and Diggy, are bullied at their school in “The Bottoms,” a part of Inglewood, California outside of Los Angeles. The three friends are in a pop-rock band. Malcolm’s goal is to go to Harvard. For his Harvard admissions essay, he wants to write on the topic, “A Research Thesis To Discover Ice Cube’s Good Day.”\n\nWhile walking around his neighborhood one day, a drug dealer on the street named Dom tells Malcolm to invite a girl to Dom’s birthday for him. Malcolm and his friends go to the party as well. At the party, in an interesting scene that stands out, Dom’s friends laugh about the use of drones. Dom says this is not funny, that’s it’s not only “Al Qaedas” who get killed. He also mentions the government said they could do the same to Americans.\n\nDuring an MDMA deal at the party, infighting between gangs erupt and Dom sends Malcolm out after having filled the latter’s backpack with drugs and a gun. On the way into school the next morning, Malcolm’s backpack sets off the metal detector and a drug dog barks alarmingly at him. The security guard, knowing Malcolm as a good kid, assumes Malcolm has nothing to hide. At his locker, Malcolm looks into his backpack and finds the drugs. Malcolm then finds himself caught between rival drug dealers who know he has the MDMA. Because Dom is in jail after being arrested on his birthday, Malcolm comes to find himself in a position where he must sell the drugs.\n\nAs he and his friends discuss what to do, Diggy suggests going to Coachella and Lollapalooza to sell the molly. Malcolm hits on the idea to sell the drugs on the dark web for bitcoins. “There’s these sites where you can sell everything from credit cards to illegal guns and drugs, and they use bitcoins so they can’t be traced,” Malcolm explains.\n\n“Way better than coachella, ‘cause the FBI can track us, the police,” says Diggy, mocking the idea.\n\n“No they can’t, not if you use a Tor browser,” Jib claims.\n\nThe three turn to their friend Will Sherwood, a stoner, hacker, conspiracy theorist and entrepreneur. His big entrepreneurial idea is small batch craft malt liquor. William explains about Black Market Reloaded. Will helps the three get started on the dark net website and with Bitcoin. Ultimately, they learn that, in order to remain “anonymous,” they must sell the bitcoins on the black market for cash.\n\nThey do this deal at a fake purse manufacturer. The bitcoin buyer makes Malcolm punch him in the face so he knows he can trust him. Afterwards, he grabs a gun to Malcolm’s dismay, but finishes the deal without incident.\n\n“Drive,” he says.\n\n“Where,” Malcolm responds.\n\n“Give me the drive,” the man says.\n\nAfter the deal, the Bitcoin buyer says, “Now I know who you are, ‘A Man that does not give a fuck.”’ On the way home from the deal, Malcolm gets jumped by his school bullies. Bullies steal the purse with the cash but Malcolm pulls a gun on the group and tells them to give the bag back. They comply in what is a drawn out scene seemingly underscoring the reality that brandishing a weapon is some sort of rite of passage for some inner city black males.\n\nIn the film, there is a lot of Crip and Blood talk. The main characters, Malcolm Diggy and Jib seem to be pulled by two forces: the 90’s past of a hip hop prime they never experienced, and a future in which various worlds collide. During a heedful monologue at film’s end, in which he reveals his favorite band is The Thermals, Malcolm says: “When you don’t fit in, you’re forced to see the world from many different angles and points of view.”\n\nOne character’s purpose, who plays a law enforcement officer seemingly tracking the MDMA and Bitcoin transactions on the dark web, is never made clear. The movie suffers a bit from this loose end. Refreshingly outside of the Hollywood norm, Dope – which had a budget of just $700,000 – does not rely on its dope soundtrack to keep the audience’s attention. A nuanced and modern storyline tells the story of world’s colliding in the modern age, highlighting the character traits which go beyond skin color.\n\nGrade: B\n\nImages: YouAreDope.com\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'There is a mindset among the greater Bitcoin development world, known as \'Bitcoin Maximalism\'. It refers to the opinion that building apps upon Bitcoin, and its’ particular blockchain, is the best and most efficient way of going forward, and other crypto currencies, and their respective blockchains, will eventually succumb to the Network Effect.\n\nThe classic network effect example is the telephone. The more people who own telephones, the more valuable the telephone is to each owner. A user may purchase a telephone without intending to create value for other users, but does so in any case. Online social networks work in the same way, with sites like Twitter and Facebook becoming more attractive as more users join.\n\nBitcoin Maximalism is a term coined by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum, however, has its own appcoin, Ether, which runs on its own blockchain independently of Bitcoins. Buterin described Ether as “simply a token useful for paying transaction fees or building or purchasing decentralized application services on the Ethereum platform.”\n\nThe Ether sale was the largest crowdsale in crypto history, and the fourth largest in the history of the internet, raising 31,591 bitcoins, worth US$18,439,086 at the time.\n\nIn Daniel Krawisz\'s classic and controversial article ‘Appcoins are Snake Oil,’ posted on the Nakamoto Institute, Krawisz argued that appcoins, like Ethereum’s Ether, are not immune to the network effect, no matter how useful they are to the underlying application.\n\n- Daniel Krawisz\n\nHis argument centers around the fact that requiring a secondary exchange to convert from one coin to another makes using appcoins less efficient than using bitcoin within the application.\n\nBitcoin-to-Ether conversion fees are commonly around 2% per trade, creating “trade barriers” that make large-scale use of the appcoin uneconomical. Krawisz also argues that it\'s a matter of user convenience, who wants to carry around two different kinds of money when you can have just one?\n\nUnderstandably, the article was not well received in the “Bitcoin 2.0” community. Ethereum is only one, albeit the largest, out of a number of projects that use their own internal cryptocurrency token. Some, like Augur, use a unique token as currency, but based on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe arguments for and against have long been fought in forums and chat rooms. The debate around bitcoin maximalism, with Ethereum as a well funded example of success, now has a new topic, Rootstock.\n\nRootstock is another project for advanced smart contracts on a blockchain, and has gathered a lot of talented coders. It purports to do everything that Ethereum does, but without the cryptocurrency Ether. It uses the Bitcoin blockchain instead of Ethereum’s chain, leveraging Bitcoin\'s network effect and security.\n\n- Rootstock\n\nThe Rootstock team, which includes at least one bitcoin core developer, has been discretely working on the platform for two years. A recent post on Reddit says that when it is launched, it will be fully compatible with Ethereum, at least to begin with.\n\n- Diego Gutierrez Saldivar\n\nThe Rootstock platform is said to be completely open-source and more information will become available at the 2015 Latin American Bitcoin Conference, LaBITConf Mexico on December 4 and 5, when the Rootstock whitepaper will be released.\n\nThe whitepaper is currently in the hands of a select few industry experts, including computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer Nick Szabo, who announced the project in a couple of tweets on Wednesday:\n\n- Nick Szabo\n\nBy using a variant of Ethereums’ open source Virtual Machine as a Bitcoin sidechain, Rootstock claims to have removed the need for any secondary cryptocurrency entirely. But the platform will use a unique token, called Roots.\n\nThrough the use of sidechains, Roots will be exchanged for bitcoin in a 2-way peg. This locks in their value, but allows them to be exchanged and used seamlessly.\n\nDetractors are quick to remind everyone that Sidechains have yet to be perfected and are not a proven technology. However, the development team at Rootstock has made the call to move ahead with implementing Roots on a sidechain anyway. If anything, the added pressure of Rootstock using them is likely to speed up sidechain development and be a boon for the whole crypto community.\n\nIn the meantime, Sidechains are already working in a less secure fashion, as a “semi-trust based alternatives to a trust-less 2-way peg.” According to Rootstock\'s Saldivar, that is most likely good enough to start.\n\n- Sergio Demian Lerner\n\nCoincidentally, in September, banking giant UBS revealed its interest in both sidechains and Ethereum, according to IBTimes. ""If folks make [sidechains] work very well then we might find we take advantage of that. It\'s just too nascent to make hard technology decisions at this point,"" stated Alex Batlin, a director in UBS\'s technology innovation and research team\n\nWhile the inclusion of sidechains may give Rootstock an edge, the question of which platform triumphs may come down to funding. Rootstock’s Saldivar recently said that they are not lacking in that department. “Suffice to say that we are well funded for the moment and we are not proactively seeking for more funds.”\n\nMeanwhile, despite the record breaking crowdsale a year ago, Ethereum has seen its reserves dwindle and is starting to actively seek new funding.\n\n- Vitalik Buterin\n\nAlthough Ethereum’s development fund is closed to the public, the number of Ether they own is known, as is their worth. At current rates, the Ethereum foundation has about 9 months of funding remaining, assuming the price of 1 Ether remains around US$1.50. Of course, if Rootstock takes off before then, and eats into Ethereum’s space, that price could suffer.\n\nKnCMiner’s Director or Marketing, Nanok ?ie, recently laid out a plan on his popular blog Webonanza, titled ‘It’s not too late to save Ethereum.’ The post addressed several problems, including the funding shortage that the project faces, a lack of coherent direction, and the lack of security in its’ present mining state. In the post dated Oct 1, ?ie argued that using a blockchain that could be merge-mined with bitcoin, much like Namecoin, would solve a lot of the project’s problems.\n\nHowever, upon learning about Rootstock just six days later, ?ie had a quick change of heart:\n\n- Nanok ?ie\n\nIn all likelihood, Ethereum developers will find the funding they need to continue forward, and both platforms will be available for use at the same time. Perhaps Buterin will follow through on his comments in Bitcoin Magazine, in April 2014, “it is very likely that as soon as the Ethereum genesis block launches, there will be side-chains for Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin implemented as contracts within three months.” The Genesis block was created on 30 July, 2015. Perhaps Ethereum can evolve into something with even more functionality than either group imagined.', 'Within the U.S. economy and all across Europe the injection of fiat by the central banking system in response to their conspired economic depressions has rocked an average citizen’s savings to the core. Many people are not saving at all, and those that can save a little for the future are scared that hyperinflation will destroy their living assets.\n\nIn the U.S. alone\n\nonly 18%\n\nof workers are confident they have enough wealth to retire.\n\n[tweet_box design=”default”][/tweet_box]\n\nIn the U.S. alone only 18% of workers are confident they have enough wealth to retire. It’s a scary time we live in where one’s life savings can be eradicated by the devaluation of sovereign currencies and poor fractional bank practices. The key to staying proactive by protecting your assets is diversification making sure your wealth hedges against nasty inflationary spirals destined to come.\n\nDiversification can help a person save and protect themselves better than saving large amounts of cash. Fiat currency no matter what governance you live under is being printed by the central banking regime which currently network’s vast amounts of devalued promissory notes on a whim.\n\nEvery day the current currency giants the Euro, Dollar and the Japanese Yen are deteriorating at record speeds and being trampled by other countries fiat money. Just recently the Chinese Yuan has become the fourth most transacted currency in the world positioning itself as powerhouse due to its reliant economy. However, the Chinese market that might be a touch “stronger” is just as faulty and will fail with its use of printing money at a whim and manipulating interest rates.\n\nThere are a multiple ways to diversify and including cash in your portfolio is still recommended because saving cash as opposed to “digits” in a bank account may preserve longer. However, there are two solid ways to rail against inflation; saving bitcoins and precious metals which have consistently performed against the devaluation of legal tender. Some may disapprove of the thought that Bitcoin is included with metals as a hedging tool as it’s a very young medium. Bitcoin has proven to be a safeguard during times where governments have imposed capital controls on their citizens.\n\nBitcoins have met most of the qualities of sound money much like the precious metals that humans have saved as safeguards throughout the millennia. The currency is divisible and most importantly scarce with only 21 million cryptographically insured units. It’s not controlled by a central entity and cannot be massed printed.\n\nIn the closing end of 2014 Bitcoin has appreciated 2–400% per annum and in 2015 even with its price reaching certain lows it continues to grow in value. It’s a one of a kind technology that can be traded instantly in a decentralized environment that cannot be frozen at the whims of authority because there is none. The protocol is a secure ecosystem of sound money that can hedge against hyperinflation and devalued fiat that causes relentless economic busts and booms.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar and the Euro have been poised for ultimate collapse for quite sometime. For the past 15 years, many countries have been exiting the main system that keeps the dollar afloat the petrodollar. The petrodollar is a deal that was made over 40 years ago today which enables every export of oil in the world to be priced in U.S. Dollars. This has kept the survival of the bloated military industrial complex and all its wars alive and will continue to eat away at people’s savings. This arrangement has provided the Dollar a position as the global reserve currency and is slowly fading away as Russia and China are making new moves with Saudi Arabia.\n\nAdditionally the BRICS nations (Brazil, China, Russia, South Africa, and India) stepped up their game by telling the world they would work directly together as opposed to funnelling trades with the dollar. Within newly formed Bilateral Trade Agreements over the years the aligned countries took the next logical step by creating the New Development Bank. All of this action leads to wars over oil, austerity measures and the removal of people’s fundamental rights by a small group of sociopathic banking elites.\n\nThe currency wars have been raging for hundreds of years and continue to smash the wealth of ordinary people. All of them including Russia and China are printing and hiding as much debt as they can as they face economic turmoil. This summer the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen plunged roughly 30% over the course of two days and the month of July showed the Chinese market had lost about 2.36 Trillion in market value.\n\nThe Yuan and the Chinese economy is continuing to grow at exponential rates in contrast to other leading countries. Despite China’s growth the fact is their government and colluded banks are printing money like water. With this injection of printed cash, the centralized banks are lending to high-risk situations and economically unsound infrastructure such as fractional banking. All fiat money whether it’s the Yuan, Ruble, Dollar or Yen will surely collapse over the course of some miserable economic times leaving only sound money solutions in its wake.\n\nAnother option of securing your wealth is with precious metals (PM) which are also a viable alternative to the dying currencies. Gold and Silver have always been a great way to diversify over the last 3,000 years. These metals have retained their value over time as a currency, jewelry and critical components in many electronics.\n\nSilver, which is the “affordable” precious metal was found after Gold in 4,000 BC and is the most electrically and thermally conductive metal in the globe. All precious metals have kept their value over time because most of them also keep to the ideals of sound money. Metals are scarce as well and cannot be mass produced enabling its owners a great tool to use against the inflation problems growing daily.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Gold are great mediums of exchange and can help when it comes to diversified hedging. Saving precious metals and digital gold such as Bitcoin are just two ways one can diversify with and there are multiples of other asset avenues a person can take including food storage and property. The point is that saving fiat whether in its hard physical form or digits can be “ok” because saving, in general, is good practice.\n\nThe greenbacks you are holding are not backed by anything and could eventually fail at any given time. Keeping all your eggs in one basket is always proven to be a poor choice and diversification leads to better asset management and less risk in the end.\n\nSaving with Bitcoin is new and exciting because it offers methods of trade that precious metals cannot give, such as sending millions across seas in a matter of minutes. Moving large amounts of gold or silver is just not that easy so holding all your money in precious metals may not be a good idea. Another fact is storing precious metals also can be very costly especially if you have quite a bit of gold and silver.\n\nOne of Bitcoin’s attributions is that it’s a portable digital form of scarcity offering an easier form of commerce than gold. Because Bitcoin is divisible by eight decimals and is capped at 21 million, it offers great liquidity within commerce guaranteeing transfer of ownership and a solid unit of account. Gold and Silver has lasted as asset safe havens for thousands of years, but Bitcoin in its early genesis is showing signs of greatness already with its achievements as a medium of exchange and store of value.\n\nDiversification of both of these units offers one of the best things of all counter-economics that in turn helps the overall end game of offering choices in a tender. Currently, there’s been a significant downtrend in the Gold, Silver and the Bitcoin environment. Gold is running at a key juncture that could drop the price down to $1,200 USD giving PM collectors an opportunity to hedge some cheaper commodities.\n\nThe same goes for Bitcoin at the current time which has dipped this year but has remained steady in price since January and seems to be rallying upwards this past month. The breaking point past $250 USD towards $260 USD may happen soon as the price is wavering in between the 240-250 zone, but there may be a downtrend towards 200MA.\n\nBoth of these assets are at apparent lows, and those choosing to invest may want to look into this range. Diversification reduces risk in investing by spreading overall investments in a variety of assets and commodities. By investing in Bitcoin or precious metals, the intention is to offset the potential loss due extreme inflation and devalued currency that is systematically destroying the savings of average citizens. The new digital gold is also thwarting off attacks such as frozen account, capital controls, and extreme austerity measures. As of now it seems the future can be more solid when saving with honest and sound money.', 'Financing momentum for bitcoin startups is fading after an all-time high earlier this year, with deal activity in the space falling to a five-quarter low in the third quarter of this year.\n\nThis is according to new data released by CB Insights, which reports funding fell for the second consecutive quarter to US$87 million.\n\nThis in spite of investments hitting an all-time high earlier this year, with the State of Bitcoin Q1 2015 report released by CoinDesk reporting the first quarter of this year saw a record amount of venture capital ploughed into bitcoin companies globally.\n\nCB Insights, however, now reports investments have lost momentum, with the drop in overall deals coming in spite of larger financing deals for startups focused on use cases for bitcoin’s underlying distributed ledger technology, the blockchain.\n\n“While overall deal and funding levels have dropped, the ecosystem of startups is now maturing to more mid-stage financings,” CB Insights said.\n\nAfrican startups benefitted from the growth in interest in bitcoin, not least the sizeable round raised in February by African bitcoin remittance startup BitPesa. In July, Kenyan digital currency wallet and development provider Bitsoko was also backed, receiving a US$100,000 grant through the Grand Challenges Explorations (GCE) initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nConfidence was dented in August, however, when Disrupt Africa reported much touted Ghanaian bitcoin startup Beam, launched in October of last year to facilitate remittances, had pivoted. The startup is still alive and well, now allowing Ghanaians abroad to pay for gifts and bill payments back home, but what was key from a digital currency perspective was the scrapping of bitcoin as a means of payment.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether bitcoin can yet find its niche in Africa, or globally.', 'Hong Kong Based Gaming Marketplace G2A Picked BitPay to Accept Bitcoin\n\nOctober 13, 2015 By: Asif Imtiaz\n\nOne of the largest gaming marketplaces, G2A announced that they have partnered with BitPay in order to accept payment from users through Bitcoin.\n\nG2A is a trusted marketplace for digital products like games, software activation licenses for Steam, Xbox Live cards, PSN codes and time-cards for online games.\n\nHong Kong based G2A is a popular online gaming portal that brings game buyers, developers and sellers under a united marketplace and facilitated on average around 700,000 transactions per month 2015.\n\nG2A currently has over 6 million active users and considered as one of the fastest growing companies in the gaming industry. In order to offer a secure online gaming experience the company has invested 20 million Euros in the research development over the past two years.\n\nEarlier this week, Bartosz Skwarczek, the Chief Executive Officer of G2A confirmed in a press release that they have partnered with leading Bitcoin payment processor BitPay as it offered one of the most streamlined Bitcoin payment solutions.\n\nCommenting on the collaboration with BitPay, Bob Voermans, G2A’s VP of Global Payments said that his company is “delighted to confirm BitPay as a trusted partner.”\n\nWith Bitcoin, G2A’s user base will get access to an additional secure payment method and likely attract a niche market of online gamers who prefer to Bitcoin over traditional payment methods because of lower transaction fees. “In my estimation this partnership will increase growth for sellers due to the fact that customers will buy more often on the G2A.COM Marketplace,” added Mr. Voermans.\n\nWith over 700,000 average monthly transactions from G2A users, BitPay would be also benefit greatly and would be able to ensure its top line growth in the coming months. General Manager BitPay also sounded delighted while commenting on the partnership with G2A, as he said “[partnering] with G2A which will help us scale Bitcoin payments to a broad gaming audience.” “By their nature, digital goods like games are borderless.

10/14/2015,"['The company formerly known as Bitreserve is moving beyond its Bitcoin roots to become a full-service provider of financial transactions under the new moniker Uphold.\n\nIn a blog post published earlier today, Uphold president and chief executive Anthony Watson laid out the new vision for the company.\n\nLaunched by internet gadabout Halsey Minor in 2014, Uphold (nee Bitreserve) was initially intended to be one of several services that brought Bitcoin to the masses in a simplified way.\n\nUnder Watson’s purview the company has expanded its mission. Bitcoin is no longer the focus as the company serves as a catch-all for commodities investment, corporate transactions (ultimately) and money transfers and remittances.\n\nThe first step in this process is launching today with the opening up of Uphold accounts to any Euro who wants to use the system to transfer money.\n\nThe second step, happening in November, will be providing the same services to customers in China and the U.S.\n\nPhases three and four involve partnerships with MasterCard, Visa, Discover allowing members to pay merchants online and offline through the Uphold system and opening up all of the company’s offerings to customers in India.\n\nIn the past, Uphold relied on Bitcoin to finance accounts, but now folks can link to any bank account or credit card.\n\nThe Charlotte-based company has been looking for its niche for a while. Earlier this year it launched a commodities investment product that allowed users to move Bitcoin into commodities like gold and silver.\n\nNow, Watson’s vision is much broader, encompassing corporate finance, remittances, money transfers and a whole host of financial services.\n\nThe vision may be big, but it’s not unique. Several companies like TransferWise and Venmo are tackling aspects of the market already. And they’re far from the only ones.\n\nUphold does have certain perks for folks who use the service. There are no charges on transfers from bank accounts to Uphold up to a certain amount (although the company does charge for withdrawals above a certain limit in the UK and in the EU), and its free to convert and move currency using the company’s system.\n\nUphold also still allows for its precious metals conversions (with a nominal fee).\n\nThe company has also opened up an API for developers. The Uphold Connect API gives folks free currency conversions and anti-money laundering controls.\n\nAnd the company also offers tracking of all of its transactions through what it calls the Reserveledger and Reservechain. Here, the company’s roots in the bitcoin community come out. The two products allow users to track balances, transaction flows and volumes, along with the corporate balances, assets and obligations of Uphold itself.\n\nUphold has handled $400 million worth of transactions across 163 countries.\n\n“Our mission is to make it easy and frictionless for anyone, anywhere to move, convert, hold and transact in any form of money or commodity securely, instantly and for free,” said Watson.', 'It\'s an open secret that companies working with bitcoin funds have long faced challenges gaining access to banking services.\n\nThough few are forthcoming about this business reality, the difficulties have affected startups around the globe – from the US to India and Argentina – resulting in business interruptions and attempts by industry firms to solve the problem through innovation.\n\nA new partnership between compliance startup Chainalysis and UK financial services giant Barclays, however, could hold the keys to reversing this trend. Announced yesterday at an event celebrating the graduation of 11 startups in the most recent TechStars FinTech accelerator, the deal is an attempt by Barclays to arm its financial crime and transaction monitoring teams with the skills needed to onboard bitcoin clients.\n\nIn interview, Chainalysis co-founder and chief revenue officer (CRO) Jonathan Levin framed the deal as one that will help mark the first time that a major bank with clearing ability would be able to publicly open its business to bitcoin and blockchain industry clients.\n\nLevin told CoinDesk:\n\n""Barclays had a blanket no rule [for working with bitcoin companies], as do most of the banks in the UK. We\'re working with the compliance division to bring things into place so they can transact with companies in that space.""\n\nLevin said that Barclays will not be accepting bitcoin funds directly, but rather seeking to use the partnership as a way to capture the first-mover advantage inherent in marketing a bitcoin-friendly fiat banking service, while also bolstering the abilities of their tech team.\n\n""It\'s a recognition that financial crimes divisions haven\'t seen that much innovation, to make it a competitive advantage by saying that they have a compliance department that can handle the latest trends in technology,"" he said.\n\nAlong with the deal, Chainalysis received an undisclosed amount of funding from startup accelerator TechStars in exchange for 6% equity and participation in the 13-week program. The company has said it plans to relocate to New York following the news.\n\nFounded by former members of bitcoin exchange Kraken and bitcoin wallet provider Mycelium, Chainalysis offers web-based compliance tools alongside an API for transaction-based risk scoring and Reactor, a product it bills as an ""enhanced due diligence and investigation tool"".\n\nDefining thresholds\n\nThought its products have proved controversial among more privacy-conscious bitcoin users, Levin framed Chainalysis\'s work as necessary to helping Barclays determine how industry startups can best meet bank-level compliance standards.\n\nIn this light, Levin indicated that the biggest challenge faced by institutions like Barclays isn\'t an inherent aversion to bitcoin as a payment method, but rather a lack of understanding about how the due diligence it needs to perform on these customers should be conducted.\n\nLevin said that all payment methods have separate standards for different forms of value, comparing the transition as akin to defining best practices and thresholds for cash.\n\n""Even cash has limits,"" Levin remarked. ""If you\'re a bank, accepting cash that smells of marijuana is illegal under the law. You need to file a suspicious activity report (SAR), which is the case in places like Colorado. You can\'t walk into a bank branch and just deposit that cash into a bank account.""\n\nHere, Levin said, bitcoin has an advantage as there\'s a level of transparency the blockchain brings that, when paired with certain services, is sufficient to help banks ensure they aren\'t establishing relationships with firms conducting illegal activities.\n\n""Everyone\'s going to have been exposed to crime, but it\'s about limiting abuse in the system,"" Levin continued.\n\nBusiness understanding\n\nThis isn\'t to say Barclays is looking to develop a one-size-fits-all approach to banking bitcoin clients, as Levin indicated it also needs help identifying the kinds of industry companies that pose a risk from a regulatory perspective.\n\nFor example, he noted that most compliance teams at major banks aren\'t yet able to differentiate between companies that purely provide software, and those that custody customer funds directly.\n\n""Banks haven\'t been able to understand the nuance of different business models in the space. People within the bank will now have that domain expertise to say this is a software business, this is not a money transmitter, this is something that is very important in developing that domain expertise,"" he said.\n\nThough a time-intensive investment for Barclays, he framed the task as one that\'s in line with recent developments in financial innovation.\n\n""This is a big trend, where cybersecurity and money laundering will be going hand in hand in the future,"" he remarked.\n\nStandard deal\n\nLevin further said that, while a big-name client for his startup, the company\'s relationship with Barclays would not be substantially different than those with other firms.\n\nChainalysis, he said, would not be consulting Barclays on its product use, nor would it be allocating daily resources to the effort.\n\n""There are some elements that we have built specifically to suit their needs, but fundamentally, we\'re a product company,"" he said.\n\nSpeaking to the abilities of the firm\'s technology, he indicated he believes the products will help Barclays ""know what bitcoin is down to the wallet implementation"".\n\nUltimately, however, he positioned the process of bringing bitcoin firms into the banking community as one that will take more than a single partnership, concluding:\n\n""What is the right level of compliance? We\'re working that out. Having a relationship with banks and regulators is key, so you can develop a standard of what\'s possible and put into practice what\'s possible.""\n\nImage credit: chrisdorney / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The first production sidechain is a platform that will allow rapid liquidity between Bitcoin exchanges and brokers. Five services collaborated with Blockstream’s developers, Bitfinex, BTCC, Kraken, Unocoin, and Xapo will operate the private chain together sharing order books. Liquid will provide processors reduced accounting time within trading to produce a more fluid exchange arrangement.\n\nFounding member and Chief Instigator, Austin Hill states:\n\n“As a Bitcoin-centric company, we are excited to be delivering a real-world solution that moves the ecosystem forward.”\n\nIt\'s been nearly a year since Blockstream released its white paper “Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains” and it looks as though the startup is finally making sidechains a reality. Sidechains are separate blockchains that are interoperable with each other and can add additional properties to the Bitcoin network. These distinct and separate chains act as vessels that can allow solutions to problems like block intervals, transaction structure, and security.\n\nFor quite some time, many in the community have viewed sidechains as vaporware, a product that is announced to the public but never comes to fruition. Now, Liquid is looking to to prove naysayers wrong with its production chain launch.\n\nThe exchanges and brokerages involved with the Blockstream chain will not only participate with the new system but also act as customers paying fees. Liquid is expected to be released sometime in Q1 of 2016 and will add a high-volume and low-fee cryptographic platform to the current Bitcoin blockchain. The service executes its protocol by using shared technology with its partners acting similar to multi-sig technology, but uses a Byzantine round robin consensus to confirm transactions and agreements made.\n\nThe system avoids soft-forks within the Bitcoin client by using a federated peg, and the POW is substituted by the number of functionaries that verify incoming blocks. Austin Hill, founding member of Blockstream and team “Chief Instigator” explains that a set of rules has been designed to make sure signatures are valid:\n\n""As long as the transaction is constructed, and the private key is correct, and the unspent transaction output is valid, then all of the signers who are running nodes approve the transaction.""\n\nThe Chief Instigator says Liquid is the first move towards a commercial sidechain market, and the Blockstream code is an open-source protocol that anyone can help improve. Crypto-community members have been pretty excited that possibly in 2016 sidechains will go beyond the vaporware stage and actually produce real-world applications and value. Certain aspects of 2.0 technology have already appeared to help financial markets such as Coinprism’s colored coin application “Open Assets” through NASDAQs trading platform. It\'s only a matter of time when services like Blockstream’s sidechains join hands with current innovative blockchain technology that\'s reshaping traditional finance.\n\nBlockstream is an accelerator for open assets, cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts by researching and designing platforms for 2.0 blockchain concepts. The startup was founded in 2014 and has roughly 50 contributors adding to the project. The core team consists of well-known Bitcoin architects, cryptographers, cypherpunks, and entrepreneurs with the belief that sidechains will have a significant impact on emerging technologies. Some of these known team-members are Adam Back, Matt Corallo, and Gregory Maxwell, who\'ve contributed quite a bit to the project. The organization has so far raised US$21 Million from venture capital investment from Blockchain Capital, AME Cloud Ventures, and private investors.', 'Yesterday morning, New York time, a company called Clique Fund used the bitcoin blockchain to borrow $10 million in stock.\n\nBitcoin is the world\'s most popular digital currency, and the blockchain is the vast online ledger that underpins bitcoin, tabulating transactions using thousands of independent machines spread across the globe. But the blockchain can oversee more than just the exchange of money. It can also oversee the exchange of, well, anything that holds value. That includes stock and other financial securities.\n\nThrough a new operation it calls TØ.com, online retailer Overstock.com and its freethinking CEO, Patrick Byrne, have built a system for issuing, buying, selling, and even borrowing stocks and bonds on the blockchain. On Tuesday morning, Clique Fund, a hedge fund based in New York City, used this system to borrow shares in the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nPreviously, TØ.com, an Overstock subsidiary, had used the system to issue a private bond to Byrne himself. Later, it issued a mostly symbolic bond to an outside company called FNY Capital. But the Clique Fund transaction is more than just a symbol. ""This is a real trade,"" says John Tabacco, who founded TØ together with Byrne.\n\nAccording to Tabacco, TØ has been facilitating stock loans for the past two weeks, with five different customers borrowing stock, including Clique Fund. Tuesday\'s transaction is the largest to date. ""We\'re starting to get critical mass—institutional-sized trades,"" he says.\n\nNew Tech to Renew Markets\n\nThe transaction spearheads a much larger movement towards systems that use the blockchain and related technologies to facilitate financial trades. Startups such as Symbiont are working on similar systems, as is the company behind the Nasdaq stock exchange. At the moment, Nasdaq is building a system that will use the blockchain to oversee trades in private companies. But it believes that the technology can also be applied to the public stock markets.\n\nThe promise of the blockchain is that it can streamline the trading process, providing a more reliable record of who owns what and when, while removing at least some of the middlemen who bog down today\'s markets. In particular, Byrne sees the technology as a way of closing the sort of well-documented market loophole—so-called ""naked short selling""—that has plagued the Overstock.com in the past.\n\nThe way the market works today, stock trades can take up to three days to settle, and this largely happens behind closed doors. In the mid-2000s, this allowed hedge funds and other to short sell stock that hadn\'t really been borrowed—-aka naked short selling. Though this loophole has now been closed, similar issues continue to plague the market. In moving transactions onto an online system, Byrne believes, we can remove these loopholes by settling stock trades immediately, and in a more transparent way. TØ is called TØ because it aims to settle trades with zero delay.\n\nOverstock and TØ believe this system could particularly benefit the stock loan market, which is controlled by a select group of middlemen, including prime brokers such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as ""agent lenders"" such as BNY Mellon and State Street. To a certain extent, TØ\'s system can cut out these middlemen and reduce the cost of stock borrowing.\n\nBasically, organizations that want to make some extra money loaning out stock—such as pension funds—can offer up this stock through the TØ system. The system uses the blockchain to attach digital tokens to each share, and then, hedge funds and other traders can bid for these ""pre-borrow asset tokens,"" which provide the right to borrow the share. Using these tokens, stock holders can closely track each transaction involving their loaned stock.\n\nOpening the System\n\nThat\'s no small thing. Stock loans are an enormous part of the worldwide financial system. In borrowing stock, traders can short sell (sell the borrowed stock and reap the profit when the price goes down) or they can hedge other trades. The global stock market spans about $101 trillion in financial securities, and according to research from DataLend, about $1.7 trillion is out on loan at any given moment. That figure tops $954 billion in the U.S. alone.\n\nJosh Galper, who runs a financial consulting firm, Finadium, that closely tracks stock loans, applauds the TØ system but questions how big its audience will be. The existing players, including the prime brokers, will be difficult to unseat. ""It\'s good news for them—and a very interesting experiment,"" he says.\n\nAt the same time, Overstock and TØ are also aiming to remake the public stock market as a whole. Their system provides a way for companies to issue stock, and it\'s seeking SEC approval to do so publicly. As it waits for an SEC greenlight, TØ has shown that the system can be used to issue private bonds—similar to what Nasdaq is trying to do with its Nasdaq Private Market system.\n\nThough the system now uses the bitcoin blockchain, Overstock has experimented with other technologies that mimic the blockchain, and the system may move to these technologies in the future. The blockchain may not operate fast enough for real-time trades on the public stock market. But the idea will hold up just fine.', 'Next Generation Blockchain Applications Go Well Beyond Bitcoin The technology behind cryptocurrency can be so much more than that.\n\nBitcoin is a mirror that reflects your attitudes about change. Maybe you see it as a Ponzi-scheme/gun club. Maybe you see it as a free market savior. Either way, it’s easy to miss the root structure for the trees. The true wonder behind bitcoin is the public ledger that supports the system, the blockchain. The blockchain is a record kept by an impartial bookkeeper who only knows how to add new entries. The chronological order and identities aren’t public — that’s where the crypto part comes from — but the record of exchange is. And this technology is probably far more significant than bitcoin itself, even if it often has to settle for a supporting role in the grander narrative.\n\nThese are the ways in which blockchain will show up in the lives of not bitcoiners.\n\nBank Security\n\nA blockchain-like system could be used to bump up the security of transactions between customers and traditional financial institutions, argues Standard Chartered Bank’s Chief Innovation Officer Anju Patwardhan. “With the use of blockchain technology, each leg of the transaction can be recorded and traced, making the ultimate destination and use of the funds clearer,” she recently wrote on Linkedin. “This means combating financial crime such as money laundering also becomes easier.”\n\nThat banks want to get in on the blockchain isn’t just idle speculation. In September, Bloomberg reported that banking shai-huluds Barclays and JPMorgan were eying the blockchain as a way to consolidate transactions into one secure system. This would definitely hurt Blockchain’s street cred, but it might provide some reassurance about information security.\n\nSecure digital voting\n\nThe greatest barrier to getting electoral processes online, according to its detractors, is security. Using blockchain, a voter could check that her or his vote was successfully transmitted while remaining anonymous to the rest of the world. In 2014, Liberal Alliance, a political party in Denmark, became the first organization to use blockchain to vote. With American voter turnout still shockingly low, distributed digital voting may represent a way to enfranchise non-participants.\n\nPatent protection without the public patent\n\nProof of Existence is a service that, for a small bitcoin fee, offers a blockchain-based proof that you, in fact, owned a document at a specific time. If you wanted to have retroactive evidence of an idea you created, you could point to the blockchain to show it was yours first. That’s not how patents work today, of course, but it’s easy to see how Google or Microsoft might want to keep a technology tucked out of the public eye while still making an effort to stake a claim. Companies and individuals should be able to keep track of their progress without helping their rivals. Giving them the chance to do research in solitude could lead to more innovation (and hurt China’s knockoff factories).\n\nRevamping the entire online experience\n\nEthereum, a foundation in Switzerland, wants to see open and decentralized technology everywhere. Vitalik Buterin, who invented the underpinning Ethereum protocol, believes it could be used for “smart contracts, computational resource marketplaces, financial experimentation, decentralized governance.” The Economist walks that scenario through its admittedly science-fictional conclusion: Once computers start enforcing contracts, robot businesses follow and start using profits to self-upgrade.', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article."", 'The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued a public warning against an investment firm promising high returns on cryptocurrency trading.\n\nThe UK regulator – which oversees more than 70,000 businesses in the financial industry – issued a public warning against Cryptoconomist Limited, registered to a London address, on its website earlier today.\n\nIn the warning, the FCA said it believed the trading website had been providing ""financial services or products in the UK"" without its authorisation.

10/15/2015,"[""CoinDesk’s latest State of Bitcoin and Blockchain report, sponsored by Coinalytics, summarizes the key trends, data and events from the third quarter of 2015. This article highlights a few of the 88 new slides found in the report.\n\nBlockchain captures the zeitgeist\n\nThe Q3 2015 report marks CoinDesk's eighth in the series and much has changed since we released the first State of Bitcoin in February 2014. Arguably the most significant change, which was highlighted in last quarter’s report, has been the dramatic shift in focus from bitcoin’s use as an alternative currency and store of value to the possibilities surrounding the underlying distributed ledger technology, or blockchain.\n\nThere has long been significant interest in the many different uses for blockchain technology. However, the ‘non-currency’ use cases (eg securities settlement) have, until recently, generally commanded less total mindshare than ‘currency’ use-cases (eg merchant acceptance and payment processing).\n\nIn acknowledgment of the increasing emphasis placed on distributed ledger technology, we have retitled our report the ‘State of Bitcoin and Blockchain’ and added a new section specifically focused on the latest developments in distributed ledger technology.\n\nBitcoin startups pivot\n\nAlongside the interest shown during Q3 in distributed ledger tech by traditional financial institutions (and the added competition this will bring), several bitcoin startups announced new blockchain initiatives. For instance, US exchange itBit revealed its bankchain product, and Ripple announced its Interledger initiative to connect various distributed ledgers.\n\nIndeed, with the reduction in exchange trading volume, and relatively slow pickup in areas such as payments and bitcoin remittance (Slide 55) it has been clear for some time now that many startups would either need to pivot or perish.\n\nIn anticipation that more bitcoin companies will incorporate blockchain-oriented products and services we have created a new industry classification framework that distinguishes between three different business models: ‘currency’, ‘non-currency’ and ‘hybrid’ (Slide 65).\n\n‘Currency’ companies are wallets, exchanges, payment processors and other financial services companies that principally focus on bitcoin as an alternative payment rail or investment asset.\n\nIn contrast, ‘non-currency’ companies focus on infrastructure and the use of blockchain technology for information management. Hybrids like itBit, which runs both a currency exchange as well its own blockchain product and service, combine both business models.\n\nLooking at the industry through this new framework shows that, to date, less than a third of all venture capital has been invested in blockchain startups (non-currency and hybrid) (Slide 66).\n\nBitcoin price volatility returns\n\nAfter a relatively quiet Q2, bitcoin’s price once again made news, and over half of the top 10 most viewed stories on CoinDesk during Q3 were related to price (Slide 19).\n\nBitcoin’s price spiked in the early part of Q3 due to macroeconomic concerns in Greece and China but then briefly fell below $200 in August, hitting a new six-month low.\n\nThe return of price volatility coincided with a 17% quarter-over-quarter increase in bitcoin exchange trading volume (Slide 13). However, trading volumes still remain well below previous levels.\n\nPace of VC investment slows\n\nTotal bitcoin venture capital increased 11% to $921m in Q3. While all time bitcoin investment is on track to surpass $1bn in 2015, there has been a slowdown in the pace of investment (Slide 30).\n\nIt is unclear at this stage if there is any particularly noteworthy reason behind the observed slowdown in investment; it may reflect something significant such as the venture capital community’s concerns over the speed of adoption, or something insignificant like seasonal factors.\n\nOne positive investment development to note is that more traditional financial services firms are investing in the space. For example, in September payments giant Visa made its first publicly announced investment when it joined Chain’s $30m Series B, which, along with BitFury’s $20m Series C, were this quarter’s two biggest deals.\n\nRising competition has also led to an increase in the number of acquisitions and bankruptcies, with consolidation particularly active in the exchange and mining sectors due to cost and competitive pressures (Slide 39).\n\nShakeout in payment processor sector\n\nPayment processor and wallet startups have seen little-to-zero venture capital investment over the last several quarters (Slide 37).\n\nBitcoin’s failure to gain significant traction as a medium of exchange for non-illicit transactions is roiling the payment processing sector. For example, BitPay, which is one of the most well-financed startups in the space, announced significant staff cuts and that it will no longer offer its ‘free and unlimited’ introductory service to new merchants looking to accept bitcoin as payment.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the challenges associated with the adoption of new payment methods are not unique to bitcoin. For example, Apple Pay has also struggled to sustain its early momentum and gain wider use despite the tremendous publicity surrounding the announcement of Apple Pay and success of the iPhone 6 (Slide 52).\n\nView the full State of Bitcoin and Blockchain Q3 2015 Report, sponsored by Coinalytics.

This causes the node computers to slow down dramatically or even freeze-up. If a node slows down too much, the bitcoin network considers it to be ineffective and \'offline\'. My guess is that most of the offline nodes just stop functioning well enough to respond.""\n\nBy Thursday, node numbers on tracking service Bitnodes had dropped 10%.\n\nToday, despite the memory pool returning to normal (around 4MB at press time) and Core developer Jeff Garzik implementing a \'quick fix\' for operators, the total number of reachable nodes – 5,030 – remains 16% lower than before the \'attack\'.\n\nUnder stress\n\nOver the past year, the bitcoin network has been subject to a number of so-called \'stress tests\' which has seen it flooded with many low-value transactions. While some have speculated over the legality of these actions, others have accused those behind them – namely, CoinWallet – of holding the network ransom.\n\nWhile node operators cannot stop the tests – sending 1 million transactions in bitcoin\'s smallest denomination, 5,430 satoshis, could cost a spammer as little as 54 BTC (or roughly $13,000) – there are now a number of proposals that could help mitigate against them.\n\nThe \'quick fix\' Garzik implemented Monday, for example, is an adjustment to each node\'s so-called \'Minrelaytxfee\', which lets it reject transactions below a certain fee.\n\nIn the most recent release of Bitcoin Core it had been set to 0.00001 bitcoin per KB by default. This has now been increased by a factor of five to 0.00005 bitcoin per KB.\n\nGarzik himself admits it\'s an ""ugly workaround"" while a more robust solution is underway, with proposals from fellow Core developers Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille and Peter Todd currently on the table.\n\n""Pretty much everyone on the Bitcoin Core team is working on this, mostly by reviewing proposals, with a subset writing code,"" Todd told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""The main obstacle to doing this right has been to come up with a scheme that doesn\'t allow attackers to use up network bandwidth at no cost; it took a number of attempts by the Core devs to come up with a scheme that didn\'t have vulnerabilities in it.""\n\nHowever, like any change that could impact bitcoin\'s economics, not everyone agrees on exactly how this should play out, with Mike Hearn\'s Bitcoin XT client taking its own route.\n\nSome have been skeptical that nodes\' varying fees will make it difficult to price transactions – a potential problem for services which want to send transactions cheaply, for example smaller wallets.\n\nAltruism\n\nNode operators, unlike miners, receive no newly minted bitcoins for their contribution to the network. Many are simply hobbyists who choose to run them altruistically – to keep bitcoin big, decentralised, and thus healthy.\n\nThomas White, who has been running multiple nodes for the past 15 months, told CoinDesk he does so because he already pays for a server which often has capacity going spare.\n\n""As a big bitcoin user, I\'m very aware of the importance of maintaining diversity in the network ... hosting the bitcoin blockchain there has no negative impacts for other projects on the hardware, while offering benefits to the bitcoin community,"" he said.\n\nAlthough he reported that last week\'s sudden uptick in transactions had not affected him, others with limited hard disk space were likely to suffer.\n\nReddit user \'aaaaaaaarrrrrgh\' was one of the node operators who took to the social network to express frustration during last week\'s inflated mempool. They said:\n\n""I\'ve restarted my (XT) node and will try to add monitoring through Bitnodes, but otherwise, if it dies, it dies. I don\'t have any actual reason to be running that node, I\'m doing it out of goodwill and to support the network. If it gets too annoying, I\'ll stop.""\n\nWhile projects like Bitnodes – now rolled into 21 – are seeking to incentivise node operators with weekly payouts, it appears some operators simply won\'t return, with this the final straw.\n\nRedditor \'Introshine\' said they had spent $400 on hosting costs in the last year, adding: ""I had to take over 28 nodes offline that could no longer handle the mempool. Also, I ran out of funds the last few months. I\'m sorry to say but they\'re not coming back.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The bank has previously held two similar accelerators in London, and will be starting a fourth one in the city next January.\n\nBarclays said earlier that the goal of the programme was to collaborate with blockchain startups to help them better understand what requirements banks have.\n\nThe bank has been experimenting with bitcoin, and is working on a proof of concept with bitcoin service provider Safello, exploring how the cryptocurrency can be used to make charitable donations.', 'New academic research has found that the price of bitcoin is higher in countries with lower degrees of economic freedom.\n\nIn his paper, Robert Viglione, a PhD student at Darla Moore School of Business in South Carolina, notes that investors in repressed countries have bigger incentives to invest in the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin, he says, is a low-cost option which allows citizens of these nations to bypass their domestic financial system.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Countries with less freedom (eg capital controls and foreign exchange controls, like Argentina) have significantly higher bitcoin prices. It goes to the whole story about bitcoin having its highest values in repressive parts of the world. I think we\'re seeing a similar argument for Venezuelans\' interest in bitcoin, as well.""\n\nViglione pointed out that Argentina\'s high bitcoin price was likely due to the data picking up the differences between the official peso exchange rate – set by the government – and the effective exchange rate used by traders buying and selling the digital currency ""on the street"".\n\nA disaster asset\n\nBitcoin\'s decentralised and open-source nature, Viglione says, affords it the ability to trade and transmit funds across borders with few barriers or transaction costs, hence allowing the digital currency to behave as a disaster asset for people in politically unstable environments.\n\nCountries with capital controls, unstable prices, trade barriers or little financial freedom, he says, would be prime candidates for bitcoin as investors undergo a higher degree of asset confiscation and are less likely to move funds outside of the government controlled currency and their political jurisdiction.\n\nViglione asserts that there is also a connection between high corporate tax rates, total tax burden and the premiums that investors are willing to pay for bitcoin.\n\nAlthough he notes hat bitcoin markets are probably too small for agents to consider the digital currency a viable channel of tax avoidance, he points out that there is a negative relationship between economic freedom and tax burden.\n\n""Taken together, this could suggest that investors are using bitcoin as a mechanism of escaping broader repression, of which excessive taxation is a component,"" he concludes.\n\nBitcoin in Argentina\n\nThe findings come after the Bitcoin Potential Market Index (BMPI), an index that seeks to rank bitcoin\'s potential utility across 177 countries, asserted that bitcoin was most likely to succeed in Argentina.\n\nBitcoin\'s potential in the South American country made the headlines earlier this year, following the publication of an article which highlighted Argentina\'s volatile currency and dysfunctional banking structure and explored the digital currency\'s performance.\n\nCoinDesk\'s research has found that bitcoin\'s prominence in Argentina was comparable to that of New York or San Francisco, with one interviewee saying that Argentina has between 8,000 to 20,000 bitcoin owners, amounting to approximately $70,000-$80,000 worth of over-the-counter daily trades.\n\nResearch paper image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The E-coin debit card funded with bitcoin can be accepted where most major credit cards are accepted.\n\nThe E-Coin funding campaign on www.bnktothefuture.com has already raised 16% of an upwardly-revised goal with 21 days left as of Oct. 14, 2015, reflecting a strong response to E-Coin’s efforts to integrate bitcoin with fiat currencies.\n\nE-Coin launched in 2014 and has already shipped around 10,000 plastic and virtual cards worldwide.\n\nA Versatile, Virtual Debit Card\n\nE-coin users can perform all the normal transactions that ordinary debit card holders are able to do such as load funds, withdraw money and shop online. Its most innovative feature is merging traditional financial architecture with digital currency. E-Coin allows bitcoin users to spend bitcoin at many websites that do not yet accept it. In addition, it can also be used for third-party services such as PayPal and ApplePay. The bitcoins are secured by BitGo with multi-signature security, and they are insured by XL Group.\n\n“E-Coin has continued to grow at a rate second to none,” Dmitry Lazarichev, director, and Tim Frost, vice president of marketing and business development, told CCN. “We now have over 40,000 user signups. We have about 10,000 debit cards on the market with about $1 million in monthly volume.\n\nThe E-Coin platform allows free and immediate conversion between bitcoin and three fiat currencies, the U.S. dollar, the U.K. pound and the euro.\n\nFunding Off To A Strong Start\n\nThe funding campaign on the online investment platform bnktothefuture.com has surpassed the original goal seeking $284,171 USD (£250,000).\n\n“We are experiencing unprecedented growth in the transaction volume, and, therefore we need to increase our working capital,” Lazarichev and Frost said. Sixty percent of the funding will be allocated to working capital. “We are also finalizing our mobile app, and it requires some investments as well as adding several new interesting features, which cannot be disclosed at this stage.” The rest of the funds will be spent on marketing.\n\nE-Coin will have 24/7 customer support and is currently hiring people as the number of tickets grows.\n\nThe E-Coin card has withdrawal and spending limits, but users can increase these limits by submitting verification documents.\n\nE-Coin’s valuation is based on cash flow forecasts that take into account market realities, Lazarichev and Frost said.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin funded debit cards announced by licensed bitcoin exchange Bit-X\n\nVirtual Currency Debit Card Proved Challenging\n\nLazarichev and Frost noted that a virtual currency debit card has proven difficult to date because the bitcoin industry is still young. Virtual currency’s first step was the evolution of exchanges and merchants accepting bitcoin wallets. “The debit card is a next step of the industry organic growth and development,” they said.\n\nThe release of the E-Coin card culminated in integrating cryptocurrency architecture with fiat architecture. “Certainly there are differences, but we managed to merge them to some extent. Fiat currencies are more difficult for cross-border payments and easier for everyday spending and crypto ones have opposite characteristics. Thus, both architectures supplement each other and make the process of managing funds easier and more efficient.”\n\nBnktothefuture has funded campaigns for UnoCoin, Factom, ShapeShift, and BitPesa.\n\nFounders Bring Strong Backgrounds\n\nE-Coin’s three founders bring a wealth of financial and software experience.\n\nLazarichev brings experience in finance, company valuation and consulting. He worked with Solid, managing valuations and leading the company into consulting services.\n\nPavel Matveev brings experience in software and banking, having worked as a developer and solutions architect. He led teams for Russian and other international IT companies. He has worked for Barclays Capital, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, and Credit Suisse.\n\nGeorgy Sokolov brings sales and business development experience.

Excelsa coffee is naturally bright and fruity with little caffeine,” Pihatt Coffee explains.\n\nWhile many coffee shops including the Cafe Punta del Ciero, one of Mexico’s largest coffee shop chains have started to accept bitcoin since mid 2014, Pihatt Coffee is the first producer to accept the cryptocurrency as payment.\n\nVietnam is the second largest coffee producing nation in the world with an output of 1,650,000,000 kilograms in 2014 alone.', 'The economic secretary to the UK government\'s economic and finance ministry – HM Treasury – has spoken about the benefits of digital currencies and blockchain technology.\n\nDuring her speech in London yesterday about the government\'s technology drive, Harriet Baldwin MP said the government is working to create the right regime for digital currency businesses and to attract both overseas investors and companies to the UK.\n\nThe secretary also touched upon the government\'s pledge to inject £10m – announced in March – into research addressing the opportunities and challenges of digital currencies and their underlying technology as part of its larger pledge to innovation in FinTech.\n\nAccording to Baldwin, the potential benefits of distributed ledgers include:\n\n""The potential to facilitate the fast, efficient, and secure transfer of ownership of digital assets – including bonds, shares, and other financial instruments, over the internet; and the function of digitally \'signing\' and time-stamping digital assets – helping maintain records of digital documents securely and efficiency. In other words, it\'s all about making processes simpler and life easier.""\n\nBaldwin\'s comments come after the UK Treasury announced its plans to regulate digital currencies in a report published earlier this year. The report, although largely positive about digital currencies, also noted the technology\'s nascent state and outlined the risks associated to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe publication of the report followed the UK Treasury\'s \'Call for Information\' on digital currencies in June last year, which was an attempt to decipher the risks and benefits associated with this new payment technology.\n\nIn response to this call for information, the UK\'s Home Office urged the government to consider creating its own digital currency, which would eradicate anonymity and pave the way for traceable transactions in a bid to reduce crime.\n\nLondon image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Digital currencies offer a way out of this dilemma, and can provide both immediate and long-term relief for those most affected by the ongoing state of crisis: the people in those indebted nations.\n\nThe Eurozone – the collection of countries which use the Euro – is in crisis yet again. Many across Europe are beginning to question the wisdom behind the single currency, with some states at risk of falling out of it altogether. But the intentions which underpinned the EU’s introduction of an international currency that bound together its member states were positive. A unitary currency removes the need for conversion fees and mitigates the impact of variable exchange rates, thus making large-scale trade cheaper, and removing prohibitive costs that prevent small-scale international transactions.\n\nIt is 1958, and across Europe the dust is settling following the greatest global conflict the world has ever known. The defeat of Nazi Germany has wrought its toll on European nations, and fear of resurgent fascism and an increasingly powerful communist bloc are leading European nations towards ever closer integration. In this environment, six countries form the European Economic Community (EEC), convinced that economic co-operation and strengthened trade links are the key to preventing future conflict. Fast-forward to 1998, and a momentous decision is taken: the newly renamed European Union (EU) introduces the Euro, an international currency which ties all but two of its members (the exceptions being the UK and Denmark) in a remarkably resilient fiscal union.\n\nThe Euro is not the first international currency – the East Caribbean Dollar predates it by some 33 years – but it is the most successful, and covers the most diverse range of states, from economic giants like France and Germany to developing nations such as Slovakia and Montenegro. Despite its many problems, the Euro’s basic aim of facilitating trade and the movement of people throughout the continent is admirable. But the Euro has, in recent years, suffered from structural problems which were exposed by the 2008 financial crisis. Interest rates are amongst the most intractable of these problems. The European Central Bank controls interest rates covering 23 countries, trying to respond to 23 highly distinct economies.\n\nDifferences in economic complexion, inflation and labor costs between these 23 nations have resulted in a Eurozone which has struggled to compete – in terms of growth and productivity – with other developed economies. With each of these states unable to adjust their currencies to reflect these imbalances, these issues take a long time to correct.\n\nIf only, the leaders of many Eurozone states must sigh, there had been cryptocurrencies back in 1998. Digital money offers many of the advantages that the Euro aimed to offer, without the requirement for states to rid themselves of the fiat currencies that serve to provide sovereign governments with greater control over their national economies.\n\nWhile states still have good reasons for favoring distinct national currencies, the world is becoming increasingly economically integrated – and not just with their continental neighbors. The internet has enabled businesses to extend their reach across the globe, so that consumers in Australia can purchase maple syrup direct from its Canadian source almost as easily as Canadians themselves. But while technology facilitates such exchanges, such trade often remains prohibitively expensive. Small scale international transactions still require transaction fees, and suffer disproportionately from unfavorable exchange rates.\n\nIn this example, the appeal of an international currency is clear, eliminating the problems caused by conversion fees and unstable exchange rates. But while both Australia and Canada have the Queen’s face on their money, their economies couldn’t be more different. While Canada’s economy is heavily dominated by the service industry, and her largest trading partner is the US, Australia’s economic base is more widely mixed, with a greater reliance on mining, manufacturing and Chinese exports. Thus, the conditions which promote growth in each country are markedly different. Economic union, therefore, would likely have seen both economies come out of the 2008 financial crisis in a much worse state than they actually managed.\n\nBig Ideas and the Law of Unintended Consequences…\n\nThe historical record is littered with the remnants of big ideas that promised to change the world, only to fall prey to the law of unintended consequences. Examples range from disastrously short-sighted foreign policy decisions like the “guilt clause” in the Versailles Treaty – a treaty so harsh in its terms that it caused much of the German resentment that played such an important role in bringing the Third Reich to power – to policies such as the U.S. luxury tax on yachts in the early 1990s that ended up harming middle class yacht-builders rather than the rich yacht-buyers the tax was designed to target.\n\nThe fact is that policy makers all too often get so caught up in bringing their big ideas to life that they end up overlooking the potential unintended consequences of those decisions. As a result, those decisions ultimately plant the seeds of their own eventual destruction. In the case of the Euro, the very aspects of the united currency that seemed to offer so much promise for the member states who adopted it are some of the same characteristics that are now threatening its stability.\n\nJust look at all that has happened in the Eurozone since the financial panic and credit crunch of 2008 began this cascade of disastrous events. Since that crisis began, the zone has seen peripheral members like Greece, Spain, and Cyprus – among others – announce that they had no ability to either refinance or repay their massive debts. At the same time, they lacked the ability to even provide bailouts for their native banks without seeking the assistance of other financial organizations like the IMF (international Monetary Fund) and the ECB (European Central Bank).\n\nTo be sure, those nations’ debts were merely the straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back. There were many other factors involved, dating from the aforementioned 2008 financial crisis to the subsequent recession, global property bubble, and crisis in the real estate markets. Add to those things the rather questionable fiscal and budgetary policies of those member states, and it’s easy to see why those nations found themselves sitting on the edge of financial oblivion.\n\nForgetting What Really Matters…\n\nIt’s also easy to become overly focused on the global picture, including the indebted nations’ disastrous financial policies, and miss why all of this really matters. While it is in some ways comforting to adopt an overly objective view of this entire situation and speak about sovereign debt issues as though nations were but cogs within a larger and impersonal machine, that does a disservice to the real victims who find themselves at risk as a result of events that are often beyond their control.\n\nThe Human Toll…\n\nWhat often gets overlooked in these dry discussions of fiscal and monetary policy, Eurozone planning, and efforts to salvage the Euro is the fact that the real tragedy here is what has happened to the people of Greece - and what is likely to happen to the people of similarly situated Eurozone member states if the EU is unable to solve this problem. For half a decade now, the people of Greece have been enduring suffering on a scale that seems almost unimaginable during this time of peace. Living standards have plummeted, half of the nation’s young are unemployed, and the national unemployment rate stands at more than 25%.\n\nAnd the forecast for the future is even gloomier. As of last year, about 44% of the Greek population was estimated to be below the official poverty level. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development reported this year that almost one out of every five Greek citizens doesn’t even have enough money on hand to pay for food each day. Homelessness has been on the rise in ways that few developed countries have experienced – since in most countries, the homeless population is typically comprised of people with poor work histories, documented mental illness, or substance abuse. In Greece, the newly homeless are men and women with solid work histories whose lives have been torn asunder by this present state of crisis.\n\nJust a few short months ago, the banks closed, as there was not enough paper currency in circulation to meet demand. Even after they reopened, there were long lines of citizens waiting to withdraw the limited cash allowance permitted by newly-enacted policies. Meanwhile, formerly productive members of society have been reduced to becoming street vendors where they can, and beggars when all else fails. The people of Greece are increasingly despondent, and new austerity measures are on the way. Most expect the misery to deepen.\n\nMany Solutions Proposed…\n\nIn the midst of this human catastrophe, there have been a variety of solutions proposed for not only Greece, but for other nations facing similar situations. Some, like U.S. economist Paul Krugman, have advised that Greece could resolve the issue by simply leaving the Eurozone altogether – something that the EU’s original bailouts were designed to prevent. Still, given the failure of those bailouts – they went almost entirely toward repaying Greece’s loans and thus had no appreciable effect on repairing the Greek economy – and the harsh terms being imposed by European leaders, the desire to leave might soon reach critical mass.\n\nOther solutions range from assembling a conference on European debt to restructure the entire Eurozone’s debt situation to negotiating yet another bailout. The former option might work, but it would require shared sacrifice across the continent – something for which there seems to be little appetite at present. As for the latter possibility, previous bailout efforts have been coupled with austerity measures that many blame for the current state of Greek economic depression. It’s difficult to see how even more austerity and further destruction of Greece’s economy can do anything other than create even more hardship for the Greek people.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting of the proposed solutions involves the idea of issuing digital currency cards that would allow citizens to access their Euros in digital form. That would, in theory, overcome the paper currency shortage that is limiting withdrawals at the present time, and allow greater spending. Again, though, even that offers little more than a band aid for what is at present a critical economic wound.\n\nThe DNotes Solution…\n\nDNotes’ Alan Yong believes that there is a better way, and one that offers more than a temporary stopgap solution for the Eurozone’s present state of difficulty. That solution, Yong believes, involves the adoption of a global digital currency to supplement the Euro. In this view, a currency like DNotes or bitcoin would not replace the Euro in any way, but would instead provide a viable asset class that could help to prevent the type of total economic shut down the Greeks faced when their banks closed.\n\nAn economic system that encourages citizens to have some of their assets in a parallel digital currency like DNotes would ensure that those citizens maintained some control over their spending power, regardless of what happened with national fiscal and monetary policy. Just as asset diversification is viewed as an essential part of any sensible investment strategy, currency diversification of this kind would be a prudent practice.\n\nThe fact is that neither Greece nor the other European Union member states can afford to experience the type of “sudden stop” in economic activities that Greece experienced this last summer. Nor is it inevitable that such stoppages must occur. The key to preventing such mass economic disruption – and the social unrest and individual angst and misery that follows it – is to take affirmative action to ensure that the supply of currency cannot suddenly be cut off by something like a lack of hard currency reserves.\n\nAn honest assessment of the consequences of the last sudden stoppage of economic activity showed us exactly how devastating the cessation of economic activity can be not only on the well-being of nation-states or cities, but on the lives of people. When funds stop flowing, supply lines shut down as letters of credit are withheld. Economic activity at every level grinds to a halt, businesses shutter their doors, and families endure one hardship after another.\n\nCan a digital currency like DNotes prevent that sort of economic death spiral? Yong believes that it can certainly play a vital role in helping to prevent the type of economic shutdown the world witnessed in Greece months ago. Not only can cryptocurrency serve as an important form of asset for individual Greeks who might lose access to their Euros as the result of another bank shutdown – providing them with currency that can feed their families and maintain economic activity in their local communities – but it can also serve as a facilitator for large-scale trade when letters of credit are difficult to obtain.\n\nIn fact, a digital currency is the perfect system for international trade, and meets all of the qualities associated with the standard letter of credit. All of the conditions stipulated in a typical letter of credit including conditions for release of payment upon satisfactory inspection of finished goods and proof of shipment can all be incorporated using Blockchain smart contracts – and at a fraction of the current cost.\n\nThe Euro would remain the primary binding currency for Eurozone member states, while the chosen cryptocurrency would offer a parallel system for holding assets and retaining access to purchasing power. With a global digital currency built with trust and integrity, access to that purchasing power could be realized by all without respect to their financial or economic standing. Even those without access to banking services could enjoy the benefits of holding and using such a currency.\n\nThe fact is that the other likely scenario is that the Greeks eventually leave the Eurozone altogether. However, given the country’s economic situation, even a return to the drachma would not likely provide much solace for the people of the nation – since their national currency would likely have little value outside the country’s borders. Moreover most Greeks will understand this truth, and that increases the likelihood of further runs on the nation’s banking institutions. Many desperate citizens may simply try to withdraw Euros before those Euros are replaced with drachmas that will almost assuredly be worth much less than their current holdings.\n\nA digital currency that maintains a value set by the global community is the clear solution, as it offers the best opportunity for providing stability at the national and local level even amid political turmoil. And since this option would not serve as a replacement to the Euro but a supplement, it is not a solution to be feared by those who remain understandably committed to the single European currency they created almost two decades ago. Instead, it is perhaps the best chance for avoiding an even worse economic shutdown in any of the Eurozone’s debt-ridden member states.\n\nAuthors: Alan Yong, Chris Cooper, & Ken Chase']"
10/16/2015,"['During discussions and debates related to Bitcoin scalability, the idea of the blockchain handling Visa levels of transactions per second is often mentioned. While reaching Visa’s 150 million processed transactions per day may seem like a lofty goal right now, the reality is that Bitcoin will need to be able to handle a number of transactions many times that amount in order to reach its full potential. This is mainly due to the fact that Bitcoin has the potential to enable completely new types of transactions that have not existed in the past.\n\nOnline Micropayments\n\nThe clearest example of a new type of payment enabled by Bitcoin that could require the blockchain to handle many more transactions per day than current payment systems is online micropayments. Many Bitcoin supporters believe that Bitcoin could revolutionize the online content industry by allowing readers, viewers, and other content consumers to make small payments for articles, videos, podcasts, and other forms of content rather than viewing advertisements or purchasing a subscription.\n\nThis new content monetization model would require Internet users to make a few payments per day that they never made in the past. In the not-too-distant future, it’s possible that a billion Internet users could be making five or ten micropayments per day in exchange for content. In this scenario, online content payments alone would account for at least ten times all of the transactions currently processed by Visa on a daily basis.\n\nMachine to Machine Payments\n\nAnother new type of payment enabled by Bitcoin is the machine to machine payment. The example that is often used here is a self-driving car that pays another self-driving car for allowing it to pass it on the highway. If this use case or another, similar type of payment were to become popular, there would be millions more payments added to Bitcoin on a daily basis.\n\nAnother type of payment that could fall under this category could involve the upcoming computer resource sharing economy. This is where excess resources, such as storage or bandwidth, are sold to the highest bidder on an open, global market. For example, some people believe that Bitcoin will eventually be able to power new mesh networks around the world that incentivize new nodes through Bitcoin payments in exchange for routing traffic on the network. Users could potentially share hard drive space on their desktops that allows them to pay for a connection to a mesh network on their smartphones. All of this could happen in the background without the user’s knowledge because the laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other devices can handle the buying and selling of system resources on their own. If Bitcoin is able to popularize mesh networks — even if they’re just at a local level — we’re talking about an unfathomable number of microtransactions per day.\n\nNon-Currency Use Cases\n\nThere are also the non-currency use cases of Bitcoin that must be added to the equation. Many people wish to issue stocks and other assets as colored coins, while others want to register cars, homes, and other forms of property on the blockchain. There has even been a “blockchain wedding” where two individuals registered their marriage in a Bitcoin transaction. It’s unknown how many more transactions the non-currency use cases of Bitcoin could bring into the picture because entrepreneurs and developers are coming up with new ideas for creative uses of the blockchain on a regular basis.\n\nWill All of This Happen on the Blockchain?\n\nAlthough there is the potential for Bitcoin to be required for a ridiculous amount of transactions per second in the future, many of these transactions will likely happen off-blockchain. In fact, the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions take place on centralized, server-based exchanges right now. Most off-blockchain solutions, such as ChangeTip and Circle, are completely centralized right now, but new innovations, such as Open Transactions and the Lightning Network (technically still an on-blockchain solution), could eventually improve the situation.\n\nThe upcoming Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong should offer some good data on the various proposals for better scalability that have been made over the years, but the fact that Bitcoin is about more than just PayPal-esque transactions shows that the scalability picture may look even bleaker than originally thought.', ""The revolution will not be televised. It'll be sent to your inbox by us.\n\nMMA Welterweight Jon Fitch Fights for Bitcoin, Embraces Techno-Feudalism MMA welterweight Jon Fitch gets paid in cryptocurrency and, yes, he prefers it that way.\n\nMixed martial artist Jon Fitch, a former top welterweight contender for Ultimate Fighting Championship preparing to headline a World Series of Fighting bout this Saturday, is one of the world’s only athletes paid in cryptocurrency. He also likes eating tacos at 10 a.m. He sat down while doing the latter to chat about the former with Inverse.\n\nWhat initially appealed to you about bitcoin?\n\nAfter the 2008 financial collapse, I was left under $180,000 on my condo in San Jose. I didn’t want to keep supporting people who kind of make those things happen. So I started playing around with cryptocurrency. Now I see all the possible things it can be used for. Especially the blockchain and the technology behind that.\n\nAre you solely getting paid in cryptocurrency now?\n\nNot totally. I was sponsored through Nautiluscoin for my fight last June, when I fought Dennis Hallman. I think I was the first mixed martial arts fighter who got paid strictly in bitcoin. But I know that Dogecoin sponsored a NASCAR driver.\n\nThe appeal for me with bitcoin and MMA is it’s an international sport. A lot of guys have problems with getting paid and the payment processing that goes on. You fight in Brazil or somewhere else, and it takes a few weeks before you get your check. It’s not always easy for a lot of fighters. They’ve got people to pay, trainers, expenses, and things like that.\n\nDo you factor that in when negotiating your fee for a fight? How do you figure out if you’re going to be paid in cryptocurrency?\n\nWell I didn’t get a crypto sponsor this fight. Usually it’s still cash deals, but it’ll be paid in crypto: $1,000, $1,200, this much and then whatever the conversion is. I think it’s an exciting time and I think people need to get over worrying about how it’s going to go mainstream and just keep doing good things, making good products.\n\nBitcoin can be volatile. Is that something you consider when you get paid?\n\nI think it’s important not to put all your eggs in one basket. I like BitGold right now because you can hedge your assets a little bit. I like HYPER coin’s 5 percent interest. I can’t get that at the bank, you know? The price has been fairly consistent for a while. It’s almost a two-year-old coin and what I like about it is it’s a gaming coin. It has gaming servers. Instead of getting points, they get money back. Why play video games just for points when you could be making money? The only game I play on my phone now is Flap Pig where you get Satoshi [one hundred millionth of a bitcoin] for collecting coins. It’s not that great of a game, but I’d rather make money when I waste my time.\n\nHow do you keep an eye on what’s coming up? How’d you learn about BitGold or HYPER coin?\n\nTwitter is like my newspaper now. It’s not social media stuff for me, it’s literally a news feed. I get up in the morning, drink my coffee and read my Twitter.\n\nThere’s also a show this guy does on YouTube called Bitcoin Rush. He’s this German guy— you know that old movie Hackers from back in the day? He reminds me of something that would have spawned from that. Like, “Yes! this is what our future was supposed to look like! This is what our shows were supposed to look like!”\n\nYou’ve been in bitcoin since it was about $600. You’ve seen it fluctuate quite a bit. Did you ever get cold feet at all?\n\nLike I said, never put more into it than you can lose. But no, I never really worried too much about it because the things you read about, why they think it’s worrying or whatever… One of the reasons the price came down, I think, was the adaptation. More stores, more shops taking bitcoin directly and they’re converting it immediately. So they’re always going to take whatever price is on the exchange, so that’s going to drive the price down. But I think we’re at a comfortable spot where I think it’ll stay at the $230 to $250 place for a while.\n\nWhat would you like to see with bitcoin technology that’s not quite there yet?\n\nMore secure wallets. Maybe things that don’t download onto your computer. Anything that makes it more usable, and different apps and things that can be decentralized. Anything that’ll decentralize, I like.\n\nThere’s less chances for people to mess with it. Whatever it is. Even things like Uber are still centrally controlled. You know? Somebody else controls the price, it’s not the driver that controls the price. I think that’s the way everything is going to start going. I think we’re already seeing it. People barter more now, they trade more now. In the Bay Area and Vegas too, people have chickens so they have their own eggs. People make their own bread and they have fruit trees and if they can’t consume what they’re making, they have friends who have something else, so they’re trading. It’s kind of like we’re going back to the feudal time, which is kind of better I think. Instead of going to one central location to get all your food or all your anything.\n\nIt’s almost like techno-feudalism.\n\nYes, exactly. That’s a good way to put it.\n\nI just went back to Indiana last summer with my wife and she couldn’t get over it. Every five or six driveways—of course they’re like a mile apart—but every five or six driveways, there’s a sign for fresh, brown eggs. I was like, ‘Yeah, I bet you money if we drive up the driveway there’s nobody there. There’s just a bucket for money.’ Well with techno-feudalism you just transfer your bitcoin into the little bitcoin machine and get your eggs.\n\nThey’re probably better eggs than you can get at the supermarket.\n\nExactly. They’re not ‘certified’ organic, but they are. If you want good eggs you just ask someone in the neighborhood. ‘Oh, yeah these are good eggs. But Susie’s down the street are even better.’ But we’re kind of getting back to that. I think people kind of got excited by technology and industrialization of everything and it’s just not serving everybody right now. It’s only serving a very small percentage of people who are at the very top. I saw a graph within the last couple years that showed the wealth gap between the wealthiest people versus everybody else, and it’s larger now than ever in world history. And that’s not the way it should be. It seems like it should be getting closer together in wage pay and wealth, but it’s not. It’s worse than when they were building pyramids in Egypt or feudal England. And we look back at those people and think how foolish, how dumb were they? But we’re kind of doing the same thing now.\n\nAnd you think sort of bitcoin is almost a way of fighting back, as a response to that?\n\nA little bit. But I think if we’re too vocal about fighting against those people, they’ll fight back. I think we need to mind our own business and keep plugging away. They’re going to be the ones to miss out.\n\nAnd from your point of view it’s almost as if — because there are inherent benefits to cryptocurrency — it will organically continue and attract interest?\n\nI think so. People are just finding out there’s a better way. If a game developer can develop an Xbox or Playstation game, or their own system, where instead of points you get actual money and you can use that money to buy in-game products, that’s going to catch on pretty quickly. I don’t think you need to advertise that very much. You can buy a better gun for your character, or you can transfer the money to your wallet and go buy a pizza. Then when you’re playing a game, you pause and go down to your food menu and order a pizza while you’re playing a game. Then a drone flies it through your window!\n\nSo, you’re sort of a futurist.\n\nWell, the drone’s a little annoying, but it’s possible.\n\nI’d like to see more secure services. Encrypted secure services that you could pay for through cryptocurrency. That would be something I would like to see in the close future. Secure email, secure text messages that I can pay for through bitcoin. Because then, you know, they’re not getting my credit card number or billing address. I can pay for security through a secure system.\n\nThat makes sense. Especially when you’re traveling so much.\n\nAnd, you know, with all these government spies on us [laughs]. I want to be able to take a dick pic in peace!\n\nI was talking to somebody yesterday and they’re having issues getting paid. I was like, “Do you want me to send you a check through the mail? Or do you want to go through the whole process of a bank wire? Which one is going to go through faster?” And if you’re sending a letter to a country that’s not too secure with their mail system and a letter with a check could be taken pretty easily.\n\nAnd just getting rid of credit cards all together. I think that’s one of the things that got me to this. My mother went through the whole Target thing.\n\nSorry to hear that.\n\nI mean it wasn’t bad. Nothing was stolen, but she had to go through the process of getting news cards. It’s just a hassle! It’s hard to get people to see that the future doesn’t have to be the past."", 'Gemini, the long-awaited New York-based bitcoin exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and billed as the ""Nasdaq of bitcoin"", finally debuted on 8th October.\n\nFeatured in articles by The Financial Times, TechCrunch and Wired, and promoted via a TV appearance on Fox News, Gemini it succeeded in grabbing the attention of the mainstream media like few industry products before it.\n\nWhile a success in terms of promotion, however, Gemini is showing signs it is struggling to appeal to bitcoin\'s active trading community. Though representatives of the exchange stated they\'re seeking to attract a more institutional clientele than their competitors, avid bitcoin traders tell CoinDesk that they believe this strategy will be difficult to execute.\n\nThey argue that Gemini\'s pricing model, charging both buyers and sellers on each trade, while potentially attractive to infrequent institutional traders, could prove an issue that will drive away retail traders, a demographic they argue is essential for building liquidity.\n\nArthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin derivatives platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk:\n\n""Gemini\'s ability to convert retail traders to their platform will determine their short-term success. Gemini definitely has the star power of the Winklevoss twins, but I don\'t know how far that will take them in the grudge match that is to come.""\n\nThe top bitcoin exchanges around the globe currently post more liquidity than Gemini, effectively meaning traders on those exchanges are able to cash in and out of the market more quickly, a must, more active market participants argue, for profit-making.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Bitstamp\'s 24-hour volume is 20,209 BTC ($5.3m), 50 times that of Gemini\'s daily total, while competitors Bitfinex and BTC-e saw 12,742 BTC ($3.3m) and 8,340 BTC ($2.1m) in trading volume over the last 24 hours.\n\nGemini is currently struggling to attract volume, though at press time it had traded 384 BTC (roughly $100,000) on 14th October, a figure that was nearly double total daily trade volumes throughout its first week.\n\nOverall, representatives from institutional trading firms such as Crypto Currency Fund and Binary Financial said they were reviewing the exchange\'s performance to determine if and when they would enter the market, while others stated they were waiting for its liquidity to increase.\n\nOf note is that some members of the bitcoin exchange ecosystem expressed overall disappointment in the strength of the Gemini offering, but were unwilling to speak publicly due to perceptions it could be viewed as negative or detrimental to the ecosystem.\n\nCharging the makers\n\nOne of the more frequent subjects of criticism was the exchange\'s plan to charge 25 basis points to the buyer and seller on each side of trades.\n\nThe founder of one major cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform, wishing to remain unnamed, called the decision ""strange"" due to the fact that bitcoin exchanges have been striving to make their pricing more appealing to liquidity providers in an effort to gain greater market share.\n\nThis maker-taker model, in which those who ""take"" liquidity are charged more, is employed by exchange such Coinbase, Coinfloor, Kraken and itBit. Business-to-business exchange Coinsetter even offers a 0.1% trading rebate, meaning liquidity providers are paid part of the exchange\'s earnings for their support.\n\nTim Enneking, manager of bitcoin hedge fund Crypto Currency Fund, agreed that the pricing went against the trend of fees declining across the industry. Active traders, he argued, ""couldn\'t survive"" on Gemini\'s current pricing model, noting that these individuals, while adding valuable liquidity to exchanges, rely on small price swings for profit.\n\nEnneking said:\n\n""They\'re going to have to make their offering attractive to smaller players, and I\'m not sure that they\'ve succeeded in doing that yet.""\n\nFeatures such as enhanced security, he said, were unlikely to appeal to these traders, who are already used to trading with a certain amount of risk, though he said he believes this is a ""great argument"" for institutions.\n\nRob Borden, CEO of bitcoin trading tool platform Coinigy, echoed the sentiment that the fees were comparable to those on other exchanges, with the exception of fees for market makers.\n\n""Coinbase, for example, offers solely a taker fee, and yet other exchanges offer free trading, with a fee for withdrawals only,"" Borden explained. ""So far, the reception has been fairly positive from what I\'ve seen, but concerns over early liquidity and the verification process linger.""\n\nBoosting liquidity\n\nElsewhere, other market observers sided with Borden in questioning the low levels of liquidity on the exchange, a factor they conceded was partly due to expectations created by the marketing effort around the launch.\n\nGeorge Samman, co-founder of bitcoin derivatives marketplace BTC.sx (now Magnr) and head of marketing at Fuzo, called Gemini\'s volume ""anemic"", a description he attributed to its ""late"" arrival in the US market when compared to regulated competitors Coinbase and itBit, which have been active in the US since January and May, respectively.\n\nCoinbase has averaged 9,800 BTC (roughly $2.5m) in trades on its platform over the last five days, according to Cryptowatch, while itBit\'s 24-hour volume at press time was 7,924 BTC (roughly $2m).\n\nIn contrast, Gemini has seen an increase in volume since its launch last week, reaching a high of 240 BTC on 15th October, according to data from Cryptowatch. The exchange traded at a low of 14.48 BTC on 10th October, a figure that then steadily increased to 62.78 BTC, 115.4 BTC and 211.5 BTC over the next three days.\n\nStill, Samman acknowledged Gemini\'s liquidity problem is one that faces the entire industry, due to weakening demand for bitcoin as an asset and what he called a ""distrust"" in existing exchange options. Further, he suggested that Gemini\'s by-the-book approach to launching in New York may have turned off avid traders, including those with libertarian or anti-government leanings.\n\n""Regulation is having a big effect on volume as services have been stopped in certain areas and traders are leaving sites they deem to be overly regulated,"" he said, echoing Borden.\n\nA less common criticism from the community was the perceived gap between bids and ask prices on the exchange, or the gap in prices at which traders were setting buy and sell prices.\n\nSources said this is likely to be the result of smaller traders needing to cover costs as a result of the pricing model on Gemini. For example, the derivative exchange founder, indicated charging liquidity providers less and buyers more would have ""looked better"" as they would offer tighter spreads.\n\n""You could say people might prefer to trade on Coinbase because the spread is going to be tight,"" he said. ""Gemini is never going to be tight.""\n\nBuilding influence\n\nStill, there was broad enthusiasm for the offering, with most respondents praising the exchange\'s launch as a positive for the ecosystem and noting that building the trust and patronage of the bitcoin trading community is simply something that takes time.\n\nMost comparisons were drawn to itBit, which launched in the US in May. Since then, the exchange has been slowly building volume on the back of an effective market strategy that saw it gain an early advantage as the first bitcoin exchange to receive a banking charter.\n\nAs a result, the future of Gemini was framed in terms of regulated US exchanges like itBit, which serves all 50 states, as well as rival Coinbase, open in 36 states at press time.\n\n""What it boils down to is how they will differentiate themselves from Coinbase and itBit,"" Hayes said.\n\n""All three of these US based exchanges\' value proposition is a regulated exchange for Americans. Apart from that, they all offer the same features.""\n\nSome respondents said the lackluster volume on Gemini has been, in part, a perception problem caused by the strong marketing effort around the exchange launch. Following the news of the launch, the price of bitcoin hit its highest levels since August, spurred in part by perception Gemini could bring new liquidity to the ecosystem.\n\n""A lot of people were looking for Gemini to deliver something fantastic and new, what they were expecting were for people to go buy bitcoins because they watch Fox News,"" one source said.\n\nEnneking went on to agree that Gemini would likely need to pivot its strategy to win the already active bitcoin trading community should it want to hold its own in a competitive field, and thus appeal to institutions, concluding:\n\n""The differences in functionality, for very specific purposes may be beneficial, but for the general community, unless someone offers something revolutionary and new, that\'s not going to be the factor that drives real legitimate volume.""\n\nBusinessman on tightrope image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In July, we reported that Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne is interested in “cleaning up” Wall Street.\n\n“We have started building things that replace what Wall Street does,” said Byrne. “It does them far cheaper, and with far more transparency, and without any of the opportunity for rigging.” Overstock’s platform, known as t0.com, applies the security and efficiency of cryptographically-protected, distributed ledgers to the world of finance. “T0\'s radical transparency and true settlement combine to grant real, unambiguous ownership – nearly instantly,” states the t0 website. “If you buy it, you own it. It\'s that simple.”\n\nt0.com is an assumed name for Medici, Inc., which is a majority-owned financial technology subsidiary of Overstock. The Medici project was first announced by Byrne in 2014 at Inside Bitcoins Las Vegas. Overstock is a large online retailer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. The company, which went public in 2002 at an IPO price of $13 and now trades at $17, is likely to enjoy first mover advantages in the novel and very promising sector of crypto-securities. In fact, the crypto-stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet. T0 partnered with a number of banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which Relbanks ranked as the largest bank in the world, to test its technology.\n\nIn July, Byrne said to expect further announcements about the t0 platform, and that it presents an “extraordinary opportunity” for Overstock because it has the potential to be disruptive.\n\nNow, Overstock announced that it successfully completed another production beta test of its t0 software, by successfully using the bitcoin blockchain to record evidence of compliance with SEC Regulation SHO before a trader can engage in a short sale. Mandatory compliance with Regulation SHO, which was adopted to update short sale regulations, began in 2005.\n\nEarlier this week, hedge fund Clique Fund, LP, participated in the t0 testing to purchase locates for all 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks.\n\n""The blockchain is the most important financial development of our lifetimes,"" said Byrne. ""While others theorize about the innovations this new technology can usher in, t0 is taking action and proving the concept daily, including using it to crack open the notoriously inaccessible black box of securities lending. This is further evidence of the world-historical potential of distributed, cryptographically secured ledgers.”\n\nByrne added that, once up and running, each Pre-borrow Assured Token will provide the purchaser a valid locate satisfying the SEC\'s Regulation SHO requirements.\n\nPre-borrowed Assured Tokens (PATs) convert the rights to lend a third-party’s money into cryptographic tokens that are auctioned off at the end of the day, and reverse auctioned at the beginning of the day. PATs will be auctioned nightly in a Dutch auction using t0 software and the transaction will be recorded on the blockchain. Access to t0.com\'s PATs, when available, will be limited to qualified institutional buyers that are also qualified purchasers.\n\n""As I have said publicly ad nauseam, I have no objection in principle with short selling when done legally,"" said Byrne. ""Our introduction of the Pre-borrow Assured Token will solve a problem for the beneficial owners, by bringing their inventory into a transparent market; it will solve a problem for the short seller, who will be able to borrow in a transparent market; and it will solve a problem for regulators, who for several years have taken a more aggressive stance regarding this mischief than they did a decade ago, I feel obliged to acknowledge. Unfortunately, a few bad apples spoil the barrel. That barrel needs a good scrubbing, and that\'s what our Pre-borrow Assured Token will do.""\n\nIt appears that Overstock’s t0 platform is advancing steadily toward fully operational status, and could have a big and disruptive impact on securities trading.', 'At this year\'s Buy-Side Technology North American Summit, panelists discussed the potential of blockchain technology. Anthony says that first, we need to make clear that bitcoin and blockchain are being used interchangeably.\n\n""Bitcoin is the currency of DDoS attackers and other miscreants; blockchain has some capability."" This was the sentiment of Mike McGovern, CIO at Brown Brothers Harriman, who was speaking on a panel at this year\'s Buy-Side Technology North American Summit.\n\nWhile McGovern was making a joke to punctuate a point, there\'s also an underlying truth there: Bitcoin, as a currency, is useful as an exchange-traded product and store of value, but the blockchain ledger is what has the most potential to revolutionize how financial-services firms transact. It\'s important to remember that they\'re two separate things, because right now these two things are at times incorrectly used interchangeably.\n\n""Everyone is looking at blockchain,"" McGovern said. ""We\'re looking at it. We\'ve set aside some funds in our 2016 innovation budget around R&D and working with colleagues on the buy side to think about how it can be applied.""\n\nJohn Shea, CIO at Eaton Vance, echoed McGovern\'s sentiments, and compared the evolution of the blockchain to that of the cloud.\n\n""What\'s funny about the blockchain is that it\'s like what the cloud was years ago: everyone is talking about the cloud and no one really knew what the cloud was, but they\'re talking about it,"" he said. ""You have to disconnect bitcoin from blockchain ? blockchain\'s the ledger; bitcoin\'s the money.""\n\nAt its core, blockchain is an append-only database where you write once, erase never, Shea said. It\'s a distributed, encrypted database with the foundation being transactions or virtual currency.\n\nEven still, right now firms are playing a game of wait-and-see.\n\n""There\'s a ton of possibilities here, but it\'s not at the ‘hey, we want to use this thing right now\' stage,"" he said, with settlement being the most logical place for blockchain adoption.\n\nTrust Still at Issue?\n\nThe other area that Shea saw the most potential was for cybersecurity.\n\n""I think that there\'s going to be a big drive towards blockchain just from a cybersecurity perspective. You can\'t trust an email; wire fraud continues to increase. Blockchain is one possible technology that can help combat some of our challenges with wire fraud and cybersecurity. But it\'s something that the industry has to adopt,"" before his firm would jump fully onboard with blockchain solutions, he said.\n\nMcGovern noted that blockchain\'s anonymity, at this point, will also give firms pause when it comes to adoption.\n\n""I do think it will have an impact longer term, but at its heart, what I see is essentially replacing the centralized ledger provided by a trusted party with another type of ledger, and the anonymity that\'s built into the technology is unattractive for institutional organizations,"" the CIO said. ""The most viable models I\'ve seen are where organizations are embracing the technology but incorporating around it traditional trust banking, regulated entity kind of business model,"" where the same legal and regulatory framework that operate today are still in place.\n\nI\'ve written this before, but exact definitions and terms matter especially when discussing a subject that is opaque.\n\nWhen talking about the potential of something, clarity matters. So to start, let\'s make sure that we\'re using the terms bitcoin and blockchain correctly.', ""Bitcoin startup Bitreserve is becoming a full-fledged financial services company and rebranding as Uphold. CEO Anthony Watson announced the move with a post titled “ Welcome to Uphold. The Internet of Money.”\n\nA press release notes that Uphold wants to be the world's leading cloud-based money platform, connecting the legacy and fragmented financial ecosystem with the future of money and finance. Uphold will be a members-only, member-to-member financial service for individuals, businesses, charities (including nonprofits and nongovernment organizations) and developers.\n\nWatson, former Nike CIO and member of the exclusive Fortune 40 Under 40 list, joined Bitreserve as president and chief operating officer earlier in 2015.\n\n“I am thrilled to join Bitreserve at such a pivotal moment in the evolution of cloud money and financial technology,” he said.\n\nFounded by CNET founder Halsey Minor in 2013, Bitreserve launched innovative features to shield its customers from the volatility of bitcoin by instantly locking deposits to a fiat currency selected by the customer, such as the U.S. dollar.\n\n“Bitreserve is on a mission to democratize the use of digital currency by protecting businesses and consumers from the risks inherent in the bitcoin model,” noted a Forbes review quoted on the Bitreserve website.\n\nIn March, Bitreserve launched two new “bitcurrencies”: the bitrupee (BitINR) and bitpeso (BitMXN), pegged to two key developing world currencies – the Indian rupee and the Mexican peso – that allow Indian and Mexican customers to hold their local currencies on Bitreserve.\n\n“Today, Bitreserve takes its next great step forward on the journey to transform global financial services for the benefit of everyone, everywhere,” says Watson. “Together with the entire company, I’m proud and excited to announce that Bitreserve has become Uphold. But that’s just the beginning. We have additional exciting updates and announcements to share, from new market entries to new products and services and broader changes at our company.”\n\nNow, customers in 30 European Union countries, as well as Switzerland, can deposit money into Uphold via bank transfer or from credit and debit cards. In November, Uphold will begin to roll out its services to customers in the United States and China (limited beta), followed by India in January 2016 (limited beta).\n\nMembers can fund their Uphold accounts by linking any bank account, debit and/or credit card (Visa and MasterCard initially), in addition to bitcoin and ‘the Voxel’ or ‘Voxels,’ a new form of virtual currency that the company and a partner will announce in the next few days.\n\nIn December, Uphold plans to roll out multiple card and payment products, both physical and virtual (limited beta release). Members, based on their location and jurisdiction, will be able to choose among Visa, MasterCard or Discover to pay for goods and services, online or in person, using cards directly linked to their Uphold accounts.\n\nWatson’s post emphasizes that Uphold is not a bank and doesn’t lend or leverage members’ funds.\n\n“Our members can rest assured that value held in Uphold is 100 percent safe and secure and can be withdrawn, at any time, regardless of what is happening in the global economy,” says Watson. He adds that Uphold services will be mostly free, with some fees that will apply in special cases. For example, a fee of 2.75 percent will apply to members who choose to fund their Uphold account with a debit and/or credit card.\n\nFortune notes that Bitreserve, now Uphold, is de-emphasizing the role of bitcoin in its business model and operations. That is shown by the new name without “bit” – “that oh-so-common prefix amongst digital currency startups” – and the new emphasis on financial services linked to traditional credit cards and bank accounts.\n\n“I’ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years,” Watson told Fortune . “The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology. I think once the world becomes more accustomed and attuned to the platform of bitcoin, the noise will go away, and the currency will go away, too.”\n\nThe company’s founder Halsey Minor, too, predicts that bitcoin as a currency “will get destroyed.”\n\nMinor and Watson’s remarks are certainly attuned to the prevailing mood in the financial services industry, which focuses on the advantages of using the blockchain technology for faster, cheaper and traceable transactions while considering the bitcoin currency as a temporary inconvenience. At the same time, it is worth bearing in mind that the current system – blockchain technology plus bitcoin currency – is proven to work."", 'October 19th is the day on which the Bitcoin community is hoping to get justice.\n\nOn this day, the court is expected to announce the quantum of punishment for former US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officer Carl Mark Force for his crimes.\n\nIn July, Carl had pleaded guilty to the charges of extorting a huge number of Bitcoins from the Silk Road‘s founder Ross Ulbricht (who is currently serving a life imprisonment sentence.)\n\nThe disgraced Silk Road was actually an unregulated online marketplace from where the buyers could procure drugs by paying with Bitcoin.\n\nIn the 16-page plea agreement, Carl had also pleaded guilty to the charges of money laundering and obstruction of justice.\n\nHis sentencing, as per news website Coindesk.com, is set for 2 PM PST on 19th October at the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The hearing will be presided over by Judge Richard Seeborg.\n\nThe Coindesk.com also reported that the government has requested the court to impose a prison sentence of 87 months (7 years+3 months) plus three years of supervised release.\n\nDuring the course of his hearing, the Assistant Attorney General Caldwell had described his crime in the following words: “While investigating the Silk Road, former DEA Agent Carl Force crossed the line from enforcing the law to breaking it.”\n\nWhen the Assistant Attorney said these words he actually gave voice to what thousands of users of Bitcoin felt.\n\nThe Assistant Attorney General had also noted that Carl was seduced by the anonymity that the virtual currency offered. And to abuse it to procure Bitcoin he invented several online personas and encrypted messaging.\n\nAs a result he was soon able to obtain Bitcoin worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from the government and even from the investigative targets.\n\nCarl was part of the federal task force which was at that time investigating the Silk Road.\n\nDuring this time, the agent went rogue and his case is one of the most talked about cases in the recent times.', 'Voxelus, a virtual reality (VR) content creation platform, will launch a cryptocurrency called voxels along with a VR marketplace it will be introducing next year, reported siliconangle.com. Voxels will be based on a Litecoin fork. To secure funding, Argentina-based Voxelus will sell voxels in a public crowdsale beginning Nov 2.\n\nVoxelus is a three-dimensional app that allows users to create VR games, experience and spaces without needing to write code. It features a VR player app that plays content using the desktop content tool on Oculus Rift or Samsung VR.\n\nThere have already been more than 20,000 downloads of Voxelus’ Creator software since its debut as Oculus Connect, according to Siliconangle.com.\n\nVR Market Expected To Expand\n\nThe launch of three VR headsets in the first quarter of 2016 – Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR and HTC Vive – is expected to bring a big expansion in VR entertainment, games and assets.\n\nVoxelus needed its own cryptographically-secure, in-game currency to bring VR assets and games to market, according to Uphold, a bitcoin exchange that will support voxels. Uphold, previously known as Bitreserve, helped to create, distribute and support the proprietary voxel currency, which will be the only form of value that the Voxelus platform will accept.\n\nJ.P. Theirot, Upold vice chairman and head of the reserve and investor relations, noted in a recent blog that the Voxelus platform is highly addictive and impressive.\n\nUphold will release an Uphold VOX Card, giving Uphold members the ability to buy voxel with bitcoin via bank transfer or debit or credit card. Theirot noted that voxel will be fungible, transferable and spendable.\n\nVoxels will be based on a Litecoin fork with 210 million coins and 2-minute confirmations. The voxels are open-source and pre-mined.\n\nPublic Crowdsale on Nov. 2\n\nThe public crowdsale for voxel begins Monday, Nov. 2 at sale.voxelus.com. There will be a 100 voxel minimum ($25 to $30 depending on purchase date.) The public presale will begin with a 24-hour sale of 1,000 voxels per bitcoin. Three periodic price changes of 900, 800 and 750 voxels per bitcoin will follow until 30 days or the selling of 31.5 million voxels. A private presale of 100,000 voxels per bitcoin was scheduled for Oct. 15. for cryptocurrency investors and partners.\n\nThe company will offer 15 percent of the tokens through the crowdsale and will distribute the rest over two years.\n\nHalsey Minor, Voxelus co-founder and chairman and also the founder of the Uphold, said he was influenced early in his career by writers like Neal Stephenson in books like “Snow Crash” which envisioned worlds having both virtual money and VR. He sees turning science fiction into reality an entrepreneur’s dream. Giving voxel functionality that is equal to bitcoin and at the same time serves the ecosystem of a VR gaming platform marks a remarkable technical accomplishment, he noted.\n\nAlso read: Samsung Ventures backs Fove virtual reality headset\n\nBitcoin Exchanges To Support Voxels\n\nAfter the sale, voxels will be available on Uphold and on ShapeShift.io, Erick Voorhees’ registration-less cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nVoxelus noted Voorhees is a team member and ShapeShift is an investor providing the back-end for the presale and public sale.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Voxelus.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Clara Guibourg\n\nThe world’s first bitcoin mining IPO is drawing near, as Australia’s Bitcoin Group Limited launches a “pre-IPO”.\n\nAfter two failed attempts to list, could it be third time lucky for the company?

10/17/2015,"['Nozomi Hayase PhD, is a writer covering issues of freedom of speech, transparency and decentralized movements. In this article, she looks at the continuing block size debate, bitcoin governance and why they are both so important.\n\nBitcoin has exploded into prominence as technology capable of disrupting global finance. Massive investment money has been poured into its infrastructure and major banking industries are now joining forces to incorporate aspects of this technology.\n\nFigures like Blythe Masters, a former JP Morgan executive known for inventing the credit-default swap, have begun working on the blockchain\'s potential to upend finance in favor of banks.\n\nYet, efforts to control this breakthrough in computer science are not limited to incumbent industries. One of the biggest challenges that the bitcoin community has ever faced emerged with the implementation of BIP 101 in Bitcoin XT.\n\nThis hard fork, launched by chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, a former Google engineer, triggered intense reactions. Some called it a takeover of the bitcoin protocol by the few at the engineering level.\n\nThis move toward increasing block size from the current 1MB to 8MB was criticized by some core developers as bypassing the consensus of the technical majority. Legal scholar and respected cryptographer, Nick Szabo even depicted the XT hard fork as a civil war, technologically equivalent to a 51% attack.\n\nOn the surface, this push for much bigger blocks appears to be purely technical. In fact, Andresen has claimed technical neutrality, free of political agendas. Yet, a closer look at XT reveals how commercial interests are increasingly pulling bitcoin’s development into a particular vision. Peter Todd, who contributed to bitcoin’s core software and is a strong critic of BIP 101, pointed out how many of the big-block supporters are large payment and wallet providers that are themselves highly centralized and regulated.\n\nThis brings a question about the promise of incorruptible mathematics. Can bitcoin maintain its ethos of decentralization with all this external and internal pressure, or will it be co-opted?\n\nTug of war over the Internet\n\nPressure toward commercialization of technology is nothing new. The Internet has gone through its own versions of centralization. In his 2012 book Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange depicts the militarization of cyberspace through NSA surveillance and censorship, remarking:\n\n""The Internet, our greatest tool for emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen.""\n\nAssange warns how tech companies like Google are now leading this trend, pointing to deep ties with the US State Department and the firm\'s active role in the NSA surveillance, which came to light after the Snowden revelations.\n\nAssange\'s book, When Google Met WikiLeaks, unveiled radically opposing visions of the Internet\'s future. For Assange, the power of the Internet lies in its statelessness and freedom. For Google chair Eric Schmidt, it is a governance model aligned with US foreign policy and ""the civilizing power of enlightened transnational corporations"" to shape the world according to the better judgment of the ""benevolent superpower"".\n\nAs a further evolution of the Cypherpunks, bitcoin carries on this battle for the Internet. The challenge to achieve consensus over block-size limits appears to be a natural progression of this clash of visions.\n\nIn the article, The Decentralist Perspective, or Why Bitcoin Might Need Small Blocks, it was noted how developers who are true to Satoshi’s vision of creating purely peer-to-peer electronic cash based on cryptographic proof see XT implementation as a trade-off of bitcoin’s core features.\n\nWhile XT developers focus on optimization of transactions per second and view bitcoin\'s success as dependant on accessibility and low cost, many prominent decentralists see the value in censorship resistance and don’t want it to end up becoming a PayPal 2.0.\n\nSecurity vs performance\n\nThis divergent vision of what bitcoin should be is the real issue behind the block-size debate. Security is the way to ensure the integrity of the coders’ vision. Depending on priorities, the approach to security can be different. Decentralists are not against the idea of a block-size increase. The primary questions are \'How big is too big?\' and \'What are the security ramifications of moving too fast?\'.\n\nAchieving monetary sovereignty requires removing single points of failure in the system that can be easily commandeered by state and other regulatory forces. For this, maintaining decentralization is necessary.\n\nSeen this way, large blocks favoring bigger miners bring further centralization of mining and of full nodes, (more analysis here). This brings a huge security risk and so more balanced, incremental approaches have been suggested, such as 2MB now, 4MB in two years and 8MB in four years, combined with the use of technical innovations such as the Lightning Network and pegged sidechains.\n\nThese security concerns are not shared by those who represent XT. Andresen said he thought the best way to get technical consensus was to just release the code and encourage people to vote with their feet. In short, \'let’s make the economic majority decide\'.\n\nMiners are inclined to choose versions that their economic incentives are aligned with. Any changes that could alter the incentive structure, if not done in consideration of the greater security, will degrade the very foundation of bitcoin. As the controversy was heating up, Szabo remarked:\n\n""If bitcoin\'s security comes to be based on bureaucrats rather than protocol, it will no longer be a seamless global system.""\n\nJust as Google\'s ambition of a global reach with their central servers blinds them to their role in enabling strategic interception, economic incentives for the sake of profit at any cost can easily blind one to control points quietly being injected.\n\nQuickly going for a maximum volume of transactions at the potential cost of centralization inadvertently jeopardizes security. Any such trend can recapitulate the Goldman Sachs-style takeover of the current system, opening doors to policy risks such as QE hyperinflation, Cyprus-like bail-ins and financial blockades.\n\nBitcoin matters\n\nA few months since the introduction of XT, developers gathered in Montreal for a Scaling Bitcoin Workshop. People are moving toward finding a solution together. So what is the lesson in all of this? The contentious hard fork provided an opportunity for the larger community to learn how the development process works and most importantly, why we should all care about where bitcoin is going.\n\n“Empowered by mathematics, we now have an opportunity to create a network that no amount of coercion or violence can break.”\n\nAt a recent panel on bitcoin governance, Andresen shared his view on the role of developers. By stressing the importance of distinguishing governance of the protocol and of open source software projects, he noted that he supports a ""benevolent dictator"" model, saying he believes there needs to be a leader who can make final decisions.\n\nPeter Todd, who also participated in this panel, countered this model, saying how “bitcoin is not under the control of any one group of people” and bitcoin core developers have been very careful not to make changes that do not have a consensus of the wider community. After all, if miners go against this consensus, they will be left mining empty blocks. Thus, in bitcoin governance, power ultimately lies in the hands of the users.\n\nBitcoin as the Internet of money joins the struggle for Internet freedom. Its development could play a decisive role in determining not only the future of the Internet, but of civilization itself. The question now is which Internet will bitcoin belong to and which future will we choose? Do we want the world free from censorship and surveillance or a Prism-style prison of totalitarian control?\n\nPeer-to-peer networks cannot be delivered from top down by selected officials or, in this case, developers and big players like investors and exchanges. Distributed systems demand informed participants who understand their value and uphold the ideals enshrined in the code.\n\nEmpowered by mathematics, we now have an opportunity to create a network that no amount of coercion or violence can break. Whether the outcome of this battle will be decided by a few or by the collective will of the people depends on all of us.\n\nGovernance image via Shutterstock.

The country’s Foreign Exchange Commission has ordered financial institutions to increase its checks and balance controls for capital outflow. Currency wars in the region have led to a massive monetary dump as China’s Black Monday looms and looks to a very rough financial week. This has sparked an interest in alternative currency vehicles and China’s buying volume in Bitcoin has increased. Chinese exchanges are also reporting significant a price spread between them and U.S. exchanges.\n\nAlso read: How Bitcoin will Make GoPro Awards Even Better\n\nAs well as Bitcoin purchasing, gold, and precious metals(PM) in China is not a new fad happening in the area, in fact, the country has confirmed that its bullion reserve interests have jumped 60% since 2009. Despite this emergency PM buying throughout the land, banks are regulating the gold markets and other safe havens heavily. Tommy Ong of DBS Bank Hong Kong told Bloomberg News that Banks are regulating the outflow realm to help stop more damage to the yuan. Ong explains: “The main objective is to reduce volatility, curb capital outflows and limit depreciation pressure on the yuan.”\n\nThe Bitcoin price is rising high as Chinese CNY/BTC volume is increasing exponentially this week and over the course of the past month trading nearly 1 million BTC daily. Volume and price on the largest Chinese Bitcoin exchange, Huobi, is higher than most of the smaller US and UK crypto-exchanges combined. The trade of Bitcoin/Yuan captures a very large portion of the market currently. Most likely due to cheaper electricity costs, zero trading fees and the serious devaluation of the sovereign currency over the past few years. Goldman Sachs analysts led by Peter Oppenheimer say that a third wave of economic crisis is happening globally. The analyst believes that this economic shift is characterised by Chinas stagnate growth and worldwide commodity lows. Goldman Sachs says that because of Chinas rise in investments after the 2008 crisis and then trying to transform its economy at the same time has helped stall its growth with poor and inefficient investments.\n\nDuring the first week of July, the Chinese stock market has plunged over the course of a three-week drop losing 2.36 trillion in market value. The Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Composite both plunged roughly 30% that month and caused a stir of fear in the global economy. With the looming fear of inflation from devalued currency many markets have felt the economic shift pushing alternative international venues. However, the People’s Bank of China is requiring all banks to pay a deposit before forwarding sales to markets overseas. With these financial edicts, citizens are finding it harder to reallocate wealth within the traditional stock, bonds, and even PM markets. This is possibly why the Bitcoin volume in China is surging as U.S. dollars, and alternative currency options are seemingly viable throughout economic shakes and currency devaluation.\n\nThe three largest Bitcoin exchanges trading in CNY are currently swapping close to a million BTC per day according to Bitcoinity. Bitcoin’s price at press time is up 5% overall within the top Chinese exchanges. With volume and price, there is much debate on whether the numbers in China are what they say they are. Contention on this issue has been debated since Goldman Sachs reported 80% of Bitcoin transactions were traded in Yuan.\n\nOverall the volumes on Chinese exchanges are showing growth in the digital currency realm. Numbers according to pages such as Coin Market Cap, and Bitcoinity are slightly different on each website but all show increases. The devaluation of Chinese sovereign currency is very real, and the region’s stock market is regularly fumbling. Movement into alternative markets with less capital control is not a far off theory as its been proven in countries like Greece. Bitcoin has become a financial haven with gold and silver, and Chinese buyers are eating these assets up. The continued devaluation of the yuan will enable trading solutions like Bitcoin to be a superior trading choice for investors.\n\nWhat do you think about the volume increase in China? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nImages courtesy of Redmemes, Localbitcoins, Bloomberg/Washington Post, and Pixbay\n\nOriginally posted on: Is China Turning To Bitcoin As Yuan Devalues?', 'Which country has fewer poor than America and 80% of the Bitcoin transactions? Although it might come as a surprise, the answer is China. Despite a stock market and currency crisis, China has fewer poor than America, according to a Credit Suisse report. Yet, there is one thing of which this report falls a bit short: good data. Much of the data in the report is from government bodies and international bodies. People with firsthand knowledge of each country might take contention therewith. Nonetheless, CCN wondered if Credit Suisse’s numbers could explain China’s large Bitcoin volume.\n\nAccording to the Credit Suisse Wealth Report, there are more poor people in the United States than in China. For instance, nobody in China is in the bottom 10% of the world’s population by wealth, while North America is home to 10% of such people. Here is a chart for perspective.\n\nNorth America is home to some of the 10% poorest in the world and 30% of the richest. As Tim Worstall writes for Forbes, “…China has pretty much none of the world’s poorest people and say 7 or 8% of the world’s richest.” The Credit Suisse report states:\n\nTo determine how global wealth is distributed across households and individuals – rather than regions or countries – we combine our data on the level of household wealth across countries with information on the pattern of wealth distribution within countries. Once debts have been subtracted, a person needs only USD $3,210 to be among the wealthiest half of world citizens in mid-2015. However, USD 68,800 is required to be a member of the top 10% of global wealth holders, and USD 759,900 to belong to the top 1%. While the bottom half of adults collectively own less than 1% of total wealth, the richest decile holds 87.7% of assets, and the top percentile alone accounts for half of total household wealth.\n\nAlthough North America contains the highest percentage of middle-class inhabitants (31%), the region holds just 105 million middle-class adults (16% of the global total), far less than 303 million\n\nmembers (46%) in the Asia Pacific Region and fewer than the 109 million in China and the 194 million middle class residents in Europe. The middle class is associated with the United States in the collective conscious. That’s why the following graph might come as such a surprise:\n\nFurther, the predicted 32% increase in the number of millionaires in the US by 2020 is among the slowest increases in the world:\n\n80% Of The Bitcoin Transactions\n\nA Goldman Sachs report found that 80% of bitcoins are now exchanged via Chinese yuan. That means the US Dollar, counterintuitively, is the second highest traded currency, not the first.\n\nThis despite a contentious history between the Chinese government and Bitcoin technology. China banned bitcoin transactions in December 2013, yet still grew into a major mining hub thus leading to the high Bitcoin transaction volume, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\nInterest in China could also be on the rise due to a crisis in the Chinese yuan which in part led to a collapse in China’s stock this past summer. The Chinese people’s confidence in the yuan seems to be waning. Although it is unlikely that these greater circumstances are contributing to as much interest in Bitcoin yuan as the huge mining complexes that have developed there, some in the Bitcoin community see it differently. Bitcoin is simply popular in China amongst the population, this group contends. As SecondMarket CEO Barry Silbert wrote, “Huge bitcoin volume in China over past 24 hours (1 million bitcoin traded).”\n\nHuge bitcoin volume in China over past 24 hours (1 million bitcoin traded)https://t.co/RkOdQnoADl — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) October 14, 2015\n\nSo what do you think?

World Patent Marketing, which is famous for its innovative business model which they describe as idea to retail, is the most recent cutting edge company to cast their lot with Bitcoin and accept the digital currency as payment.\n\nBitcoin is a privately held digital currency that relies upon a digital clearinghouse known as blockchain. This replaces the banks and escrow agents which are the backbone of Wall Street, stock markets and bond markets around the world. The Bitcoin trading platform, known as T0, automatically encrypts and matches the transaction for 100% privacy and security between the parties. Because of the secure encryption, Bitcoin money can be hidden and secure. The matching system, or ledger as it is known, guaranteed compliance (payment and acceptance) on the part of both parties in any transaction.\n\nWorld governments and reserve banks are deeply concerned about the rise of Bitcoin. If transactions can be conducted with zero transparency, it destroys their ability to track and tax funds.\n\nOf course, government concerns are hardly going to hold enthusiasts for the private digital currency back. In fact, privacy and security are what Bitcoin fans love.\n\n""The U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve are terrified of Bitcoin,"" said Scott J. Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing, ""It\'s classic disruptive technology, just like our business model. Disruptive business models, new and better ways of doing things, always scare the daylights out of the old guard. Bitcoin, it\'s new. It is a huge game changer.

According to KPMG, the financial services provider that carried out the research, the imposition of stricter capital requirements could hurt managers’ profits and constrain future opportunities to grow. The consultancy surveyed 32 investment managers and found that 19 had been instructed to put aside £30m of additional capital on average by the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator. A large manager might have to set aside even more, up to £54m, said KPMG. “The FCA has become more stringent,” said David Yim, an investment management partner at KPMG. Every investment manager must provide written evidence about its risk management processes and how it would wind down its business in an orderly fashion if it were to fail. But some managers have failed to satisfy the regulator in their mandatory submissions known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process or ICAAP. In a speech in May, Nausicaa Delfas, director of specialist supervision at the FCA, said: “We have found that some firms are not assessing their ICAAPs appropriately. This can result in us requiring significant capital increases.” Mr Yim said: “Basic errors or poor articulation [of risk management processes] in capital adequacy submissions can have real consequences.” Two asset managers were forced to defer making dividend payments to their parent group after being instructed to hold more capital by the regulator. Mr Yim warned that investment managers “could be compelled to double the capital” they hold if they failed to satisfy the regulator’s requirements. Lorraine Bay, a partner at Moore Stephens, the law firm, said the importance of ICAAP submissions had changed for both investment managers and regulators. “It is regarded as a very serious document by the FCA, which uses these submissions to form its opinion of the governance, oversight and culture of a firm,” she said.', 'China es un país con una tradicional propensión al oro.

Or so the headlines would have you believe. In fact, opening new grammars remains illegal, as it has been since 1998. The “new school” in Sevenoaks is actually an extension of the existing Weald of Kent school nine miles away in Tonbridge. It has been allowed because Department for Education rules permit schools to expand on to so-called “satellite” sites, as long as they can prove that they are a genuine extension of the existing school — so, for instance, they have the same headteacher and the staff move between the sites. While this decision is regrettable for those of us who oppose selection, it does not presage a massive increase in grammar places. For a start, it will be challenged in the courts on the grounds that it is not a genuine extension — so other grammars considering a similar proposal will hold off spending time and money until they know it is worthwhile. In addition, many of the existing 163 grammars would have little interest in further expansion as it would dilute their selectivity, especially in areas such as east Kent where they are already concentrated. Finally, the government has shown no sign of wanting to scrap the 1998 Act, introduced by the last Labour administration, and allow genuinely new grammar schools. At the moment, 5 per cent of pupils in England are educated in grammars; this could plausibly rise to 6 or 7 per cent but there is no chance of a return to the 1947 peak of 38 per cent. This is because, since David Cameron became party leader, there has been a shift in Conservative policy from trying to help a few pupils through grammars to trying to improve the system as a whole. Under Michael Gove, former education secretary, and his successor Nicky Morgan, the government has pursued a series of policies designed to meet Harold Wilson’s wish for a “grammar-school education for all”. Money has been redistributed, through the pupil premium, to schools with more disadvantaged intakes; all pupils are now expected to pursue a classical liberal education up to 16; and good schools have been paired with struggling ones (building on a policy initiated by their Labour predecessors). Mr Cameron and Ms Morgan know that a return to the 11-plus for all and selective entrance to secondary school would work against these policies. The evidence is clear that, while grammars benefit the minority of pupils lucky enough to attend them, they reduce social mobility and widen gaps. Disproportionately few children from disadvantaged backgrounds pass the 11-plus, partly because their parents cannot afford extensive tutoring. And in local authorities that still have selection, poorer children do worse than in the rest of the country. In Northern Ireland, which kept its selective system, there is a significantly bigger gap in academic achievement between pupils on free school meals and their wealthier peers than in England. Globally, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has found that countries that select at 11 are invariably more socio-economically segregated than countries that have comprehensive systems. The top 10 most successful education systems in the world are all comprehensive, bar Singapore which has a non-academic stream for a small minority. Given the weight of evidence, it feels as if the persistence of the “grammar school as driver of social mobility” mantra is a function of what psychologist Daniel Kahneman calls availability bias. A small number of high-profile figures — Margaret Thatcher, Michael Howard, Iris Murdoch and John Carey to name a few — whose success was in part due to a grammar school education are much more visible than the far more numerous people from poorer backgrounds who had less of chance of success as a result of going through a selective system. Meanwhile, the focus on creating an excellent education for all is starting to show dividends. Schools such as King Solomon’s Academy in Westminster; Perry Beeches in Birmingham and Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets are all helping around 90 per cent of their pupils — many of whom come from the poorest wards in the country and, a generation ago, may have found themselves written off as uneducable — achieve at least five good GCSEs including English and maths. But this success remains patchy. Too many schools are finding it difficult to recruit high-quality teachers and leaders and the threat of funding cuts in the upcoming spending review could make life even harder. Excellence for all is an admirable goal but it needs to be paid for. More challenging exams and curriculum could help give those from disadvantaged backgrounds the chance to compete with their richer peers for university places and top jobs; but if schools don’t have the capacity to deliver this, the gap could widen further. These are the real issues the government is grappling with. Grammars remain an unhelpful distraction. The writer is executive director (programmes) of the charity TeachFirst', 'Fancy new terms such as “FinTech” are found all over mainstream and online media outlets these days. However, most people still have no idea what this term means, or why it is even such an important topic of conversation these days. Before we can explain the recent evolution of FinTech, we must first explain what this new hype is all about.\n\nAlso read: New UK Cybercrime Report Makes No Mention of Bitcoin\n\nWhat is FinTech?\n\nThe term FinTech is a shortened version of talking about Financial Technology. Using shorter terms are always more eye-catching, and are easier to convey between parties engaged in conversation. FinTech’s main goal is creating new forms of software and hardware to provide financial services to people, and improve existing financial product for mainstream consumers.\n\nRegardless of how one wants to look at things, the current financial infrastructure we all use – and hate – is outdated. Granted, the way consumers pay for items and services has evolved from paper money to plastic cards. In a way, this is a form of FinTech, as plastic cards are a rudimentary form of financial technology.\n\nPayment terminals, which were designed to read these plastic cards and use them as a form of payment in a semi-convenient manner, is a prime example of FinTech in a hardware format. Without these payment terminals, which are now very common at brick-and-mortar stores, card payments would simply not be possible. Innovation in the financial sector took place when these payment terminals were created.\n\nSince that time, however, there has been very little to no further innovation from within the financial sector itself. In fact, things have grown from bad to worse, as everyday consumers are looking for alternative ways to spend funds. Using card payments is convenient, but not every person in the world has access to financial services provided by a bank or similar institution.\n\nOver the course of recent years, the term FinTech has become broader in terms of being applicable. Not only can this term be used to identify financial innovations for consumers to interface with directly, but it is also applicable to software innovations. One example of such a software innovation is how payment terminals will not only read bank cards, but also credit and debit cards. The hardware was already in place, but the software on the device had to be modified slightly.\n\nWhy Do We Need Financial Innovation?\n\nMany people will know the saying “if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it”. One thing most consumers fail to realize – in large part thanks to traditional media not paying enough attention to this – is how the financial ecosystem is utterly broken right now. The world of finance has been shielded from regulatory changes for quite some time now, and global banks are in firm control of consumer’s money at all times.\n\nWhile this may sound positive on paper, the truth is that the everyday consumer has no say in their financial future. People are forced to comply with the current infrastructure and rules, and there is no room for interpretation or debate. Many people have taken offense by this lackluster attitude and feel the time is now to shake up the financial ecosystem as we know it.\n\nFurthermore, recent attacks against banks, as well as their seemingly unlimited ability to keep printing extra paper money while devaluing existing currency supplies, are not all that favorable. Disrupting the financial sector will not happen overnight, but as our society evolves, so should all aspects of society. The financial world has been delaying that evolution for five decades now, but that time has come to an end.\n\nHow do you feel about the current financial ecosystem? Do you feel there is a need for innovation in certain aspects, and if so, which ones?

After a rally to SPX 2022 on Tuesday the market pulled back to 1991 by Wednesday. After that, helped by two gap openings, the market rallied Thursday/Friday to post new uptrend highs at SPX 2034. For the week the SPX/DOW gained 0.85%, the NDX/NAZ gained 1.40%, and the DJ World gained 0.50%. On the economic front reports continue to be mixed to negative. On the uptick: retail sales, consumer sentiment, plus weekly jobless claims improved. On the downtick: the CPI/PPI, NY/Philly FED, industrial production, capacity utilization, the WLEI and GDPn. Next week lots of Housing reports, Leading indicators, and the ECB meets.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWith the stock charts monthly chart only going back to 1980 the labeling of the waves can be confusing for some, as one can see a Primary III lasting 18 years, (1982-2000), and now a Primary III lasting only four years, (2011-2015). One may think how is that possible? Actually, it is not only possible but somewhat expected when one reviews the last 100 years of stock market data rather than just 35 years.\n\nThe chart above displays the market activity in the DOW from 1900-2008. During this period of time the stock market completed a bullish Grand super cycle in 1929, and a nearly 90% decline bearish Grand super cycle into 1932. From that 1932 low the next 200+ year bullish Grand super cycle began.\n\nGrand super cycles divide into five Super cycle waves, with the three bullish waves (SC 1, SC 3 and SC 5) lasting about 70+ years. The bullish SC 1, noted by the Cycle wave [5] top in 2007, started in 1932, and lasted 75 years. This was followed by a bearish 50+% decline into 2009 for SC 2. After that low in March 2009 the market started its next 70+ year bullish SC 3. This is easily observed with the up-to-date monthly chart that follows.\n\nA 70+ year bullish Super cycle unfolds in five Cycle waves. The three bullish Cycle waves (C 1, C 3, and C 5) can last from 5 years to 30+years. During the 1932-2007 SC 1, the Cycle waves were as follows: C [1] 1932-1937, C [2] 1937-1942, C [3] 1942-1973, C [4] 1973-1974, C [5] 1974-2007. Notice Cycle [1] only took 5 years, Cycle [3] 31 years, and Cycle [5] 33 years.\n\nEach bullish Cycle wave divides into five Primary waves. Obviously a Cycle wave of only five years will have much shorter Primary waves than one of 30+ years. It is therefore very important to know where the market is in regard to the big picture, before trying to anticipate where it is now, where it is heading, and how it might get there.\n\nWith SC 1 as a template we have been expecting a relatively short Cycle wave [1] bull market from the March 2009 SC 2 low. At first we thought it might last five years, then eight years, now we would not be surprised if it ended 2015/2016. The important point is that we knew it would not last 30+ years. That is expected for Cycle wave [3]. After the current bull market tops, a one to two year Cycle wave [2] bear market will follow.\n\nLONG TERM: bull market\n\nWe continue to track the wave formation of Cycle wave [1] of Super cycle wave 3. As noted above bullish Cycle waves unfold in five Primary waves. During this bull market Primary waves I and II completed in 2011, and Primary waves III and IV completed in 2015. Primary wave V, the fifth and final wave, is currently underway.\n\nWe are expecting Primary wave V to complete at one of the price targets posted on the weekly chart above. The most obvious target would be SPX 2214-2219, if it completes in one uptrend. When it does conclude a Cycle wave [2] bear market should then follow, with the market losing between 45% and 50% of its value. This is likely to take one to two years. After that a 30+ year Cycle wave [3] should get underway, with bull/bear markets along the way, carrying the markets to unbelievable heights. Exciting times ahead!\n\nMEDIUM TERM: uptrend\n\nAfter the Primary III high in May at SPX 2135 we observed a three trend a-b-c decline to 1867 by August. We then waited for a test of that low before firmly labeling Primary IV at that SPX 1867 low. The main thing we were watching was to observe alternation between the Primary II five trend elongated flat, and Primary IV. With Primary IV ending as a zigzag, alternation was achieved by the market.\n\nSince impulsive primary waves unfold in five Major waves, we labeled the first rally off the SPX 1867 low to SPX 1993 as Major wave 1. Then Major wave 2 unfolded in an odd irregular zigzag ending at SPX 1872. After that low, right at the end of September, Major wave 3 kicked off to the upside. Should Major wave 3 travel 1.618 times Major 1, then its target would be SPX 2076. If 2.0 times Major 1, its target is SPX 2124. Medium term support is at the 2019 and 1973 pivots, with resistance at the 2070 and 2085 pivots.\n\nSHORT TERM\n\nFor Major 1 we counted a simple five waves up from SPX 1867: 1915-1880-1990-1948-1993. For Major wave 3 we have counted nine waves up for just Intermediate wave i: 1917-1894-1992-1972-1999-1976-2020-2006-2022. Then after an Intermediate wave ii pullback to SPX 1991, we have counted just one wave up for Intermediate iii thus far: 2034. This one wave could have subdivided into five Minute waves: 2008-1997-2031-2020-2034 thus far. So this first wave up should be close to completing. When it does we would expect about a 15-20 point pullback before Intermediate iii heads higher.\n\nShort term support is at the 2019 pivot and SPX 2000, with resistance at SPX 2040 and the 2070 pivot. Short term momentum ended the week with a negative divergence.

10/18/2015,"[""Charlie Woolnough is a co-founder of CoinCorner, a consumer-focused bitcoin services business. In this article, he gives his view on the current state of the bitcoin industry and what companies in the space should expect from next year.\n\nThe bitcoin industry is still years away from maturity. Unfortunately, many business were launched on the back of overly optimistic industry growth projections. The hard reality is, there just isn’t currently enough volume to support all the exchanges, payment gateways and wallet providers that have sprung up, let alone the number of secondary service providers, such as bitcoin compliance solutions, that have been created to support the first wave of service providers.\n\nBelt tightening\n\nMany of these businesses will need to take radical steps to survive the next few years while consumer adoption catches up with service provider expectation. We are already seeing signs of this where those businesses that haven’t been able to reach critical mass are forced to close, resize, pivot or merge with competitors.\n\nExpect to see this trend accelerate in the next 12-18 months. Even those companies that have raised large amounts of investment aren’t immune to the situation. Indeed, they will now have a different type of pressure to deal with – the pressure of investor expectation and the fight to avoid the dreaded ‘down round’ if they need to secure further funds to continue operating, which many will.\n\nBitcoin businesses will need to learn very quickly that they have to grow with the industry rather than ahead of it. Consumer education and the public promotion of bitcoin is admirable, not to mention required, but we are still several years away from sports sponsorship being an optimal use of company funds.\n\nWell-backed businesses with patient investors or those that are owner-operated with a low cost base will be best placed to survive.\n\nBlockchain needs bitcoin (or at least its user base)\n\nA lot of investors are now chasing so-called ‘blockchain ideas’. However, it’s not always entirely clear how a lot of these ideas will generate revenue or gain user traction any time soon. A sensible approach would be for blockchain businesses that are targeting consumers to partner with more established bitcoin businesses that are already operating in the space and have reached a critical mass of users.\n\nAt least then they would have ready access to a consumer base that has some appetite for more nascent blockchain-related services. It’s hard to imagine people who haven’t already experimented with bitcoin suddenly rushing to register assets on the blockchain, for example.\n\nSurely it’s those people that have adopted and experimented with bitcoin that will be the most likely early adopters of blockchain services as well. For many, bitcoin will become the gateway to the blockchain. It’s how people will get comfortable with the technology.\n\nThe banking issue\n\nIt has been said many times that bitcoin needs a killer app to become mainstream. However, don’t we have that already in the form of extremely cheap peer-to-peer payments? What is needed is a more seamless consumer experience between traditional finance and bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is currently functioning in spite of an awkward relationship with banks. If this relationship could be improved then bitcoin could thrive. How can we ever hope to get greater consumer adoption for bitcoin when many users’ first experience is the loss of £25 for an international bank transfer or a 3% credit card fee for the pleasure of acquiring their first bitcoin. It’s self-defeating and means only diehards and those keen on experimentation will make the leap from fiat to crypto currency.\n\nSo, how do we bridge the gap between banking and bitcoin? Unsurprisingly, the answer lies in banking’s favourite arena of regulation and compliance.\n\nRegulation\n\nRegulation is required to give banks the certainty they need to provide banking facilities to the sector. How a bitcoin business then satisfies a bank that they are in compliance with any relevant regulation is the next big hurdle. This is where regulators need to realise that applying traditional compliance metrics to bitcoin is pointless.\n\nA new paradigm is needed that recognises and embraces the unique characteristics of bitcoin. As a result, bitcoin compliance and those who create products that are able to help get banks comfortable with bitcoin, is critical to the development and growth of the sector. Herein lies the acid test: if the bitcoin compliance providers can’t create a product that banks approve of, they won’t get many clients.\n\nIt will be interesting if the Isle of Man’s new Designated Business Act, which comes into force in the next few weeks and requires crypto businesses to register with the island’s financial regulator, does anything to enhance bank’s appetite for the sector.\n\nTen predictions for 2016\n\nBitcoin companies with just one business line will increasingly become disintermediated by those that offer multiple services. Investor clamour for all things blockchain will return full circle as blockchain start-ups begin to partner with more established bitcoin businesses. Sadly more bitcoin business will close or consolidate. Bitcoin adoption will continue to move slowly forward – mass consumer adoption is still in the future. The relationships between banks and bitcoin business will begin to thaw as more sophisticated bitcoin compliance solutions come to the market. We will see fewer and fewer pure bitcoin start-ups – those that already exist now have too much of a head start. Bitcoin legislation will begin to evolve at a faster pace and will help give the sector added credibility. There will be more fraud related to altcoins. Investment in the sector will plateau until consumer adoption dramatically increases. The price of bitcoin will remain relatively static around the $200-$300 range.\n\nFinal thought\n\nUltimately, bitcoin will survive and gain greater public adoption – the technology is simply too compelling to ignore. However, whether many of the companies currently operating in the space will survive long enough to reach the promised land remains to be seen.\n\nLean business models and frugality are the order of the day for bitcoin companies in 2016. A loyal and growing customer base will surely help as well.\n\nTo learn more about what happened in the bitcoin and blockchain space in the third quarter of this year, see our latest State of Bitcoin and Blockchain Report.\n\n2016 image and padlock image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

With bitcoin and blockchain technology companies also benefiting on the investment front, a collision of the two industries was inevitable as companies reach for a slice of the pie.\n\nAside from attracting Venture Capital, the digital currency industry has always been inherently drawn towards crowdfunding. The creators of an end-to-end virtual reality (VR) content creation platform, Voxelus, recently announced a 30-day crowdsale of the cryptographically secure in-game token, called “Voxels.”\n\nAccording to the company\'s co-founder and CEO, Martin Repetto, Voxels will be the only method of payment on the platform’s upcoming Content Marketplace for VR assets, which is set to launch in early 2016. Items for sale on the market will include animations, immersive worlds and games, some of which will be made by users of the platform itself.\n\nThe public sale will commence on the 2nd November, and is being handled by ShapeShift. The European based exchange is no stranger to token sales, EverdreamSoft partnered with ShapeShift for their Spells of Genesis BitCrystal token sale, in July.\n\n- Shaban Shaame, EverdreamSoft CEO and Founder\n\nThe Voxelus platform was designed to allow anyone to create Virtual Reality content, a current lack of which is a sticking point for upcoming VR platforms. Voxelus Creator, a 3D design app for PC and Mac, will allow users make new VR experiences and virtual spaces, all without writing a single line of code. Voxelus also features a stand-alone VR player app, which works on desktop PCs, and plays the content on the Oculus Rift or Samsung VR.\n\n- Oculus\n\nThe idea of virtual reality has been around since before the 1950s, traces can be seen in Stanley G. Weinbaum’s short story, “Pygmalion’s Spectacles,” which is recognised as the first work of science fiction to mention VR.\n\nThe current generation of headsets in development, including the Oculus Rift, are arguably a real-life version of Pygmalion’s Spectacles. The Rift came into being through it’s own crowdfund, a kickstarter campaign which raised just over US$2m, in August 2012. Just two years later, Facebook purchased the project for US$2b. Mark Zuckerberg, the Founder and CEO of Facebook, said at the time that, “Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction. But the internet was also once a dream, and so were computers and smartphones. The future is coming and we have a chance to build it together”\n\nLeveraging the buzz around Rift, Voxelus seized the opportunity to announce the public crowdsale at the Oculus Connect 2 developer conference, which took place three weeks ago in Los Angeles. The event, which focused on the Oculus Platform and pushing virtual reality forward, attracted over 1000 engineers, designers, and creatives from around the world.\n\nPreceding the public sale, Voxels have been available to strategic partners and cryptocurrency investors in a private sale, where they received 1200 Voxel per bitcoin, with a minimum purchase of 100,000. During the public crowdsale, taking place on the site sale.voxelus.com, buyers can acquire 1000 Voxel per bitcoin in the first 24 hours, followed by three tranches of 900, 800 and 750 Voxel per bitcoin. There is a minimum order of 100 voxels, selling for US$25 - US$30. The sale will last 30 days or until 31.5 million Voxel are sold, representing 15 percent of the total supply, 210 million.\n\nVoxelus is not the first digital currency company announcing a crowdsale to fund a VR project this year. Wendell Davis arranged a private sale in late January, with assistance from crowdfunding platform Koinify, for project Vizor, “the Youtube of virtual reality.”\n\nVizor released their own token VIZR, for the sale. Davis, who is the co-founder at Vizor, explained that he is a big believer in crypto tokens and thinks they will pair well with VR, in an interview with BraveNewCoin.\n\nThe plan for VIZR sounds much the same as the the plan for Voxels. Down the line, the VIZR token will be tradable for anything, from virtual furniture to a film screening in a virtual theatre, “the possibilities are endless and no coding is required,” said Davis. “The VIZR token can also be used to tip content creators, and purchase advertising and other premium features in the Vizor ecosystem.”\n\nThe Vizor team have also experimented with Adam B.Levine’s idea of token controlled viewpoints in VR. “If you had a certain token within your wallet, say we called it ‘Vizor Door’, then a door would appear in your world,” said Davis.\n\nAdam B.Levine wrote a blog exploring this topic, called Token Controlled Viewpoint (TCV) Genesis, Characteristics and Early Use Cases. In it he explains that Token Controlled Viewpoints are an application of Token Controlled Access (TCA ), where users gain access to content by holding a specific token.\n\n- Adam B. Levine\n\nVizor appears to still be in Beta mode and have not made any official announcements since their private crowdsale, although their twitter account occasionally posts updates, the last one was May this year.\n\nVoxelus, however, have taken a slightly different approach with their public sale. The team have attracted not only ShapeShift, and the influence that Erik Voorhees brings with him, but also Halsey Minor, chairman and co-founder of Voxelus and chairman and founder of the exchange Uphold.\n\nUphold, formerly known as Bitreserve, announced that Voxels will be the only digital currency other than bitcoin that is supported by the platform. ""Early in my career, I was influenced by the visions of writers such as Neal Stephenson in books like Snow Crash that envisioned worlds with both virtual money and virtual reality,” said Minor. “Making science fiction science fact is the kind of thing every entrepreneur lives for.""', 'Certain organization such as MMM Global have been accepting bitcoin payments in what appears to be a rehashing of the pyramid scheme of the same name that was started back in the Soviet Union.\n\nNow, CEO Bobby Lee and the BTCC team issued a warning to its customers and potential bitcoin investors that BTCC is in no way affiliated with such schemes, and that investors must consider validating the entity promoting any bitcoin related investments to ensure its legitimacy.\n\n1/ We\'ve had reports of dubious ""investments"" involving #bitcoin. These may be ponzi schemes designed to steal your bitcoins. — BTCC (@YourBTCC) October 14, 2015\n\nOver the past few months, customers of prominent bitcoin exchanges and investment firms like BTCC and San Francisco-based bitcoin investment firm Pantera Capital have seen an increasing number of investment scams and ponzi schemes.\n\nLast month, anonymous hackers claiming to be Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead sent an email blast using the email address [email protected], to coax Pantera Newsletter subscribers into investing in a highly profitable investment offer.\n\nAlthough none of the customers were involved with this scam, the professionalism and complexity of the letter convinced many of Pantera Capital investors by imitating Pantera flawlessly.\n\nThe letter offered small investment opportunities starting from 0.5 BTC all the way to 15 BTC, and guaranteed around 2 BTC in profit in less than 30 days of investment.\n\nA section of the letter read:\n\n“We are now accepting subscriptions for the first ever Pantera Blitz Fund. This Fund designed specifically on investing for a short period of time and with a guaranteed fixed returns. Our offer stands for 15% per month subscription limiting max. deposit 50 BTC per person. Deposit 15 BTC to address: 19QiVvDdyC8sMPNrX8us159TefrCcS6xeB or scan QR code for participation.”\n\nMMM Global Republic of Bitcoin\n\nSergey Mavrodi, founder one of the largest Ponzi schemes of all time, which stole around US$10 billion worth of funds has initiated another investment scheme with bitcoin and the same brand name.\n\nMMM Global, derived from his previous billion dollar ponzi scheme MMM guarantees 100% profit per month by having its users purchase “Mavros,” which Mavrodi describes as altcoins and invest in a “Global Fund of Mutual Aid.”\n\n“MMM is a community of people providing each other financial help on the principle of gratuitousness, reciprocity and benevolence. We use BITCOIN infrastructure in our transactions. In MMM you don’t have to make contracts or pledge your property. In MMM there are no lenders and no debtors. Everything is very simple: one participant asks for help — another one helps,” the website explains.\n\nThe fund has gained popularity from many South African bitcoin users and investors from South East Asia. This time, a lot of new “bitcoin investors” may fall victim to Mavrodi once again, which certainly won’t help Bitcoin’s public image (e.g. MtGox), and that’s something Lee and Bitcoin users will be hoping to avoid this time around.', 'Bitcoin and altcoin exchange Cryptsy (Project Investors, Inc.) may be in a serious trouble, with one report over the weekend claiming that the exchange is refusing to allow users to cash out.\n\nA report from The Merkle goes as far as claiming that the company has “gone full Mt Gox” (a reference to failed Japanese Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox) and that customers have had their funds frozen or were locked out of their account and are unable to withdraw coins.\n\nIt’s suggested that the downfall of Cryptsy may be related to the company being involved in a GAW Miners/ Paycoin ponzi scheme, in particular that Cryptsy held a Prime Controller for Paycoin and profited from the scam; it was reported earlier this month that Cryptsy was under Federal investigation for its involvement with Paycoin, and not from one agency but several: the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe report links to multiple users who have complained on popular Bitcoin forum Bitcointalk going back months who all have a similar story: they are unable to withdraw funds from Cryptsy, they have either been ignored by support or threatened with losing their accounts for constantly contacting support; in one case one user claims that Cryptsy changed the password on his account and wouldn’t let him access it.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Cryptsy has been in the spotlight for poor behavior with the company being sued in 2014 due to its links to the also now notorious Bitcoin Savings & Trust ponzi scheme.\n\nComplaints, in that case, included that Cryptsy using deceptive and misleading tactics such as the promise of high profits based on seven percent weekly interest; not providing a safe and reliable platform to trade cryptocurrencies; and excessive fees and commissions, among others.\n\nNo surprise\n\nCryptsy appears to be continuing to trade and take deposits at the time of writing but in the world of dodgy Bitcoin exchanges we’ve seen this before; the more important aspect is whether users are able to withdraw their funds, and answer currently would appear to be no.\n\nIf they have “gone Mt Gox” it’s of absolutely no surprise whatsoever, given the company’s previous involvement with some of the worst scammers and criminals to have ever operated in the Bitcoin space; that people would still trust the services of this company in October 2015 despite the nefarious company they keep is a sad reflection that either people don’t do some basic due diligence about the people they trade with, or just don’t care, and although there are legitimate victims here, the Latin phrase Caveat Emptor comes to mind.\n\nCryptsy is one of the ever shrinking pre-regulation, old school exchanges complete with Belize registration at a time where the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space has moved to transparency and financial compliance through venture capital backed companies such as Coinbase and Gemini, taking Bitcoin to a broader, more publicly acceptable space.\n\nThe death of Cryptsy will be sad for those who lose money, but good for Bitcoin in the long term as the market can only progress once it is purged of those who are willing to steal and defraud users.', 'Apple Pay has been touted as one of the most revolutionary mobile payment forms of the past 12 months. Despite a ton of marketing efforts, hype, and integration by thousands of merchants around the world, the platform has not been without flaws. In fact, most users are still not sure whether or not Apple Pay is a favorable option. Running out of phone battery makes the entire payment utterly useless.\n\nAlso read: Understanding FinTech – What is it And Why Do We Need It?\n\nApple Pay – Positive Signs But Still Not Lovingly Embraced\n\nApple Pay is proving to be quite an interest spin on mobile payments, as the service has many things going for it. There is a dire need for more competition in the mobile payments ecosystem, and Apple Pay, combined with Android Pay and Samsung Pay, are just a few of the names in the mix. Everyday consumers favor mobile payments as a form of cashless transactions, and Apple Pay has launched at the most opportune time.\n\nFor small businesses, Apple Pay may be a favorable option, depending on their customer page. Especially younger generations seem to enjoy using Apple Pay, and if that demographic represents over half of a store’s clientele, it might be worth investing in the additional hardware. Plus, more partnerships have been announced to grow the Apple Pay ecosystem even further.\n\nAdditionally, more card issuers and banks are supporting Apple Pay on a monthly basis. At the time of publication, over 400 financial institutions have partnered with Apple Pay so far. Combine that with a rather strong initial adoption, and things seem to be on the right track. But there are still a lot of hurdles and problems to overcome as well.\n\nDespite that strong initial response, usage rates of Apple pay have been declining across the board. Even people who used Apple Pay on a daily basis have started to resort to this form of payment less and less. In fact, most users indicate they rarely consider using the payment method at all. No alarming situations just yet, but it’s not a great sign of confidence either.\n\nA fair amount of big-brand merchants is still holding out on Apple Pay. Most major brands are developing – or have developed – their mobile payment system and are not too keen on embracing the competition just yet. When consumers have to keep in mind where they can use what payment method, traditional wallets and card payments will always win. European penetration seems to be particularly difficult to overcome.\n\nLast but not least, Apple Pay users rely on their device’s battery status to make payments; Most everyday consumers find themselves out of mobile battery at least once a day, making such a payment method inconvenient. Apple pay is not the only mobile payment method suffering from that fate, though, but this matter needs to be addressed sooner or later.\n\nBitcoin Payments Suffer From The Same Fate\n\nThe mobile payments sector is prone to several weaknesses and flaws, especially as far as device’s battery levels are concerned. Bitcoin can also be used as a mobile payment, but using it is also subject to battery levels. However, there is one major difference between Apple Pay and Bitcoin payments, as the latter can be used without investing in additional infrastructure.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the mobile payment ecosystem will evolve in the next few years, and whether or not Bitcoin payments will play a big role. Apple Pay is struggling with adoption around the world, whereas Bitcoin can be used as a borderless global digital currency. One thing’s for sure, though: Apple Pay is facing stiff competition, and not just from similar payment methods, but also digital currencies.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Apple Pay and the mobile payment sector? What will Bitcoin’s place be in all of this? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nImages courtesy of Apple Pay, Shutterstock\n\nOriginally posted on: Apple Pay Stumbles After Initial Support – Bitcoin A Major Competitor', 'T0.com , a majority owned subsidiary of Overstock.com incorporated has some good news to share with the cryptocurrency community. The company has recently concluded yet another successful production beta test of its platform. According to a press release the company has successfully recorded the platform’s compliance with the regulations on bitcoin blockchain.\n\nT0.com is a bitcoin blockchain based trading platform. Like any other platform involved in trading, the company is required to meet the compliance requirements as stated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission among others. The recent production beta test successfully tested the ability to record the evidence of compliance with SEC Regulation SHO before a trader attempts to short sell. This is a significant breakthrough for the company as it will enable T0.com to efficiently make use of blockchain technology in trading to ensure transparency and fairness by recording all the information on blockchain.\n\nIn the press release, the CEO of T0.com, Parick M Byrne praises blockchain technology as the most important financial development of our lifetimes and he also proudly states that the company has utilized blockchain technology to create a working product which will be operational shortly while others are just theorizing about the innovations that are possible using blockchain technology. By using blockchain technology T0.com is attempting to bring transparency into a market which doesn’t have any.\n\nExcerpt of Byrne’s quote from press release –\n\n“When up and running, each Pre-borrow Assured Token will provide the purchaser a valid locate satisfying the SEC’s Regulation SHO requirements. These tokens will be auctioned nightly in a Dutch auction using t0 software and the transaction will be recorded on the blockchain. In the process, the arcane world of stock loan receives sunlight.”\n\nHe explains that the Pre-borrow Assured Token issued by T0.com to qualified institutional buyers and sellers on the platform will allow beneficial owners to bring their inventory into a transparent market. At the same time, short sellers will benefit by being able to borrow in a transparent market. Increased transparency is also good for regulators as they don’t have to go digging too deep into records to ensure compliance.', 'The pictures, like this one of Karim by Herakut , incorporate a QR code that passers-by can use to donate to the homeless person\n\nHomeless people ignored by passers-by are being put back in the picture with the help of art and mobile technology.\n\nProject 256 will enable street artists to paint a local homeless person, accompanied by a stencilled QR code.

Het onderwerp van deze week: bitcoins.\n\nMet Bitcoin kan je, kort gezegd, bankloos bankieren. Vanwege de innovatieve technologie achter het digitale geld heb je geen tussenpartij(en) meer nodig om geld (of andere zaken van waarde, zoals aandelen) te kunnen verplaatsen. En die technologie heeft inmiddels de belangstelling getrokken van grote jongens: banken en accountancykantoren. Die doen namelijk ook transacties onderling en dat zou met Bitcoin misschien wel sneller en goedkoper kunnen.\n\nBitcoin, het betaalmiddel, is wat meer omstreden. Je kan ermee betalen bij een kroegje in Delft en bij Thuisbezorgd.nl, maar nog niet bij de Albert Heijn. Toezichthouders weten niet zo goed wat ze ermee aan moeten.\n\nBlijft het muntje bitcoin iets voor de technerds of gaat het ooit nog de rol van de euro overnemen? RTL Z redacteur Frederieke Hegger schrijft een brief aan monetair activist Paul Buitink.\n\nBeste Paul,\n\nIn de kroeg, op het werk, thuis aan de keukentafel. Jij en ik moesten nog niet zo heel lang geleden (en misschien wel nog steeds) keer op keer hetzelfde aan sceptici uitleggen: bitcoin, dat is veel innovatiever dan je denkt. Wacht maar af, dat wordt echt wel wat.\n\nEn inmiddels kunnen we allebei tevreden vaststellen: we hebben gelijk gekregen.\n\nPopulariteit stijgt\n\nIn elk geval als je het hebt over de technologie achter de munt. Die technologie heeft technerds en bankiers over de hele wereld aan het denken gezet. Over geld. Maar vooral over de inefficiëntie van het huidige betalingsverkeer. Elke Nederlandse bank heeft tegenwoordig een innovatieclubje die naar bitcointechnologie ‘kijkt’. Sommigen gaan verder en werken samen met bitcoinstartups. Weer anderen, grote jongens, vormen zelfs een collectief om de blockchain, want zo heet die technologie, ook echt te gaan gebruiken voor transacties.\n\nHoe dat er in de praktijk uit gaat zien moeten we nog afwachten. Maar de blockchain, of iets vergelijkbaars, heeft impact en gaat nog meer impact hebben. Ongetwijfeld meer dan we nu kunnen voorzien.\n\nNiemand gebruikt het\n\nMaar ergens hebben sceptici ook gelijk gekregen. Bitcoin, het ‘muntje’, ging even hard, maar is eigenlijk nog niet echt verder gekomen dan de technerd die wel eens een pizza koopt. Ja de bitcoinstartups komen als paddestoelen uit de grond, en ook bij Microsoft kan je inmiddels met bitcoins betalen. Maar de ‘killer-app’ waardoor naast de technerd ook mijn moeder ermee gaat betalen is er nog niet.\n\nOndertussen wordt het muntje wel populairder onder criminelen. Steeds meer boeven blijken hun geld wit te wassen via bitcoins. Het digitale geld mag dan oh zo open source en transparant zijn, voorlopig is het nog verhullend genoeg voor criminelen om weg te kunnen komen met nare zaakjes. Een reden voor sommige autoriteiten om bitcoinbedrijven te gaan reguleren. Goed nieuws lijkt me, want dat geeft de gewone burger weer meer vertrouwen, maar misschien denk jij daar wel anders over.\n\nDecentralisatie\n\nHet ultieme einddoel van sommige bitcoinfans, dat centrale en commerciële banken van de aardbodem verdwijnen, is natuurlijk al helemaal ver weg. En dat is misschien maar goed ook. Een flink stuk decentralisatie en een fintechrevolutie: oke. Maar een baasloos en toezichtloos financieel systeem lijkt mij, op dit moment, een flinke en onverantwoorde brug te ver. Opnieuw: misschien denk jij daar anders over .\n\nKortom, de technologie van bitcoin gaat lekker. De monetaire kant, het betaalmiddel bitcoin, ligt een beetje op z’n gat. Misschien blijft dat gedeelte van Bitcoin toch alleen iets voor de diehards? Maar wellicht verwacht ik wel te veel in korte tijd of ben ik te sceptisch. Vertel jij het maar: wordt het, naast die technologie, ook nog wat met dat muntje? En waarom zouden we dat moeten willen?\n\nGroet en tot bij de Tegenlicht Meetup,\n\nFrederieke\n\nIs redacteur bij RTLZ, waar ze onder meer het dossier fintech in de smiezen houdt. In november komt haar boek De Geldrevolutie uit, over de invloed van technerds op de bankenwereld.\n\nHoi Frederieke,\n\nLeuk, een brief! Is weer eens wat anders dan een Twitter DM van je.\n\nPas op dat je niet in de PR van bankiers trapt. Wél de technologie van Bitcoin omarmen maar niet het muntje snijdt weinig hout. Je kunt deze technologie - het gedeelde, open grootboek genaamd blockchain - namelijk niet zomaar los zien van het waardemiddel erachter.\n\nHet is goed om voor onszelf en de lezer eerst duidelijk te maken wat de kracht is van de Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin is door Satoshi Nakamoto ontworpen zodat gebruikers wereldwijd onderling waarde kunnen overdragen zonder tussenkomst van een derde partij die ze hoeven te vertrouwen. En deze waarde wordt vastgelegd in de bitcoineenheid. De zogeheten ‘miners’ krijgen nieuw uitgegeven bitcoins voor het verwerken van transacties die vervolgens in een keten van blokken wordt geplaatst; de ‘blockchain’. Dit recht verkrijgen ze door aan te tonen dat ze de meeste rekenkracht hebben geleverd. Wedstrijdje ver plassen zeg maar. Als gevolg hiervan is Bitcoin het krachtigste decentrale netwerk ter wereld. De miners hebben in principe een prikkel om zoveel mogelijk transacties goed te keuren, waardoor Bitcoin beschouwd kan worden als ‘censuurvrij’. Verder groeit het aantal bitcoins in omloop volgens een openbaar, vastgelegd patroon tot 21 miljoen in het jaar 2140.\n\nNetwerk blijft groeien\n\nIn het eurosysteem daarentegen is een euro een vordering op een risicovolle bankbalans en moet je er op vertrouwen dat het schuldenkaartenhuis niet ineens omvalt, zoals in 2008 en recent in Griekenland. Of dat Draghi en co. de waarde van de munt niet verder uithollen en geld via QE (in)direct aan vermogende vrinden geven. Of dat je transactiegegevens niet voor marketingdoeleinden worden gebruikt of worden doorgestuurd aan de NSA. Er is veel vertrouwen en propaganda nodig om het draaiende te houden.\n\nHet aantal transacties, gebruikers, wallets en de rekenkracht binnen het Bitcoin netwerk blijven voorts groeien. Zelfs die vermaledijde prijs zit in een opwaartse trend. Oh, en criminelen prefereren nog altijd contant geld en voor de échte bedragen het goede, ouwe bankensysteem.\n\nTegen de stroom in\n\nBanken en overheden houden van big data en hun rol als gecentraliseerde vertrouwensbroker. Zoals eerder beschreven, is de essentie van een blockchain het overdragen van waarde zonder een derde partij die je hoeft te vertrouwen. Je ziet het conflict. Waar ‘the powers that be’ echt naar op zoek zijn als ze het hebben over blockchain, zijn manieren om sneller transacties te verwerken tussen hun eigen computersystemen. Wellicht door het optuigen van een nieuwe, gedeelde database. Een ‘blockchain’, maar dan net wat compleet anders. Mensen onderling wereldwijd laten betalen zonder dat ze er tussen zitten, is echter niet het plan.\n\nDit gezegd hebbend, ook ik zie bepaalde nadelen aan Bitcoin, bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot schaalbaarheid (ook al wordt hier via het Lightning Netwerk vooruitgang geboekt), verbruik van energie en prijsstabiliteit. Maar de kracht van de munt is voor mij helder: monetaire soevereiniteit. In een wereld waar banken en overheden meer en meer macht krijgen, is het belangrijk alternatieven te hebben; een corrigerende tegenkracht. Wikileaks werd overeind gehouden door bitcoiners nadat de reguliere bancaire kanalen werden afgesneden. Miljarden mensen zonder bankrekening kunnen via bitcoin direct meedoen aan het internationale economische verkeer. Het ‘Internet of Things’ heeft iets als bitcoin nodig om apparaten elkaar te laten betalen en in landen als Venezuela wordt het belang van apolitiek geld als bitcoin dagelijks duidelijker.\n\nKiller apps te over, als je de oogkleppen afzet.\n\nTot 4 november!\n\ngroeten,\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n@paulbuitink\n\nBron • RTL Z / Versus"", 'Review by Robin Harding OCTOBER 18, 2015 0 Would you like to be free of financial worries forever? Lose 10 pounds of belly fat in just one week? Bankers hate this one weird trick by a pair of top economists: this 179-page book tells all about it! Still here? Then, in the parlance of George Akerlof and Robert Shiller, I have phished you for a phool. The term “phishing” comes from scam emails but Bob and George, as these Nobel laureates in economics style themselves, define it more broadly as businesses “getting people to do things that are in the interests of the phishermen but not in the interest of the target”. It happens whenever there is an opportunity to appeal to the “monkey on our shoulder” — the part of our brains that like nicotine, folksy-but-fake politicians and 15 per cent investment returns. Phishing for Phools has a host of examples — from used car dealers to credit card usurers, from junk food to junk credits — where the authors feel free markets exploit consumers’ lack of knowledge or self-control and turn them into the “phools” who fall for the sales ploys. This line of argument has a long history. Where Akerlof and Shiller break new ground is the sweeping application of the idea of the “phishing equilibrium” to finance. But for two such insightful economists, the concept is curiously under-developed. For an example, consider bank overdrafts in the UK. In the authors’ terms, the high interest rates and penalty fees make them a phish, from which nobody benefits. But is this correct? The phishermen, in this case the retail banks, find their phools by offering the British population free bank accounts. The cost of that is paid for by those weak, stupid or unlucky enough to go into debt. Avoid using your overdraft, however, and UK bank accounts are a great deal. Another case is the recent phenomenon of free-to-play online games. Here all the revenue comes from the 1 or 2 per cent of players addicted enough, or impatient enough, to pay for power-ups and in-game items. The other 98 per cent are pure winners. They get a free game that would not otherwise exist. This is surely a phish, but it does not just benefit the phishermen. The phools are subsidising other customers. So while a phishing equilibrium may well be unfair, as the money often comes from those who can least afford it, others may benefit. This kind of market structure can therefore be popular — a possibility Akerlof and Shiller do not address in their book. With their description of “reputation mining” by credit rating agencies, who caught out unwary investors by offering triple-A rated securities that turned out not to be, the authors make a strong case that phishing was part of the financial crisis. But putting it at the heart of the story goes too far: it makes one look for the evil mastermind scamster behind it all, when Lehman Brothers and its ilk were phools as much as phishers. The problem of the rating agencies is that they are still paid by the banks selling bonds and not the investors who rely on the ratings. Akerlof and Shiller devote two chapters to the 1980s savings and loans crisis, when about 1,000 small US banks went under after interest rates were raised, but not until they had first poured cash into Wall Street trader Michael Milken’s junk bonds. Some junk bond investors were surely phished. The savings and loan operators knew what they were up to, however — that was the scam. Akerlof’s deservedly famous paper with Paul Romer describes the S&L crisis as “looting” not “phishing”. It seems a more apt and interesting word. The style of Phishing for Phools will be familiar to fans of Shiller’s work: light on jargon and pacy enough not to outstay its welcome. The authors tell some engaging tales, although usually at the remove of a fellow academic’s research. There is not much grime or anguish, dialogue or doubt. The brilliant, catchy title will sell Phishing for Phools. Indeed, it is almost as if Bob and George want to tempt the monkey on the shoulder of the book-buying public. They give their readers a breezy ride through some modern behavioural economics — and if they leave them hungry for a little more nutrition, well, what clever marketer does not?

10/19/2015,"['Carl Force, a DEA agent who helped bring down online black market The Silk Road whilst also plundering hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin will be spending the next 78 months in prison, a judge decided today.\n\nForce was an undercover DEA agent working on the investigation into Ross Ulbricht and online black market The Silk Road, but things took a turn for the weird when he started operating off-book. Force created a number of unsanctioned online identities, which he used to try and extort Ulbricht into paying him, by threatening to reveal information to the DEA unless Ulbricht paid him off.\n\nWhile all this was going on, Force conspired with a Secret Service agent on the Silk Road Task Force, Shaun Bridges. Together, they managed to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars more from The Silk Road and another Bitcoin service, CoinMKT.\n\nForce was sentenced to 76 months—more than six years—in prison today, with the judge describing his “betrayal of public trust” as “breathtaking”. Bridges is due to be sentenced later this year, while the subject of their joint investigation, Ross Ulbricht, is in prison for life.\n\n[Reuters]', 'National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia will be taking part in a joint project led by global financial innovation firm R3 to design protocols based on blockchain technology at the same time as the ACCC has begun investigating the banks for closing the accounts of Bitcoin businesses last month.\n\nAustralia’s two of the largest banks, National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, will join R3, which includes 20 other major banking groups including HSBC and Citigroup, to explore the underlying technology of bitcoin and its uses to optimize and improve settlements and overall banking operations.\n\nThe news comes after the decision by the two banks to close all accounts associated with bitcoin startups and projects because according to the banks, all bitcoin startups failed to comply with KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) policies. All major banks of Australia abruptly shut down accounts of bitcoin companies without any prior notice on the same day.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has already begun their investigations to find out the reason behind the banks’ collaborate decision. ACCC chairman Rod Sims told the Australian Financial Review the investigations are in the early stages and the organization has asked the banks to explain their actions.\n\n""It is being investigated. We have already spoken to some banking representatives and sought some information. It is all still early stage, but under way,"" said Sims. ""We are asking the banks why they acted as they did and what contact there was between them.""\n\nThe investigation by the ACCC was requested by Australian senator Matthew Canavan, who suspects the banks have decided to proceed with the closing of all accounts associated with bitcoin because they wanted to avoid competing with emerging companies.\n\nCanavan said:\n\n""We have strong laws against one business obstructing another business competing against it. These laws are even tougher for those companies that have the privileged position of a significant market share.""\n\nWhile the ACCC has already started interviewing the banks and financial institutions involved, it will take around a couple of months for the ACCC to conclude the investigation. Until then, all bitcoin related businesses will not be able to use their bank accounts to transact with its customers and partners.', 'Blockchain technology company Coinprism has released Openchain, an open source, distributed permissioned ledger that targets enterprise and financial institutions.\n\nUnlike bitcoin, which is based on a unique distributed ledger, Openchain will enable users to deploy their own version of the chain, allowing them to potentially cut costs and reduce settlement time.\n\nSpeaking about Openchain\'s launch, Flavien Charlon, founder and CEO of Coinprism, explained:\n\n""Traditionally, settlement of a transaction happens some time after the trade happened. For example, three days for stock trading. With Openchain, it is possible to handle the trade and the settlement as a single operation, reducing both costs and counterparty risks.""\n\nOpenchain vs bitcoin\n\nThe main difference between Openchain and bitcoin\'s blockchain, Charlon said, resides in the type of assets that his product is designed to handle.\n\nAccording to Charlon – previously a software development engineer at Microsoft – bitcoin ""is a very special asset ... built for censorship resistance"".\n\nHe added:\n\n""The entire design of bitcoin comes from that requirement, with proof-of-work being at the core of that design. We certainly appreciate the incredible innovation around proof-of-work and censorship-resistant assets, but when banks talk about blockchain technology, they are really not interested in censorship resistance.""\n\nSimilarly to bitcoin\'s blockchain, Charlon claimed Openchain is both fully transparent and auditable.\n\n""Anyone can connect to a validating node, and receive a real-time copy of the transactions being validated,"" said the founder, adding: ""Openchain is also secured by digital signatures, which make it impossible to counterfeit a transaction.""\n\nOne notable difference with bitcoin, Charlon said, is the way in which Openchain deals with transactions to avoid confirmation delays:\n\n""Openchain gets rid of blocks, and chains transactions directly to each other, which means you can get instant transaction confirmation.""\n\nCompetition\n\nDistributed ledger technology has become increasingly popular in recent months, with various companies such as Digital Asset Holdings – which acquired Hyperledger – emerging in the space.\n\nItBit also revealed details about its top-secret Bankchain project, a private consensus-based ledger system which also targets financial organisations.\n\nSpeaking about its competitors, Charlon said:\n\n""The first big difference with all those companies is that our product is open source and ready to use today. None of these companies have released anything to date, and most of them (if not all) are making their software proprietary.""\n\nAlthough he declined to divulge specifics, Charlon said a few companies had already experimented with a private beta of Openchain.\n\n""The feedback we have received so far is very positive. Unfortunately, I can\'t share the names of the companies at this time,"" he concluded.\n\nBusiness man image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It’s either the ultimate evolution of financial technologies, or a silly fad that can be summed up in the disconcerting phrase: “dogechain.” In reality, major companies around the world have already shown favor to the burgeoning money exchange system and it may become harder and harder to stay away from the financial dark art.\n\nIn reality, it is all relatively easy to understand. The Blockchain is a public ledger where transactions are recorded and confirmed anonymously. It’s a record of events that is shared between many parties. More importantly, once information is entered, it cannot be altered. So, if the blockchain is the public record, what is being recorded? What are all of these “transactions”?\n\nCryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, are currencies that exist solely in digital. There are no physical golden coins with a big “B” on them. Moreover, owning these non-real coins entails a new idea of “ownership.” You don’t literally have it in your hands, or even in your bank account, but you have the ability to transfer “ownership” to someone else simply by creating a record in the blockchain. Rather than using bills, your transfer is pure data.\n\nWhere exactly is this chain located? Due to the open nature of cryptocurrencies, and the importance of the public having access to other blocks, the blockchain isn’t located on just one guy’s large computer. For example, the bitcoin blockchain is actually managed by distributed nodes. These nodes all have a copy of the entire blockchain. Nodes will forever come and go, synchronizing their own copies of the chain with those of other users. By distributing copies and access, the chain can’t simply “go down,” or disappear. It’s a decentralized system that is both sturdy and secure.\n\nAll of your dogecoins are in a row, but what do you do with them? Whether you’re using them IRL or online, the blockchain makes it happen. There are many reasons people are falling in love with cryptocurrencies: it’s anonymous, decentralized, and there are no fees or third parties trying to grab a percentage. However, if there were absolutely no regulations in place, the new currency would quickly become a greedfest of users trying to screw each other over. The public nature of the blockchain means that anyone can check it. It is effectively anonymous, yet public, simultaneously, and it is in the best interest of users if it remains so.\n\nYou can accept and trade coins, or you can mine for them. Miners can spend thousands of dollars on the right equipment just to mine coin. But what do they really do? What miners do is quite similar to real-world miners in that they are actively looking for something. Their computer repeatedly works through complex calculations to find a very specific answer.\n\nMiners solve problems, but how in the world is that helpful? Short story, miners are actually verifying that transactions posted by other users are legitimate, and the numbers all add up. Long story…\n\nMiners collect transactions and put them into a single block. A block generally contains four pieces of information: a reference to the previous block, a summary of included transaction, a time stamp, and Proof of Work that went into creating the secure block. The blocks are strung together into a chain—a fluid chain that does not allow for any inconsistencies; this means there are no “bad cheques” in the system, and transactions entered are necessarily valid and can be processed. By checking the blockchain and confirming transactions, the entire system is effectively self-regulated and fully secure. No, that doesn’t mean some kid cooped up in a basement can just click “okay” and confirm a billion dollar transfer. Blocks generally need numerous independent confirmations, and the equations are intended to be hard to crack. Not to mention, the hardware required is far more specialized than the average laptop. Finally, what’s to stop someone from simply going back and editing existing blocks? Each block is securely hashed—meaning it is rendered into seeming gibberish and nearly impossible to invert or undo. Once it’s in the blockchain, it’s there forever.\n\nSo, why waste time and resources helping other people, or the blockchain? Why not let someone else do all that “confirmation stuff,” while you just mine? Because, you don’t necessarily have a choice. Confirmation of the blockchain is central to mining. It’s part of the actual mining process; however, miners are generally given incentives. For example, after solving a problem (and creating a new hash) they are rewarded with coins.\n\nWill you be seeing a blockchain-styled ledger in your future? Short answer: oh yes. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have caused quite a stir over the past years. However, it seems their real importance has yet to be fully realized. The future isn’t just in businesses around the globe sporting happy “Now Accepting Bitcoins” signs, but rather emerging companies (and revolutionary existing ones, too) finding new uses for the cutting edge technology. VC firms and investors are placing their bets on the blockchain because there is untapped potential. Identity management, international contracts, and all sorts of complicated bank transactions can be greatly altered with the public ledger system. The process could (in an ideal world) work seamlessly, crossing boundaries where banks, logistics or a plethora of other obstacles once existed. They could be combined with the Internet of Things to create a more connected and automated world. Future companies may be able to absorb mountains of new data, or even digitize real-world things that are hard to quantify. Unfortunately, many big companies are remaining mum on the studies in the blockchain field for obvious reasons.\n\nHowever, it is public knowledge that nine major banks (including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs) recently joined a partnership to develop blockchain technologies. That’s not to say major companies are getting in on the cryptocurrency game; rather, they realize that the blockchain system, itself, could be a powerful tool for efficiency. With a system as versatile and secure as the blockchain, there may many unexpected innovations in the coming months and years.\n\nimage credit: BTC Keychain, CC2.0)', 'When people I know, or don’t know, ask me about work or what I do, I tell them that I write about Bitcoin, or I teach people about Bitcoin, or I invest in Bitcoin. That gets me at least a minute of genuine interest and curiosity. Let’s presume you don’t know this person very well, as only a passing acquaintance, like someone you may spend time in an elevator with. This is where something in sales called “The Elevator Pitch” comes in handy.\n\nSomeone you know as “Derrick” on your floor, either at work or in your apartment building, comes into the elevator, or runs into you in passing. You know you’ll be spending the next 30-45 seconds or so with Derrick, and he says “Hey, Joe, how’s it going?” If you’d like to introduce Derrick to Bitcoin, you can tease him with “The Elevator Pitch” and the conversation can go like this (Feel free to tweak this to work in your situation).\n\n“Hey, Joseph, how’s it going?”\n\n“Oh, things are just great, Derrick. I just invested in some more bitcoin and values are on the rise. Just paid for my coffee with bitcoin.”\n\n“Oh? Yeah, I’ve heard of this bitcoin. What is bitcoin again?""\n\nWhatever you said, the goal was to get him to ask you a “buying question” or for more information on Bitcoin, so make it sound interesting, but not complicated. This is where ‘The Elevator Pitch’ begins. It should last no more than 30 seconds while highlighting 2-3 great benefits, not features, to the user. It should pique the person’s curiosity to maybe do a Google search on it later. Here’s an example of the pitch I use in these situations. You should practice this beforehand.\n\n“Well, Derrick, imagine sending unlimited money, anywhere in the world, for free, with your smartphone. Imagine an investment that was worth a nickel five years ago and is now worth over US$250. Imagine a way to buy plane tickets, a cup of coffee, or a Tesla electric car without a bank fee, or risk of identity theft. What if you were your own bank, Derrick? Wouldn’t your life be better? That is ‘The Future of Money.’ That is Bitcoin.”\n\nThat’s not too hard, right? Then ask if he’d like more information, and refer him to a site that may help him, without overwhelming him with information. Ask him for his email to send him a link. I’d recommend an Andreas Antonopoulos video on YouTube that is focused on Bitcoin beginners. Search: “Bitcoin Andreas.” I do a one-hour video training on Udemy for free called ‘Bitcoin for Beginners’ that can help. It is broken up into 5-8 minute easy-to-follow videos designed for newbies to get their feet wet. Bitcoin is best understood is small spoonfuls, as to not overwhelm a person new to it.\n\n- Andreas Antonopoulos\n\nElevator pitches are like snowflakes, no two are alike. Come up with something you can say in 4-5 sentences that is easy to understand and easy for you to remember, but will make someone curious about Bitcoin. Leverage major sites that accept it like Fiverr or Microsoft. It should hit some hot buttons like identity theft, lower cost, high appreciation in value over time, etc. Have fun with it. Set goals that you will elevator pitch three people this week. Maybe somebody at your gym, someone at work, and someone in your neighborhood or church.\n\nIn my experience, people are curious about Bitcoin, but negative press and its complexities are major barriers. It’s a little over people’s heads, but if you make it simple, and tell the positive sides of owning it, you have a fair chance of growing your Bitcoin community. Give it a try.\n\nThe more people who buy it and use it, the more its mainstream monetary value increase and more businesses will sign up for it as well. When you do your part, and share Bitcoin with your community, Bitcoin and its “Network Effect” get a boost. If the mainstream media’s version of Bitcoin is all the common man hears, it will never gain mass adoption. We need to fill in the gaps.\n\nJust like the Internet did 25 years ago, revolutionary inventions like Bitcoin can grow virally, if you spread the word, so get to it! Think of three people you’re going to share “The Future of Money” with this week. Consider this a way of giving back to Bitcoin by sharing its treasures with your own community. Sharing is caring.', 'On the phone from his San Mateo office, Adam Draper, CEO of Boost VC and son of Skype and Tesla investor Tim Draper, is his usual energetic self, his voice evoking the same optimism as the orange high-tops he wears regardless of occasion.\n\nDraper is fresh off demoing a new batch of startups – Tribe 6 – for the incubator he co-founded with former Xpert Financial collaborator Brayton Williams in 2012, and that in 2013 found success by backing an emerging financial technology called bitcoin, then best known for its volatile price and associations with cybercrime.\n\nWhile potentially risky, the decision proved adept, winning Boost VC a slew of media coverage and its 2014 pledge to fund 100 ""bitcoin companies"" through 2017. So far, Boost is halfway there, having invested in 52 industry startups, including firms such as Align Commerce, Mirror and Reveal.\n\nToday, however, he\'s in the middle of recapping a recent trip to New York, unpacking his feelings about a revelation that financial institutions and investors ""don\'t like bitcoin"", but are interested in ""blockchain"", the amorphous term that while technically referring to bitcoin\'s distributed ledger, the blockchain, and derivatives that use its logic, has come to serve as a general stand-in for innovation in the way that YOLO was once used to punctuate hip conversations.\n\nDraper told CoinDesk:\n\n""We use the word blockchain now. I say bitcoin, and they think that\'s the worst thing ever. It just feels like they put up a guard. Then, I switch to blockchain and they\'re very attentive and they\'re very interested.""\n\nDraper seems ambivalent to the change, though he said he was initially against using it, mostly because he believes it\'s superficial. After all, companies that use the blockchain as a payments rail, the argument goes, still need to interface with its digital currency, which is the mechanism for transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n""When we talk about blockchain, I mean bitcoin,"" Draper clarifies. ""Bitcoin and the blockchain are so interspersed together, the incentive structure of blockchain is bitcoin.""\n\nDraper believes it\'s mostly a ""vernacular change"", noting the ecosystem has been through several such transitions before. He rifles off the list of terms that have come and gone including cryptocurrency, digital currency and altcoin.\n\n""It\'s moved from bitcoin to blockchain, which makes sense, it\'s the underlying tech of all these things,"" he added. ""I think in a lot of ways blockchain is FinTech, so it will become FinTech.""\n\nEffect on Boost\n\nIn regards to the startups Boost VC is accepting, Draper said this colloquial change hasn\'t influenced the businesses that are applying or the ones that gain entrance.\n\nBoost VC\'s most recent class included only five bitcoin startups – CoinUT, Epiphyte, Joystream, Unocoin and Wealthcoin, down from more than 20 in Tribe 5.\n\n""All of them, in some way, are using the blockchain, some of them are still using bitcoin,"" Draper explained. ""A lot of them are using bitcoin as a way to get money from one place to another.""\n\nIn terms of the guidance startups receive, Draper says the shift to blockchain hasn\'t resulted in any change in strategy, even on aspects of branding and positioning for growth.\n\n""It\'s really about what problem are you really solving and using this tool that we have that is the blockchain, and bitcoin on top of the blockchain, to solve problems that were once impossible to solve,"" he said.\n\nRegulatory burden\n\nAs for the low number of bitcoin companies in the most recent round, Draper attributed this to Boost VC\'s excitement about virtual reality (VR) and to factors like regulation.\n\nIn the future, he said, he wants the incubator\'s batches to be composed evenly of enterprises focusing on each emerging technology, but acknowledged that heightened regulatory burdens in the US are posing an issue.\n\nDraper has been openly critical of the BitLicense, New York\'s licensing regime for industry businesses, and of the approach lawmakers have taken toward the technology. Also of note is that Boost VC had backed Sand Hill Exchange, a platform shut down by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2015 for acting as an unregistered securities exchange.\n\nThis regulatory pressure, Draper said, has put an onus on his team to start conversations about compliance earlier when seeking to enlist new candidates, though he said the shift in how the industry is described could alleviate issues here.\n\n""Currency does need to be regulated, and this can tie into the blockchain vernacular. The blockchain doesn\'t need to be, it can be about assets,"" he said, adding:\n\n""Everyone is moving toward blockchain because you don\'t need to bear that regulatory burden.""\n\nBlockchain building\n\nWhen asked about the state of the blockchain infrastructure and its ability to serve as infrastructure for top-layer applications, Draper said he believes enough of the regulatory burden is already being shouldered for new businesses to flourish.\n\nNoting firms in his Boost VC and personal portfolio that meet this definition, he said cited BitPagos, Coinbase, Unocoin and Volabit as examples of companies that could now be built on by other entrepreneurs.\n\nOn the subject of private blockchains, Draper was less positive, referring to the technology as a ""private database"", and stating that he believes ""bitcoin\'s blockchain is the blockchain.""\n\nHe noted the launch of Liquid, a new sidechain developed by industry startup Blockstream as proof that the bitcoin blockchain is versatile enough to meet the demands of institutions that want to develop private blockchain networks, while still gaining access to the security and network effect of the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n""I\'m all in on bitcoin\'s blockchain and still 100% positive,"" he said.\n\nChanging times\n\nThe most beneficial change that may come from the rebranding of industry activities under the term ""blockchain"", Draper believes, is that financial institutions have the scale to market the technology to their already large number of users.\n\n""Financial institutions will build products that people actually use to do all their transactions, and they have the marketing dollars to do that,"" he said. ""In some ways, we\'re getting hamstrung by now being able to market to as large a market as we\'d like.""\n\nStill, he suggested that both Silicon Valley, the central hub of FinTech, and New York, the mecca of old finance, will likely be a bit awkward in their attempts to work together for some time.\n\nDraper recalled a meeting with representatives from the banking community on his New York trip, in which he stood out for fashion choices that had nothing to do with his preference for orange footwear.\n\n""I was in the middle of these bankers, and I was wearing my orange shoes. Everything else was really nice, suit, tie, everything else, and everyone was making fun of me because I was the only one wearing a tie,"" he said adding:\n\n""I was like what\'s happened to New York?""\n\nImage via TheProtocol.TV\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Topping over 140,000 global transactions a day in the last month, up from around 50,000 when prices were at their highest.\n\nIt also puts paid to the idea that the blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, is the most promising aspect of Bitcoin.\n\nAlthough, Bitcoin does have a long way to go to catch regular debit and credit card transactions.

But not just consumers can benefit from technological innovation, as companies stand to gain a lot from embracing these new tools. A recent study of British businesses indicated there is a major interest in harnessing technology, which could yield up to nearly £100bn a year.\n\nAlso read: Understanding FinTech – What is it And Why Do We Need It?\n\nDon’t Fight Technology, Embrace it At An Early Stage\n\nOver the past few years, technological innovation has gotten a bit of a bad reputation. Many people, especially among older generations, feel that machines and other innovations will replace humans in the long run. While it is certainly true that a lot of aspects of life could be improved upon by replacing the human element, Skynet is still a few decades, if not centuries, away.\n\nInvesting in new technology is a great opportunity to strike it big, or end up losing a lot of money. As is the case with any type of investment, there are benefits and risks which have to be weighed carefully. Many UK businesses are optimistic about these benefits though, as it could help company awareness and increase revenue by quite a margin.\n\nVirgin Media Business, in collaboration with Oxford Economics, polled over 1,000 UK executives regarding the impact of new technology on their company. While there is a certain amount of jobs that will become obsolete in the end – especially in financial services – there is an overall positive trend to this polling. Most executives feel the number of jobs in key parts of the company will increase, most notably in the professional & tech services area.\n\nEmbracing new technology allows companies to cut down on overhead costs, which is invaluable to any business. Furthermore, sales channels can be improved by leaps and bounds, as it has become increasingly difficult – and easy at the same time – to reach an intended audience. While most companies can be a bit over-optimistic regarding their expectations, there is a vast level of confidence in technological innovation boosting the number of jobs across the board.\n\nAs more and more companies launch their new digital solutions for customers, jobs will be created in terms of collecting, coding, and analyzing data. New services and technology will not increase a customer base tenfold overnight, as it takes months, if not years, to properly analyze whether or not it was a good investment.\n\nBitcoin Adoption Takes Time For These Reasons As Well\n\nMany people within the Bitcoin ecosystem are worrying about the lack of growth in recent months. These same people tend to forget a lot of major companies only started accepting Bitcoin at the end of 2014, and they can start analyzing data in a few months from now. Until those results have been made public, most other retailers, brands, and small businesses are keeping their “laissez-faire” attitude.\n\nIt only makes sense for a company to accept Bitcoin payments if there is enough customer demand.

Actualmente su cotización está por encima de los 260 dólares. Abría la jornada por encima de los 262 dólares, y roza, en el momento de publicar esta información, los 265 dólares en Bitfinex.\n\nLos analistas opinan que esta tendencia positiva podría venir provocada por varias razones, pero la principal parece que son las previsiones de una desaceleración económica mundial. El impulso inicial para esta subida llegaba desde China, donde las dos principales casas de cambio, Huobi y OKCoin, experientaron durante la semana pasada un aumento del volumen de intercambio. Esto podría haberse originado ante el temor de una desaceleración de la economía china y la especulación de una nueva devaluación del yuan chino, provocada por unas declaraciones del primer ministro chino, Li Keqiang, llevando a la gente a invertir en activos alternativos como bitcoin al estar acabándose el juego de la bolsa china que había desinflado la burbuja anterior del precio de bitcoin.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-fundador de BitMEX, defiende esta teoría ante CoinDesk hace unos días: “Las personas que ven la escritura en la pared están empezando a usar bitcoin como medio para preservar la riqueza. Como resultado de ello, la prima para bitcoin en China está aumentando, lo que está alimentando el rally que estamos viendo. Hoy mismo (por el 26 de octubre) la prima tocó un nuevo máximo local del 3%”. Desde OroyFinanzas.com se nos hace muy aventurado defender que el Bitcoin se este reconociendo como un activo de refugio por las masas y pensamos que el principal factor que mueve el precio de bitcoin es el especulativo, la deep web y las promesas de futuro bitcoin que se tienen que materializar en algunas de las muchas inversiones de capital riesgo en el ecosistema Bitcoin.\n\nSin embargo, el espectacular aumento de volumen que llegó a alcanzar bitcoin el 14 de octubre 2015, llegando a los 1,29 millones, ha sido calificado en CoinDesk por Bobby Lee, CEO del exchange chino BTCC, como artificial. Lee ha asegurado que aunque su casa de cambio ha visto también un aumento de volumen significativo, desestimó el volumen de su competencia, y aseguró que detrás de esos volúmenes no estaban los operadores sino los consumidores inmersos en un esquema ponzi. Razón por la que BTCC ha advertido a sus usuarios de que fuesen cuidadosos con sus compras.\n\n“Hemos publicado advertencias en nuestro sitio y en nuestras redes sociales advirtiendo a los usuarios a tener cuidado, pero han estado viniendo a nuestro intercambio y comprando como locos”, aseguró Lee.\n\nFuente: CoinDesk, NewsBTC\n\n© OroyFinanzas.com']"
10/20/2015,"['He was sent undercover into the Internet’s dark underbelly to flush out “Dread Pirate Roberts,” the leader of the notorious Silk Road drug market.\n\nBut Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Carl M. Force ended up playing both sides, tempted by the supposedly untraceable digital currency bitcoin. He conned his target, trafficker Ross Ulbricht, as well as the agency that he worked for.\n\nBut the gambit ultimately failed.\n\nEarlier this year, Force, 46, of Baltimore, pleaded guilty to extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice. On Monday, a federal judge in San Francisco ordered the 15-year DEA veteran to spend more than six years in prison and pay $340,000 in restitution.\n\nIn a statement, the U.S. attorney’s office said Force was the lead undercover agent in communication with Ulbricht when the DEA went after the Silk Road founder between 2012 and 2014. During that time, Force used the anonymity of the Internet to convince Ulbricht that he was someone named Carla Sophia, who went by the handle “French Maid” online.\n\nThe now defunct Silk Road was a hidden online marketplace that served as host for more than $180 million worth of drug deals starting in 2010. Ulbricht, 29, was convicted for running Silk Road and sentenced to life in prison in May.\n\nAs “French Maid,” and a second pseudonym, “Nob,” which was known to the DEA, Force persuaded Ulbricht to pay him in bitcoins for information about a fictional corrupt government employee. But instead of revealing these payments to the DEA to help build a case, Force converted the bitcoins to cash and then secretly deposited the proceeds in personal bank accounts.\n\nHe made more than $100,000 in bitcoins through the scheme, prosecutors said.\n\nLater, capitalizing on his role in the Ulbricht probe, Force convinced 20th Century Fox to pay him $240,000 to help consult on the studio’s film version of the Silk Road investigation -- without getting the DEA’s permission.\n\nForce later illegally used his role in a bitcoin currency exchange company to seize a client’s account and steal the bitcoins. When federal investigators began closing in on Force, he lied and obstructed their investigation into him and Ulbricht, prosecutors said.\n\nForce is the second law enforcement officer to be convicted of stealing bitcoins during the Silk Road case. Former Secret Service agent Shaun W. Bridges, 32, admitted this summer to stealing 20,000 bitcoins and liquidating it into $820,000 through a Japanese currency exchange before depositing it into his personal accounts. He’s scheduled to be sentenced in December and faces up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.\n\nFor breaking California news, follow @JosephSerna', 'UK-based Bitcoin savings account service BSAVE.io has announced closure of a US$400,000 seed funding round.\n\nBSAVE, the brainchild of former Société Générale analyst Jonathan Azeroual, announced the investment from a still unknown source in a press release Monday.\n\n“Bitcoin and digital crypto-currencies may be best suited to disrupt finance and become a global platform for storing and exchanging value,” Azeroual said. “BSAVE aims to unlock this potential by introducing a paradigm shift for online savings.”\n\nThe principle behind BSAVE lies in an algorithmically-calculated dividend paid on balances stored with the service, which is directly linked to Coinbase accounts and is therefore dependent upon users signing up with the wallet provider.\n\nAccording to BSAVE, Coinbase, which has previously received criticism for its user identification requirements and data sharing practices, was chosen as a partner “due to their stringent security procedures and their large customer base.”\n\nOther market offerings such as Magnr, which offers a fixed 2.18% return over a six-month period, do not place this prerequisite on prospective users.\n\nNonetheless, the savings account is something of a growing trend as a storage solution for dormant BTC funds on the market through its payment of interest, which is calculated according to factors including the size of funds held and the duration of storage.\n\n“People come to expect [a] more robust, user friendly and dynamic platform,” Azeroual summarized.\n\nBSAVE meanwhile also announced Monday the unveiling of “something very exciting” on its Twitter page, with further details still forthcoming.', 'UPDATE: CoinTelegraph has been informed that the annoucement, on which the following article is based, was originally published in People\'s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party with the CAC reposting it on their website. So while the article doesn\'t represent the opinion of the CAC, the People\'s Daily is a major publication in China, whose main readers are Chinese officials.\n\n***\n\nWhile many media outlets and financial experts have pointed to the large influx of funds from China to Western bitcoin exchanges as the cause of the recent bitcoin price spike, China’s Internet watchdog has announced that it can no longer “ignore its revolutionary changes” announcing that we have entered the “post-Bitcoin era.""\n\nNow it appears that China’ law enforcement and government agencies’ approach toward the cryptocurrency demonstrate may be easing. Based on recent events and publications from the Cyberspace Administration of China, the government seems to have tacitly authorized the use of bitcoin and operations of bitcoin startups and exchanges.\n\nIn a newly released publication, the CAC noted that the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officially defined bitcoin as a commodity and that its bank regulators stated that bitcoin will promote economic regulation of electronic money.\n\nA section of the publication also added:\n\n“Although some people think that bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain, is not stable, we cannot ignore the revolutionary changes it brought to the financial sector. The new technology has led to the expansion of a distributed payment and settlement mechanism, which will innovate financial transactions.”\n\nFurthermore, the CAC firmly believes that the “Post Bitcoin Era” has brought the properties of virtual currencies including bitcoin closer to real money through its secure and robust core functions and technical mechanisms. The CAC also cited the European approach to cryptocurrency and increasing interest from major banks.\n\n“Recently the attention has shifted from the traditional financial sector to the blockchain technology.” reads the translated text. “For example, according to the European Banking Association (EBA) in its latest report, blockchain technology can lower costs, improve product supply and improve the speed of transaction settlement.”\n\nFinally, the text also emphasizes that bitcoin is becoming more and more like a real currency with less volatility, announcing that we have entered into a new phase of development. An excerpt reads:\n\n“Digital currencies have entered the ‘post Bitcoin era,’ away from the [volatility] and towards regulation and mainstream development.”\n\nThis publication was released on October 13, around the same time the price of bitcoin in China began to surge. Meanwhile, The Harvard Business Review China also hosted the 1st global blockchain Summit in Shanghai during this period, possibly adding to the bitcoin hype and buying pressure on local bitcoin exchanges.\n\nWhile this unofficial announcement from the Chinese government seems to have boosted the bitcoin price by around 15%, it is important to realize that the largest bitcoin exchanges, businesses and mining pools are based in China and, in a few months, this could be the main factor driving up the bitcoin price.\n\n[Editor\'s note: The excerpts were taken from their original text in Chinese and translated into English by a Chinese speaker.]', ""Coinprism , the colored coin startup that created the Open Assets protocol as experimented with by NASDAQ and Overstock , has announced Openchain .\n\nOpenchain is an open-source distributed permissioned ledger with optional “anchors” into the Bitcoin blockchain. It is designed to solve Bitcoin's scalability and compliance issues as encountered by financial institutions, while still enabling several of the use cases offered by the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhile Bitcoin's blockchain currently offers a trustless public ledger, and is secured by a record amount of hashing power, existing financial institutions are often unable to make use of these properties. Most importantly, Bitcoin has proved to be a challange from a regulatory perspective, as regulators often require financial institutions to offer a level of accountability that Bitcoin cannot give them.\n\n“Public ledgers like Bitcoin have been problematic for financial institutions as transaction validation is delegated to a group of potentially unknown parties – the miners – while financial institutions are often legally required to vet every transaction going through them,” Coinprism founder and CEO Flavien Charlon said in a statement. “Openchain has been designed with these requirements in mind, and offers full control on transaction validation.”\n\nOpenchain allows each company or institution to deploy its own version of Openchain, for internal use. Within these companies or institutions, each level of the organization can transact on the corresponding level of their Openchain, using their unique digital signatures.\n\nAs such, higher levels within the organization have access to higher levels of the ledger, and are able to set permissions for lower levels. These lower levels, in turn, have access only to the lower levels of the ledger.\n\nThis, in effect, replicates the existing structure of an organization onto a blockchain-like system, while incorporating some of the advantages of blockchain technology such as transparency and auditability.\n\nAdditionally, Openchain allows different organizations to transact conceptually similar to how financial institutions currently conduct business. Essentially, several companies or institutions can set up mutual gateways through an API, connecting their Openchain ledgers.\n\nThis allows these organizations to create an account on the other Openchain, acting as a mutual liability. Once a transaction is validated by both parties, the accounts on both Openchain ledgers are adjusted simultaneously.\n\n“Openchain features a powerful hierarchical account system, a hybrid between a file system and a double-entry accounting system,” Charlon said. “This lets the administrator of an Openchain instance define their business rules, such as anti-money laundering and know your customer regulation, by setting various permissions on accounts, with different levels of granularity.”\n\nBecause the distributed permissioned ledger uses a simplified and trust-based consensus mechanism, it exceeds Bitcoin's capabilities on a technical level. While Bitcoin is currently limited to a handful of transactions per second, Openchain offers several orders of magnitude more transactions than that. On top of that, Openchain's transaction validation is virtually instant.\n\nMeanwhile, Openchain offers immutability by publishing “anchors” into the main Bitcoin blockchain at regular intervals. It can then benefit from the security and irreversibility of Bitcoin while keeping transaction costs to a minimum.\n\n“While proof of work is central to building a fully autonomous, decentralized currency such as Bitcoin, it actually becomes a burden when you start tokenizing assets,” Charlon explained. “With Openchain, we have taken all the key characteristics of a Blockchain like immutability, auditability and programmability, but removed the legacy of proof of work. This allowed us to build an extremely efficient and scalable platform with no compromise.”\n\nOpenchain open source and is now available on\n\nGitHub\n\nCoinprism offers a test wallet at\n\nwallet.openchain.org\n\nfor developers and curious users to start experimenting with it."", 'On Thursday, Kaye Scholer, the New York City-based law firm specializing in life sciences and financial services, held a seminar for many of its clients as an introduction to Bitcoin both as an asset as well as a technology.\n\nIntended as an introductory session, the seminar included topics talking about what virtual currency is, the federal and state regulations and financial opportunities associated with Bitcoin, among other topics.\n\nThe presenters were Evan L. Greebel, a partner at Kaye Scholer; Keith McGowan, a partner at BDO; Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder and president of Gemini; Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder and CEO of Gemini; and Peter Van Valkenburgh, Research Director at Coin Center. The event was moderated by Kathleen Moriarty, a partner at Kaye Scholer.\n\n“Kaye Scholer is a market leader in representing companies and entrepreneurs in the fintech space. Evan Greebel, Kathleen Moriarty and I joined that fintech team in July and are bringing our own Bitcoin and blockchain expertise to bear in New York, Silicon Valley and beyond,"" said Gregory Xethalis, counsel in the Corporate Division at Kaye Scholer, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. ""The event was an opportunity to introduce our practice, and Bitcoin itself, to Kaye Scholer clients who are in the process of learning what Bitcoin will mean for Wall Street, both as an asset class and a technology.”\n\nVan Valkenburgh explained in simple terms how the bitcoin blockchain works, including how the mining fee helps secure the network, and the risks that overregulation could have on the sector. The Winklevoss brothers touched on the long-term possibilities for Bitcoin both as a technology as well as an asset. Tyler Winklevoss explained how bitcoin could replace gold as a store of value because humanity may begin mining metals in space, where there is an oversupply of the same precious metals humans value for scarcity.\n\nOverall, there were 65 attendees at the event ranging from individuals at large financial institutions (some that have already been active in the space), private hedge and private equity fund advisers and fintech professionals.\n\nAnd while Kaye Scholer is the law team that has worked with the Winklevoss brothers on Gemini and the ETF, this was not an event to advertise Gemini.\n\n“While trading professionals certainly would have an interest, it wasn’t a Gemini pitch so much as a Bitcoin informational session,” explained Xethalis.\n\nThis event is the first in a two-part series. While this event focused on the Bitcoin blockchain, the firm is holding a second one to focus in on blockchain technology as a whole.\n\n“Tonight was intended to be an introduction to Bitcoin as an asset and technology,” Xethalis explained. “We are hosting a roundtable on November 5th that will include panelists from premier Wall Street companies that are exploring the blockchain and investors in blockchain-focused companies. That seminar will focus on the financial systems adoption of blockchain technologies for routine and complicated financial transactions.”\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business, and bitcoin. He runs a weekly digital currency and blockchain newsletter called Crypto Brief.', 'Beyond Bitcoin\n\nWhat was once thought to be only a Bitcoin innovation, now has the potential to shape new technology across the entire internet. In the coming years, we can expect to see other industries unleashing the potential of blockchain technology and Bitcoin sidechains, says George Basiladze.\n\n2015 has seen a growing interest in alternative applications for the blockchain technology which powers Bitcoin. The peer-to-peer distributed network can provide an incredibly efficient means of transmitting ownership data. Blockchain technology is likely to be the focus of a great deal of attention in the coming years, with significant focus being placed an alternative applications for the innovative technology. Sidechains are a promising concept, which despite being confusing, could provide an infrastructure which enables other industries to use blockchain technology, without clogging up the primary Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nOther companies are beginning to develop and use their own blockchain based software, which applies some aspect of the cryptocurrency technology, to wider problems. Most people will agree that the Bitcoin network can’t facilitate the sheer number of potential ideas and applications for blockchain technology that will emerge over the next few years. Sidechains can potentially function alongside the primary Bitcoin blockchain, wherein they’re essentially pegged to a certain address. This allows interesting connectivity and the development of an open platform between the existing world of Bitcoin and newer innovations.\n\nThe advantages of sidechaining\n\nBlockstream are one of the leading champions of sidechain technology, and provide a platform for developers to begin experimenting with the new possibilities presented by them. Pegged sidechains will enable the next generation of blockchain innovations, and are increasingly likely to make a dramatic impact on the way we use the internet. Decentralised forms of value transfer have significant advantages and sidechains could be utilised for everything from distributing shares to land registry.\n\nThe advantage offered by sidechains is they will be afforded a degree of independence from the slow, consensus based development of the Bitcoin network. As an example, the Bitcoin community has been struggling to decide on the future of block sizes for some time now, without reaching consensus. Even though almost all parties agree that a size increase is needed, the process of choosing an appropriate implementation for an improvement to the Bitcoin software is difficult and long-winded. Separate pegged sidechains would allow developers to create practical solutions to problems, without being limited by reaching a full Bitcoin community consensus for their ideas; they can simply develop specific software for their separate chain which functions alongside the main blockchain. A full breakdown of the concept of sidechains is available in the form of the BlockStream white paper. It is worth noting that Blockstream will need to submit a BIP, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, before any changes to the Bitcoin codebase can be made to implement sidechain functionality.\n\nBlockstream state that banks are one of the primary parties reportedly interested in using the platform. The company raised $21 million in Seed capital; there is certainly great potential for the sidechain concept. There are still potential issues which will have to be overcome before sidechains can actually exist on the main Bitcoin blockchain. Any proposed changes to the Bitcoin software will be subject to a great deal of scrutiny to ensure there is no possibility of negatively impacting the main blockchain. I/O Digital are working on a sidechain which functions as a decentralised identity system, and has a number of useful applications particularly for digital rights’ management. The mechanics of mining sidechains will be vital to protecting the integrity of the main blockchain, and as such will need to be figured out effectively. The success of Blockstream in introducing their innovation could result in a significant drop in the number of alternative networks, as attention moves to working with sidechain tokens.\n\nSEE ALSO: How companies are fighting Bitcoin ransomware\n\nEthereum is a smart contracts platform, which utilises a blockchain and programming framework. The project reportedly seeks to “decentralise the web” and has a number of potential applications, not solely tied to finance. It consists of it’s own separate blockchain and the project also has great potential to open up blockchain technology to more potential usage across many industries. Ripple has also received a lot of attention as an alternative value-transfer network, but it is not a truly decentralised system like Bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain technology will surely be utilised across many industries in the coming years. The possibilities are incredibly exciting and the next couple of years will likely see more great ideas come forward, and more VC interest, for what may well be a technology that is used everywhere across the internet of the future.', 'CZ, October 20, 2015 at 14:12 UTC\n\nAfter joining forces on a safer login back in August, Trezor and Cashila got together again - to deliver a great new feature that makes bitcoin to euro payments super easy.

Customers should do their own research before investing funds in any company.', ""A fund to invest in the world’s first ever Bitcoin mining company through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in Australia, which recently went live on the online investment platform BnkToTheFuture, has secured pledges amounting to almost US$3m (£1,933,609) - representing 82% of its target - to invest in Bitcoin mining company Bitcoin Group Limited.\n\nWith less than 24 hours to go in the fund raising, the ultimate goal is to reach a figure £2,342,804. All money backed in the pitch is final although investments will only be transacted in the IPO - if at least £1,969,192 is pledged by 21 October (05.18am GMT) - just after midnight New York time. That would require a further £35,583 being stumped up.\n\nBitcoin Group, founded in September 2014, is Australia’s biggest mining company founded in Melbourne after a five-year partnership between Sam Lee, CEO, and co-founders Allen Guo and Ryan Xu. It finally rounds off its IPO next month - at the third attempt. Still, they've got there.\n\nIt comes after the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), the financial regulator, put two stops on the firm’s original fund raising efforts. The second occasion was when the fundraising round was being promoted on We Chat, a Chinese social media platform, prior to the prospectus being lodged and approved.\n\nNow Bitcoin Group is scheduled to list shares in a A$20m (c.US$14.57m) public offer on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in Sydney on 11 November 2015, having secured approval from ASIC. It follows bitcoin start-up digitalBTC listing last year on the ASX via a reverse listing.\n\nWith operations in China, Iceland and Australia, the company is focused on becoming one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining companies and on creating a more convenient means by which the general public can manage and transfer money.\n\nCurrently it produces around 1.57% of the global mining output through its seven mining sites and in the period 2014-15, it mined around A$2m worth of the crypto-currency."", 'Developed in 2008 by Japanese hacker Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was the world’s first decentralised digital currency. Since then, it has garnered praise, criticism and everything in between for its ability to facilitate fast and low cost peer-to-peer transactions, while at the same time having a damaging association with criminal activities: over the past few years, scandals such as the Silk Road website have emerged, in which the cryptocurrency was used to purchase guns and drugs, and the disappearance of nearly £250m on the MtGox exchange in Japan.\n\nThese events translated to questions being raised about its credibility: however, after a forgettable 2014 (it lost over 60% in value against the dollar), Bitcoin was given a boost last month when nine of the largest investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, announced that they were backing a Blockchain initiative. Blockchain is the computer network on which Bitcoin sits, and operates a system whereby payment ledgers can instantly be updated without the need of a central authority. Major challenges remain: a power struggle has ensued this year between the five lead developers over whether the “blocks” in bitcoin transactions should be enlarged from their current 1 megabyte to enable more transactions per second, resulting in the creation of a rival group known as Bitcoin XT. However, last month’s news could propel Blockchain technology into the mainstream of finance over the next few years, and Bitcoin is poised to profit from this, arguably in emerging markets to the greatest extent.\n\nIn countries where financial infrastructure is limited, Bitcoin has the potential to provide a safe place to store capital and send money around the world without exchange rates and fees. Strict capital controls in countries such as Argentina have led to Bitcoin seeing a rapid uptake among small businesses, with many incentivised by high inflation eroding the value of the Peso. Even today, only half of the country’s population entrust their savings with the nation’s banks, and with no end to the economic stagnation in sight, there is a significant opportunity to expand its user base. Indeed, Mongolia, with a population of less than 3 million people, has four times more Bitcoin users than the United States.\n\nDeveloping countries could thus, to some degree, circumvent credit and debit card usage and make the move straight to digital currencies. Mobile payment services are an excellent example of the way in which developing countries have adapted technology in the absence of central structures: M-Pesa, the market leader in this area, has had such a important impact on the Kenyan economy that it can cause inflation to rise or fall. Brad Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, an early-stage investment fund, believes African consumers are\n\n“Essentially skipping traditional banks…[with the funds]…going straight to the bank in your pocket in a decentralised, non-bank way.”\n\nA 2014 survey by mobile payment Jana found 74% of Kenyans would invest in digital currency, highlighting the country’s credentials as a leading market for Bitcoin to grow.\n\nWhile the transfer of bitcoins has been restricted in China, this has not deterred the creation of a dedicated exchange, BTCC. The Shanghai-based exchange estimated last year that up to 70% of Bitcoin trades could be attributed to yuan users (i.e. the Chinese market). This is an astounding proportion, but should the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) move to ban Bitcoin, this would be severely detrimental for its global presence. Following this summer’s stock market volatility, the government could look to point the finger at what it considers to be destabilising influences, and, given that Bitcoin is something of an unknown quantity, it would seem to fit the bill.\n\nEmerging markets are an excellent frontier for Bitcoin to establish itself as a safe and legitimate currency. They have entered some markets with varying success, but will want to avoid becoming the payment method of choice for criminals in these countries, while maintaining the currency’s decentralised characteristics. Ultimately, in the future, it could mitigate economic crises faced by the likes of Zimbabwe, where hyper-inflation has been the product of corruption and irresponsible behaviour by its central bank. Bitcoin is unlikely to be adopted as the primary currency of a country any time soon, but it could become a viable alternative for many, particularly in the developing world.', 'The Spanish Tax Authority has probed at least one bitcoin-friendly business in the country for information on the way it handles payments received in the digital currency.\n\nLa Agencia Tributaria Española sent an information request to Madrid-based, bitcoin-accepting law firm Abanlex, asking it to provide its bitcoin-related accounts. Abanlex received the request on 8th October and published it online.\n\nA loosely translated version reads:\n\n""[We request] to know whether your business accepts bitcoin as a payment method for services offered or goods delivered. If so, we request to know the volume of bitcoin payments received to date as well as information and accounting documents for all bitcoin activity.""\n\nIt continues: ""We also request information about the exchange of bitcoin into euro and vice-versa; including the exchange platform used, timings of the exchange and, in particular, information about your bitcoin wallet, if you have one, or if you automatically exchange bitcoin into euros upon receipt.""\n\nThe request outlined that the bitcoin accepting business should reply within 10 working days, noting that failure to do so would result in further investigations and possible sanctions.\n\nIn his response to the agency\'s request, Pablo Fernández Burgueño, partner at Abanlex, said the firm had not yet received any payments in bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlthough they declined to comment on specifics, a spokesperson for the Spanish Tax Authority said they hoped to find out more about bitcoin to determine whether it could be used for illicit purposes.\n\nNo surprise\n\nA spokesperson for Spanish travel agency Destinia – which integrated bitcoin payments in early 2014 – said they had not received an information request.\n\nThe spokesperson added: ""Information requests are part of the Agencia Tributaria\'s normal procedure, they are issued for various different reasons. It is an understandable exercise within the Agency\'s framework and should not come as a surprise.""\n\nA. Gómez de la Cruz, lawyer at Law and Bitcoin noted that the questions put forward by the agency evidenced its ""perfect"" understanding of bitcoin and the digital currency\'s inner workings.\n\nThe information probe comes after the Spanish Tax Office clarified earlier this year that bitcoin was exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in the country.\n\nThe European Court of Justice is expected to decide this Thursday whether bitcoin exchanges in the continent will be required to pay VAT on trades.\n\nSpanish flag image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Remember back in January, for example, when crude oil had fallen through $55 and was the news of the day? Two opposing camps emerged. On the one hand you had the likes of T. Boone Pickens predicting a return to $100/barrel before the end of the year, and on the other some analysts (I remember one in particular from Citibank) predicting $15/barrel in the same time frame. Of course, neither has been right so far, nor do they look likely to be. The simple fact is that saying that oil or anything else will probably trade a little lower or a little higher in the near future may be accurate but it is not sexy; it doesn’t get page views or get you on T.V. Predicting vicious but unlikely moves, however, do.\n\nThat thought came to mind this week when I read this Zero Hedge article by author Tyler Durden. Zero Hedge, by their nature like to be controversial, so the prediction that we should “...sit back and watch as we witness the second coming of the bitcoin bubble, one which could make the previous all time highs in the currency seem like a low print” is not entirely out of character. In addition, those of us that hold bitcoin as a long term inflation hedge would love to see it come true. It is, however, most likely to be entirely wrong.\n\nThe logic behind the piece, that there is a huge pool of Chinese money that is poised to seek refuge from capital controls, is in many ways sound. Indeed that could well be in part responsible for the recent increase in BTC/USD to around $270 from the lows around $200. It could even drive further gains in the future to some extent, but to talk of a quick return to $1100 and beyond is just not realistic.\n\nFirst, if that were going to happen, it would be reasonable to expect more of a move than we have so far seen. Yes, interest and presumably buying from China has increased since the controls were announced and that has helped, but the recent move needs a little perspective. The lows from which BTC/USD has recovered were just a short time ago and the evidence suggests that it was that move down, not the subsequent recovery that was the aberration.\n\nWe are hardly at new highs, after all. Prior to last week BTC/USD last traded above $270 just 2 months ago, on August 11th. What we are witnessing now is a retracement of the decline that came shortly after that, not a surge caused by panic buying in China. I guess, in theory at least, that could come, but the 3-month chart indicates a gradual retracement following a sharp drop, mot the other way around.\n\nAlso, in the light of other news this week, if this is Chinese money on the run (or after looking at that chart on a gentle stroll out of the country), the surge looks doomed before it really gets underway.\n\nThe linked to article at Cryptocoin News is about a recent report from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) that acknowledges Bitcoin as a force to be reckoned with. In some ways, that can be seen as a positive for Bitcoin and for cryptos in general. I mean, nobody wants to be ignored, right, and I have made the point in the past that some degree of government regulation is inevitable and, if applied with a light touch, may even be necessary if Bitcoin is to fulfill its potential.\n\nThe problem is that the Chinese government is not renowned for its subtlety. If they regard Bitcoin as a force to be reckoned with then there is a good chance that they will try once again to regulate it out of existence, or at least out of The People’s Republic. I suspect that most Chinese investors who might try to move money away from capital controls would feel the same. History and the nature of the internet suggest that in the long run the government will fail, but the fact that the report from the CAC came out on October 13th would suggest that those who see bitcoin as an escape route would have already acted now that the government is taking notice.\n\nI, like anybody who sees the potential of Bitcoin, would love to see some more price appreciation in the near future, but the last thing that the currency needs is another bubble followed by another bust. That could prove fatal to the still young and somewhat fragile idea. Fortunately, despite the predictions of some though, that looks unlikely.', 'Multinational professional services firm Deloitte has questioned whether it is too soon to try and regulate bitcoin.\n\nIn a publication titled Bitcoin at the Crossroads – which notes the advantages of both bitcoin and blockchain technology – Deloitte explores whether regulating digital currency could potentially have a negative impact on its future development and potential to reach mass adoption.\n\nIt adds:\n\n""In most respects, while policy makers and regulators are acting in accordance with their mission statement to protect the public and the integrity of the financial markets, an important question comes to the fore – is it too soon to try and regulate bitcoin?""\n\nThere is, according to the publication, strong historical evidence which suggests that allowing new technologies to develop without interference is initially the best course of action.\n\n\'A drop of water in the ocean\'\n\nThe publication notes there are three reasons why global policy makers should refrain from regulating bitcoin during its nascent stage.\n\nFirstly, bitcoin\'s market penetration is still small compared to traditional fiat currency systems and transaction platforms:\n\n""Bitcoin is receiving a remarkable amount of attention and scrutiny from policy makers and regulators all around the world – far beyond what its current scale and market impact would seem to justify. In fact, by any relevant benchmark, the value currently at risk with bitcoin is just a drop of water in the ocean that is the financial industry.""\n\nThe publication then goes on to say that ""we could be cycles away from real products that can generate true demand for bitcoin related services from mainstream consumers"".\n\nImpact on mass adoption\n\nAdditionally, the authors say other transformative technologies were given more time to develop before they came under regulatory scrutiny.\n\nCiting the telephone (invented in 1876 and regulated in 1913); airplanes (invented in 1093 and regulated in 1938) and the Internet (invented in 1969 which has come under increased regulatory focus in recent times) as previous examples, it adds:\n\n""The open-source platform that is bitcoin was first released in 2009. We are a mere six years into the development of bitcoin and a long way away from the time it has typically taken for new technologies to achieve mass adoption in the past.""\n\nExploring its potential\n\nFinally, the authors note bitcoin has not yet found its most valuable application.\n\n""While the list of potential use cases for bitcoin and blockchain technology is expanding every day,"" the publication says ""it is still in its early days and some of the emerging use cases are tremendously exciting.""\n\nAcknowledging the challenge that bitcoin poses for regulators, and its potential to disrupt both the financial services and technology industries, the publication concludes there is a case for industry groups, policy makers and regulators to collaborate at a national level.\n\nBusinessman image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Employers need to make sure candidates actually graduated from the institutions that are mentioned on their resume.\n\n""Lying about education credentials is a common problem, and today it is very easy to counterfeit academic diplomas and certificates,"" said Blake Haggerty, recruiter at CoreOS. ""In addition, the process to check someone\'s degree is quite laborious, as you need to get the school\'s contact information, reach the right person and do it again for every candidate. Medium and big companies often delegate this task to third parties as it\'s very time and money consuming.""\n\nHolberton School and Bitproof are simplifying this verification process, and adding a new layer of security by using the blockchain.\n\n""The blockchain is well known for storing bitcoins transactions because it\'s a decentralized, authenticated and hardened against tampering storage systems,"" said Louison Dumont, blockchain expert and founder of Bitproof. ""Naturally, it also makes a perfect place to store academic certificates.""\n\nBy having students\' certificates available in a public blockchain, Holberton School makes it easier for employers to check if a candidate is truly a graduate from the school. Using any free blockchain explorer available online, such as Merkle, employers can get the answer in seconds.\n\n""The blockchain is the future of certification, and we believe that in the following years, more schools will use the public blockchain to secure their certificates and diplomas,"" said Sylvain Kalache, co-founder of Holberton School. ""It is much more efficient, secure, and simple than what you can find today in the industry. We think first about our students -- we want to make sure that our certificates will always remain valid and verifiable by employers. It will also keep them safe and impossible to copy or hack.""\n\nRead more about the announcement\n\n- Holberton School blog post\n\n- Bitproof blog post\n\nAbout Bitproof\n\nBitproof is an online blockchain notary recognized by the Bitcoin community to be one of the most user friendly use case of the technology. Bitproof delivers cryptographic timestamped proofs of integrity using the blockchain technology. The generated certificates can then be accessed through any blockchain explorer. The blockchain certification process is more efficient, cheaper, faster and safer than the normal offline process: inserting a new entry in the blockchain only costs a few cents and takes a few milliseconds, moreover, the content\'s privacy is protected using strong cryptographic functions (hashes and asymmetric encryption).\n\nRead more about Bitproof:\n\n- Bitproof website\n\n- Merkle, the free online blockchain explorer, by Bitproof\n\n- Follow Bitproof on Twitter\n\nAbout Holberton School\n\nHolberton School is a project-based alternative to college for the next generation of software engineers. Using project-based learning and peer learning, Holberton School\'s mission is to train the best software engineers of their generation. At Holberton School, there are no formal teachers and no formal courses. Instead, everything is project-centered. The school gives students increasingly difficult programming challenges to solve, and give them minimal initial directions on how to solve them. As a consequence, students naturally look for the theory and tools they need, understand them, use them, work together, and help each other.\n\nRead more about Holberton School:\n\n- Holberton School website\n\n- Holberton School blog\n\n- Facebook page\n\n- Follow Holberton School on Twitter', ""This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.\n\n... this is the Gartner hype cycle ... trade ... free famous charge ... he will tell you for instance ... the growth and in the inner Dan rank in the beginning we have ... a ninety six Internet technologies like oh my God Internet and everybody gets excited and then ruin it's not growing as fast in one or many it's not accept the mark ... when ... people figure out maybe there's something to this technology ... and comes back ... now I wanna bring up the second chart shows you ... bitcoin's price ... and ... quality were saying that ... for some similarities here ... yes I think a ... big decline isn't one of ... only ... several apartheid cycles continued ... interest in human earlier ... boom in Boston and you know people for Office dad and ...

The chart view irons out some of the noise evident in the heavily manipulated bitcoin chart.\n\nThe wave structure for 2015 is clear and conforms to Elliott wave principle in a manner that is a relief since the bitcoin chart is often so distorted that it would be reasonale to assume Elliott wave does not apply to it. In the context of the LTC chart, a useful perspective is gained.\n\nLitecoin formed an ABC structure to the July top. It counts out perfectly and exhibits the “extended fifth wave” that characterizes commodity charts. In stock charts the longest wave is typically wave 3 since that is where the herd piles in. Because fear tends to drive commodities, the urge to join trend increases with each new wave to the upside, and the herd piles in during wave 5 causing it to surge. Even the fifth subwave of wave 5 becomes extended as the market “blows out” to the upside.\n\nTwo wave counts are labeled. The black count is prefered and the red count is “alt”. By implication, the current bitcoin wave B is ridiculously exaggerated to the upside and is bound to correct to support.\n\nThat cotton trade was almost the deal breaker for me. It was at that point that I said, ‘Mr. Stupid, why risk everything on one trade? Why not make your life a pursuit of happiness rather than pain?’ – Paul Tudor Jones\n\nSummary\n\nWhichever way the Litecoin chart heads in, the prospects in the bitcoin chart have improved and our concept of what scenarios are probable has come a long way from the beginning of 2015 when we did not know if it was up, down, sideways or what.\n\nA big exchange boss recently declared most of the exchanges’ volume as bogus. Perhaps he’d like to file such a statement to his banking bosses before TPP obliges him to?\n\nLet’s keep an eye on Litecoin – its correlation to the Bitcoin chart may decouple in the future, but for now it is a useful guide.\n\nBitfinex orderbook depth and Buy/Sell Volume:\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

The attackers were clever, creating an exact clone of the original Electrum Twitter, but using an “I” (uppercase) instead of a lowercase “l.” On first glance, it’s hard to tell the difference.\n\nFor reference, Electrum is a popular lightweight bitcoin wallet for desktop and mobile which operates similar to SPV wallets. It communicates with a trusted server rather than downloading the entire block chain. One common criticism of it is that the Electrum server can log information about the clients.\n\nInterestingly, the phishers decided not to create a whole website around this concept, and have tweeted legitimate information about Electrum. But in one case, as ZoidbergCoin reported, they were most definitely phishing:\n\nElectrum users are encouraged to be keen on the difference between the two accounts. The false one has less than 1,500 followers and only a few tweets. The other has more than 2,000 users and, after all, is spelled properly.\n\nAlso read: Electrum Execoin Stealth Wallet Review\n\nHad ZoidbergCoin not discovered this potential scam artist, it’s unclear how far they could have gotten with this before anyone had noticed. The public nature of Twitter’s platform means that the attackers could easily go down the list of people who follow the real ElectrumWallet account, which basically serves as a target list. One by one they could phish, and only one hit would equal free money.\n\nBut the scam could have gone much more legitimate, as well. They could have registered eIectrum.org, which looks like electrum.org in most fonts. They could have then distributed malware-infected versions of the lightweight client. As you can see, it quickly gets much more serious than mere Twitter trolling.\n\nIn other Electrum news, they did, indeed, release version 2.5.1 recently. Additionally, their documentation has moved to ReadTheDocs.org last month after a hack of Orain.org. It is unclear if this hack is related to the current attempts on Electrum users.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Founded by ex-Microsoft software engineer Flavien Charlon, Coinprism is a company that has been extending the capabilities of Bitcoin\'s Blockchain. A technology called “colored coins” makes the blockchain a ledger that can record more than simple payments.\n\nCoinprism developed the main colored coins standard, Open Assets, which attaches a limitless variety of asset types to normal bitcoin transactions, through additional metadata. The open source system is now used by companies such as NASDAQ, Overstock and First Data.\n\n- Coinprism\n\nWhat was a surprise to the company was Overstock\'s first use of the protocol, which anyone is free to use. “We can see the bonds have been issued on June 8, and that a recent transaction (July 30), which corresponds to one of their latest announcements, has sold 500,000 units of it ($5M),” stated Coinprism when they discovered the transaction.\n\nCoinprism.info is the main block explorer for colored coins. Whenever a transaction is committed to the Blockchain, Coinprism detects if it’s a colored coin transaction. Bitcoin is a public ledger after all, and everything that happens on the Blockchain is public.\n\nCoinsprisms block explorer will also extract the metadata related to the asset, even if an asset was created completely outside of Coinprism and its asset metadata is hosted on a third party website, “we can index it, thanks to the transparency of the Blockchain.”\n\n- Coinprism\n\nThis transparency isn’t to everyone\'s liking, although the cost savings associated with blockchain technology certainly are. A Japanese company, Mijin, recently announced plans to offer private blockchain technology solutions to financial institutions, reducing their infrastructure costs by up to 1000% by 2018. “Within a single company or between partners, a permissioned blockchain is often desired, not only to realize zero downtime, but also to improve security and performance, at low cost,” stated the projects press release.\n\nFinancial institutions are certainly showing an interest in the technology. A consortium of banks including Barclay’s, UBS and J.P. Morgan, recently joined forces to investigate possible applications, coordinated by Wall Street-based R3 CEV. “This partnership signals a significant commitment by the banks to collaboratively evaluate and apply this emerging technology to the global financial system,"" said David Rutter, R3 CEV CEO.\n\n- David Rutter, R3 CEV CEO\n\nCoinprism\'s latest open source offering is Openchain, an entirely new distributed ledger protocol that anyone can implement. “Unlike Bitcoin, which is based on a central, unique distributed ledger, the concept behind Openchain is that each company and institution can deploy their own instance of Openchain, which then can interconnect to each other,” states the company.\n\nUnlike Open Assets, Openchain has been designed specifically with financial institutions in mind. Flavien Charlon, CEO and Founder of Coinprism, explained how tricky that design phase was. “We had to decide in which direction we would go. Should we just implement lightning networks for colored coins? Should we build a new system forked from Bitcoin or Ethereum? Should it use proof-of-stake or authorized miners? Or should we just build it from scratch?”\n\nThe decision was made to build Openchain from scratch, which gave Coinprism the opportunity to focus on some of the issues faced by Bitcoin. “An example of that is transaction malleability. After seeing all the problems that malleability caused with Bitcoin, making sure our system was immune to it was high on the list,” said Charlon. Another issue is the structure of the blockchain itself.\n\n“Blocks introduce a delay,” Charlon explained. Focusing on financial systems means taking into consideration the millions of regulated transactions taking place on a daily basis. Bitcoin’s blockchain is limited to ~7 transactions per second, and can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to confirm.\n\n- Flavien Charlon, Coinprism CEO\n\nThis doesn\'t mean that the benefits of Bitcoin are being discounted, Openchain uses the immutability of Bitcoin by publishing ‘anchors’ into the blockchain. “ [Openchain] can then benefit from the security and irreversibility of Bitcoin while keeping transaction costs to a minimum.”\n\n- Charlon\n\nAn exclusive feature to Openchain is a hierarchical account system, which is a hybrid between a file system and a double-entry accounting system. ""This lets the administrator of an Openchain instance define their business rules (such as AML/KYC) by setting various permissions on accounts, with different levels of granularity,” states Coinprism\n\n- Charlon\n\nWhile Openchain can work independently from any other system, it is also possible to use smart contracts to create a two-way peg with a Blockchain such as Bitcoin, effectively turning it into a federated sidechain compatible with Bitcoin and the Open Assets protocol, a situation that may well give the protocol an advantage over any other.', 'The lead undercover DEA agent in the investigation of Silk Road has been sentenced to six years in prison for stashing away hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal bitcoin payments, reports the Los Angeles Times.\n\nTo recap: Agent Carl M. Force established communication with Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road, as part of a Drug Enforcement Agency investigation into the anonymous Dark Web drug marketplace:\n\nAs “French Maid,” and a second pseudonym, “Nob,” which was known to the DEA, Force persuaded Ulbricht to pay him in bitcoins for information about a fictional corrupt government employee. But instead of revealing these payments to the DEA to help build a case, Force converted the bitcoins to cash and then secretly deposited the proceeds in personal bank accounts.\n\nUlbricht must have been all of the following: rolling in cash; breathtakingly corrupt; and just wonderfully fucking inept in the field of hiring out criminal conspirators. You will recall, this is the same guy who pissed away hundreds of thousands of dollars on so-called “hitmen” he met via Silk Road in paid (and failed, and hoaxed) assassination plots. Guy was all about firing off bitcoins to anonymous strangers for nefarious purposes. The trusting type.\n\nForce, for his part, had gotten a taste of that sweet, sweet flow of untraceable currency and wasn’t about to go back to the square life:\n\nForce later illegally used his role in a bitcoin currency exchange company to seize a client’s account and steal the bitcoins. When federal investigators began closing in on Force, he lied and obstructed their investigation into him and Ulbricht, prosecutors said.\n\nForce was charged back in March with an array of felony charges, including money laundering and wire fraud. The criminal complaint details how he used “a series of complex transactions” to launder and conceal “ill-gotten proceeds,” including a $235,000 transaction routed through a bank in Panama. As “de facto Chief Compliance Officer” for CoinMKT, Force stole and routed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins into his personal accounts.\n\nHe was sentenced to more than six years in prison and ordered to pay $340,000 in restitution. Force made it to sentencing just before Former Secret Service agent Shaun W. Bridges, who was convicted of stealing 20,000 bitcoins and liquidating them into $820,000 through a Japanese currency exchange, also during the Silk Road investigation. The Los Angeles Times reports Bridges is scheduled for sentencing in December.\n\n[Los Angeles Times]\n\nPhoto via AP']"

Force admitted to charges of extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice. Bridges, separately, reached a plea agreement with prosecutors.\n\nDuring the investigation, Force posed as an online drug dealer named “Nob,” sweet-talking Silk Road founder Ross Ulricht into paying him $50,000 in bitcoin by pretending to have knowledge of the raid, the report said. Force then falsely told the DEA that he received no payment after the discussion. Force went on and used another pseudonym, “French Maid,” on the site, offering information to Ulricht on the investigation in exchange for another $98,000 worth of bitcoin, Reuters reported.\n\nForce apologized and received 78 months in prison, less than the 87 months sought by prosecutors. All bitcoin that were seized in the Silk Road raid were eventually put up for public auctions.\n\nFor more Fortune tech coverage, watch this video:', 'In 2012, two servers run by the U.S. Navy rolled back their clocks 12 years, deciding it was the year 2000.\n\nThe servers were very important: they’re part of a worldwide network that helps computers keep the right time using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).\n\nComputers that checked in with the Navy’s servers and adjusted their clocks accordingly had a variety of problems with their phones systems, routers and authentication systems.\n\nThe incident underscored the serious problems that can occur when using NTP, one of the oldest Internet protocols published in 1985.\n\nThe protocol is fairly robust, but researchers from Boston University said on Wednesday they’ve found several flaws in NTP that could undermine encrypted communications and even jam up bitcoin transactions.\n\nOne of the problems they found is that it’s possible for an attacker to cause an organization’s servers to stopping checking the time altogether.\n\nNTP has a rate-limiting mechanism, nicknamed the “Kiss O’ Death” packet, that will stop a computer from repeatedly querying the time in case of a technical problem. When that packet is sent, systems may stop querying the time for days or years, according to a summary of the research.\n\nThey found a big issue: it’s possible for an attacker to spoof a Kiss O’Death packet, making it appear to have come from a system experiencing trouble when it’s actually fine.\n\nThe researchers didn’t discover the Kiss O’Death packet by hunting through code, said Sharon Goldberg, an associate professor at Boston University’s computer science department.\n\n“We discovered the KOD vulnerability by just reading the specifications of the [NTP] protocol,” she said in a phone interview on Wednesday. “We just saw this packet, and we were like ‘Really? What can you do with this thing’?”\n\nWith just one computer, the researchers suspect such a spoofing attack could be conducted on a large scale across NTP clients found using network scanners such as nmap and zmap.\n\nThe spoofing is possible in part because most NTP servers don’t use encryption when talking to their clients.\n\nThe connections are unencrypted because NTP doesn’t have a key exchange protocol as refined as SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security), Goldberg said. The encryption keys have to manually programmed into NTP devices, which most organizations don’t bother to do, she said.\n\nWhen a computer’s clock goes out of sync, it can have wide-ranging effects.\n\nIf a computer’s clock is rolled back, it could mean an expired SSL/TLS certificate could be accepted as valid for which the attacker has the decryption key, according to their technical paper.\n\nWith the virtual currency bitcoin, an inaccurate clock could cause the bitcoin client software to reject what is a legitimate transaction, wasting computational time, they wrote.\n\nTwo other flaws were also found. In a type of denial-of-service attack, an attacker could spoof Kiss O’Death packets to look like they’re coming from an NTP client. The time server then tries to slow down those queries, sending a response that causes the NTP client to stop updating its clock.\n\nThe third flaw could allow an attacker who interfering with unencrypted NTP traffic to shift a computer’s clock forward or backwards on reboot.\n\nSoftware fixes for the problems are available now, as the researchers privately disclosed their findings in August to the Network Time Foundation, and vendors including Red Hat and Cisco, which have patched their NTP implementations.\n\nThe latest version of NTP released on Tuesday is ntp-4.2.8p4, and administrators are advised to patch as soon as possible.\n\nGoldberg said because NTP is viewed as robust, it hardly gets much attention these days. Their research showed that one of the most widely used versions of NPT is 4.1.1, which is more than a decade old.\n\n“What that means is you’ve have these old clients, just sitting there,” she said.\n\nThe research paper was co-authored by Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen and Erik Brakke, all of Boston University.', 'Holberton Software Engineering School announced it will become the first school to deliver academic certificates that are secured and accessible via Bitcoin’s blockchain. To this end, the school has collaborated with Bitcoin startup Bitproof that specializes in document certification on the blockchain.\n\nThe new blockchain-powered certificates should make it easier for employers to verify job candidates’ backgrounds and reduce the number of false resumes.\n\nAccording to the information in Holberton school blog, each graduate will be given a paper certificate and a Digital Certificate Number (DCN). Graduates can include this number in their CV. Thus, the employer can easily verify this information just by checking this number in the blockchain explorer available online.\n\nSylvain Kalache, co-founder of Holberton School, stated:\n\n""The blockchain is the future of certification, and we believe that in the following years, more schools will use the public blockchain to secure their certificates and diplomas.""\n\nHolberton School is a project-based alternative to college for the next generation of software engineers, which uses peer learning.\n\n""It is much more efficient, secure, and simple than what you can find today in the industry,” Kalache continued. “We think first about our students – we want to make sure that our certificates will always remain valid and verifiable by employers. It will also keep them safe and impossible to copy or hack.""\n\nWhile this is the first school to implement the blockchain for academic certificates, the idea of using this public ledger to record and register various aspects of our lives is becoming increasingly common.\n\nToday, everything from marriage, citizenship, artwork, and land registry, to even a World Passport can be transparently recorded on the blockchain as new uses are still being discovered. Moreover, the Refugee Emergency Response project from Bitnation is currently using the blockchain to help resolve the current refugee crisis in Europe by registering undocumented individuals on the blockchain.', 'Since its inception in 2011, the Bitcoin development mailing list has been unmoderated. Anyone could join it and start posting to it. For most of its existence, the list was a mostly technical forum, devoted strictly to Bitcoin and the cryptography underpinning it, including bug discussions and proposals from the public.\n\nMore recently, the list has become a hotbed of heated debate between proponents and opponents of immediate block size increasing. The debates have at times felt very much like the debates on raising the debt ceiling in US politics: divided parties repeating the same arguments, leading up to a schism in the form of Bitcoin-XT. CCN’s own Venzen Khaosan recently posted a message to the list which was deemed by Peter Todd to be very off-topic. Arguably, it was.\n\nIn the wake of all this argument and “noise,” Jeff Garzik posted a message last week which outlined a moderation policy proposal.\n\nThis mailing list, bitcoin-dev, aim [sic] to facilitate constructive discussion of issues related to technical development of the bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin Core reference implementation. We can achieve this, in part, by behaving well towards each other, so that the broadest diversity of participants – both amateur and professional, new and experienced – feel that the lists are welcoming and useful.\n\nSeven days after that, yesterday at some point, the moderation policy was put into effect. It is not like most mailing list moderation policies, which simply have a few people entrusted with overseeing the list giving a pass or fail to every message that comes into them.\n\nAlso read: Dunvegan Space System’s Garzik: Public Block Chains Will Drive Future Fintech Along With Space Exploration\n\nRather, users who post meaningful content will earn their place on a white list of sorts, being granted automatic posting privileges after proving themselves. Moreover, rejected messages will go to a separate list, thereby still being public and received by those who choose to subscribe to the alternate list. It’s important to note that this is a very liberal policy as moderation policies go. This might be credited to the versatility of the Mailman software, which allows one to white list users with relative ease.\n\nRusty Russell posted the notification to the list yesterday, saying:\n\nEveryone starts moderated, and the mod bit gets cleared as they post. It gets set again if someone notices or reports a violation.\n\nThe moderators have all been on the list for quite some time, and are well known and trusted members of the community. The new policy does not come off as an attempt to stifle vibrant discussion, but rather to differentiate between philosophical and technical discussions.\n\nThree months from now the policy will be reviewed by the entire list, in an unmoderated discussion. Again, this is unusual among moderation policies. The whole episode exhibits the philosophical underpinnings of the cryptocurrency movement, which are those of people who are, to say the list, not friendly to any form of censorship, preferring a chaotic exchange of ideas to carefully guarded, politically correct discourse.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A recent report by the Deloitte Center for Regulatory Strategies, entitled “Bitcoin at the crossroads,” explores why regulators should consider delaying bitcoin regulation. After going into great depth, exploring both sides of the argument, Deloitte proposes giving the digital currency ""more time to develop.""\n\nDeloitte is the largest of the global ""Big Four"" professional services firms, by the number of professionals, and the second largest in the world by revenue. As such, reports like this one are often read by decision makers at many of the top companies around the globe. This report, specifically aimed at regulators, is part of the company\'s effort to help clarify the challenges with the fledgling digital currency industry.\n\n- Deloitte\n\nThe report outlines why it is premature to regulate bitcoin, claiming that tight regulations at this time could hinder the growth of the bitcoin market, while drawing parallels to earlier examples of the internet and eCommerce.\n\nThe author presented the argument that the market may provide the best indication of how and when to regulate bitcoin. If bitcoin succeeds and reaches mainstream adoption, then regulators would have more information about how to do their job effectively, otherwise bitcoin would simply disappear, and therefore, attempts to regulate bitcoin at this stage could yield adverse effects.\n\n- Deloitte\n\nThe report also cited that the bitcoin market is still very small, with a $4 billion global value, which is about 0.3% of the ~$1.36 trillion US currency physically in circulation. Bitcoin\'s daily dollar transaction volume, which peaked in February, was around $57 million, or less than 1 percent of its credit card company counterparts, as measured in 2012.\n\n- Deloitte\n\nMainstream adoption is a key point in the report, which claims that “individuals who have used Bitcoin are very early adopters.” According to the Technology Adoption Lifecycle, early adoption is one of the first stages. “We could be cycles away from real products that can generate true demand for Bitcoin related services from mainstream consumers,” stated the report.\n\nPast regulatory efforts, applied to other disruptive innovations, only happened after mass adoption was reached. “Bitcoin is a long way away from the time it has typically taken for new technologies to achieve mass adoption in the past,” states the report.\n\nSome examples in the report include the telephone, which was unregulated for 37 years. It was 35 years for airlines, 20 years for the radio, 24 years for mobile phones, and about 46 years for the Internet. By contrast, it has only been seven years since bitcoin was first introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThere have been many discussions about when Bitcoin will reach mainstream adoption. The World Economic Forum survey expects bitcoin to reach mainstream adoption in the year 2027. Gartner\'s Hype Cycle for emerging technologies places bitcoin mass adoption in five to ten years time. Following the argument that majority adoption is years away, the implication is clear, it’s too soon to regulate bitcoin.\n\n- Max Hoblitzell, Deloitte Consulting Senior Consultant\n\nPerhaps the most persuasive reason why it would be premature for regulators to focus on bitcoin revolves around the unrealized final form that bitcoin and blockchain technology will take. The report cited a rising number of potential use cases for bitcoin, which are getting increasingly impressive, and anticipates applications that may influence the future in a variety of ways.\n\n- Deloitte\n\nThere is simply no way to know what Bitcoin will look like, and what it will be doing, by the time it matures, the report reasons. While further making this case, Deloitte compared bitcoin to eCommerce, which was also controversial in its infancy, and prohibited for some time.\n\nSimilar to bitcoin today, venture capital investment and startups were heavily invested in the technology behind eCommerce, well before mainstream adoption could occur. The technology had been around for almost 20 years before the National Science Foundation lifted its ban on commercial traffic over the internet, in 1991.\n\n- Al Gore\n\neCommerce only took off with the introduction of the High-Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991, as well as efforts from Congress to remove regulatory constraints, allowing heavy investments in the internet technology.\n\n- Deloitte\n\nDeloitte is not alone making the case that it is too early to regulate bitcoin. In Europe, the Commonwealth recognizes the potential of bitcoin and blockchain, and set up a “Digital Currency Working Group” to investigate regulating the digital currency, before any regulations are adopted.\n\nIn the recent central bank governors\' meeting, digital currencies were discussed, but the consensus was to wait for more information before applying any regulation. In the UK, where the government is notably pro-bitcoin, £10 million has been earmarked for investment into digital currency research, to find out the impact of regulating the digital currency before the government passes any laws.\n\nWhen regulations are imposed without ensuring the right environment, companies that cannot comply are likely to leave, as demonstrated by the mass exodus of companies leaving New York following the approval of the BitLicense.\n\nHowever, regulators may make the case that they should be trying to regulate bitcoin early, because unusual challenges exist in trying to regulate bitcoin, which was created to be unregulated.\n\n- Deloitte\n\nMany people, both inside and outside of the bitcoin arena, agree that government intervention is sometimes not necessary. This sentiment includes government officials themselves, like presidential hopeful U.S. Senator Rand Paul: “As information becomes more widespread, maybe you need less and less government.”', 'A study by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm shows that Sweden is on track to become the world’s first cashless country. Today, five of six major banks in Sweden are already refusing to operate with cash. As a result, and considering the latest Tax Authority guidelines, Bitcoin has the potential to become a commonly used currency in Sweden.\n\nFully digital\n\nPeople are becoming increasingly accustomed to using bank cards to pay even for the smallest purchases in Sweden with four out of five purchases made electronically. Now, with the increasing penetration of mobile and P2P payment systems, the necessity to use cash is quickly becoming obsolete.\n\nNiklas Arvidsson, a researcher in industrial economics and management at KTH, stated:\n\n""Cash is still an important means of payment in many countries\' markets, but that no longer applies here in Sweden.""\n\nMoreover, the recent launch of mobile payment app Swish from several major Swedish and Danish banks is already revolutionizing the local banking system, says Arvidsson. As a result, several major banks are refusing to accept cash at all.\n\nAccording to Arvidsson, there are less than 80 billion Swedish crowns in circulation (about EUR8 billion) and out of that amount, only somewhere between 40 and 60 percent is actually in regular circulation. To compare, there was around SEK106 billion in circulation only 6 years ago.\n\n“We’re leading the world in cashless trading,” explains Bengt Nilervall from the Swedish Federation of Trade in an interview with The Guardian. “It’s safer this way and it saves us money, as handling money and transporting cash is costly. The Payment Card Industry [PCI] has taken many security measures to ensure that people are safe and we have good protection in place, so Swedes feel confident paying electronically.”\n\nBitcoin & Sweden\n\nConsidering the confidence displayed by the Swedes in electronic payments, bitcoin also has an opportunity to become a commonly used currency in Sweden, especially considering today’s ruling that Bitcoin exchange is exempt from VAT across Europe.\n\nBack in May 2015, the country’s Tax Authority also published guidelines for Income Tax on bitcoin mining operations. This type of income would only be considered as economic activity, and thus subject to tax, if the miner “carries out the mining in a professional and cost efficient manner over a longer period with appropriate equipment,” or if “the activity is expected to create a surplus as measured over the full financial calculation period” and “the computing capacity can be expected to generate more than 25 bitcoins a year.” The only prohibited activity included the usage of bitcoin in waste and scrap metal transactions.\n\nMoreover, as politics in Sweden also warm to bitcoin following the establishment of the BitcoinPartiet, the entry of foreign payment startups such as Stripe vying for market share, numerous Bitcoin-themed social events, as well as neighboring Denmark set to abolish the printing of cash by 2016, it will be exciting to watch which payment methods take off in Sweden and Scandinavia as a whole.', ""Rebit.ph co-founder Luis Buenaventure recently published a blog post on Medium claiming that Bitcoin does little to help cheapen remittances.\n\nWhile the math-based currency does lower the bar of entry for startups, and local technological innovation could further improve the competitive advantage of so-called “rebittance” companies, Buenaventure argued that most of the cost is currently made in “the first and last mile.”\n\nWhile Bitcoin does a great job realizing cross-boarder transfers of money, the distribution of physical cash was the expensive part of remittances all along – a problem Bitcoin hasn't solved.\n\nTo find out if Buenaventure is right, Bitcoin Magazine took the pulse of four other rebittance startups: Bitex , HelloBit , SatoshiTango and Volabit .\n\nThe first and the last mile\n\nMost rebittance startups agree with the main premise as presented by Buenaventure. Bitcoin does not make rebittance cheaper – at least not yet. All four companies acknowledged that the bulk of the cost is made in the first and the last mile, the part of the remittance process that doesn't really involve bitcoin. As such, rebittance startups are not particularly well positioned to compete with existing giants Western Union and MoneyGram as far as costs go.\n\nHelloBit co-founder and CEO Ali Goss explained:\n\n“These companies have very large foreign exchange (FX) departments, and they're basically able to bring the cost of sending money across boarders down to zero. We're talking about big movements of money, which they do when prices are favorable. They might even make money doing that, as opposed to it being a major cost.”\n\nAs such, Goss continued, bitcoin doesn't actually remove that much friction. Rather, it can make it worse.\n\n“With bitcoin, you're adding a third currency,” Goss said. “You go from U.S. dollar to bitcoin, and then from bitcoin to whatever the local currency is. You're adding an extra FX move right there alone. That increases friction. On top of that, small startups don't have a big FX department, and they don't have the big abilities that come with such a department ... they're generating more costs for themselves, not less.”\n\nHannah Kim, COO and Head of Product at Volabit, added:\n\n“In addition to costs, perhaps a bigger problem is that Bitcoin companies in many countries – most notably the U.S. – cannot develop sustainable partnerships with cash-collecting and distributing networks due to unclear regulatory implications.”\n\nSatoshiTango co-founder and CEO Matias Bari agreed, but emphasized that he is quite hopeful for the future, saying:\n\n“I agree that rebittance is currently not cheaper than existing alternatives, but I do think that costs will lower as long as companies in the space grow and are able to charge less for the same service. That is a path we need to walk. But it is going to happen in a couple of years when the industry gets bigger and healthier and some mechanisms used today probably change for better ones, allowing us to improve our processes and lower fees.”\n\nThe only company that disagreed with Buenaventure's assessment was Bitex, the Latin Americawide bitcoin exchange that offers remittance services within the region as well.\n\nBitex co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Manuel Beaudroit stated:\n\n“In this region there's a significant reduction in cost when using bitcoin, from 15, 20, or 30 percent to 6 or 10 percent in most cases. Though it is true, though, that the main added costs are in the first and last mile, where the branch offices usually charge 2.5 percent to 3 percent.”\n\nInnovation\n\nThe rebittance companies generally agreed with Buenaventure's conclusion that Bitcoin does help smaller startups get a foot on the ground in the remittance industry, while they also acknowledged that adoption of local virtual currencies or other fintech solutions could severely cut costs.\n\nBut the rebittance companies pointed out that one other aspect is even more important: innovation. The open nature of Bitcoin allows for startups to use this technology in new and innovative ways, and this is where they believe the rebittance industry should really get its edge.\n\n“I would not say that the remittance industry is stagnating,” Volabit's Kim explained. “Rather, the industry is being forced to evolve quickly by learning what works and what doesn't. The remittance population is as diverse as its use case, and looking at success cases like Transferwise it’s clear to see that there are opportunities to reach people that are more open to online, tech-forward solutions.”\n\nThis was seconded by Goss, who's HelloBit transformed its remittance company into a sort of “Uber for cash ,” where users act as “human ATMs.”\n\n“Smart people need to come up with smarter things, and we will ultimately see the innovation occur that will make using Bitcoin for remittance cheaper.” Goss said.\n\n“But that wasn't our goal. We knew early on that it wasn't going to be cheaper right off the bat, therefore what we asked ourselves: What could we do that's different? So, with HelloBit, you might pay more sometimes, but then you’d pay more for an additional service. You get the money delivered to you. Though it may be more expensive than picking it up at Western Union, or maybe the same price, you have the added benefit of delivery, which is a completely new distribution model. And out users are able to settle right there with their phone, rather than having to need a bank account.”\n\nBitex's Beaudroit agreed that rebittance companies should focus on alternative markets rather than the markets that are already served by the existing rebittance industry.\n\n“I see bitcoin playing a fundamental role for remittance company when needing to move funds crossborderly, more focused on B2B (business to business) than B2C (business to customer), at least for the following couple of years,” Beaudroit told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nSatoshiTango's Bari acknowledged that rebittance companies will need some time to find the best way to utilize Bitcoin, too. He believes this will be a long process, with many failures on the way, but that this is healthy for the market as a whole.\n\n“It is normal that we see a stagnation after some two years of absolutely excitement,” Bari said. “It is common; it’s a Darwinian process of selection among companies.”\n\nAnd, drawing a comparison to the automobile industry, Bari said:\n\n“You know Ford and Chrysler. Find out how many car companies were funded 70, 80 years ago, at the same time those two were funded. Hundreds. They couldn’t make it. It took many years until they became these amazingly huge companies. But when they first started they were startups, not knowing where to aim.”"", 'Dubai-based startup BitOasis has expanded its bitcoin wallet and exchange service further across the Middle East.\n\nAttributing the expansion to Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar to the growing demand for bitcoin in the Gulf region, co-founder Ola Doudin, told CoinDesk that users in those countries had requested the option to buy the digital currency on BitOasis\' platform.\n\nDoudin, who claims the startup has close to 20,000 customers, added that future expansion plans included launches in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

10/23/2015,"['People who are new to Bitcoin rarely understand it the first time around. They think it is not real money, or only a currency, or just a scam tool for online criminals. The digital currency of bitcoin is only the Bitcoin protocol’s first “app.” Just like email was to the Internet, the currency simply is the best way to bring the new technology to the masses. Just like the Internet is so much more than email, we haven’t even scratched the surface to what Bitcoin is.\n\nThis list of 10 reasons for someone to get started with Bitcoin should help the new-to-intermediate user of Bitcoin get a better understanding of how Bitcoin and its ecosystem will work in the real world as we go forward.\n\nIf you are already a Bitcoin veteran, share this list with someone you’d like to introduce to Bitcoin.\n\n1. The world’s easiest bank account to open\n\nWhen you are the bank, accounts are just so easy to open! With Bitcoin, you don’t need a bank or credit. No credit check, ID, age requirement, citizenship papers, or passport are needed to have a Bitcoin wallet or any bitcoin. If you control your money and bank account, you have true economic freedom. Bitcoin gives anyone this option. Your 10-year old child can forget piggy banks (unless it’s bitcoin-powered) and start their own digital empire today!\n\nHave your own Bitcoin address, QR code, receive your first deposit, and buy something with bitcoin in less time than it takes to read this article.\n\n2. Appreciate the appreciation\n\nCritics of Bitcoin are quick to point out that it has lost hundreds of dollars in value since Mt. Gox. What they leave out of their assessment is that five years ago it was worth one American nickel and has appreciated thousands of percent in value in just over six years. Name any other currency or commodity, from gold and silver, to cash or real estate that has increased in value that much since 2009? You can’t, because there has never been a financial option as revolutionary as Bitcoin before.\n\nBitcoin hasn’t even gone mainstream or “viral” yet! Its upside potential, and the limited supply of 21 million total units, creates a truly special investment opportunity. Bitcoin’s value has already increased about 50% since its 2015-low back in mid-January. Bitcoin is so resilient because it is designed to appreciate in value over time, through simple supply and demand, unlike a dollar or euro, which are designed to depreciate in the long-run.\n\n3. Launch your Business idea without the need for bank approval\n\nStarting a new business can be very hard, financially. Maybe you are a coder who wants to make a great “app” but have no money or credit. Within minutes, get a QR code, post it on your Facebook or Twitter and drum up grassroots support for the next great business idea. Whether it’s a way to process microtransactions quickly and easily, a new crowdfunding platform or a partnership with your lawyer friend to do bitcoin escrow management, no credit check or bank loan is required.\n\nOffer a product or service, something of value, in exchange for Bitcoin. This is the fastest and easiest way to get started with Bitcoin. It’s not about changing dollars to cryptocurrency. Instead, build the Bitcoin community, and start new economic activity within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. And it allows you to “opt-out” of the status quo, philosophically.\n\n4. Quickly gain access to the rest of the digital currencies or altcoins\n\nBitcoin is a multi-billion dollar industry, but that is just part of the digital currency world. There are hundreds of millions invested in “altcoins” as well. In order to enter the altcoin market, and experience all the features digital currency has to offer, you’ll need some bitcoin. Bitcoin is to digital currency what the U.S. Dollar is to fiat currency worldwide. It is needed as a liquid asset to move and convert easily between different currencies. Going from a fiat currency straight to Litecoin would be much more difficult than converting bitcoin to litecoin using an instant online service like Shapeshift.\n\nBitcoin may not be the best currency for all situations, and something less valuable, and with quicker transaction times may be more desirable as an alternative in the future. Just like you wouldn’t use a US$100 bill to buy a slice of pizza or leave a tip, smaller altcoins could have more and more real-world value as well as their own specific niches. They will be used more as transactional currencies in the future, as bitcoin continues to grow in value, and fresh supplies dwindle.\n\n6. Two words: Bitcoin IPOs!\n\nThese are starting to become a new bitcoin financing option. Offer stocks, bonds, and IPOs for your small business or corporation without any established stock exchange seat needed. Receive financing from anyone worldwide, buy and sell shares of your company. Take new investors for a day, a week, or on a timer! Sell your “app” or business model outright, or just gain partnerships to infuse capital and awareness to your vision. The possibilities are endless.\n\n7. Programmable money has its advantages over fiat currencies\n\nHaving a truly digital currency means you can do many things a dollar simply can’t do. For example, you can have a family wallet with pre-set spending limits. Your teenage daughter can only shop at certain mall stores at certain times with the family bitcoin wallet. Your daughter in college can only buy books at the school store, not beers for the frat party on Saturday. Digital currency is designed to be easily programmable by the owner for many different parameters. Limits are not a Bitcoin thing, but it will give you these options.\n\n8. ‘Smart contracts’ provide many business options\n\nEvery day, many people worldwide use a version of the “smart contract” and don’t even know it. If you go to the vending machine and give it a dollar, you are entering a primitive version of a smart contract. You send the dollar to the machine and enter into a contract. The machine has the keys to your change and your product and releases them when you send the payment to fulfill the contract you desire. Bitcoin can have a similar, but a much more advanced smart contract, for your car, for example. Nick Szabo coined this concept back in 1997.\n\nIf you get a car, it will have a digital key for you and your bank. If you fail to make the payments, your (digital) keys to the car revert to the bank’s Bitcoin account until you make amends with the bank. No more car theft, which builds on the current engine immobilizer concept, a similar primitive form of a smart contract, like the vending machine example. This can apply to homes or anything with a loan where more than one party has a claim to the property over a span of time.\n\n8. Crowdfund your business or project even in the most remote area\n\nWhat if you’re in an impoverished, 3rd-world nation? You don’t live near a metropolitan city. You live 30-50-100 miles from the nearest bank. You don’t own a car. Your local dirt road is flooded out by rain 3-4 days a week. Your nation’s currency is going through inflation at close to 10% annually, and you don’t get much of it to begin with. You support your family from a small farm you own that provides food to live on, but could provide more if you could invest in grain, materials, and more land. You know one person several miles away with a computer and an internet connection. You can get to him once a week when you shop near his location. He lets you use a computer if you need. Bitcoin’s unique abilities give you the means to transact worldwide. Now, you have options you’ve never had before.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you can get a free Bitcoin wallet online, have a web page made, and you can put your QR code online. Place an ad to gain payments from anyone worldwide!\n\nA few US dollars in bitcoin may be worth hundreds of currency units in many countries with a swiftly depreciating national currency. In many foreign lands, US$10 in bitcoin would change the lives of entire families for 2-3 months. Websites, networks, and partnerships are being built worldwide to make these capabilities of Bitcoin easier to realize every day.\n\n9. Don’t like your government or central banking system? Bitcoin makes a financial and political statement\n\nMaybe you or someone you know is the type of person that hates being controlled, financially or otherwise. Maybe they are the type of person that is constantly complaining about the Federal Reserve, the government, or regulations in general. Bitcoin may be your ticket.\n\nBitcoin is just a technology, but it is a technology that is not owned or sanctioned by any government or centralized body or server. It is a true financial model of independence. The more money invested into Bitcoin means less money is invested directly into government, central banking, and the status quo, in general.\n\nThe more money flowing into the Bitcoin ecosystem, the more each bitcoin grows in value in the long-run; pretty much the opposite of how modern fiat currency works, which is something to consider whether you are new to Bitcoin, or not.\n\n10. Bitcoin’s speed makes a wire transfer seem like a steam ship\n\nHave you ever tried to take more than US$10k out of a bank? These days, you will have a conversation with the branch manager, and the transaction will be sent to the government, regardless of where you are. You are on somebody’s list. Ever try to move more than a gold coin or two through customs on a flight overseas? Yeah, you will spend some time in a room with men carrying guns.\n\nPrivacy and rights are becoming a thing of the past with the old guard of value transfer. Bitcoin steps up your security and privacy in a big way. Access your bitcoins without a need to transfer them, no matter you go. Sending a wire transfer takes days! Why waste the time? Plus, you’ll have to answer twenty questions as to who you’re sending it to and why. If you want to send a million dollars in bitcoin to someone overseas, you can send it fully-encrypted to any address you like, without an interrogation by a bank, or fear of reprisals. They’ll receive it in seconds, and get it verified within the hour. Create a “brain wallet” if you like, and access your BTC by remembering a favorite phrase.\n\nPeople have been trained and conditioned to think physical money is a great asset, but when it is time to move that physical asset, this favored trait becomes a major liability. Bitcoin doesn’t have such problems. You are in full control of your money anytime, anywhere, with access to any amount. Now that’s control over your finances.\n\nThe Internet started out just like this\n\nThis is just a working sample of what Bitcoin is doing now and will do in the very near future. Bitcoin is not a conjured-up online experiment. It is a new digital ecosystem that will allow people to have the same flexibility and economic power as nation states. The privacy that is currently being stolen at an exponential rate is infinitely enhanced through encryption. Limitations aren’t built into the system through location, age, identification, or language, like they are with fiat, or paper currency systems.\n\nInstead, everyone in the Bitcoin distributed network gets a chance to succeed, and the establishment has no built-in advantages. Bitcoin levels the global economic playing field, just like the Internet did 20 years before it for global transfer of information.\n\nActually, you have an advantage over the establishment because you have just opened a window into “the future of money” that many people have not. You’re now a step ahead of the competition. What will you do to stay a step ahead? With Bitcoin, the world is full of innovative, amazing new options. Take advantage of this opportunity.', 'American Express, through its venture capital arm American Express Ventures, is looking to use its recent investment in bitcoin remittance startup Abra\'s $12m Series A as a way to more closely observe the digital currency industry and the technology behind it.\n\nAmEx Ventures managing partner Harshul Sanghi told CoinDesk in a recent interview that, for the 165-year old company, it’s too soon to predict how it might leverage the technology or what use cases might take shape.\n\n“It’s very, very early days for us, right? And ... we get to explore and see how the space is going to evolve,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, AmEx will “test the waters” through its work with Abra, and in return, provide resources and advice to the startup.\n\nSanghi left the door open to support for bitcoin by American Express, stating:\n\n“Let’s see what currencies are important and we’ll transact in the currencies that our customers want to transact in.”\n\nHowever, he suggested other applications of the blockchain are more at the forefront of the company’s mind than bitcoin itself.\n\n""As we watch the digital currency industry develop, we have seen that blockchain technology and the distributed ledger can play an important role in shaping the future,” said Sanghi.\n\nHe thinks AmEx may consider making other investments in the digital currency space, tying such a prospect to how the technology progresses.\n\n“I think as the technology continues to evolve, as others have in the past, we will look to see and make investments as appropriate and as relevant for us and our businesses,” the partner said.\n\nSanghi went on to say the user experience of the Abra app was a draw for American Express, reiterating that the company’s investment gives it a platform to explore the technology further.\n\n“We think they have a unique platform in the way they’re leveraging the blockchain technology, and their goal market and how they’re looking to move forward,"" he said. ""And we think it was a good investment, a good company to partner with and see how the space evolves.”\n\nImage Source: Nadalina / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

One are the Winklevoss Twins, who made plain how many they had purchased to the press in 2013.\n\nAt that time, they claimed to have purchased $11 million worth of BTC at a rate of around $120. There have only been a few times since then that they’ve actually lost any value, and currently they’re sitting on a higher value than their original investment. If they sold during the $1000-plus bubble at the end of 2013, and then purchased again, it’s hard to say, but they could have five times as many bitcoins easily.\n\nOf course, buying Bitcoins with money is not the only way to do it. The other two ways to get bitcoins are to mine them or sell goods and services for them. Ross Ulbricht was perhaps one of the largest Bitcoin hoarders in history, albeit not necessarily by choice, making vast sums from transaction fees on the Silk Road. This is no longer an allegation, in that he confessed to it repeatedly by now.\n\nVenture capitalist Tim Draper purchased one of the lots of Ross Ulbricht’s bitcoins when the market rate was more than double what it is today. Then there are the rumored Satoshi Nakamoto coins, an unknown amount that hasn’t moved since the creator disappeared in 2011. During the first year of mining, 2009, there were over 1.5 million coins mined, of which it is believed Nakamoto controls a fair few. Were these coins ever to start moving, a market panic might ensue. In fact, the last time ancient coins, from February of that year, were moved, the owner felt the need to publicly announce that he wasn’t intending to scare anyone by moving old coins.\n\nAs of July, the address containing the most bitcoins was 39coweGgC8CPZ6hYL1BBEfc1zqbSfHsprW and it contained at that time some 215,000. A recent episode involving Silk Road cohort Variety Jones mentioned that federal agents were illicitly trying to get him to help them unlock a wallet that contained more than 300,000 coins.\n\nDetermining who has the most bitcoins would not be easy. It’s not really feasible to “prove” that one has control of coins. On top of that, most Bitcoiners are rightly private about their finances, which currently still have dubious legal standing in many jurisdictions. Additionally, most Bitcoiners do not store vast quantities in single addresses. The very act of making a transaction usually results in change addresses receiving the remainder of the transaction. The writer’s own wallet, for instance, contains something like 250 addresses for this reason.\n\nBut if we had to make a guess, it seems likely that the winners of the Silk Road Bitcoin auctions most likely control the most bitcoins at this stage, with the Winklevii and other large firms controlling other large sums. In the end, it really doesn’t matter who controls the most bitcoins. It seems that the more hands the currency finds its way into, the harder it is for singular entities to pick up vast sums, which can protective of the price in the event that such entities decide to exit the market.\n\nWho do you think has the most bitcoins? Comment below and like and share above!\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin is money.\n\nThat was the gist of a ruling this week from the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the highest court in Europe. The ruling was in response to a dispute originally filed in Sweden. In the case, Skatteverket (Swedish Tax Agency) v. David Hedqvist, the ECJ was asked to rule on whether transactions to exchange a traditional currency for bitcoin (or vice versa) would subject to value added tax (VAT). The question was important because Hedqvist intended to use the currency in commerce as part of on online bitcoin exchange. At first, the Swedish Revenue Law Commission advised Hedqvist that bitcoin was exempt from VAT but the Swedish Tax Authority disagreed. Eventually the question made its way to the ECJ.\n\nThe ECJ ruled that bitcoin was exempt from VAT because it is not tangible property. Instead, the ECJ cited the Advocate General\'s position that ""virtual currency has no purpose other than to be a means of payment."" That means that in the European Union, for purposes of tax, bitcoin is considered - and taxed - as currency. By rule, in the EU, there is no tax on ""currency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender.""\n\nYou can read the decision in English here.\n\nThe ruling is an important step towards resolving lingering tax disputes globally over how to treat bitcoin. In 2014, the UK finally clarified its position on the taxation of bitcoin, finding it to be a currency while Germany\'s official position had been that bitcoin was ""personal"" or ""private"" money, to be treated like a commodity and subject to sales taxes. Those conflicting positions have been clarified in the EU.\n\nBut don\'t count your tax-free bitcoin just yet: while the ECJ has ruled bitcoin a currency in the EU, the U.S. disagrees. Just last year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance to taxpayers on how to treat bitcoin – and other virtual currency – for federal income tax purposes. Their decision? It’s not money. Noting in IRS Notice 2014-21 (downloads as a pdf) that ""virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss for US federal tax purposes,"" the IRS determined that bitcoin and similar currencies are to be treated as a capital asset. For taxpayers, this means that bitcoin and other virtual currency will be subject to capital gains rules for any applicable gains or losses.\n\n(You can read more on the IRS tax treatment of bitcoin for income tax purposes here and more on the IRS treatment of bitcoin for FATCA purposes here.)', 'A tiny Regina bitcoin startup, Dominion Bitcoin Mining Co., says it has been ""exonerated"" after facing allegations from Saskatchewan\'s securities regulator last year that it was soliciting investors without the proper paperwork.\n\nIn a decision dated Oct. 22, a three-member panel of the province\'s Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority (FCAA) ruled that no trading or other breaches of Saskatchewan\'s Securities Act occurred.\n\n""It is the determination of the Panel that, notwithstanding the initially apparent validity of the allegations of the FCAA Staff, an offering of shares did not at material times exist, and the parties did not individually or collectively engage in any acts in furtherance of trading or in any breach of the provisions of the Act,"" the decision reads.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAt issue were messages on Dominion\'s website that appeared to urge ""sophisticated investors"" to buy shares in a group of companies engaged in what is known as bitcoin mining, which is the process by which computers are used to create new units of the virtual currency.\n\n""By taking part in our offering, you own a share in one of ten provincial companies that own Dominion. That share allows you an equal part in EVERY SINGLE BITCOIN WE EVER MINE,"" the site read, according to the decision.\n\nAt a hearing earlier this month, Dominion argued that the website was not live, and was supposed to be password-protected and encrypted, and was merely a ""whiteboard"" for the company\'s ideas. They also say they had no securities to sell. The panel agreed that the fact the website was accessible was ""unintended,"" that no securities were ever sold or created, and that Dominion\'s three founders ""had no clear picture of what an investor might be investing in.""\n\nJason Dearborn, a former Saskatchewan party MLA and a co-founder of the company, said he plans to sue the Saskatchewan regulator for libel for making the allegations. He also says he is pursuing other legal action for alleged violations of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that he says took place during interviews with investigators. He also alleges his company\'s website was accessible to investigators only because it had been hacked.\n\n""These guys are just absolutely ridiculous,"" he said of Saskatchewan\'s securities regulator. "" ... This is just a Mickey Mouse organization.""\n\nHe said Dominion\'s plans to mine bitcoins, and engage in bitcoin trading are still under development but that it would probably not do any business in Saskatchewan.\n\nHowever, he said the company has continued to mine bitcoin in the meantime. But Mr. Dearborn said Dominion had not sought out any external investors, and that it would operate in full compliance with securities laws.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe also said an anonymous informant, labelled ""Person X"" in documents filed with the securities regulator, spurred the launch of the investigation while one of Dominion\'s co-founders, Peter Voldeng, a former Saskatchewan Party president, was seeking his party\'s nomination for a seat in the Saskatchewan legislature.\n\nA spokesman for the FCAA said the regulator had no comment.', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The virtual currency legislation will make it easier for companies dealing in Bitcoin to operate\n\nJersey\'s government is to introduce ""light touch"" regulation for virtual currencies, according to the assistant chief minister.\n\nSenator Philip Ozouf announced the new legislation at the island\'s first finance technology conference.\n\nThe government has been working on the legislation for about 18 months and focused on protecting against money laundering and financial crime.\n\nVirtual currency companies will face tighter regulation as they grow.\n\nJohn Harris from the Jersey Financial Services Commission said they would not have to pay a fee or face tougher regulation until they had an annual turnover of £150,000.\n\nRobbie Andrews, who founded a group to campaign for Bitcoin regulation, said there were already companies waiting to move to Jersey.\n\nHe said: ""The fact that the government has taken a light-touch approach where other jurisdictions have gone all-encompassing with regulation will be a benefit to Jersey.""\n\nVirtual currency legislation elsewhere\n\nUK - Plans for regulation were announced in the 2015 Budget but no specific details have been announced\n\nIsle of Man - Regime to regulate almost all activities in virtual currency\n\nGuernsey - No announcement\n\nMr Harris said when looking at the regulation they had to be careful about the risk to the finance industry.\n\nBitcoin expert Dave Birch said Jersey was right to focus on regulation, as it was the area where it could have a competitive edge.\n\nHe said: ""The barriers most of the companies we work with come from the regulatory environment.\n\n""Everybody can access Bitcoins and it is hard to see how you can get a competitive advantage when you don\'t have the same scale as other areas such as Silicon Valley.\n\n""Where Jersey has an advantage is being able to connect the regulatory environment to those new key technologies.""\n\nOfficials hope the new legislation will be in place by the end of the first quarter of next year.', 'Barcelona city council is reportedly working to launch its own digital currency in the next six months.\n\nAccording to reports from El Pais, one of Spain\'s leading national newspapers, mayor Ada Colau\'s government is hoping the digital currency will stimulate local commerce.\n\nThough it remains unclear whether the proposed currency is strictly a cryptocurrency, the council has said that users will be able to store their holdings in mobile wallets and exchange them into fiat.\n\nIn addition, civil workers will be able to receive part of their salary in the new digital currency.

In the piece we outlined the levels we were looking to watch in the bitcoin market throughout Friday’s session, and stated that – if we got the volatility we were looking for – we would look to enter according to our breakout strategy in an attempt to draw a short term scalp profit on the action. Action has now matured throughout the day, and we are heading into the close of the European session and the beginning of the weekend. In the majority of other financial assets, markets would be pitching to close for he next couple of days. Not in bitcoin, however. Indeed, the weekend is where we seem to be getting most of the action as late, so it’s worth setting up some key levels to watch as we head into Friday night incase we get a reiteration of the past few weeks’ volatility. So, with this said, here are the levels we are keeping an eye on in the bitcoin price this evening and beyond. Take a quick look at the chart.\n\nAs the cart shows, today’s action has been pretty volatile. We reached the level we slated as in term resistance a little earlier on this afternoon at 280 flat, and have since corrected towards I term support at 273 flat. From support, we have bounced a little to trade at current levels around 278. Since we have not breached either of our key levels, they will be the ones we hold going into the weekend.\n\nWe will incorporate our standard breakout strategy going forward, so a break above 280 flat will bring 285 into play as a medium term upside target, while a break below 273 would bring 265 into play to the downside. On both entries, a stop around $2 the other side of the entry point will help to keep things attractive from a risk management perspective.\n\nCharts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Let\'s take a look this week\'s top bitcoin and blockchain headlines.\n\n\'Great news\' for bitcoin\n\nThe European Court of Justice\'s bitcoin VAT exemption made waves both in and outside the digital currency ecosystem, while at the same time garnering the attention of a variety of journalists.\n\nInternational Business Times\' Ian Allison, a regular on the bitcoin beat, cited Sarah Buxton, a tax lawyer at Bryan Cave LLP, who said:\n\n""This ruling is great news for bitcoin enthusiasts and means that Europeans can continue to buy Bitcoins without paying tax.""\n\nBuxton continued: ""The ruling treats bitcoin as money and should help strengthen the popularity of this cryptocurrency. This decision may be a step in the right direction towards the recognition of Bitcoin as legal tender.""\n\nIn a piece for Business Insider, Rob Price noted:\n\n""There had been fears that the court might rule that bitcoin exchanges should have to pay value-added tax (VAT), pushing up the price of bitcoin in Europe.""\n\nThe court, Price added, could have potentially ruled that bitcoin itself should be subject to tax, which ""would have entangled bitcoin businesses in significant new red tape"".\n\nECJ\'s new ruling, he concluded, is a boost for bitcoin in building credibility as a ""viable alternative currency"".\n\nMatt Clinch said in a CNBC piece:\n\n""Virtual currencies can be exchanged tax free in the European Union, following a ruling from the highest court in Europe on Thursday.""\n\nClinch continued: ""Bitcoin is a virtual currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.""\n\nThe ruling, Clinch said, paves the way for potentially cheaper transactions within the EU and therefore a boon for the nascent industry.\n\nBlockchain Alliance\n\nRelations between the digital currency industry and US law enforcement were brought into the spotlight following news of the establishment of a discussion forum between industry groups, startups and various agencies in the American government.\n\nAmerican Banker\'s Ian McKendry covered the announcement, framing it as an effort to bring bitcoin into the mainstream and weed out criminal activity.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Bitcoin and blockchain technologies have received praise for being innovative, but they have also received notoriety for being used by criminals who take advantage of the potential anonymity the technology offers to trade illegal goods and services.""\n\nIn his piece, McKendry cited Perianne Boring, president of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, who said in a statement: ""It\'s no secret that bitcoin has perception issues, which is a roadblock to mainstream adoption.""\n\nMotherboard ran a piece entitled ""There\'s a New Alliance to Crack Down on Bitcoin Crime"", which began:\n\n""It\'s no secret that the pseudo-anonymous currency bitcoin is often used for crime.

You may only be able to count the number of bitcoin exchanges that you've heard of on one hand, but the world is absolutely full of defunct bitcoin exchanges, and they’re apparently quite hard to keep profitable.\n\nDoes this mean that the industry is suffering, or that it’s getting hard to find a bitcoin exchange when you need one?\n\nNot by a longshot! If anything, such a large number of exchanges going under means that the quality of exchange that you do use is much higher today than it would have been had these exchanges been profitable.\n\nMarc Andresen, a prominent VC agreed in a tweet soon afterwards: “MtGox had to die for Bitcoin to thrive. Its former role from early Bitcoin days has been supplanted by better, stronger entities.”\n\nAsk any free-market-loving libertarian about ‘market Darwinism’ and you’re likely to encounter a gleeful tale about capital moving from the hands of the incompetent into the hands of those who can create the better product. The theory goes that markets mature and get stronger through a process similar to natural selection, where bad or “unfit” services are bankrupted in one way or another, getting out of the way to make room for the good, or “fittest” services to thrive.\n\nIf these 36 exchanges are any indication, the theory is sound, and the bitcoin exchange industry is maturing quite rapidly.\n\nIn a global market where anyone, anywhere, can start up their own currency exchange, the market has been flooded with both good and bad service offerings. How many exchanges are there in total? Making a list of them is nearly impossible to do. Brave New Coin currently tracks over 111, while the official bitcoin wiki lists 162, although it’s somewhat out of date.\n\nNot only are they hard to find for geographical and linguistic reasons, but the precise definition of an exchange is something few can agree on. A better way of estimating how well the bitcoin exchange market is doing is by looking at blockchain statistics for exchange trading traffic.\n\nWith Exchange trade volume doubling, or perhaps tripling over the last half year, it is clear that new exchanges are not just maintaining the status quo, but appear to be expanding bitcoin’s ability to grow.\n\nFor those who enjoy a stroll down memory lane, here’s a list of 36 now-defunct exchanges, and when we lost sight of each, with some historical notes where available.\n\nOut of the 36 exchanges in this two were sold to larger companies, living on, if only in essence. Another two lost banking relationships, forcing closure in spite of any potential. 16 gave up the ghost due to financial difficulties, while 13 claim to have been hacked, four of those closures led to criminal convictions. In total, more than 950,000 bitcoins have been stolen from their rightful owners.\n\nSoon after the MtGox fiasco came to a head, legendary venture capitalist Fred Wilson said, “We are witnessing the maturation of a sector and part of that will inevitably be failures, crashes, and other messes. Almost every technology that I’ve watched come into a mass adoption has gone through these sorts of growing pains.”\n\nApparently, it has been easy to go bankrupt, get hacked, give in to corruption, or otherwise fail to make a profitable business out of exchanging bitcoins for currency. While many of these failures have affected individuals, to varying extents, each one has added to the bitcoin ecosystem, and today's new exchanges are more secure and fortified than ever. No matter how secure these exchanges become, there is a simple lesson to be learnt.\n\n- Andreas Antonopoulos, Author of Mastering Bitcoin\n\nVenture Capitalist Marc Andreessen was no doubt speaking for the greater bitcoin community when he tweeted that “Every important new technology has birthing pains. PC did, Web did, Bitcoin does. Our enthusiasm and commitment unchanged.”""]"
10/24/2015,"['When it comes to bitcoin, Europe’s highest court and the US’s major tax agency don’t agree on exactly what it is.\n\nIn a decision last week, Europe’s Court of Justice effectively decided that bitcoin is a currency, and therefore transactions in which bitcoins are exchanged for other currencies are exempt from value-added taxes. All exchanges relating to bank notes, coins and currencies are exempt from value-added taxes under European law. (Full judgement is available here.)\n\nIn laymans terms, the EU’s highest court thinks that virtual currencies like bitcoin are essentially the same as other currencies.\n\nThere’s a different view across the pond. Last year, the IRS decided that bitcoin is essentially is property for tax purposes. Separately, the US Commodity Futures Trade Commission last month argued that bitcoin is a commodity like gold or silver, and as such fell under its own regulatory purview.\n\nAs Dow Jones Newswires note, the decision by the Court of Justice eliminates some uncertainty over the treatment of bitcoin within the EU. “While the UK’s tax authority had taken the position that bitcoin is a currency, tax authorities in some countries, such as Sweden and Germany, had argued that it should be treated more like a commodity, making transfers of it subject to sales taxes,” Dow Jones reported.\n\nBut the differing approaches of regulators in the EU and the US highlight the ongoing uncertainty faced by both governments trying to manage the growth of the cryptocurrency and the myriad start-ups, investors and companies eager to incorporate bitcoin into their businesses and portfolios, while staying on the right side of the law.', 'The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) hit $280 this morning following a steady climb since mid-September.\n\nThe bitcoin price crossed the milestone at around 03:30 UTC having closed on Friday at $277.46.\n\nLast Friday, a 2.5% rise tipped the BPI over the $260 mark. That day of trading marked a two-month high for the currency.\n\nWhile pundits cannot agree on the cause of the rise, its clear that the majority of volume is coming from Chinese bitcoin exchanges.\n\nAccording to data from Bitcoinity, in the past 24 hours, 37.81% of trading volume occurred on Huobi, with 35.94% occurring on OKCoin. This was followed by 7.3% on BTCC and 4.74% on Bitstamp.\n\nOver the past 30 days, 41.83% of trades took place on OkCoin, 36.28% were on Huobi and 4.44% were on BTCC.\n\nAt the time of press, the bitcoin price was $279.05.\n\nFeatured image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Is bitcoin really the preferred currency of terrorists? You might think so from reading some of the mainstream media headlines. But a recent intergovernmental study on terrorist financing paints a very different picture.\n\nThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a Paris-based, intergovernmental body that develops policies to protect the global financial system against money laundering, terrorist financing and financing of weapons of mass destruction, recently released a report called Emerging Terrorist Financing Risks. There is a small section in the report about virtual currency as a tool for this financing, but the 48-page report says foreign terrorist groups are primarily using traditional methods such as private donations, self-funding and criminal activities to raise funds. It says new payment technologies pose an emerging vulnerability that may increase over time, but the prevalence of these technologies by terrorist groups is not clear at present.\n\nThe report’s purpose is to analyze recently-identified terrorist financing methods. It claims that understanding how terrorists manage assets is key to restricting their access to funds and to disrupting their activities. Experts from the FATF’s global network of law enforcement, intelligence agencies and financial intelligence units contributed to the report.\n\nTerrorists And Traditional Financing\n\nTerrorist groups raise money for operations, propaganda, training and recruitment.\n\nAnti-money laundering and efforts to counter terrorist financing have succeeded in undermining these organizations’ ability to use some traditional fundraising methods, the report notes. But it also notes that these organizations are adaptable, requiring authorities to continue to monitor terrorists’ use of traditional financing methods.\n\nVirtual currencies are not mentioned until the latter part of the report.\n\nVirtual currencies have attracted terrorists and criminals because they offer anonymity for transactions and users, fast transactions, low volatility (which brings a lower exchange risk) and reliability, the report notes.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have noticed terrorist websites promoting the use of bitcoin for donations. Authorities have also discovered online discussions among terrorists about using virtual currency to purchase weapons. One ISIL-linked blog proposed using bitcoin to support global terrorism.\n\nThe report cites the recent case of Virginia teen Ali Shukri Amin who was arrested for using Twitter to promote terrorism and instructing people how to use bitcoin. Amin’s Twitter conversations had more than 4,000 followers.\n\nOther payment technologies rated higher than virtual currency on FATF’s list of concerns. One being social media.\n\nDonors to social media and crowdfunding solicitations are often unaware of the end use of funds raised. Such campaigns can attract thousands of donors. Terror groups also use other peer-to-peer horizontal communication venues like mobile apps, chats and forums.\n\nOnline Payment Systems Raise Concern\n\nTerrorists’ growing use of online payment systems also gets significant scrutiny. To avoid detection when using these systems, terrorists rotate the required registration information.\n\nThe exploitation of natural resources for terrorist financing gets examined at length. Natural resources in or near areas of conflict present terrorists with opportunities to reap rewards from these resources. Other criminal activities terrorists use to raise funds include smuggling, illegal mining, extortion and kidnapping for ransom.\n\nTerrorist groups also infiltrate non-profit organizations to gain access to their funds. A 2014 FATF report on non-profit organizations explored terrorist abuse of the global non-profit sector. Charities and non-profits that operate in war zones are particularly at risk of being infiltrated by terrorist groups.\n\nThey are also able to route revenue from legitimate commercial enterprises to terrorist organizations.\n\nStill other illegal fundraising activities mentioned include credit card fraud, loan fraud, insurance fraud, smuggling, bank robberies, drug trafficking, tax fraud, extortion, and kidnapping for ransom.\n\nAlso read: Will bitcoin be used to fund terrorism?\n\nHow Terrorists Move Assets\n\nOne section of the report examines how terrorist groups move assets. It notes the banking sector remains the most reliable global transaction venue, and it remains vulnerable to terrorist financing. Anti-money laundering measures are making it more difficult for terrorists to use the banking sector, but traditional financial products can be used for terror financing. A group can still open a bank account and provide a credit card to enable members to access cash via bank ATMs.\n\nThe report’s conclusion notes that traditional financing methods continue to represent terror financing risks. It also notes that self-funding through legitimate means such as personal and business income are increasing.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and FATF.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Blockchain Alliance is a new, nonprofit organization founded by bitcoin advocacy groups the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center. It aims to serve as a “public-private forum,” where members speak over a shared email group, in order to discuss bitcoin and blockchain related criminal activities, such as the dreaded Cryptolocker extortion scam.\n\n- Jerry Brito, Coin Center Executive Director\n\nAdvising the alliance is Dr. James Newsome, former chair of the CFTC, and legal counsel Steptoe & Johnson, LLP.

It’s of little mystery why so many upstanding pillars of the bitcoin community would want to create an organization that helps bury those associations.\n\n- Valery Vavilov, BitFury CEO\n\nAcross the table, the Blockchain Alliance is engaged with seven U.S. agencies.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security Investigations (DHS)\n\nThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service (SS)\n\nThe U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS)\n\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)\n\nThere are also plans to engage with other U.S. and foreign agencies in the future. ""It\'s no secret that Bitcoin has perception issues, which is a roadblock to mainstream adoption. Having an open dialogue with law enforcement and policymakers will help reduce anxiety about this transformative technology,"" states Perianne Boring, Chamber of Digital Commerce President.\n\nWith so many U.S. law enforcement departments, many of which have a history with the Bitcoin community, it should be no surprise that opinions are divided about the new alliance, in the libertarian-leaning bitcoin community.\n\nPerhaps the most vocal opponent, Bruce Fenton, is the current Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation and Founder of Atlantic Financial. Fenton has been posting across a range of social media outlets, detailing his disappointment in the move.\n\n- Bruce Fenton\n\nFenton laid out his concerns for the Blockchain Alliance, stating “I can see that this will also be a massive train wreck that will again harm the industry I care so much about.”\n\n- Bruce Fenton\n\nJason Weinstein is the “poster child” Fenton referred to, he will serve as Director of the newly formed Blockchain Alliance, and is currently Partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP. “Fast & Furious,” was a DOJ scandal where more than 2,000 US-purchased guns were sold to drug cartels by US agents.\n\nWeinstein resigned when the Justice Department inspector general\'s report on the operation was released. ""[Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein] was the most senior person in the Department in April and May 2010 who was in a position to identify the similarity between the inappropriate tactics used in Operations Wide Receiver and Fast and Furious,"" states the report.\n\nWhile believing in good engagement with law enforcement, Fenton was quick to point out that these particular are not lawmakers or regulators, just enforcers. “no amount of convincing will get them to relax, consider or change policy.”\n\n- Fenton\n\nAlthough less vocal, one of the first venture capital investors in bitcoin, Roger Ver, appears to agree with Fentons opposition, stating that “regulators aren\'t adept at catching bad actors, but are far more adept at creating hurdles for legitimate business.”\n\nThere have been many others weighing in on forums and social media, questioning the possibility of backdoors being built into bitcoin service provider platforms. Legally mandated backdoors for data access have been an ongoing topic of discussion in the US.\n\nThe Obama Administration recently said that it won’t support legislation forcing firms to decode encrypted messages. But this didn’t provide much solace for privacy advocates, the administration says it will pursue other means to get people’s data.\n\nThis means that the federal government won’t be forcing companies to build backdoor access into their services and devices any time soon, a measure that many intelligence agencies have been asking for.\n\nInstead of pushing for formal legislation mandating backdoors, the administration has decided that it will continue its efforts to informally pressure companies into creating a way for the government to look at people’s data when they are under investigation.\n\n- FBI Director James B. Comey\n\nJerry Brito reiterated this point, “The Blockchain Alliance is not a backdoor for the government to get information about companies or their customers.”\n\n- Brito\n\nVer disagrees, “It\'s also important to remember that the biggest danger in this world isn\'t from evil people. It is from good people who blindly obey the orders of evil people because they imagine them to have ""authority."" Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and other evil people wouldn\'t have been able to accomplish anything if it wasn\'t for the basically good people who blindly followed their orders.”\n\nCore Developer Gavin Andresen, who is the Bitcoin Foundation’s Chief Scientist, doesn’t agree with Ver in this case, and believes that engaging with law enforcement will help bitcoin grow. “I still think engaging is the best strategy.”\n\n- Gavin Andresen\n\nNo one appears to doubt that the Alliance members’ intentions are sincere, but it is clear that experts in the bitcoin space are divided on whether the endeavour will be useful or damaging. Perhaps Andreas Antonopoulos provided the most persuasive argument, when he stated the alliance is a “terrible idea.”\n\n- Andreas Antonopoulos', 'Gerry Torres, owner of the gritty yet clean City Tacos in San Diego’s North Park neighborhood, opened Tostada’s down the street on August 15. He did so quietly, confident in his concept. Both of his restaurants accept Bitcoin through the Bitcoin wallet Airbitz.\n\n“I wanted to get a little exposure and have people trickle in,” Torres told me. “You want to go slow and take it easy and make sure things are right. So far, so good, people seem to be enjoying it.”\n\nWhen you walk into Tostada’s, large windows and bright walls welcome you into the open, vibrant and simple space. Filled with the diverse smells of spices, fish and fruit, it’s easy to grow curious while waiting in line to order your first time. The nuanced menu features fresh and light mariscos with a unique take.\n\nAs I mulled it over, my options included a tostada filled with octopus, shrimp, crab meat, pineapple, red onion, parsley, spicty tomato, lemon juice and raspberry sauce (Mixta) or another with red snapper fish, cucumber, tomato, red onion, parsley, serrano chile and clamato (Ceviche de Pescado).\n\n“The menu is basically something fresh, something different, it’s something new,” he said. “It’s a take on mariscos, it’s a take on sushi and it’s a take on juice crafters.” When you roll all three of those things together, you get Tostadas.\n\n“The Mariscos is basically some of the traditional preparations, while the sushi aspect goes into the quality of the fish and the techniques used in preparation of the fish.” The fresh fruit element which Tostada’s incorporated into its ceviche evolved into cold-pressed juice and fruit salads.\n\n“It’s something that’s wholesome, and something that’s good for you,” he told me.\n\nThe Tostada de Nopales caught my attention so I asked about that. The nice cashier told me they were out due to an afternoon lunch rush. I ordered the Aguachile Tostada, a more traditional Mexican option than some others at Tostadas. The tostada broke up easily, especially as the aguachile sauce soaked in, and the large Mexican shrimp, lemon juice, red onion, chile serrano, cucumber and garlic flavors combined for a complex, tasty experience. This was the favorite of my two dishes thanks to my spice-drawn palate.\n\nThe Camaron Tostada – my second choice – features shrimp, olive oil, sesame seeds, red onion, parsley, tomato, clam, orange and lemon juices, cilantro and mayonnaise. This dish is sushi in disguise. The very fresh shrimp and clams define it, while the orange and lemon juices lighten it. The crunchy shell satisfied a certain craving in a mild and savory dish much different than the Aguachile Tostada.\n\nMy drink choice – Platanos – is made of banana, milk, vanilla and cinnamon. This very cold-pressed option is very familiar to horchata, yet fuller. Like a healthy dessert, if you’re a fan of horchata you will love this juice option.\n\nTorres owns City Tacos, Tostadas and IB Street Tacos in San Diego. One thing that might tie all of his restaurants together is a minimalist take, a trend popular among Mexico’s hippest, world-renowned restaurants. At Tostada’s, the Latin, Asian and Californian come together.\n\n@Tostadas #NorthPark #Camaron A photo posted by Justin (@justinofconnell) on Oct 20, 2015 at 1:53am PDT\n\nAlthough Torres has thoughts of opening places throughout the county, his heart seems to be in North Park.\n\n“North park is so cool – its hip and vibrant, and people young-and-old are out and trying to new things and supporting a new cause on a daily basis,” he says. Other than unique tacos, his restaurants offers an unique payment option.\n\n“City Tacos started accepting Bitcoin pretty much from the beginning,” Torres told me. “We had a nice response.” Torres says it’s a great conversation piece.\n\n“There is nothing wrong with it. It fluctuates like any other currency. Being multicultural and always being immersed in Mexican culture I am used to having currency fluctuations and the exchange rate from one or another so it’s definitely something that is not foreign to me and Bitcoin appears to basically be the same.” Since his taco shop began accepting Bitcoin, he’s noticed some changes.\n\n“It’s gotten a lot better I think and it’s grown since I have accepted it,” he said. “I have bitcoin meetups now and then and the attendees purchase goods with Bitcoin.” Bitcoiners do not make up a large chunk of Torres’ customer base.\n\n“It’s a small percentage, but the way I look at it it’s a percentage where they are people I would not be catering to.\n\n“They are actually searching for you and not the other way and that is a plus,” he adds.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It is no secret that most everyday consumers can barely scrape enough money together to pay for regular purchases. Some consumers, on the other hand, are more interesting in getting their hands on luxury items. Both types of customers have one thing in common: they want quick and convenient payment methods to complete their purchases. Can Bitcoin play a role in the process?\n\nAlso read: FBI Advises Victims Pay Ransom on Ransomware\n\nLuxury Retail Business Is Booming\n\nOver the past two years, more and more customers are purchasing luxury items. Part of this trend can be attributed to the success of platforms such as MatchesFashion. However, there are other factors at play as well, as smartphone shopping is becoming an important aspect of e-commerce around the world these days.\n\nIt is not easy to come by luxury items in the e-commerce space these days. Most of these items have price tags of four digits and more, making it a high-value target for credit card fraud and scammers. Imagine selling someone a US$3,000 watch online, only to see the transaction disputed by the issuing bank two weeks after the payment was made due to a fraudulent charge.\n\nThat being said, there seems to be a market waiting to be explored by luxury retailers. Businesses brave enough to explore this niche market of e-commerce are most likely to see their sales numbers increase exponentially within the first year. Furthermore, growth will increase for many years to come, as there is very little competition in this market right now.\n\nOffering something special to customers looking to spend a fair amount of money will boost sales as well. Next-day delivery, for example, will be highly valued by customers, albeit it is not an option available everywhere in the world. Express delivery, regardless of the cost, is another alternative worth exploring.\n\nLuxury retailers can offer something most other online retailers can not: a different type of stock, especially where fashion is concerned. While there may be some overlapping with other e-commerce platforms, luxury retailers can carefully select their stock to put up for sale online, rather than just listing everything.\n\nAdditionally, there are a lot of emerging designers in the fashion world who are chomping at the bit to get their creations advertised online. This gives luxury retailers another edge over their competitors. But despite all of these positive sides, there is still plenty of reason to stay cautious as well. Making a name for oneself in the luxury e-commerce sector will be a long and tough battle.\n\nIntroducing Bitcoin Payments for Luxury Items?\n\nRetailers selling high-value brand goods in the e-commerce space can also differentiate themselves depending on which payment methods they accept. As previously mentioned, credit cards – as well as any online payment method using credit cards – are not the most secure solution. However, this is one of the most commonly used forms of payment around the world.\n\nBitcoin is a more secure payment method, and has proven to be quite beneficial to the e-commerce sector as well. According to statistics provided in the past, Bitcoin customers spend more per purchase on average, making the luxury retail business an interesting opportunity to explore.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on using Bitcoin as a payment method in the luxury retail business?

These include email addresses, banking info, and phone numbers.\n\n""Not our core systems""\n\nKrebs\' report comes at the same time as a new statement from the company, downplaying the hack somewhat. It now says that ""this cyber attack was on our website not our core systems,"" and that the company did not store full credit card details, ""and therefore are not usable for financial transactions.""\n\nPasswords have not been accessed, the company says, adding that ""we now expect the amount of financial information that may have been accessed to be materially lower than initially believed and would on its own not enable a criminal to take money from your account.""\n\nHowever, some of the customer data was stored in an unencrypted format, as the company initially confirmed on Friday. Encryption is a way of scrambling data in such a way that it is unintelligible without the correct password or key, and is standard practice for protecting sensitive information.\n\n""Disgusting""\n\nBusiness Insider also spoke to Mike Andrews, a retired consultant from Yorkshire, whose personal details were included in an apparent leak from someone claiming to be the hacker. TalkTalk has been hacked twice before (in the last year!), so this leak might not be from the most recent hack: The leaker could be using data from either of the previous two attacks to impersonate the most recent hacker.\n\nBut either way, Andrews has confirmed he is a TalkTalk customer — he has been for years — and says he finds what he has heard about the company\'s security measures is ""disgusting.""\n\n""If there is, in fact, a way of protecting this for major companies like TalkTalk, i.e. this \'encryption\' they talk about ... if they have been negligent in not doing this when they could have, then I think it’s disgusting,"" Andrews told Business Insider.\n\n""I think its disgusting that they haven’t taken — presumably to save money, because that’s the only reason — they haven’t taken due care to do all this. I think they should be heavily fined, because it’s their fault and caused a lot of aggravation for people like me, and I think if it needs putting right then TalkTalk should be made 100% responsible for putting it right.""\n\nThe 78-year-old retiree also said that so far there\'s been zero communication from TalkTalk informing him about the hack. Everything he\'s heard, he learnt from television.\n\nA spokesperson told Business Insider that the company has attempted to reach everyone, but it is difficult and doesn\'t have email contact details for all customers. Letters are also being posted out, and there is a page on the company\'s website about the hack (if you know where to look for it). But three days after the hack was made public, Andrews says he is yet to hear from them directly.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', '']"
10/25/2015,"['Marc Prosser is a freelance journalist who has been involved in many businesses as an executive, advisor and investor. In this article, he explores why blockchain technology could become the backbone of a new generation of government systems.\n\nBlockchain technology is frequently touted as the answer to inefficiencies in the financial sector, but it also has the potential to make a wider societal impact if implemented by governments.\n\nIn May, it was revealed title software firm Epigraph and decentralized record keeping startup Factom were working with the Honduran government on a pilot project.\n\nBlockchain technology is to be used to run the country’s public land registry ledger, making it safer, nigh-on incorruptible and more transparent.\n\nIf successful, similar solutions can quickly be implemented in many other, similar, government ledgers and databases.\n\nAbhi Dobhal, Factom’s VP of business development, said blockchain has three ""distinct advantages"" in a government setting: ""It has a distributed architecture, is immutable and transparent.""\n\n""These qualities allow blockchain-based apps and systems to combat fraud and corruption. At the same time, they are more efficient,” he added.\n\nThe promise of blockchain\n\nCurrent public land registry ledgers are, like many other public ledgers and databases, relatively easy to manipulate. It can be extremely hard to identify who makes specific changes to them and they are expensive and inefficient.\n\nThis applies not only to Honduras, which has a budget transparency described by Transparency International as ‘scant to none’, but to governmental systems all around the world.\n\nBlockchain technology seems almost tailor-made to tackle such issues. The biggest advantage of blockchain in government settings is the simple fact it can lead to massive efficiencies.\n\nFactom stays within the distributed network\n\nSeveral companies and startups are working on solutions that can meet this potential demand.\n\nFactom\'s system includes native time stamping and provides a distributed mechanism to lock in data, making data verifiable and independently auditable.\n\nThrough employing the technology, Factom enables people and businesses to use a mathematically provable, third-party “notarization” service, which is immune to manipulation.\n\nFactom uses the bitcoin blockchain to anchor entries so they are timestamped and proven. However, Factom has its own blockchain and network of federated servers where companies can create Factom chains to insert as many records as they want.\n\nThe advantage of this is that a land title registry, for example, can insert millions of records in one or more Factom chains at very low cost. When they are ready, they can then anchor all these records with one hash on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe system utilises the strength and immutability of the blockchain to create a system that secures ledger data and renders it almost unhackable.\n\nDobhal said the bitcoin blockchain is secured by more computational power than all of Google\'s servers combined, stating that the decentralized hashing power of the network makes it ""impossible to hack and change data"". He added:\n\n""Any data or transactions secured on this network are \'piggy backing\' off the security of the bitcoin network. No amount of money or threats can undo what’s been done without leaving an auditable trail.""\n\nMany uses on the horizon\n\nFactom’s solution can be used to monitor document versions and prove data lineage.\n\nGovernment transparency can be increased through the use of publishing cryptographic hashes during each step of a mission-critical business process. This provides an irrefutable “proof of existence” and establishes a standard of care.\n\n“In large organizations and within governments, data transactions between disparate systems can contain incorrect or inappropriate data. Thus, initiating a reconciliation process and, subsequently, an audit review. As the number of systems multiplies that each have sway over some set of data, settlement becomes increasingly difficult. A shared ledger – or source of truth, if you will – could ensure that transactions and data shared with the core systems are consistent and error free,” Dobhal said.\n\nOther uses of the system could include message authentication mechanisms to fight against message spoofing, anti-phishing for internal and external audiences, and controlling or monitoring document version of various documents or templates used internally and externally by large organizations.\n\nThe backbone of governments\n\nDobhal believes blockchain technology will evolve into a commonly used protocol to secure both data and transactions throughout society.\n\nThe strengths of the technology mean it will become the de facto standard for audit and compliance.\n\n“I imagine a \'blockchain backbone\' will be deployed across a lot of public and private systems to record and prove data as well as financial transactions,"" Dobhal said.\n\nHe added that the financial, supply chain, manufacturing and retail sectors could all benefit from the use of blockchain technology.\n\n""Pretty much everywhere data sharing takes place, blockchain has the potential to make it more efficient, create faster settlements and thereby higher economic activity with less corruption and fraud. Apart from that, it will lead to us living in more honest and transparent societies,” he concluded.\n\nBribe image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The decision was cheered by the bitcoin community across the world. However, at least one government is not happy about it for sure.\n\nThe increased popularity of bitcoin has got governments thinking of innovative ways to gain revenue out of it. Unfortunately, the only way for governments to do so is either in the form of fees, taxes or fines. Taxes are the most attractive ones as it provides a constant stream of revenue to the treasury. Like United States, Sweden tried doing something similar by applying VAT on bitcoin trade executed at bitcoin exchanges. For their disappointment it was shot down twice for good.\n\nIt all started with David Hedqvist, a Swedish resident requesting for clarification on VAT policy for bitcoin exchanges. In response to his request, the Swedish high court conducted an inquiry and ruled that VAT should not be applicable to buying and selling bitcoin over bitcoin exchanges in the country. While David got his answer, the Swedish tax authorities, known as Skatteverket objected to it and appealed to the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe European Court of Justice on Thursday ruled that bitcoin exchanges should indeed by exempted from VAT. This ruling adds weightage to the argument that bitcoin is no less than traditional cash and it has attained a mainstream status in few regions across the world. VAT exemption on bitcoin exchanges resonates with similar existing exemptions enjoyed by exchanges that deal only with conventional currencies.\n\nThe European Court of Justice, with this ruling has partially clarified the taxation regime applicable to bitcoin. Even though it has not managed to clear the confusion surrounding bitcoin regulations, it has reduced the confusion to an extent.\n\nThere are no clear taxation rules on bitcoin across the world. In United States, bitcoin falls under a lot of different categories. Bitcoin is considered as currency, commodity, money and property by various different government agencies, attracting different regulations and tax slabs depending upon the operations conducted by people using bitcoin.', 'The price of Bitcoin is surging towards the $300 USD price range. Over the past two weeks, BTC has seen a steady climb from the $260 range to yesterday’s $280 break. Despite breaking this boundary, the digital currency stepped up again to a high of $293 as of press time with no sign of a slowdown just yet.\n\nAlso read: The Potential Impact of Bitcoin on the Luxury E-Commerce Industry\n\nMany have been wondering why the price has been doing so well, and have looked to the world economy. China’s government is moving its economic chess pieces, and the whole world is watching. The interest rates from their centralized banking system have been cut once again, and talks of capital controls being lifted in 2020 show that the country has more moves up its sleeve. With all these announcements, China’s largest exchanges are eating up Bitcoin like candy — bringing prices back up to last October’s levels.\n\nWe all remember last year when there was the sale of 30K worth of bitcoins in the $300 range. The epic Bear-Whale dropped its wealth fast, and the whole world watched as the volume ate through the large sell order. Today, the price is moving towards the same trajectory. U.S. trading has remained steady with not much of a significant volume boost. However, the dollar has been extremely sluggish over the past three weeks, and the U.S. economy’s numbers don’t look so hot. Confidence in the dollar has been weak and markets have reached record lows this past year. The anonymous writer at Zerohedge wonders what will happen when Federal Reserve goes broke, as it looks like its capital is waning. With the U.S. and China teeter tottering over the past few months, safe haven assets like Bitcoin and gold are being discussed heavily.\n\nWith Bitcoin remaining very stable over the course of the past few months, people are finally seeing its value become stronger. The Digital Currency Group (DCG) founder Barry Silbert is bullish on the price, as he recently told a group of investors in Palo Alto, California that “the price will be higher.” The DGC founder is very positive about the digital currency’s course currently and believes the virtual money will continue to emerge as a solid store of value. With BTC showing strong upward pressure, quite a few people see little resistance to a continued rise.\n\nSome feel that there may be some liquidation when the U.S. government sells the last of the seized Silk Road coins. On November 5th, 21 separate contained units of 2,000 bitcoins will be sold to the highest bidders during the federal auction. This will put over 44 thousand new coins into the public market and its possible the price will be affected.\n\nHowever, people have also taken into consideration the future reward halving coming to the network in July of 2016. The anticipated event will cut the miners block rewards to 12.5 bitcoins as opposed to 25, making the currency more difficult to harvest. With only 21 million available units and close to 15 million of them currently found, it’s believed that the price will increase drastically due to the fact the currency will be limited. Even though the theory makes sense, some do not share the community’s optimism towards the halving and feel that it won’t affect things much at all. Litecoin has halved its reward and saw no significant price advance; some look to this as a testament of the future even though the market supply is completely different.\n\nDuring the end of this write-up, Bitcoin has seen some slight resistance and has dipped a touch back to USD $289. There may be a slight correction over the course of the next 24 hours with the strain of people selling at the new high points. The patterns resemble trending sell pressure with consistent small upside waves that have been keeping the trajectory upwards in value. People will be looking to the beginning of the global market trading this coming week with booms and busts seemingly evident. The question is with the BTC price value increasing, will the trend continue towards the moon? The digital currency has reached a milestone 12 hour period with its push breaking the $280 range with many debating why this is happening.\n\nHow do you feel about the price rise during the past two weeks?

But the Facebook founder and chief executive “had another conversation in mind”, he recalls. The billionaire was there to offer Mr Marcus the chance to lead a team that was a fraction of the size of the 15,000-strong army he commanded as head of PayPal, swapping the title of president for the lesser one of vice-president, messaging products in the process. It did not take him long to say yes. Forget any thought of demotion. Mr Marcus was seduced by what he calls a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to transform Facebook’s Messenger tool into “a new platform at the scale of billions of people”. And after 15 months in charge, he is delivering on some of this Silicon Valley hyperbole. Now a standalone product, Messenger has grown from 300m to 700m monthly active users and is no longer simply a text message replacement service that helps Facebook keep users from straying to rival chat apps. Its expansion has included the launch of a service aimed at improving the ability of retailers and other companies to interact with customers via the Messenger app. In August he launched a trial of M, a virtual assistant that combines human and artificial intelligence to service users’ whims. Sitting beneath a poster of an angry, anthropomorphic burger — an emoji, or symbol, that can be sent on Messenger — in his personal conference room at Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters, Mr Marcus says the nature of his current job is very different to his previous role. “It is no secret that while I was running PayPal, I was operating a pretty big, deep, cultural shift, and at the scale of 15,000 plus people, it is not easy every day. So you spend 90 per cent of your energy and your time just rewiring the culture.” At PayPal, he once scolded employees for not installing their own app — a faux pas that is less likely to occur at Facebook’s growing “family”, where workers enthusiastically embrace the social network as a way of life. He has a favourite emoji — a ninja — which he often sends to his team when they are doing a good job, and he is often seen in a Messenger T-shirt. Today, he is in a pale blue shirt, dark jeans and expensive-looking shoes. Eager to return to his roots as an entrepreneur, he says it felt “natural” to be experimenting with a new product and a nimbler team of 200, albeit with the resources of one of the world’s largest technology companies behind him. “Here I spend really 90 per cent of my time not focused on how we’re going to do the things we need to do, but rather, what are the best things we can do to advance the product and to create more experiences for people,” he says. “To delight” is a verb almost as in vogue in Silicon Valley as “to disrupt”, but the M virtual assistant does have eye-catching potential. Only a few hundred Bay Area residents are trialling it, to get a broken-down car towed, say, or to research childcare options. But some industry experts have hailed it as a potential replacement for search engines. “It is fascinating how people outside tech companies can label those things as way bigger than how we see it,” Mr Marcus says, before declaring that the company does indeed have “big ambitions”.

Unlike rivals Siri and Cortana, M uses both an algorithm and a team of people to process requests. Instead of just finding information, it can take action: making reservations at a restaurant, for example. If the machine is unsure whether it is able to complete the task by itself, it forwards it to a human. The algorithm learns from what the human does, meanwhile, and gets cleverer by the day. Mr Marcus likes to use M to send thank-you gifts like flowers. He rejects any idea that the AI tool will outgrow its human helpers rapidly: “I think humans will be involved for a very long run — even the very, very long run.” He is cautious, however, saying it is “very early days”, but remains confident that what they are trying to achieve is far more useful than Apple’s Siri, Google Now or Microsoft’s Cortana. He claims these voice-powered assistants are “not very useful, but very scaleable”, while M is “extremely useful, but not very scaleable”. The challenge is to make M both. Artificial intelligence is a long way from buying and selling Swatch watches, Mr Marcus’ first business as a teenager growing up in Switzerland. Most of his former classmates work in finance, but he followed a less typically Swiss path: learning basic code aged eight, dropping out of university in Geneva and starting his first tech company. He ended up doing premium SMS voting for television shows including Nouvelle Star in France and Pop Idol in the UK. Moving to Silicon Valley in 2008 has proved to be the right decision, Mr Marcus says in his American-inflected English. “I always felt that if you wanted to really have an impact and make it big, you had to come here,” he says. It is hard to grow a technology company in Europe, with less venture capital, many more languages and a substantial bureaucracy, he says, before adding that the UK and Berlin are exceptions. He wishes Europe would welcome more innovation in technology rather than adopting a protectionist approach and creating complex regulations that change across borders. The current situation “is actually persuading local European entrepreneurs to come here, which is very unfortunate”, he says. Mr Marcus is not an unabashed cheerleader for Silicon Valley, however. He is concerned there could be a “mini-bubble” in funding for late-stage private companies and warns that the valuations that hit the headlines are not necessarily as transparent as they would be in the public markets. “I think that the public markets are pretty healthy. I think the valuations of some of the late-stage private companies are problematic in some ways.” Facebook is well loved by Wall Street: its shares are up more than 150 per cent since it listed in 2012 and revenue is forecast to grow 38 per cent this year to $17.2bn. Facebook Messenger will provide a new revenue stream when it begins to make money, most likely by using Messenger for Business to charge retailers to get back in contact with past customers with promotions or suggestions about products they might have run out of. How Messenger makes money could provide an important role model for the other messaging service owned by Facebook. WhatsApp, bought last year for $22bn, is run independently by its founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton from an office in neighbouring Mountain View. Mr Marcus meets them regularly, though not over a European-style lunch, he notes sadly. If he pulls off the monetisation of Messenger, he could extend his influence to another almost 1bn-or-so people on WhatsApp. “Hopefully we’ll find something that works as far as an eventual business model for both of us,” he says. “But TBD [to be decided] at this point in time.” Second opinion: The former colleague David Marcus is a “mensch”, says Hill Ferguson, who met him shortly after he moved to the US and worked with him at his start-up Zong, and then at PayPal. “He can be a great, persuasive person around a vision but he combines that with being a genuinely solid person — or a ‘mensch’, as he would say — and he really is that in the truest sense of the word\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009A lot of people in Silicon Valley are very smart and can see parts of the future but they are missing that human element,” Mr Ferguson says.', 'Kathrin Hille in Moscow OCTOBER 25, 2015 70 Any western leader who launched a military operation abroad in the middle of a stinging recession would have a hard time convincing the nation to pay for it. But as the Russian government sent its draft budget for 2016 to the Duma on Friday night, nobody even mentioned President Vladimir Putin’s bombing campaign in Syria. Low oil prices, a weak rouble and western sanctions have caused the country’s economy to contract by 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year and, as Russia relies on oil-related revenues for half of its budget, this has forced some belt-tightening. Pensions, for example, will increase by no more than 4 per cent next year, according to the budget — far short of the inflation rate of 12 per cent. Despite all this, Moscow can easily afford its military operation in Syria — both because it is cheap compared with similar endeavours by the US, and because 17 consecutive years of funding increases and an opaque budget have helped to fill the military’s pockets, say defence experts. Even if Russia continued its air strikes at the current level for a full year, it would use less than 3 per cent of the funds budgeted for national defence in 2016, according to IHS Jane’s, the defence research group, and Financial Times calculations. “We believe a campaign like the one they are running there right now would cost between $2.3m and $4m a day,” said Ben Moores, senior analyst at IHS Jane’s. A sum of Rbs3.15tn ($51bn) has been earmarked for national defence expenditure next year. The government reversed some earlier planned defence budget cuts this week, so the 2016 draft defence budget marks a 0.8 per cent increase over this year, but both as a share of total public spending and of gross domestic product, it is decreasing slightly for the first time in years. However, more than a quarter of this year’s budget was earmarked for military expenditure, and vast parts of the military budget are secret. This absence of public oversight and of a visible financial burden allows Mr Putin to continue or even expand his high-profile geopolitical challenge to the west. On the back of constant state television coverage, which describes Russia’s three-week bombing campaign in Syria as a fight against evil, the independent pollster Levada found that support for Moscow’s military action had soared from a mere 14 per cent in late September to more than 70 per cent. Mr Putin’s support ratings had hit an all-time high of 89.9 per cent, state-backed pollster VTsIOM said this week. Mr Moores’ calculation of the war cost is based on the assumption that Russia has 36 fighter aircraft and 20 helicopters at its Latakia air base which fly an average of 30 sorties a day and drop five bombs per sortie. In addition, he takes into account the presence of at least 1,500 soldiers deployed, plus naval support. According to IHS data, Russia could sustain its troops in Syria at little more than one-tenth of the roughly $4m it costs the US per day to support the same number of soldiers in Afghanistan. This is because Russia can save fuel by sustaining the troops by sea, its soldiers’ salaries, food and medical bills are lower, and the military personnel are believed to be concentrated at base rather than spread out in combat. According to recent figures released by the Pentagon, the US has so far spent roughly $4bn in its 14-month campaign against Isis Islamist fighters — roughly $10m a day. Other foreign and Russian defence experts said it was impossible to calculate the cost of the Syria intervention accurately, due to Moscow’s opaque defence budget. But they agree that it is likely to be minuscule compared with total military spending. This [Syria campaign spending] is going to just disappear in the huge black hole that is our country’s military budget Vasily Zatsepin, Gaidar Institute “This [Syria campaign spending] is going to just disappear in the huge black hole that is our country’s military budget,” said Vasily Zatsepin, an expert on military economics at the independent Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy in Moscow. “The transparency of our defence spending is decreasing from one defence minister to the next.” Russia’s national defence budget accounts for 78 per cent of the country’s total military expenditure, which is expected to hit 5.42 per cent of GDP this year, according to Julian Cooper, an expert on Russian military spending at the University of Birmingham. The military spends each year an amount equivalent to 60 per cent of the national defence budget on arms procurement, maintenance and development. In depth Syria crisis Western policymakers and strategists are trying to figure out what Vladimir Putin’s military goals are in Syria — and if he intends to help the Assad regime regain territory lost to opposition forces  Further reading A senior government official said the cost of the Syria operation was expected to be covered by reducing the number and scale of domestic military exercises. The ministry of defence does not disclose details on the cost of such exercises. IHS’s calculations exclude the launch of 26 cruise missiles against Syrian insurgents on October 7, Mr Putin’s birthday. A Russian official said the use of the missiles was “very expensive”, but defence experts noted that a smaller number would have been launched as part of an exercise anyway. Russian military experts said several other military expenditure categories also offered reserves that could be used for the Syria war. “Even though the Russian armed forces officially have 1m personnel, everybody knows that the real number is closer to 850,000, but the ministry of finance still provides funds for 1m,” said Ruslan Pukhov, head of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Russian defence think-tank. Funds claimed by the ministry of defence for expenditure such as bonuses for soldiers could be channelled into the war effort, he said. Russia — a game changer in Syrian war? Play video Several defence analysts added that an expected slowdown in procurements under a multiyear armaments programme would free up money for the Syria campaign. Moreover, they expect that Moscow is lowering the cost of the war by using expired ammunition stocks and making Syria foot at least part of the Russian air force’s fuel bill.

A collapse in the price of oil since June 2014 is taking its toll on the investment management industry, as oil-producing countries pull money from their wealth funds to make up for a loss of export earnings. Of the world’s 50 sovereign wealth funds, which collectively oversee about $6.5tn, one-third have reported a reduction in their invested assets. Of those affected, half derive their capital from oil, according to data provider Preqin. So far this year, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency — the world’s third-largest sovereign fund with $661bn invested — has withdrawn about $70bn from external asset managers. One manager likened the outflow of funds to a stock market crash — calling it “our Black Monday”. But, now, this loss of business is being exacerbated by sovereign wealth funds’ desire to cut the cost of investing — and cut ties with third-party managers. Some believe they can do a better job of managing their money themselves, at a fraction of the price. Azerbaijan’s oil fund, which oversees $37bn of assets, has said in its annual report that it intends to bring the management of all of its assets in-house. It currently has $662m managed by State Street, the US financial services group, and $664m with Swiss bank UBS. Similarly, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority — the second-largest sovereign fund globally with $773bn of assets — has also grown its in-house teams. It reduced its allocations to investment managers from 75 per cent to 65 per cent last year — in effect, a $77bn outflow from external fund houses. A spokesperson for one large sovereign wealth fund, who did not want to be named, said: “We have been building our in-house capabilities for a number of years. This has been happening across all asset classes.” According to a new report from Moody’s, the rating agency, the damage to asset managers’ revenues will be lasting. “Our view is that if the oil price stays where it is, these [oil-rich] funds will continue to take reserves back,” says Rory Callagy, vice-president of investor services at Moody’s. “We don’t foresee material increases in oil prices over the next several quarters. Longer term, that’s a trend we view to be negative for the [asset management] sector.” Moody’s also warns that sovereign wealth funds taking money in-house represents a long-term trend — and, those that still use external managers are “being more aggressive about negotiating prices”. Gary Smith, head of sovereign wealth funds at Barings, the UK asset manager, agrees. “Most [sovereign] funds have a long-term plan to take the management of their money in-house,” he says. “They hire asset managers to learn about products and the end destination is to [run money] internally.” A recent report by Deutsche Bank on sovereign wealth funds concludes that this trend is likely to dent management fees. “This may pose a big challenge to the asset management industry,” the authors warn. Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the asset management consultancy, says: “Large asset managers will be hit the most, since sovereign wealth funds tend to prefer well-known brands. They will suffer a double whammy: loss of fees and falling asset values.” State Street has already been badly affected. It suffered $65bn of outflows in the second quarter of the year, which it blamed partly on clients’ need for cash “due to lower commodity prices”. BlackRock also appears to have been hurt by withdrawals. It reported a net outflow of $24bn from Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter — which market participants partly attributed to redemptions from sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf. Capital markets Sovereign funds wake up to fiscal reality Lower oil prices expose Saudi Arabia more than Norway, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Read more After BlackRock’s results earlier this month, one analyst asked for clarity on “how diversified BlackRock’s exposure is between commodity-related sovereign wealth funds and non-commodity related funds”. In reply, BlackRock president Robert Kapito said: “That’s a great question and it is a question I’m not going to answer because I don’t talk about my clients.” Most fund management companies are similarly reluctant to discuss withdrawals by sovereign wealth funds. Invesco, Baillie Gifford, Investec and Aberdeen, as well as BlackRock, all decline to comment. Asset management arms at JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and UBS also prefer not to discuss the issue. One fund group would say only that sovereign wealth fund outflows “hit a little close to home for us”. Equally, the oil-rich sovereign funds of Norway, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Nigeria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia declined to comment. Of the few asset managers willing to speak, the message is one of reassurance. Gavin Ralston, head of official institutions at Schroders, Europe’s largest listed fund house, says his company has not witnessed “any oil-related withdrawals of assets managed for sovereign wealth funds”. Mr Smith also denies that Barings has experienced outflows from sovereign wealth clients. He does concede, however, that there has been “a slowdown in new activity” from sovereign wealth fund investors.', 'Publicado 25/10/2015 11:37:34 CET\n\nEl juez González cree que hay riesgo de fuga por parte de los jefes de Unetenet\n\nMADRID, 25 Oct. (EUROPA PRESS) -\n\nEl juez de la Audiencia Nacional Juan Pablo González ha acordado el ingreso prisión provisional, comunicada y sin fianza, de una pareja que fundó la empresa Unetenet acusada de estafar más de 28 millones de euros a 50.000 personas que logró captar en todo el mundo y a las que convenció de que obtendrían grandes beneficios a través de una falsa moneda virtual que convertiría sus inversiones en dinero.\n\nEl magistrado ha dictado un auto en el que acuerda el envío a prisión de José Manuel Ramírez Marco y Pilar Otero Sánchez por presuntos delitos de integración en organización criminal, estafa y blanqueo de capitales, al ser los ""máximos responsables"" de un complejo entramado financiero utilizado para desviar los fondos defraudados.\n\nEl titular del Juzgado Central de Instrucción número 3 reconoce que ambos viajaron desde el extranjero para declarar voluntariamente ante el juzgado, pero considera que existe un ""riesgo de fuga"" y de destrucción de pruebas, teniendo en cuenta la gravedad de los hechos y el ""elevado"" importe de los fondos que han depositado en el exterior y que podrían servir a los ""miembros del grupo familiar"" para huir.\n\nEn sendos autos, el juez señala que ambos formaron un grupo criminal dedicado a la comisión de una ""estafa piramidal masiva"" a través de sus empresas Union Business Online Ltd, radicada en el país caribeño San Vicente de Granadinas, y su filial Unetenet, con domicilio social en Rincón de la Victoria (Málaga).\n\nCONSEGUIR ""DINERO FÁCIL"" DESDE CASA\n\nUnetenet, en cuya página web se puede leer su eslogan \'Tu éxito desde Casa\', promete conseguir ""dinero fácil"" dedicando solamente ""unos minutos al día trabajando desde casa, sin desplazamientos y con unos beneficios inalcanzables en cualquier otro trabajo"". Según el juez, la función del cliente consistía en invertir sus ahorros, publicitar la marca en las redes sociales y animar a amigos y familiares a participar en el negocio.\n\nEl magistrado desgrana el \'modus operandi\' de los acusados, quienes se ponían en contacto con otros responsables intermedios que, a sabiendas del fraude --muchos de ellos habían participado antes en otras estafas piramidales--, participan desde agosto de 2012 en charlas formativas, reuniones, actos y vídeos para dar a conocer Unetenet y lograr el ""máximo número de socios/víctimas"".\n\n""Se intenta convencer a la masa, a través de esos actos, de los beneficios que les aportará el publicitar los servicios de Unetenet, beneficios a conseguir previa compra de una serie de packs que les dará pie para posteriormente ofrecer la publicidad de Unetenet, empezar a generar ingresos y, a través del \'back office\' particular de cada uno (argot utilizado por los fundaores), tener acceso a la zona privada de Unetenet y comprobar el estado de los anuncios puestos y las gananciavs conseguidas"", explica el juez.\n\nSegún recoge, las ganancias conseguidas irían en proporción con el pack contratado y pagado previamente por la víctima. Por ejemplo, Unetenet prometía unos beneficios anuales de 67.600 dólares con una inversión de 18.000, todo ello prorrateado en 48 pagas semanales de 1.300 dólares cada una, si bien deben abonar mensualmente 59,95 dólares.\n\nLA MONEDA VIRTUAL, ""UNETE""\n\nUna segunda fase de la estafa se produjo cuando Union Business Online LTD decidió cambiar ""unilateralmente"" los términos de todos los contratos concertados con sus clientes para abonar los presuntos beneficios a través de una moneda virtual inventada por Ramírez Marcos y Otero, denominada \'Unetecoin\' o \'Unete\'.\n\nEn 2014, indicaron que los clientes debían ""vender la nueva moneda al precio que estimaran conveniente, dejando de esta forma que sean los propios usuarios los que se tengan que encargar de recuperar su inversión inicial"".\n\nDe este modo, el juez resume que el ""cebo"" empleado por la empresa consistió en ""embaucar y engañar a miles de usuarios, que nunca podrán recuperar su aportación inicial"" con promesas de ""grandes dividendos"" después de que ingresaran su dinero en cuentas bancarias situadas en distintos países, muchos de ellos en paraísos fiscales.\n\nLa denuncia de un antiguo trabajador de la empresa y otras presentadas por los estafados provocó la detención el pasado julio de veinte personas acusadas de estafar a más de 50.000 personas, 6.000 de ellas residentes en España. La Policía Nacional detuvo a dos personas en Madrid, una en Valencia, dos en la provincia de Málaga, ocho en la provincia de Sevilla, otra en Langreo (Asturias), dos en la provincia de Alicante y cuatro en Arrecife (Las Palmas).']"
10/26/2015,"['Credit card companies and banks are getting serious—or at least more curious—about the potential of bitcoin, making an increasing number of investments in startups involved with the digital currency.\n\nAmerican Express late last week confirmed it participated in a $12 million Series A funding round for Abra, a service that makes it easier to send money between countries using the technology underlying bitcoin, called blockchain. Cross-border money transfers are viewed as an area where the technology could be particularly useful, given that conventional methods are costly and slow.\n\nThe move by AmEx—its first investment in the digital currency—underscores how traditional financial institutions are at least taking initial steps toward understanding and incorporating bitcoin into some aspects of their business. However, they’re still wary about diving in headfirst, due to an unclear regulatory environment and a lack of mainstream interest.\n\nBlockchain startup Chain raised a $30 million Series B round last month, with big names like Visa, Nasdaq, and Citi taking part in the investment. Chain also partnered with Nasdaq for a pilot program in which private shares could be traded using blockchain technology. Another startup, R3CEV, has partnered with 22 of the biggest banks in the world, including Bank of America, Citi, BNY Mellon, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, BBVA, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan. Not much is known about R3CEV, but it’s focused on understanding the different uses of bitcoin and blockchain in order to find the best applications for the technology in the banking world.', ""Bitcoin price and market value have been less than volatile for the majority of 2015, but a Bitcoin bull market run has been started in China recently. The last two weeks have seen price values increase as much as 20%, peaking at US$295 on Sunday. This coincides with recent currency market manipulations of the Chinese Yuan/Reminbi by the Chinese government.\n\nIf you don’t know why the Bitcoin market is up, it's probably China\n\nIn the West, speculation of why Bitcoin has been on a “bull run” have centered around the recent EU VAT tax ruling in Bitcoin’s favor, but nothing correlates directly to the spike like the moves made in China. Provided by ZeroHedge in the chart below, you can see the positive effect the Chinese capital controls have had on bitcoin demand.\n\nOddly, Bitcoin demand has been much more linear and consistent in its movement than gold has been worldwide since actions began September 15, and gold has fallen recently while bitcoin has accelerated upwards.\n\nAs Cyprus, Argentina and Greece have already discovered recently, massive capital controls by the central government are counter-productive. Bitcoin provides an excellent way to move money abroad, and hedge against inflation, so any panic in the Chinese markets plays in Bitcoin’s favor.\n\nInvesting in gold is always a popular option in China, but moving gold overseas is not. Bitcoin has a natural advantage in mobility that gold will never share as the word seems to be realizing this fact out in the East, along with Chinese funds, moving from banks into bitcoin.\n\nCrackdown on Underground Banking in and around China\n\nThe official capital controls by the Chinese government dictate that the citizenry can only take US$50,000 out of the country annually, or just 20,000 Yuan or about US$3,200 daily. Businesses can only exchange the Yuan for foreign currency with government approval. This has caused many workarounds, such as considerable real estate investment in the U.S., London, Canada and other locales. Also, the gambling Mecca of Macau is a common destination for those seeking an escape from the grips of The State.\n\nAdding the desired amount of funds to you common UnionPay debit card, a Chinese citizen can very easily make a trip to Macau and make a $50,000 purchase work for them. Any number of store clerks and jewelry shops will run a transaction for HK$300,000 (US$50,000) and hand you cash. The receipt would be billed as a “general sale” purchase, and this can be done over and over again. Even Chinese politicians have used these measures themselves to get around the system.\n\nThis has led to Chinese officials intensifying a crackdown on such “underground banks,” where Chinese nationals shift money in and out of the country to skirt capital controls. Meng Qingfeng, China’s Vice Minister of Public Security, is urging police around the country to better coordinate with the Central Bank in the campaign, which will run through the end of November. Thus, seeing Bitcoin being used more and more as an option instead of these “underground banks” is reasonable to assume, and values may reflect that in the short-term.\n\nPlus, new capital controls instituted by the PBOC (People’s Bank of China) started October 15, and that’s precisely when bitcoin values really started heading towards US$300. It requires banks to use a type of financial contract, known as currency forwards, to buy dollars while selling Yuan to set aside reserves with the Central Bank. Under the new requirement, a bank that has sold a total of $100 of the so-called currency forwards over the course of a month must deposit $20 at the Central Bank. The reserves will be held at zero interest for a year.\n\nDisintermediation\n\nNow, Bitcoin can be added to the list of options for those in a wealthy, cash-rich Chinese market, erasing so many middlemen and trips out of the mainland.\n\nChina’s need to keep funds in the country to pump up a weakening domestic market may be indirectly inflating the global Bitcoin market. It is estimated that over US$22 trillion is on deposit in Chinese banks, with it being the second largest economy on Earth. If any fraction of this value moves towards the US$4 billion Bitcoin market, the market force could change the digital currency’s economy forever. China alone can make the price spike of 2013 look like a minor accounting error within a couple of months’ time.\n\nFor the ardent Bitcoin investor, keep an eye on the financial news and the movement of currencies in the Chinese markets throughout the rest of 2015. They may hold the key to you Bitcoin investments’ financial future."", ""Russia’s Ministry of Finance (MinFin) has proposed jail sentences for the use of cryptocurrency, strengthening its opposition to the technology.\n\nAccording to a press release, those found guilty of using so-called “money surrogates” could face up to four years in prison. Current sentences are limited to a fine of up to 500,000 rubles or 2 years’ community service.\n\nThe latest revision to the law has received the support of the Ministry of Economic Development and will be put before the Duma in the coming months, finance journal Vesti reports.\n\nThe assistant to the minister of economic development Elena Lashkina meanwhile reiterated the official stance to local publication Izvestiya:\n\n“The use of money surrogates, including cryptocurrency, carries a high level of risk [...] [and] creates the conditions for the involvement of citizens and companies in illegal activity, including the legalization (laundering) of financial proceeds from criminal and terrorist operations.”\n\nThe renewed push to criminalize cryptocurrency usage outright by MinFin still runs in contrast to the position of the Central Bank, which has thus far advocated a wait-and-see approach to any legislation.\n\nRussian attitudes towards the legal status of cryptocurrency have in general been mixed, creating a patchwork of uncertainty with industry players unable to speculate on what the future might hold.\n\nSpeaking during a televised forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin conversely stipulated that Bitcoin could be used “in some account,” leading to rumors of an ultimate softening of the official position.\n\n“[… ][A]s an accounting unit, these 'coins' or whatever are they called, they can be used, and their adoption becomes wider and wider,” Putin said. “As some kind of unit in some account, probably, it's possible.”\n\nMeanwhile, payment processor QIWI announced it was developing a blockchain-tech based Bitcoin alternative known as the ‘Bit-Ruble,’ which it says will likely launch in 2016 for use in payment of services attached to its mobile wallet, Vesti adds."", 'A Canadian man who devised an elaborate scheme to defraud elderly U.S. citizens while using monetary transmitters like Western Union and Bitcoin has been caught. Stephan Moskwyn is looking at up to thirty years in federal prison for money laundering and related crimes performed in Southern Florida.\n\nScammed grandparents into thinking relatives were in financial trouble\n\nThe basic premise was simple: Call the large elderly population in Florida from a Canadian call center and purport to be a grandchild or other relative in need of money, due to a legal issue or accident. The callers would have them send the funds in the form of pre-paid debit cards, or money orders via Western Union, which would later be cashed in foreign markets like Chile and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThen “virtual money orders” were converted to Bitcoin by Moskwyn. He had bought pre-paid debit cards in Miami-Dade and Broward counties to execute the scams, which is when he met with witnesses who were working for federal law enforcement, according to documents submitted to the court. Those who were scammed would even go the extra mile to help, sending more funds than requested multiple times, according to federal investigators.\n\nU.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer said:\n\n""This scam exploited the kindness and trust of elderly American citizens by convincing them that loved ones were in trouble and needed money […] Criminals who engage in these scams must know that they are not safe from prosecution, merely because they operate from foreign countries or use virtual currencies.""\n\nMoskwyn spent times traveling between Miami, Chile and the Dominican Republic, buying more pre-paid debit cards when he was in Miami. He was finally arrested by the authorities last week on one of his flights between Chile and the Dominican Republic, during a layover in Miami. Moskwyn will be arraigned in the coming days.', 'An all-star AMA session on forum.bitcoin.com with many top names in the Bitcoin industry will begin November 2nd, and continue throughout the month.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'With the recent announcement of the Blockchain Alliance “A Public-Private Forum to Help Combat Criminal Activity on the Blockchain” founded by Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce, CoinTelegraph highlights some recent events overlooked by the Bitcoin industry that immediately precipitated the announcement including an FBI “playbook” and European seizure survey.\n\nEver since Let’s Talk Bitcoin broke the story in June 2013 that the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) seized 11.02 bitcoin from a bitcoin user, the internet has been aflutter what exactly it means to seize bitcoin and the extent of control that law enforcement has over everyone’s favorite cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the time, Bitcoin superstar Andreas M. Antonopoulos stated that “There is no indication the Bitcoin protocol was compromised. “Seizure” is probably a word used to imply that money was received in the process of a Silk Road sting operation, rather than actually bitcoin seized from the user\'s wallet.""\n\nAndreas’ words still hold true today. At its core, literally Bitcoin core, it is not possible to seize bitcoin. However, it is possible to seize bitcoin depending on how a Bitcoin user interacts with the cryptocurrency (including sending it to law enforcement unbeknownst to the user -- as was likely the case of the seizure discussed above).\n\nTrack Record\n\nOf note, the most upvoted stories in r/Bitcoin on Reddit right after the Blockchain Alliance announcement was a Tweet by Andreas M. Antonopoulos:\n\n“Blockchain Alliance is a terrible idea. Spend money fighting poverty, not phantom threats used as excuses to fund war and surveillance […] Bitcoin is economic inclusion, global access and anti-poverty. If you want to help law enforcement, blow the whistle on a fat cat banker.""\n\nAnd a post by Bruce Fenton, the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation:\n\n“Friends: the Blockchain Alliance isn\'t a debate over whether we should engage government or not, it\'s about whether this particular form of engagement is helpful or harmful.”\n\nLast summer, “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” covered Civil Forfeiture for HBO in a shocking YouTube video with a tagline “Did you know police can just take your stuff if they suspect it\'s involved in a crime? They can! It’s a shady process called ’civil asset forfeiture,’ and it would make for a weird episode of Law and Order. See?” This was tempered by a response by the Department of Justice earlier this year with an order by Attorney General Eric Holder, “Prohibit[ing] Federal Agency Adoptions of Assets Seized by State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies except where needed to Protect Public Safety.”\n\nThe FBI\n\nIn September the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Law Enforcement Bulletin “Virtual Currency: Investigative Challenges and Opportunities.” Calling law enforcement’s interdiction in a crime an “opportunity” is a bit baffling if you stand back and look at this choice of words (that said I almost made the exact opposite argument in “United States to Monitor Canadian Border for Illicit Drug-Related Bitcoin Transactions”).\n\nIn the bulletin is a section entitled “Virtual Currency Seizure,” which essentially is an FBI playbook for seizing bitcoin. It notes that “Prosecutors may forfeit bitcoin through existing asset forfeiture laws as proceeds of criminal activity or as property involved in money-laundering violations.”\n\nIt further explains the intricacies of seizing bitcoin:\n\n“Seizing bitcoin will require law enforcement officers to take hold of or otherwise gain lawful access to the electronic media where the wallet resides (e.g., on a laptop, thumb drive, or server). The Bitcoin address also may be recorded as printed ‘QR’ codes or strings of letters and numbers, known as a paper wallet. The bitcoin immediately should be transferred to a government-controlled wallet, and the media holding the wallet should be segregated and stored without connection to the Internet. Merely seizing the wallet and storing it as evidence is insufficient because backup wallets may exist online or in another location. If the bitcoin are not moved to a government-controlled wallet, they may be transferred by a third party using a backup wallet; in that case, the original seized wallet no longer will hold any value. If a third-party business holds bitcoin in an e-wallet, investigators must serve process on the business just as one would serve a seizure warrant on a financial institution for funds in an account.”\n\nThe bulletin further explains that due to the volatile nature of virtual currencies the bitcoin may be sold before an investigation is finalized:\n\n“[…] Due to the volatile nature of virtual currency, prosecutors should consider obtaining a stipulation for interlocutory sale where possible, which will permit the sale of the virtual currency prior to completion of the forfeiture. In the event law enforcement officers seize a large quantity of virtual currency, prosecutors should consider breaking it up into smaller batches for sale after forfeiture or an order for interlocutory sale […].”\n\nWhile the article does portray the government (in particular the FBI) as being particularly savvy, it is has always been interesting to note that the first ever bitcoin seizure involves a case of mistaken identity as noted in “DEA Seizes Bitcoin: Seizure Points to Earlier Mistaken Identity.” Moreover, a recent survey from the Council of Europe reveals that not all governments are prepared to respond to Bitcoin related crimes.\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nThe Council of Europe, which according to Wikipedia is a “regional intergovernmental organization, which promotes human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in its 47 member states, covering 820 million citizens) issued a questionnaire/report a day after the FBI bulletin.\n\nThrough The European Committee on Crime Problems Committee of Experts on the Operation of European Convention on Co-Operation in Criminal Matters, a questionnaire entitled “Questionnaire on the use and efficiency of CoE instruments as regards international cooperation in the field of seizure and confiscation of proceeds of crime, including the management of confiscated goods and asset sharing” provides an overview of Bitcoin seizure capabilities in Europe.\n\nThis included a question: “is your state in a position to provide assistance in procedures related to virtual currencies such as bitcoins, especially as regards seizure and confiscation?”\n\nA summary table of responses was included in the report and it is included below:\n\nState Assistance Comment Andorra Yes All proceeds of crime Azerbaijan No No Belgium Yes In principle Bulgaria No Finland Unknown Germany Yes German law considers bitcoins to be objects which are subject to confiscation (section 73 (1), first sentence, StGB) Norway Yes Criminal Procedure Act, chapter 16 Sweden Yes No experience Switzerland No experience Turkey Yes Ukraine Yes United Kingdom Yes Order on the value of bitcoin. The UK can also restrain virtual currencies depending on the nature of how they are held\n\n\n\nDigging into the actual responses provided to the survey reveals some gaps in governments’ ability to “control” Bitcoin. Finland’s actual response to this question was “No idea, really” German and United Kingdom’s responses were as follows:', 'Colorado’s marijuana businesses are having a hard time creating a bank. The Federal Reserve said that because the substance is federally banned they don’t want to work with the money involved with it. Now a hopeful Colorado credit union stands as a vacant building while the reefer industry shakes its head. Andrew Freedman, director of marijuana coordination for Colorado was feeling very frustrated saying:\n\n“We tried to do the most with the building blocks of instructions they sent us, set up the most rigorous solution. And we still are left with confusion.”\n\nAlso read: FBI Advises Victims Pay Ransom on Ransomware\n\nThe court filing came from a legal feud between the Federal Reserve and the Fourth Corner Credit Union. Colorado’s cannabis and hemp supporters formed this organization to be the “only credit union in the world constructed from the ground up”. The $700 million-a-year industry can’t open a bank without the authorization from the Federal Reserve who said in its court filing: “transporting or transmitting funds known to have derived from the distribution of marijuana is illegal.”\n\nFounder Mark Mason and a group of entrepreneurs in Colorado wanted to start the first “Marijuana Bank” in history, and one that works within just that ecosystem. The mission statement is to provide a “compliant” set of banking services to those in the cannabis industry. Despite the passion these marijuana activists have, the Federal Reserve says the Credit Union’s “very existence is prohibited by federal law.” The filing claims they won’t arrest bankers who take cannabis funds into their establishment but putting that money into the Federal Reserve system is a different story. The Fed in its court statement said these money deals were much like “trading endangered species or trading with North Korea” which gives the belief that the Reserve detests the pot cash.\n\nIn November 2014 speaking at the Web Summit in Dublin, Gavin Andresen said he believed cryptocurrency and legal marijuana businesses could help each other. “Legal marijuana industries could possibly be one of the big industries for bitcoin,” Andresen said. “It gives marijuana growers a way of charging customers that doesn’t involve cash.” Despite a many outspoken individuals speaking on the same mutual positivity of both industries Patrick Rea, co-founder of CanopyBoulder thinks Bitcoin is not the solution. Rea said in February of 2014: “The banking situation needs to be solved. I don’t think bitcoin is the solution,”\n\nWell, the solution doesn’t seem to be working with the United State Federal Reserve. Most banks want nothing to do with the marijuana industry and have clearly stated they have no intentions with mixing with the cannabis businesses. Some feel that Bitcoin could help the situation by offering both banking services and lower fees. There is one Colorado cannabis dispensary who only accepts cash and Bitcoin yet most in the marijuana field have believed the opinions of accelerators like the one in Boulder. We now know the opinions of the Feds which is basically your credit union will not fly and you might as well be trading Siberian tiger.\n\nDo you think The Cannabis Industry Needs Bitcoin? Let Us Know In The Comments Below.\n\nImages courtesy of Redmemes and Pixbay\n\nOriginally posted on: Marijuana Industry Could Still Use Bitcoin', 'by\n\nMillions of Bitcoin users store their bitcoins with online exchanges (e.g. Coinbase, Kraken) which store bitcoins on their customers’ behalf. They present an interface that looks somewhat like an online bank, allowing users to log in and request payments to other users or withdrawals. For many users this approach makes a lot more sense than the traditional approach of storing private keys on your laptop or phone and interacting with the Bitcoin network directly. Online exchanges require no software installation, enable a familiar password-based authentication model, and can guard against the risk of losing funds with a stolen laptop. Online exchanges can also improve the scalability and efficiency of Bitcoin by settling many logical transactions between users without actually moving funds on the block chain.\n\nOf course, users must trust these exchanges not to get hacked or simply abscond with their money, both of which happened frequently in the early days of Bitcoin (nearly half of exchanges studied in a 2013 research paper failed). Famously, Mt. Gox was the largest online exchange until 2014 when it lost most of its customers’ funds under murky circumstances.\n\nIt has long been a goal of the Bitcoin community for exchanges to be able to cryptographically prove solvency—that is, to prove that they still control enough bitcoins to cover all of their customers’ accounts. Greg Maxwell first proposed an approach using Merkle trees in 2013, but this requires revealing (at a minimum) the total value of the exchange’s assets and which addresses the exchange controls. Exchanges have specifically cited these privacy risks as a reason they have not deployed proofs of solvency, relying on trusted audit instead.\n\nIn a new paper presented this month at CCS (co-authored with Gaby G. Dagher, Benedikt Bünz, Jeremy Clark and Dan Boneh), we present Provisions, the first cryptographic proof-of-solvency with strong privacy guarantees. Our protocol is suitable for Bitcoin but would work for most other cryptocurrencies (e.g. Litecoin, Ethereum). Our protocol hides the total assets and liabilities of the exchange, proving only that assets are strictly greater than liabilities. If desired, the value of this surplus can be proven. Provisions also hides all customer balances and hides which Bitcoin addresses the bank controls within a configurable anonymity set of other addresses on the block chain. The proofs are large, but reasonable to compute on a daily basis (in the tens of GB for a large exchange, computable in about an hour). Best of all, it is very simple and fast for each user to verify that they have been correctly included. We can even extend the protocol to prevent collusion between exchanges. The details are in the paper, the full version of which is now online.\n\nWhile our Provisions protocol removes the privacy concerns of performing a cryptographic proof-of-solvency, there are still some practical deployment questions because the proof requires the exchange to compute using its private keys. Exchanges rightly go to great lengths to protect these keys, often keeping them offline and/or in hardware security modules. Performing a regular solvency proof requires careful thinking about the right internal procedure for accessing these keys.\n\nThese deployment questions can be solved. We hope that cryptographic proofs of solvency will soon be expected of upstanding exchanges. Incidents like that of Mt. Gox have greatly damaged public perception of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. While solvency proofs can’t prevent exchange compromises, they would have made Mt. Gox’s troubles public earlier and more clearly. They would also shore up confidence in today’s exchanges which are (presumably) solvent.\n\nTaking a step back, solvency proofs are yet another example where we can replace an expensive and trust-laden process in the offline world (financial inspection by a trusted auditor) with a “trustless” cryptographic protocol. It’s always exciting to take a new step in that direction. There remain limits as to what cryptography can do though. Critically, solvency proofs do not create a binding obligation to pay. A malicious exchange could complete a Provisions proof and then immediately abscond with all of the money. For this reason, some form of government regulation of online exchanges makes sense. Though regulation is dreaded by many in the Bitcoin community, it appears to be on the horizon. Bills have been proposed in several states, largely aimed at exchanges. Interestingly, the model regulatory framework proposed by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors in September already mentions cryptographic solvency proofs as a means of demonstrating solvency. We hope this recommendation is enacted in law and solvency proofs are a tool to avoid the cost of the heavyweight auditing requirements traditionally demanded of banks, while simultaneously increasing transparency for exchange customers.', 'Victims of malware, such as bitcoin ransomware Cryptolocker, should just pay off the perpetrators if they want to see their data again, an FBI agent has advised.\n\nAccording to Security Ledger, Acting Special Agent Joseph Bonavolonta, who oversees the bureau\'s Boston office, told C-level executives at Wednesday\'s Cyber Security Summit they\'d be better off stumping up the ransom.\n\nAccording to an FBI report from June, this sum can be anywhere from $200 to $10,000. Bonavolonta said:\n\n""The amount of money made by these criminals is enormous and that’s because the overwhelming majority of institutions just pay the ransom ... To be honest, we often advise people just to pay the ransom.""\n\nPrograms like Cryptolocker and Cryptowall – typically spread through phishing emails – demand bitcoin to unlock files they have encrypted on a user\'s computer.\n\nThe FBI said it had received 992 complaints about (now defunct) Cryptolocker in a 14-month period, with victims reporting losses of $18m. ""Criminals prefer bitcoin because it\'s easy to use, fast, publicly available, decentralized and provides a sense of heightened security/anonymity,"" its report read.\n\nBecause ransomware has found success on such a vast scale, Bonavolonta said attackers are likely to keep their demands low to maximise profit. For this same reason, they are mostly honest, he added: ""You do get your access back.""\n\nNo guarantees\n\nBonavolonta\'s advice comes counter to many public advisories on the subject to date. In 2013, when Cryptolocker first swept the UK, the National Crime Agency (NCA) issued a statement telling businesses not to pay up.\n\n""The NCA would never endorse the payment of a ransom to criminals and there is no guarantee that they would honour the payments in any event,"" its statement read.\n\nIn April, a security researcher from Kaspersky Labs, Jornt van der Wiel, echoed this sentiment, telling CoinDesk: ""As there are few ways to get files back without paying, users often just give in. This is the wrong strategy, but it’s often the easiest for the user.""\n\nOthers, including authorities in The Netherlands, argue that payment actually helps to perpetuate the problem, as it gives malware operators an incentive to continue – and target new victims.\n\nA 2014 study of 39,760 people from security firm ESNET showed that only 1.4% of victims actually paid the Cryptolocker ransom.\n\nWhile some were given access to decryption software, others were not – usually because the full amount hadn\'t been paid.\n\nRansom image via Shutterstock\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated that 1.4% of Cryptolocker victims who paid the ransom were given access to decryption software.

10/27/2015,"['Barry Silbert last week sold SecondMarket, his popular trading exchange for private company stock, to Nasdaq (NDAQ) for an undisclosed amount. Now he’s lined up a group of big-name backers to support the launch of a new conglomerate devoted entirely to bitcoin and other blockchain technologies.\n\nIt’s called Digital Currency Group, and will include a pair of businesses that were originally formed at SecondMarket, but were not part of the sale to Nasdaq. They include Genesis Global Trading, an over-the-counter bitcoin trading firm; and Grayscale Investments, a digital currency asset management firm that manages the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a publicly-listed vehicle that raised over $60 million.\n\nIt also will house a portfolio of 57 seed-stage investments that Silbert and his team have already made, including Chain, Circle, Coinbase, Ripple and Xapo. They also have backed several companies looking to exploit bitcoin’s blockchain technology for uses outside of finance, including Ascribe (managing digital IP) and ShoCard (digital identification). Using CoinDesk data and other public sources, Silbert estimates that the companies he’s made early investments in have gone on to raise nearly 70% of all venture capital that has been pumped into the bitcoin and blockchain markets.\n\n“What we’re building is the largest early-stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain ecosystem,” Silbert explains. “We’re also going to start high-growth businesses of our own, and develop a global platform and network to support our companies.”\n\nDGC is structured as a company rather than as an investment vehicle, in part because Silbert hopes to someday take it public. To that end, he has raised what he refers to as a “very large” new round of funding.\n\nAmong the new investors is MasterCard (MA), which seems to be making its first formal foray into the bitcoin space. The others are: Bain Capital Ventures, CIBC, CME Ventures, FirstMark Capital, New York Life, Novel TMT, Oak HC/FT, RRE Ventures, Solon Mack Capital and Transamerica Ventures.\n\n“We’re still far away from bitcoin being a functional currency, and I don’t think we’ve gotten closer lately,” Silbert says. “First it’s going to function as a speculative investment that will drive up the price and create a larger monetary base that will draw in Wall Street to trade it. Then more merchants will come on board. As it gets more liquid, as a [payment] rail it will become a real alternative to the existing money transfer systems in the world today. I really believe that’s what will happen, and I want DGC to be a big part of it.”\n\nGet Term Sheet, our daily newsletter on deals & deal-makers.', '2015 has been a banner year when it comes to Bitcoin venture capital investment. In the first six months, investment easily eclipsed the total number for all of 2014. Now, the numbers for Q3 show that capital investment is way down from just months ago and Bitcoin startups are feeling the pinch.\n\nWho turned off Bitcoin’s financial faucet?\n\nYou know what they say: once is an occurrence, twice is a trend. The third quarter of 2015 did see a 15% increase over the same period of 2014 -- a good sign -- but a lot has happened in the interim. The fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 saw explosive growth in Bitcoin venture capital investment.\n\nThe chart below shows the VC investment numbers dropping just as fast as they grew in the previous quarters.\n\nThese ebbs and flows are quite unlike the relative stability and lack of volatility Bitcoin has shown in 2015 with its market values. As Bitcoin prepares to pass the US$1 Billion market of total venture capital investment, the slowdown was not totally unexpected by investment experts.\n\n“It is natural that VCs are waiting to see whether their previous investments have panned out before increasing investment,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.\n\nExamples of Bitcoin startups that have struggled recently include BitPay, the largest Bitcoin payment processor, which cut over two dozen staff and contractors last month. BitPay was backed by several venture firms, including Founders Fund. Bitcoin marketplace Buttercoin shut its virtual doors earlier this year, joining many others who have either closed or merged with others to survive.\n\nAll Bitcoin news is bad, far from it, according to Tim Draper of Draper Fisher Jurvetson. They have made Bitcoin investment a core part of their market strategy and are very happy with the results so far. His son, Adam, has used his company, Boost VC, to also back many up-and-comers in the space.\n\n“Our Bitcoin companies are rocking, and there are lots of buyers and not many sellers of bitcoin out there. The transformation is here,” reports Draper to Bloomberg Business.\n\nAdam does see an issue cropping up recently, indicative of the mainstream views of the larger economy. Right now, Bitcoin’s Blockchain is hot, and Bitcoin - not so much. So the approach in a period of adjustment for those looking for capital investment may be in how you pitch your company’s market strategy.\n\n""We use the word blockchain now. I say bitcoin, and they think that\'s the worst thing ever. It just feels like they put up a guard.” Draper told CoinDesk. “Then, I switch to blockchain and they\'re very attentive and they\'re very interested.”\n\nOther investors also see no reason to panic and are also increasing investment in Bitcoin-related businesses like Michael Terpin, who has invested more in Bitcoin in 2015 than he did in 2014.\n\nTerpin:\n\n“There’s a lot of pivoting of companies saying we want to build things for companies on the blockchain. The rate of growth is slowing, and that’s not a surprise. For the most part, we are seeing a mild hiccup. Nothing goes up forever. I don’t think we are in a 2001 crash moment in bitcoin. We are in the 1997 inflection point.”\n\nNeedless to say, this news of reduced Bitcoin investment may influence other investors to watch from the sidelines in Q4. However, the pattern of two quarters of growth followed by the opposing bear market may yield a strong finish to 2015.\n\nIn January, we’ll know the total story for 2015 and it will be a noticeable increase, year over year, regardless. But more importantly, it’s not how much money is invested, but what you get out of it that really counts.', 'BTCC, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in the world, announced its Pro Exchange at a Money 20/20 panel held at The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas.\n\nPro Exchange is a bitcoin margin trading tool that will allow traders to exercise 20x leverage on spot trading.\n\nUnlike BTCC’s regular spot exchange, which might be useful for those who are looking to buy or sell one or two bitcoin, Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, explained that this product is better suited for more experienced traders.\n\n“If you want to buy a lot of bitcoin, it’s a quick way to get a lot really fast,” Lee explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine . Lee explained that miners looking to hedge against price decline, those looking for arbitrage opportunities, and “people who are professional and directional traders would all find the tool useful.”\n\n“We’re the first exchange to launch a radically new trading platform,” Lee said. “We’re going to reinvent the game and not wait to be marginalized. We’re going to disrupt ourselves with this. This is big. This kind of trading will be adopted by other companies, I guarantee you.”\n\nMargin trading is effectively borrowing bitcoin to make trades with it, returning it once an individual’s trade is completed. If a user had 1 BTC and the price appreciated by $10 before selling, their profit would be $10. However, if someone borrowed bitcoin at 20x margin, they’d have 20 bitcoin to trade with. If the price went up by $10, they’d have effectively made $200 profit. Users effectively get more buying power than they physically have to trade with.\n\nThere are two parts to the fee structure that BTCC charges. “There’s a commission once you open a position to go long or go short,” Lee explained. “There’s also the overnight carry fee because of 20x leverage. It’s sort of like an interest rate. It’s very competitive.” More details on pricing can be found on the exchange website.\n\n“It’s also the first platform that allows users to earn interest,” Lee explained. In essence, if a user allows their bitcoin to be lent out to other traders, they will earn interest on the bitcoin based on the fees that BTCC charges.\n\nThe company recently underwent a branding change from BTC China to the now current BTCC. While the Pro Exchange is one of the first products it has launched under this new moniker, the company has many plans coming.\n\n“Our mission is to launch more and more of these convenient and trustworthy digital currency products,” Lee said. “Whether it’s merchant payments, remittance, and our wallet later this year. There’s a bunch of things coming over the horizon.”\n\nPro Exchange is just step one to the company’s goals of building the “world’s greatest company to serve this global bitcoin audience,” Lee said.\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin. He runs a weekly digital currency and blockchain newsletter called Crypto Brief.', 'What do the 1950s military avionics technology and bitcoin mining servers have in common? In a word – heat, or, more precisely, cooling requirements.\n\nBlowing cold air over the innards of military aircraft and satellite electronics 60 years ago was as inefficient as blowing cold air through power-hungry bitcoin mining servers today. It was in the 50s that 3M introduced its first dielectric fluid, which at the time found its first application in cooling avionics systems.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the single biggest application for 3M’s fluids has been in supercomputers, which because of their power density were much better off cooled with liquid than air. Over the last several years, however, as the bitcoin mining industry grew and reached a point where the biggest players were building their own mining hardware and data centers to house it, cooling electronics with dielectric fluid found its second big application.\n\nPower densities in bitcoin mining data centers are radically higher than in data centers that house traditional IT equipment, and operators of these facilities tend to squeeze every last watt and square foot they can out of them. Some of them have found that by bringing bitcoin mining ASICs, or Application Specific Integrated Circuits, in direct contact with dielectric fluid allows them to pack a lot more mining horsepower in a square foot of data center space.\n\nNon-HPC Liquid Cooling at Massive Scale\n\nA data center being built in Georgia (the former Soviet republic) is one of the world’s biggest showcases for the most unusual of approaches to liquid cooling: submerging servers in fluid completely. The facility is being built by the bitcoin mining giant BitFury, and the cooling system was designed by Allied Control, a Hong Kong-based engineering company BitFury recently acquired.\n\nAccording to a case study of the deployment, published this week, BitFury expects its 40 MW facility to support 250 kW per rack at launch. This will not be the power-density limit of the design. The company expects it to support future-generation bitcoin mining hardware that will be even more energy-intensive. For comparison, typical power density of IT gear deployed in traditional enterprise or colocation data centers ranges between 2 kW and 5 kW per rack.\n\nIT racks, in this case, are liquid-filled tanks. The BitFury data center will have 160 of them.\n\nBoiling Servers\n\n3M’s Novec 7100 fluid used in Allied’s design does not transfer heat very well, so it’s not enough to simply flush electronics with it continuously. But it does boil at a relatively low temperature of 142F. When servers submerged in a specially designed tub heat up, the liquid starts boiling, and the resulting gas carries the heat up. Once above the surface, it reaches water-cooled cooling coils, turns back into liquid as its temperature drops, and falls back into the tank.\n\nIllustration by Allied Control\n\n3M actually created the concept itself but made it freely available for anyone to use, which is what Allied did, Michael Garceau, business development manager at 3M, said. The approach is called “two-phase immersion cooling,” or 2PIC.\n\nThere is at least one other company that sells similar immersion-cooling systems for data centers, but there is one key difference. Green Revolution Cooling also submerges servers into a dielectric mineral oil blend it designed itself, but its approach does not use two-phase immersion. The company claims that its oil, called ElectroSafe, has 1,200 more heat capacity by volume than air.\n\nOther approaches are filling sealed server enclosures with coolant or isolating coolant flow to CPUs alone. The latter approach involves installing a small chamber for coolant directly over the CPU and pushing coolant through it by a system of narrow pipes.\n\nBreaking out of Niche Markets\n\nThe power-density advantages of direct liquid cooling and especially immersion cooling are clear. What is unclear is whether it will eventually become useful in more mainstream computing scenarios, which is something 3M is hoping to see.\n\nThe alarmist forecasts from about a decade ago of an imminent data center power density crisis have not materialized. Densities have generally gone up, but not to the extent or at the scale predicted.\n\n“The reality is, only in the last two or three years have companies started to more broadly deploy high density to be able to take advantage of the efficiency that that drives,” Sureel Choksi, CEO of the wholesale data center provider Vantage Data Centers, said. “The average data center rack today, in terms of actual utilization, probably has density of about 2kW a rack, which is extraordinarily low.”\n\nThe higher the power density the more sense immersion cooling makes. 3M’s Novec fluid itself is a major cost, and at lower densities economics of the technology get “less compelling,” Garceau said. He declined to share the price of the fluid, but a report on the liquid cooling market by 451 Research said it could cost up to $50 per liter.\n\nAlso undisclosed is the amount of fluid required to cool BitFury’s 250 kW racks. A previous project for which the data was disclosed used 3 liters per kW, Garceau said. In lab tests, 3M simulated a higher IT load and was able to cool 4 kW with less than one liter, he said.\n\nBut Garceau’s current challenge extends beyond the bitcoin mining industry. The company wants to make the case that the cooling technology can be useful in more than just a few specialized applications. “There’s a tendency to believe that liquid cooling is special and expensive and niche for supercomputing,” he said.\n\nAt least today, however, that belief is not unfounded, since non-HPC deployments of immersion cooling are rare, and the overwhelming majority of the world’s IT gear is cooled by air. Garceau views the emergence of bitcoin mining as the second big application for direct liquid cooling as an opportunity to demonstrate that the story of the technology does not start and end with supercomputers.\n\nOne potential application can be cloud-scale computing, he said. “They would have to optimize around high density hardware for the purposes of energy efficiency, construction savings, all the benefits of two-phase immersion cooling,” Garceau said. But making the case to an industry that has an opposite philosophy of data center architecture – scale out versus scale up – will be difficult.', 'Visa and DocuSign unveiled a new proof-of-concept this week that leverages the bitcoin blockchain for recordkeeping.\n\nThe project, outlined in a 26th October blog post and debuted at Money20/20 in Las Vegas, focuses on digitizing the process of leasing a car. Bitcoin transactions are used to create a digital fingerprint for each vehicle, with new transactions published throughout the leasing process.\n\n""From the driver\'s seat, the customer then chooses the lease options for the car – low, mid or high mileage, for example and DocuSigns the leasing contract right there and then. This is all in turn updated on the blockchain,” the post explains.\n\n“They then choose their insurance options in the familiar way – evaluating by coverage, deductible and other factors,"" it continues. ""They would again DocuSign the agreements, and the blockchain would again be updated.”\n\nVisa is involved through its technology innovation arm, which has been working with bitcoin and the blockchain for months. The company is also an investor in DocuSign.\n\nOther elements of the proof-of-concept involve Visa’s credit cart network and some of DocuSign’s document management technology in a bid to connect the leased car and further digitize the leasing process. DocuSign released a YouTube video that shows a step-by-step demonstration, including instances in which information is published via the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDocuSign and Visa did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nView the full video demonstration below:\n\nImages via Shutterstock, YouTube\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The patents were published by the agency on 15th October.\n\nSubmitted in April last year,the patents listed the inventors as Matthew Pauker, co-founder and chairman at 21 Inc; Nigel Drego, co-founder and chief architect; Veerbhan Kheterpal, president and co-founder; and Daniel Fir, co-founder.\n\n""The present invention relates to mining of digital currencies such as cryptocurrencies,"" reads the filing, which goes on to state: ""Mining circuitry and mining operations described herein may be used for any digital medium of exchange such as digital currencies, credits, rewards, or points.""\n\n2. Coinbase\n\nJust last month, CoinDesk reported that San Francisco-based firm Coinbase had filed nine bitcoin patent applications with the USPTO.\n\nSubmitted in 17th March 2015, the filings included patent applications for various bitcoin products including a hot wallet, an instant exchange (launched in June), a bitcoin exchange and a bitcoin tipping button.\n\nCoinbase\'s CEO Brian Armstrong took to Reddit to defend the company\'s decision to file for patent protection.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk at the time, he said:\n\n""While it would be irresponsible for Coinbase not to apply for patents (we need to protect ourselves from larger companies engaging in patent warfare), we can certainly commit to not using patents offensively against smaller companies.""\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nBank of America\'s patent application for a wire transfer system that would leverage cryptocurrency technology also made headlines last month.\n\nFiled on 17th March by the US financial services giant, the filing sets out to garner protection for a system by which electronic funds could be transferred between customer accounts using blockchain technology as the payment rail.\n\nCommenting on the purpose of the invention, its authors Thomas Edward Durbin and James Gregory Ronca wrote:\n\n""Enterprises handle a large number of foreign wire transfer requests on a daily basis. As technology advances, foreign transactions have become more common. For some customers, it may be desirable to conduct a foreign wire transfer in less time than what current foreign wire transfer systems allow.""\n\n4. BitGo\n\nA patent application filed by BitGo caused concern among crypto enthusiasts and prominent industry figures, prompting bitcoin multisig wallet provider to address the issue on its blog:\n\n""Today we\'re excited to announce BitGo\'s decision to internally adopt the Innovators Patent Agreement (IPA), a framework for patent assignment that allows engineers, designers, and other employees to retain control of patents stemming from their inventions. BitGo has no issued patents as of today, but intends to use the agreement if and when any patent may be issued.""\n\nThe IPA – pioneered by Twitter in 2012 – BitGo added, stipulates that patents must be used for defensive purposes only, ""meaning that patents awarded to employees cannot be used in offensive litigation without permission from the investors themselves"".\n\n5. MasterCard\n\nLast year, global financial services giant MasterCard filed a patent to be able to incorporate bitcoin into the design of a proposed online shopping cart which would be rolled out on a global scale.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk at the time, a MasterCard representative said: ""Every day, we look for ways to bring additional convenience to consumers when they shop. This application is just one example of that – exploring how to create flexibility in how a consumer would fund a shopping cart purchase.""\n\nThe patent, MasterCard added, should not be perceived as support for bitcoin:\n\n""The application was filed to protect our intellectual property and does not indicate a commitment to one idea or concept.""\n\n6. Amazon\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon was awarded a bitcoin-related cloud computing patent which outlined the use of digital currencies as payment for cloud computing services on Amazon Web Services (AWS) – the company\'s cloud-computing platform that, according to the company\'s CEO Jeff Bezos, is a $5bn business and growing fast.\n\nAs reported by CoinDesk at the time, Amazon\'s patent award came after the company publicly stated it was not interested in accepting digital currencies, despite its perceived competitor eBay hinting at integrating bitcoin payments.\n\n7. Western Union\n\nColorado-based remittance giant Western Union\'s patent award in April 2014, was subsequently followed by reports that suggested the company would have a claim to the exchange of alternative currencies.\n\nAlthough it fails to mention bitcoin, the filing reads:\n\n""Alternative currencies are an emerging trend. Some alternative currencies have been created in response to a lack of long-term confidence in monetary methods of exchange; some as a community hedge against inflation; others merely as a medium of exchange between members of a physical or virtual community, among other reasons.""\n\n8. IBM\n\nIBM filed a patent application to track the value of digital currencies in 2012.\n\nMade public in 2013, IBM\'s application states:\n\n""The ability to validate and authenticate digital tokens across the lifetime of any particular token will bolster trust and viability, allowing e-currencies to operate across disparate economic systems, fostering easier participating alongside sovereign currencies and non-standard currencies.""\n\nPaper filings image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Not that this should come as a surprise, as fifty years of resting on laurels has been the source of little to no innovation. However, a legally compliant financial platform for both consumers and merchants has been developed, and digital Euros might make an appearance soon within the EU banking system.\n\nAlso read: Tierion and Philips Bring Blockchain Technology To Healthcare Sector\n\nSafe Cash Payment Technologies Partners With CleverCoin To Create Digital Euro\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Safe Cash Payment Technologies, Inc. has announced a partnership with CleverCoin. The name CleverCoin might ring a bell for some readers, as this Dutch Bitcoin exchange has become quite popular in recent times. That being said, CleverCoin is not just active in the Bitcoin world, as the company wants to help shape the financial system of tomorrow by any means necessary.\n\nPartnering with Safe Cash Payment Technologies is an interesting development, as the goal is to create new instant payment functionality to consumers with the EU. Using CleverCoin’s API to integrate with Lemon Way’s mobile payment solutions will create an interesting hybrid solution that brings the digital Euro into the EU banking system.\n\nNote from the Author: Lemon Way is the mobile payment solution developed by BNP Paribas Fortis. Safe.cash acts as a new payment functionality to complement Lemon Way.\n\nStarting in Q1 of 2016, both businesses and consumers can convert Euros into digital cash. Safe.Cash, as this new platform will be called, respects privacy of all parties involved while using the universal acceptance of cash euros. The entire process will benefit from the digital portability and security associated with cryptocurrency.\n\nSafe.Cash founder Chris Kitze explained:\n\n“Safe.Cash is fully committed to serving the mainstream banking world. Our platform is designed to solve crucial pain points and remove unnecessary friction from the existing system. Eventually, we aim to power banks around the globe, supporting euros, U.S. dollars, and all other fiat currencies, as well as asset-backed and loyalty products.”\n\nAs you would come to expect from the Safe.Cash service, every token issued on the platform is backed by the identical value in Europe. By partnering with banks and utilizing digital wallets with end-to-end encryption, Safe.Cash will be available on various mobile platforms, including iOS and Android. Consumers can spend the digital Euro tokens, just like they would spend cash, and even swap these tokens for local currency if needed.\n\nTo make the entire process as streamlined as possible, Safe.Cash will provide instant and guaranteed funds at all times. Converting Euros to other local currencies in Europe will become a lot easier once these digital Euro tokens are introduced. Last but not least, this entire partnership is compliant with European banking regulations.\n\nNo Affiliation With Bitcoin\n\nWhile some readers might be disappointed to hear Safe.Cash has nothing to do with Bitcoin at all; it is a positive trend to see the underlying technology make it to the traditional financial sector. Just a few years ago, no one would have ever considered using digital Euro tokens based on Bitcoin’s underlying technology, yet as of Q1 2016, that will become a possibility.\n\nSafe.Cash may very well be the first of many tools to unify traditional banking with Bitcoin technology over the next few years. This does not mean Bitcoin will never make it to the world of finance as know it, but it is understandable banks want to explore the technology first. Interesting times are ahead of us.\n\nSource: Press Release via Email\n\nImages courtesy of Safe.Cash, CleverCoin, Shutterstock\n\nOriginally posted on: Digital Euro Tokens Based on Bitcoin Technology Coming in 2016', ""In August Bitcoin Magazine reported that CardCash, an American online company that buys and sells discounted gift cards from thousands of national retailers, had started to accept bitcoin payments, joining companies such as Gyft and Fold in providing ways to purchase gift cards from major retailers with bitcoin.\n\nFounded in 2008, CardCash has been included in the Forbes’ list of America’s Most Promising Companies for the last three years, as well as in the Inc. 500 list of the fastest growing private companies in America for the past four years. In November 2013, the company raised $6 million in Series A funding from Guggenheim Partners.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Eric Berger, director of growth strategy at CardCash, to find out more about the company’s bitcoin-related strategy.\n\nCould you explain in a few words the main benefit that CardCash brings to consumers?\n\nCardCash has been the industry leader in security, speed and innovation for nearly a decade. The benefits our consumers enjoy are as follows:\n\nCardCash offers gift card liquidity by allowing consumers to exchange their unwanted gift cards quickly and securely for cash. CardCash offers consumers the opportunity to purchase second-hand gift cards to their favorite retailers at significant discounts. These savings can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars each year for our regular customers. Lastly, CardCash fully guarantees each purchase for 45 days. That means that customers have over six worry-free weeks to use their cards.\n\nFurthermore, with CardCash’s acceptance of bitcoin, we have now bridged the gap between bitcoin users and over 1,000 retailers that do not yet accept the innovative digital currency.\n\nHow do consumers use your mobile app? How is the rollout plan proceeding?\n\nOur mobile app is set to launch at the end of October. Customers will be able to purchase gift cards using their same account information, just as they would online, with our omni-channel account access. The app also has full wallet functionality, allowing customers to store their gift cards and even purchase goods at retailers’ physical stores straight through the app. The next iteration of the app will also include Apple Pay and Android Pay along with improved location-based technology that will allow us to custom-tailor promotions to suit each customer better.\n\nDo you have plans to expand beyond the U.S. to international markets, and, if so, what's your expected timeline for that?\n\nWe believe that the current domestic opportunity is still in its infancy. With this enormous potential, our primary focus for the foreseeable future is on the U.S. market. We do look forward for the opportunity to share our valuable service with new markets and consumers when the time is right.\n\nYou mention strict AML/KYC compliance policies. Isn't that likely to become a barrier to CardCash adoption from bitcoin users?\n\nCardCash has always been the industry leader concerning customer security and AML/KYC compliance, and we will continue to meet these standards for our new bitcoin users. We have seen no barriers to CardCash's bitcoin adoption and are excited for the tremendous potential impact in the bitcoin community. Policies such as purchase limits, fraud detection and account monitoring will be no different for our bitcoin users. These not only satisfy compliance requirements, they also help detect and deter fraudulent activity that ends up costing everyone more.\n\nHow do the bitcoin-only discounts work, and are you already able to offer bitcoin-only discounts?\n\nBitcoin discounts will be an automatically credited discount at checkout, passing back our savings on transactions fees back to the consumer. We will also have bitcoin-only coupons from time to time to market, specifically, to the bitcoin community. We plan on implementing these discounts in the very near future."", 'Payments giant MasterCard has been named as one of 11 investors in Digital Currency Group\'s (DCG) new funding round.\n\nThe undisclosed raise, announced today, attracted support from billion-dollar brands across multiple sectors including Canadian bank CIBC, insurer New York Life and TransAmerica Ventures, the VC fund owned by Aegon and TransAmerica.\n\nIt marks the first investment in the bitcoin and blockchain sector for all but four of the firms involved.\n\nDCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert said in a statement:\n\n""It is our mission to accelerate the development of a better financial system, and we’re excited to be doing it together with a fantastic group of visionaries.""\n\nOthers in the round include healthcare/FinTech fund Oak HC/FT, Chain investor RRE and Bain Capital Ventures, the VC arm of asset management firm Bain Capital.\n\n""Unique position""\n\nDCG was created earlier this year when Genesis Global Trading and Grayscale Investments – formerly under the SecondMarket umbrella – merged with Silbert\'s seed fund, the Bitcoin Opportunity Corp (BOC).\n\nHaving backed 57 companies in 18 countries, the company has by far the largest early-stage investment portfolio in the sector.\n\nSilbert – whose first company, SecondMarket, was acquired by NASDAQ Private Market last week – told CoinDesk DCG will invest in a further 10 to 20 companies in 2016.\n\nIn turn, his company is hoping to use its ""unique position"" in the industry to foster collaboration between entrepreneurs, investors and – crucially – legacy institutions, who are seeking answers about blockchain technology\'s disruptive potential.\n\nGeorg Schwegler, the CEO of TransAmerica Ventures, told CoinDesk his firm had joined DCG\'s round to get a broad overview of goings on in the space.\n\n""Instead of investing in single companies in that space, we wanted to have access to a larger ecosystem on a global basis,"" he said.\n\nSchwegler went on to describe the flexibility blockchain technology affords payment processes as ""phenomenal"".\n\nSilbert told CoinDesk the firms involved had expressed interest in following up with investments or collaborations in individual startups:\n\n""For many of our new investors, this is their first investment in the bitcoin/blockchain space ...

It also raised awareness for the regulatory challenges facing digital currencies and the important work that Coin Center is doing on that front.\n\nOverall, it isn’t a bad piece of physical Bitcoin memorabilia. It feels high quality in your hand, like what you are holding is important. I’m going to get into some criticisms of it now, but I want to stress that I think this was a positive program from Coin Center overall and they should be commended for it. My criticisms are minor and have more to do with the current state of Bitcoin’s community than anything Coin Center actually did. That being said, the pocket white paper instantly reminds me of the pocket New Testament frequently carried by evangelical types, and I think that is a problem. Not a huge problem, but a problem. (We later asked Coin Center if the resemblance was intentional but have not heard back at press time.)\n\nFirst, what makes it resemble a bible? It certainly isn’t thick like a Bible (or even the New Testament) is. It has a faux-leather cover that is similar to the material you’ll often see used for bibles. The name of the document is embroidered on the top, with Satoshi Nakamoto’s name at the bottom (as the author) and a symbol that the uneducated could easily mistake for a religious one. Inside, the paper is that same thin paper that fills up the Bibles and Hymn books in church pews around the world. No one would mistake this for a Bible, but nearly everyone I showed it to, especially those with religious backgrounds, made the connection. One could be forgiven for thinking the document’s creators think it is as important as the Bible.\n\nWhatever reason Satoshi had for leaving the community, I believe it was the right decision to make. Having one person lead a revolutionary technology like bitcoin is dangerous for multiple reasons we don’t have time to get into at the moment. But Nakamoto leaving also had one (likely) unintended consequence: It turned him into something resembling a deity. I have written in the past about how dangerous I think that is, how it is harmful to healthy debate and discourse, but there is another problem with the growing Satoshi Religion: It makes the bitcoin community look bad.\n\nLike most Bitcoin users, I have become a Bitcoin advocate. While I am mindful of not pushing it onto people, I am often asked about it and am usually more than happy to educate the public when they ask. Even still, I often feel like one of those door-to-door Mormons. I sometimes don’t feel far off from saying something like “Do you have some time to hear the good news about our lord and savior Bitcoin?” The pedestal we have put Satoshi on isn’t helpful and I’m not sure if making his Whitepaper resemble a Bible is a good idea either.\n\nImagine you are someone hearing about Bitcoin for the first time. The person who told you about it is rambling on about fed money, the death of banks, decentralization and other concepts that are completely new to you and sound borderline insane. Then, this guy pulls out a leather bound document, written by a mysterious figure who, not unlike Jesus, disappeared after getting his movement started, but unlike Jesus, he didn’t tell anyone his name and it happened last decade. At that point you couldn’t be blamed for thinking Scientologists are relatively sane.\n\nThe letter included with the document, a “personal note” from Director Jerry Brito, includes not one but two “P.S.” notes at the end, both asking for money. I understand most people who received this asked for it, but people did order them for their friends and family as well. To them, this could seem a bit pushy and again, brings to mind the evangelical types that send out notes asking for money so they can clean the world of sinners.\n\nUltimately, this is just nitpicking. Overall, I think a physical white paper given out to those that expressed interest is a good thing. Big picture, it is probably more important that the white paper be made out of high quality materials, so it can last, than it is to make it not resemble a Bible. Coin Center should be commended for making this, presumably at a not-insignificant cost, with the goal of increasing Bitcoin adoption. The resemblance to the Bible isn’t that big of a deal, those without religious backgrounds probably won’t even notice. But it is something to keep in mind, if you plan on keeping the document at the ready in your breast pocket, in case someone asks you about Bitcoin. Evangelizing about Bitcoin is a good thing and the Coin Center provided physical white paper seems like it could be a useful tool towards that end, but be conscious of how it may make you look. Don’t clutch it to your heart while you and a friend walk door-to-door with matching dress shirts and ties. It is a great resource to have, but don’t quote it like scripture, it’s not scripture, it is a simple explanation of a complex technology written by a man in 2008. Don’t make it anything more than that, the world has enough religions and religious texts.']"
10/28/2015,"['The founder of an IPO services company that was sold this month to Nasdaq has lined up several investors for his new company, which will invest in bitcoin and blockchain developers.\n\nBarry Silbert said several firms have agreed to invest in Digital Currency Group, for which he is chief executive. Financial services industry companies that have invested include MasterCard and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, according to a Tuesday news release.\n\nThe total amount raised and additional financial terms were not disclosed. The investments were announced on Tuesday at the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas.\n\nAdditional investors in Digital Currency Group include Bain Capital Ventures, CME Ventures, FirstMark Capital, New York Life Insurance, Novel TMT Ventures, Oak HC/FT, RRE Ventures, Solon Mack Capital and Transamerica Ventures.\n\nDigital Currency Group will be operated as a holding company and not an investment fund, Silbert said in the release.\n\n“Being structured as a company, versus a fund, allows us to evolve with the industry given our permanent capital base and flexible mandate,” Silbert said.\n\nSecondMarket Solutions, which was founded by Silbert, was acquired this month by Nasdaq. Digital Currency Group was formed by combining two subsidiaries of SecondMarket Solutions—the bitcoin trading firm Genesis Global Trading; and Grayscale Investments, the firm that manages the publicly traded Bitcoin Investment Trust. Those subsidiaries were further combined with additional investments that Silbert has made in the bitcoin and blockchain industries.', ""The price of the digital currency bitcoin hit the $300 mark on Tuesday night for the first time since July.\n\nThe last time this happened, Greece was undergoing an economic collapse and citizens were shut out of accessing their bank accounts, leading many bitcoin companies to attempt to harness the opportunity to drive Greeks to digital currency. There was some debate over whether the price bump was actually a direct result of the Greece situation or simply coincided with it. Regardless, when the price is up, the bitcoin industry—from entrepreneurs to price indices to exchanges to chat forums—gets very excited.\n\nDon't look now, but #bitcoin has broken through 300 and the exchanges are all buzzing. — LocalBitcoins.com (@LocalBitcoins) October 28, 2015\n\nTo be sure, the price of bitcoin has never again flirted with the $1,000 mark it surpassed in January 2014. But many in the industry believe that spike hurt the currency, in the long run, since it is constantly compared unfavorably to that high number, an anomaly. Some bitcoin experts and authors have told Fortune they believe the price could stay in the low hundreds and that would be okay for the industry as long as it stays stable—the coin doesn’t need to shoot up in value. (Indeed, the popular sound bite outside of bitcoin lately is that the currency is less important than the underlying blockchain technology behind it.) In the past year or so, $300 has become the new benchmark for excitement.\n\nFor bitcoin believers, good things happen when the price of bitcoin is up. Prior to July, the last time the currency hit $300 was on March 10, the same day on which bitcoin companies 21 Inc, ShapeShift, and Digital Asset Holdings all announced either fundraising rounds or big executive appointments.\n\nFor those who follow this business from the outside, it is interesting to observe some of the chatter on bitcoin blogs and forums when the price rises. Those who are betting big on bitcoin’s future get very optimistic, very quickly. “Always exciting to feel that charge in the bitcoin air,” wrote a user on Reddit’s bitcoin section on Tuesday night. “We did it,” wrote another user, and someone responded, “Yaaayy!!”\n\nBut one commenter was a bit more tempered: “We all know the price does not matter until it does.” In a time when some big banks and payment processors like MasterCard are getting involved with bitcoin—but cautiously, and typically citing the uses of the blockchain as the appeal—that’s a smart, measured reminder."", 'Computing giant Microsoft is rolling out a toolkit that will let its enterprise users build on the Ethereum protocol.\n\nThanks to a partnership with Ethereum collective ConsenSys, business users of Microsoft\'s cloud-based Azure service will be able to access Ethereum Blockchain-as-a-Service, or \'E BaaS\'.\n\nThe sandbox initiative, announced today, will be unveiled on 10th November at Ethereum\'s DEVCON1 event in London.\n\nMarley Gray, Microsoft\'s director of technology strategy for its US Financial Services, said in a statement:\n\n""Our enterprise clients will have the ability to deploy private and semi-private or consortium blockchain networks, as well as public Ethereum nodes with a single click on Azure.""\n\nThe company, which began accepting bitcoin for Xbox content in 2014, has shown increasing interest in blockchain technologies. In August, its director of technology and civic innovation, John Paul Farmer, told CoinDesk currencies were its ""least interesting"" application.\n\nThrough the toolkit, Microsoft\'s Azure users will be able to access tools such as BlockApps\' full stack app and blockchain builder, Strato, and Ether.Camp, a blockchain explorer for Ethereum.\n\n""We’ll have developer tools and applications so [enterprises] can begin to understand the power behind blockchain technology,"" Gray said.\n\nAbout ConsenSys\n\nConsenSys, headquartered in New York, is a collective building tools and DApps (decentralised apps) on Ethereum – which launched in ""bare bones"" form in July – to make the protocol user-friendly.\n\nThe brainchild of Ethereum Foundation co-founder Joseph Lubin, it emerged from stealth in August.

It was not immediately clear if the latest charges involved money cited in the earlier allegations.Karpeles\' new arrest mean authorities can detain him for another several weeks, giving them further time to grill him over MtGox\'s demise.The Tokyo-based exchange shuttered last year after admitting 850,000 coins worth around $480 million at the time, or $387 million at current exchange rates had disappeared from its digital vaults.The company initially said there was a bug in the software underpinning Bitcoins that allowed hackers to pilfer them.Karpeles later claimed he had found some 200,000 of the lost coins in a ""cold wallet"" a storage device, such as a memory stick, that is not connected to other computers.MtGox, which once said it handled around 80 percent of global Bitcoin transactions, filed for bankruptcy protection soon after the cyber-money went missing, leaving a trail of angry investors calling for answers.Bitcoins are generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet, and are not backed by any government or central bank, unlike traditional currencies.', 'Few know the pulse of the bitcoin industry as well as Simon Dixon. Founder of a bitcoin-based crowdfunding platform named Bank to the Future and an investor in more than a dozen bitcoin related start-ups, he has become part of the center (if there is one) of this decentralized technology and community. We recently spoke with him about the current state and future of this digital currency. TheStreet: Why are you interested in bitcoin and blockchain technology? Dixon: Bitcoin invented the first form of money that allows anybody with an Internet connection to transfer any amount of value from A to B with virtually no cost and friction. It allows anybody to send money as simply as sending an email in fractions of pennies or in the millions. The blockchain is the largest supercomputer in the world made up of hundreds and thousands of computers that all plug together and audit every transaction sent through the system. It means there is no reliance on a bank or authority to send secure payments. The implications are that we now have the first secure form of programmable money, meaning we can do things with money that was never possible before and more people can participate unrestricted. What is your view on the regulatory landscape of these technologies? Bitcoin is a network that is regulated by maths and code that cannot be manipulated by any individual as every transaction is audited by hundreds of computers all around the world. Bitcoin regulates itself better than any regulator could with no central point of failure as with a traditional financial institutions. However, financial institutions that operate bitcoin financial services businesses need to be subject to the same rules and regulations that traditional financial institutions are subject to with a few exceptions. All scandals and problems have occurred with financial institutions rather than Bitcoin itself. As Bitcoin is fully transparent, and every transaction can be seen by all it is possible to mathematically prove compliance with no need for a regulator in many cases and with more security than traditional payments. For example, anybody can look up proof that a financial institution is not touching client money with no risk to the client. This eliminates the need to regulate that part of the business, but when they deal with traditional money, the same rules apply. Bitcoin solves the problem in some circumstances of ""Who regulates the regulator?"" as it takes the human element out of the system and replaces it with a transparent system that cannot be manipulated.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on bitcoin as an investment for private investors? At BnkToTheFuture.com over $35 million has been invested in the sector and because some of our investment products pay investors dividends in bitcoin, it is an example of what can be achieved when you make money programmable. Rather than waiting a year for dividends, we are able to pay investors real-time dividends every day through our fund Bitcoin Capital. This is only possible because we can automate the process of paying dividends, something that is not possible with traditional money. This is an example of how bitcoin produces many interesting investment opportunities. If programmable money is as useful to financial services in the future as I believe it will be, then bitcoin is very undervalued and has the potential to be worth significantly more as the technology becomes more useful in financial services. What are your thoughts on bitcoin as an investment for institutional investors? I believe it is an asset class that every institutional investor will want in their portfolio if they have a high-risk, high-return appetite. This year exchanges have been built that satisfy that volume and regulatory requirements to include institutional investors. What are your thoughts on investing in bitcoin to diversify your portfolio? Bitcoin has a lot of growth potential for those with a high risk appetite. Are you invested/would you consider investing in bitcoin? I have invested in over 15 companies in the sector and hold a portfolio of both bitcoin and alternative coins. It has been the highest performing asset class I own. I believe investors with an appetite for risk should have an amount they are comfortable losing invested in this high-growth sector. Over a billion in venture capital investment have been made in companies in this sector already, and this sector has created a vast amount of wealth for many investors. It will take several years to fully mature, in my opinion.', 'BTCC has launched “Pro Exchange”, a trading platform boasting of great features, for the “spot trading” of virtual currency Bitcoin.\n\nOne salient feature of this platform is, that the traders who would use it will be able to maximize their profits as they will get 20x leverage on spot trading.\n\nThis leverage is the highest in the industry and Pro Exchange will also allow the traders to choose when to take delivery, which is another unique feature that could help it earn distinction against other leveraged Bitcoin trading platforms.\n\nCurrently, the exchange is running a trading contest which will last till November 23, 2015, and has lucrative prizes for winners.\n\nBobby Lee, the chief executive officer of BTCC, unveiled the exchange at the Money20/20 panel held at The Venetian.\n\nMoney 20/20 had earlier witnessed a much applauded demo on new Proof-of-Concept by DocuSign and Visa.\n\nIn a press note issued for the media, the company summed up Pro Exchange in the following words:\n\n“Pro Exchange is a Bitcoin margin trading platform, that allows investors to hedge against Bitcoin price volatility, or pursue gains from Bitcoin price fluctuations.”\n\nLee also said that “Pro Exchange is an innovative addition to our growing set of digital currency services that allows keen investors to trade on and hedge against Bitcoin volatility.”\n\nMichael Fok, BTCC’s vice president added, that “BTCC’s Pro Exchange is another example of how we lead the cryptocurrency services market by offering our customers pioneering services that are unparalleled in the industry.”\n\nFok later quipped that this Bitcoin exchange is for traders and designed by traders.\n\nPro Exchange also says, that since it offers traders stop orders hence, they would be free from monitoring the market frequently.\n\nThe stop orders buy or sell a position whenever the market reaches a certain price and they are considered to be highly convenient in the otherwise volatile market.', 'Visa and DocuSign have unveiled a new proof-of-concept that uses bitcoin blockchain technology to revolutionise the car leasing process, allowing people to rent a car without having to plough through reams of paperwork.\n\nThe project aims to digitise the whole process, from configuring the lease, insurance and other expenses like parking and tolls, to digitally signing and paying for the car itself.\n\n""Leasing a new sports car – or any car for that matter – should be fun, it should be exciting. The problem is, the paperwork and process involved often diminish that experience,"" said Ron Hirson, head of product at DocuSign in a blog post .\n\n""So we wanted to find a way to reimagine the experience and bring the magic back. To make the moment special again. To ensure someone can literally walk in and drive out in a matter of minutes.""\n\nTo begin the process, the car is given a unique digital identity, which is registered on the blockchain – the secure ledger database used to record transactions over broadly-distributed computer networks.\n\nThis is linked to the customer\'s DocuSign’s eSignature and integrated with Visa’s payment technology, so that they can pay for the lease and insurance, as well as in-car payments like tolls, maintenance services and parking, on the fly.\n\n""From the driver’s seat, the customer then chooses the lease options for the car – low, mid or high mileage, for example and DocuSigns the leasing contract right there and then. This is all in turn updated on the blockchain,"" said Mr Hirson.\n\n""They then choose their insurance options in the familiar way – evaluating by coverage, deductible and other factors. They would again DocuSign the agreements, and the blockchain would again be updated.""\n\nWith the lease and insurance contracts signed and the credit card details integrated, the customer is ready to drive away. From there, the car can do many things automatically, like pay tolls, download music of even order a take-away pizza.\n\n""Much like Visa put its card into the (Apple) Watch (providing on-wrist Apple Pay capability) this is just putting your card into your car. The vehicle becomes a smart asset that offers two-way communication that can benefit consumers,"" Mr Hirson told USA Today.\n\nDocuSign said this is just one of the projects it is working on with Visa. The two companies have a long history of collaboration, and Visa is also a strategic investor in DocuSign.\n\nThey claim that the concept can be applied not only to car leasing but to anything from renting or buying a new home to setting up new services and utilities.\n\nEarlier this year, Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock MP told the Telegraph that blockchain could also have a role to play in the digital state of the future.\n\n""Blockchain is itself a way of verifying the accuracy of data, and has all sorts of applications that we are only beginning to understand,"" he said.\n\n""In some cases it replaces the need for a central verification.

10/29/2015,"['MasterCard\'s participation in Digital Currency Group\'s undisclosed funding round sent ripples of excitement across the crypto-sphere earlier this week.\n\nWhile this is MasterCard\'s first crypto-related investment, the multinational corporation is not the first mainstream finance company to dip its toe in the bitcoin and blockchain technology pool.\n\nBanks have publicly embraced blockchain technology and prominent figures from traditional finance have also lauded its potential. But how exactly are payment giants such as MasterCard interacting with the world of crypto?\n\nBe it through direct investment, partnerships with companies in the space or public comments on bitcoin and its underlying technology, here\'s a round-up of some of the most notable interactions between payment giants and the world of crypto.\n\n1. MasterCard\n\nFounded: 1966\n\nCompany type: Public\n\nCompany size: Over 10,000 employees.\n\nReported revenue: $2.4bn net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 – a 14% increase versus the same period in 2013.\n\nAmerican payments giant MasterCard was one of 11 investors in Barry Silbert\'s Digital Currency Group\'s (DCG) new undisclosed funding round.\n\nThe news came months after the multinational corporation claimed the risks presented by digital currencies far outweighed the benefits in its submission to the UK Treasury\'s call for information on digital currencies, last November.\n\nMatthew Driver, MasterCard\'s president for South East Asia was also critical of digital currencies in December 2014, following the company line that cryptocurrencies presented too many risks.\n\nDriver said MasterCard was ""not completely comfortable with the idea of cryptocurrencies"", adding that the technology was ""against the whole principle"" on which the credit card giant had established its business.\n\nReports surfaced that MasterCard had spoken out against bitcoin\'s perceived risks, calling for regulators to create a ""level playing field"" for payments systems:\n\n""It is our view that all participants in the payments system that provide similar services to consumers should be regulated in the same way to achieve a level playing field for all. Moreover, any regulations should be technology neutral to ensure that they can and do apply to all new providers of payment services to consumers, especially with advancements in technology.""\n\nMasterCard filed a patent application to be able to incorporate bitcoin into the design of a proposed online shopping cart which would be rolled out to its global customers. Despite this, MasterCard insisted the filing should not be perceived as the company\'s support of bitcoin.\n\n2. Visa\n\nFounded: 1958\n\nCompany type: Public\n\nCompany size: between 5,001 and 10,000 employees\n\nReported revenue: GAAP net income in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.1bn, a decrease of 10% over the prior year.\n\nLike MasterCard, Visa has also invested in the crypto space, contributing to blockchain startup Chain\'s $30m funding round.\n\nEarlier this week, Visa revealed a new proof-of-concept that leverages bitcoin\'s blockchain for record keeping.\n\nDebuted at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas, the project sets out to digitise the car rental process, using bitcoin transactions to create a digital fingerprint for each vehicle on the blockchain. Visa is involved in the project through its technology innovation arm.\n\nUnlike MasterCard, which has been generally dismissive about digital currencies, some Visa executives have spoken positively about bitcoin and its blockchain in the past.\n\nSpeaking at Wired Money this summer, Jonathan Vaux, executive director of new digital payments and strategy at Visa Europe, said:\n\n“The one thing I often get asked about is bitcoin. I do see … a separation between the currency and the technology that sits under it. From the point of view of currency, I think that\'s interesting. As Visa, that\'s what we do – we manage currencies.”\n\nVisa CEO Charlie Scharf spoke about bitcoin in January last year.

Sides split between self-identified “true believers” who continue to espouse the long-term benefits of the bitcoin blockchain, the longest-running open and public version of a distributed ledger, even as pragmatic entrepreneurs garner attention for decentralized ledger projects that enable financial incumbents to create ledgers with restricted access.\n\nOf debate was whether the change was one of terminology, an interest in one word over another, or whether such a rebranding was a recasting of the larger political implications inherent in bitcoin’s technology, and if so, what would be lost should the differences between the bitcoin blockchain and decentralized ledgers be unsuccessfully articulated.\n\nAmong representatives of the more tenured bitcoin startups, consensus emerged that conversation can be expected to turn back to bitcoin next year, as banks begin to “see the light” regarding the benefits of the bitcoin blockchain over alternatives.\n\nColu CEO Amos Meiri, who previewed his bitcoin-based digital asset platform at the event, talked about the frustrations of positioning a company amidst the debate, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“It\'s hard to explain bitcoin [to people here], they don\'t understand if they don\'t have bitcoin, there is no public blockchain, so it\'s not easy for them to digest. They hear banks are using blockchain and it\'s easier than hearing bitcoin, but next year we\'ll go back to bitcoin.”\n\nElsewhere, Adam White, product manager at bitcoin services startup Coinbase, fought against the idea that proprietary decentralized ledgers were “some magic pill” for financial institutions, stressing that the term ""blockchain"" hides the fact bitcoin is the only decentralized ledger with traction and scale.\n\nTally Capital’s Matt Roszak, in his panel talk, voiced his opinion that the name change was more pragmatic on the part of banks, saying:\n\n“I think [bitcoin and the blockchain] are inextricably linked. The marketing powers have said let’s call this stuff blockchain so we can invest in technology, and the compliance department isn’t going to get bent out of shape.”\n\nRegardless, the debate was perhaps rightly seized on by industry representatives due to the myriad of other issues facing development of the bitcoin blockchain, including an ongoing slump in merchant adoption, consecutive quarter-over-quarter drops in venture capital funding and the ongoing inability for the development community to reach consensus on how to resolve network scalability concerns, all of which were largely unaddressed.\n\nGhost of AOL\n\nNotable at the conference was that support for the view that the bitcoin blockchain is potentially the most beneficial version of the technology among more educated representatives of the incumbent financial industry.\n\n“It’s interesting if you look at the blockchain, the biggest innovation is bitcoin,” Cassio Goldschmidt, principal information security leader at NCR Corporation, said.\n\nGoldschmidt evoked a common theme at the conference, that private or restricted-access versions of decentralized ledgers risked repeating the mistakes of AOL.\n\nHe said:\n\n""That’s something that I’ve heard some people using, this sort of analogy, and I think there is some value. You could start with an intranet and that is a valid way of starting things, but you don’t want to be locked into somebody’s proprietary technology.""\n\nThis view was also put forth by Xapo chief strategy officer and former AOL business affairs manager Ted Rogers, who spoke to CoinDesk about his experience with the Internet giant.\n\n""[Consumers] thought AOL was the Internet, but it was just a walled garden built on an open platform, and what was happening while they were seemingly winning, was that people like Google and others were building services on top of this permissionless innovation structure that eventually destroyed AOL,"" he recalled.\n\nDave Birch, director of innovation at Consult Hyperion, suggested the debate was more than just a battle of words, telling CoinDesk he sympathized with the frustration of those in the industry, as words carry deeper implications.\n\n“Permissioned in technical blockchain terms, is not the same as what [the banks] are doing,” he said. “Our names for things are technical names for things and you have to be really careful when you’re using them in the public space.”\n\nOthers like Adam Vaziri, director of compliance consulting firm Diacle LTD, said he believes the focus on terminology risks limiting the diversity that could come about should alternative ledgers coexist with the main blockchain while expanding the technology\'s reach.\n\n\'Perception battle\'\n\nThe view of the bitcoin industry companies on the issue was perhaps best on display during a roundtable featuring Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert and Blockchain CEO Peter Smith.\n\nBeginning with a high level discussion on the respective companies, the talk featured a number of references to the ongoing split in the industry regarding how the technology is positioned and how it is affecting business decisions.\n\n""Today we’re all building blockchain companies. You need to be aware of how to situate your business in the perception battle,"" Smith told the crowd, noting that he feels this will be particularly important for companies looking to raise funds in the next six months.\n\nSmith believes the major financial institutions that are today interested in private blockchains, either based on bitcoin or another protocol, will eventually come to the “logical conclusion” that the bitcoin blockchain is a superior platform.\n\n“Every single industry that has been shaped by technology has been shaped by the movement to mass open platforms,” Smith said, sprinkling his talk with remarks about how the bitcoin blockchain is one of the only large-scale versions of a decentralized ledger.\n\n“It’s the difference between incremental change and fundamental change,” he continued.\n\nSilbert, however, was more pragmatic in his response to questions calling the development of alternative blockchains ""not a bad thing"" given that private systems are allowing mainstream financial institutions to feel more comfortable engaging in the industry.\n\n\'False choice\'\n\nThe split between the bitcoin blockchain and alternative distributed ledgers again reared its head during a panel discussion on how the industry will work with financial incumbents, with Bobby Lee, CEO of bitcoin exchange BTCC, and Todd McDonald, CEO of distributed ledger startup R3CEV, trading terse words.\n\nMcDonald, whose startup is working with major banks to explore as-yet-unreleased distributed ledger concepts, took issue with the idea that all alternative ledgers are “centralized” or “private” as often categorized by more established bitcoin firms.\n\n""You need a open platform, but one of the things that\'s untenable today is open access to validation. You can have permission without centralization,"" McDonald said, adding his belief that financial institutions can’t rely on an open mining network such as the one used to incentivize the bitcoin blockchain due to regulatory concerns.\n\nThe brief spat was mediated by Prasad Chintamaneni, president of banking and financial services, at IT and consulting firm Cognizant, who sought to delineate what he suggested was the inherent advantage of a global open ledger, like the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n“How many enterprises are leveraging public cloud? It\'s about data privacy and security. A private cloud has [fewer] benefits, but it will be way more secure,” he said.\n\nChain’s big vision\n\nOf the industry companies assembled, none arrived in a bigger show of force than Chain, the startup that recently raised $30m from firms including Capital One, Nasdaq and Visa, and staged a Blockchain Workshop that showcased four proofs-of-concept built with brand-name partners.\n\nCementing Chain’s position in the industry was CEO Adam Ludwin’s control of the conversation on a panel that included distributed ledger startup Ripple and its partners Royal Bank Canada and Toronto Dominion (TD) Bank.\n\nIn his remarks, Ludwin touched on his company’s transition from one that attempted to build on the bitcoin blockchain to one that specializes in “blockchain infrastructure”. He described the latter term as pertaining to a “new type of database technology” for financial assets that, while being built for specific use cases on specific networks, would eventually become interoperable.\n\nLudwin stressed that he does see a difference between “blockchain” and “bitcoin” in terms of the goals of the systems, stating:\n\n”Bitcoin wasn’t designed for banks … and that’s fine. Another way to frame the question is what do bitcoin companies think of financial services advancing tech? My perspective is it’s taking pressure off bitcoin to let it be what it is, a way to move money with an Internet connection.”\n\nAlso discussed was the different tone around blockchain technology discussions when compared to those surrounding bitcoin, which moderator and CoinDesk CEO Jeremy Bonney characterized as a veritable love affair. In a more candid moment, the remarks ended in Royal Bank of Canada’s head of mobile innovation Eddy Ortiz openly embracing Ludwin onstage.\n\nStill, even major financial representatives, such as Nasdaq associate vice president Dominick Paniscotti, dismissed the bitcoin versus blockchain argument, given that the Internet is a sum of many technologies working in concert.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""At Nasdaq, you can go to our website, but you can’t access our trading platform. It still runs ethernet, IP, TCP, so is that less valuable than the Internet? When we talk private or public blockchains, I think it just confuses the matter.""\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But regulators worldwide are divided on whether it is a commodity or a currency and are still probing the advent of bitcoin derivatives as exchanges flourish to satisfy traders\' demand for a wider range of products.\n\nBitcoin is a virtual, decentralized currency that can be transacted without the need for middlemen – that is, banks. Last week, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that bitcoin is indeed a currency and so should be exempt from value-added tax (VAT), meaning that people in European Union (EU) states can buy it without paying tax. The case came to the ECJ from a Swedish national, David Hedqvist, who wanted to launch a bitcoin exchange and asked Swedish tax authorities whether converting bitcoin into Swedish krona would incur VAT. He was informed that it would but, undeterred, he appealed against the decision. The case reached the ECJ, the highest court in the EU.\n\nThe ECJ found in his favour, a decision welcomed by bitcoin exchanges. Daniel Scott, co-founder or The CoinCorner Bitcoin Exchange, says: ""It\'s a great thing from our perspective. We have been through this with the UK [which ruled that it would not tax bitcoin trades]; now the EU has done the same thing. It means we can keep operating and we don\'t have to change anything or [incur] extra costs.""\n\nCurrency or commodity?\n\nIn the US, though, regulators classified the bitcoin as a commodity in an official ruling last month against an unregistered bitcoin options trading platform, Derivabit. It was found to have illegally offered to connect buyers and sellers of bitcoin option contracts, without having been properly registered either as a swap execution facility (SEF) or a designated contract market.\n\nThe US Commodity Futures Trading Commission\'s director of enforcement, Aitan Goelman, said in a statement: ""While there is a lot of excitement surrounding bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets.”\n\nAlso in September, though, the CFTC temporarily approved bitcoin options platform LedgerX to operate as a SEF, although it has not yet launched. LedgerX is now seeking a derivatives clearing organization licence to operate as a fully functioning exchange and clearing house; it has recently hired ex-CFTC commissioner Mark Wetjen to its board. A CFTC-regulated derivatives exchange is paramount to attracting institutional investors that are bound by US compliance laws.\n\nMoreover, a derivatives market might add stability to the bitcoin market, which is susceptible to high levels of volatility. These can be triggered by anything from a bad story in the press to a market sell-off of risky assets.\n\nFutures, forwards and options\n\nCryptocurrency derivatives trading platforms are catching on elsewhere, though, with Seychelles-registered BitMEX offering a 100X bitcoin/US dollar futures contract (XBT24H), which is its most popular product.\n\nLondon-based Crypto Facilities, founded by two former bankers, now offers bitcoin forwards, with maturities of one, two, three and four weeks. This enables traders to hedge their existing bitcoin risk or simply take a punt in the hope of making a quick buck on the price of the cryptocurrency rising or falling.\n\nFurther reading Bitcoin: special focus\n\n\n\nSingapore-based Coinut enables users to trade binary options or European vanilla options; according to Coinut, 60% of bitcoin owners need risk-hedging tools to protect against a falling bitcoin price. This year, the Coindesk Bitcoin Price Index has fallen from a high of $427.24 to as low as $177.28, although it has rallied in the last month.\n\nBoston-based Alt-Options even launched a competition that gives anyone the chance to learn how to trade bitcoin derivatives, without risking their own money.\n\nThe need to hedge the risk of volatility will grow as better-known institutions begin to use cryptocurrencies as a form of payment and, says law firm Latham & Watkins\' Financial Institutions Industry Group, the growth of a derivatives market is a ""natural result of the nascent cryptocurrency market"".\n\nBut the CFTC is still wary, having asserted its authority last month with Derivabit. International law firm Sidley Austin LLP believes that the CFTC\'s decision to treat virtual currencies as commodities has ""significant regulatory implications"" for those who trade bitcoin derivatives, such as futures, forwards, swaps or options. Any collective investment vehicle that invests in these derivatives will be classified as a “commodity pool” under US law, meaning they are subject to registration with the CFTC.\n\n\n\n\n\nComing up in the November issue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting to grips with the blockchain\n\n\n\nBanks have suddenly cottoned on to the power of the blockchain technology beneath Bitcoin. Inside their own treasuries and innovation labs, and increasingly in collaboration, banks are testing uses for rebranded distributed ledgers to replace their costly, proprietary systems. Enthusiasts see banks creating a new fabric for payments transfer and financial markets, an internet of money. Doubters sense it’s all hype.\n\nBig challenges remain, but markets from private equity and syndicated loans to corporate bonds and derivatives may go on private blockchains within months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', '“I wish I could give you a grand leading vision.”\n\nIt’s the first thing Heartland CEO Bob Carr says as he sits down in the media room at Money20/20, the modern white leather couch clashing with his holiday sweater. We’re talking about the buzz around the bitcoin blockchain, the technology’s decentralized ledger, and how it relates to the future of his New Jersey-based payments firm.\n\nFrankly, I’m surprised he arrived. With all the chasing that goes into setting up meetings, it’s a bit startling the CEO of the fifth largest merchant acquirer in the US would venture down to the press room for the kind of theoretical conversations bitcoin and blockchain discussions often spiral into, especially when it was only loosely on our schedules.\n\nMy hesitation for the meeting was not without reason. We’re both not exactly sure what to talk about, both armed with the awareness that the narrative around the technology is shifting away from Heartland’s specialities like payment services and e-commerce.\n\nWhen Heartland signed a deal to refer its merchant customers to BitPay in March of this year, the industry was just a few months removed from Microsoft’s decision to accept the digital currency, and even then, payments director Joe Wysocki expressed how the company was moving slowly on the technology.\n\nDespite warnings signs at the time, there was still optimism that other big-name merchants would quickly follow, but data from Q3 illustrates this resurgence hasn’t came to pass. This doesn’t seem to bother Carr, who gives the impression that he’s still genuinely interested in the technology, even if he struggles to see its practical applications for his business.\n\nWe wade into conversation, and talk comes slowly and with ample pauses on either side. In a way, it’s honest, devoid of the eager soundbytes that come when meeting payments firms that seek an easy headline opportunity.\n\nCarr told CoinDesk:\n\n”I’ve noticed a lot more discussion about blockchain. I have been asking experts, ‘What should we be doing here?’, ‘How much time should we be spending on this?’ Usually the answer is stay tuned and see how things develop.”\n\nIt’s not much to work with – the admission that, like Money20/20, the finance industry is a crowded room, filled with technologies and products that come and go, and that in this light, it’s just not clear what the next steps for his company will be with the technology.\n\nStill, he seems inclined to believe that the promise of distributed ledgers is the real opportunity given the increasing momentum toward this use case.\n\n""It seems to me that the play is for banks [to use blockchain] to settle between themselves. There’s trillions in very high-end transactions going back and forth across borders between businesses,"" he said, adding without any real vigor:\n\n""That might be the breakthrough.""\n\nEliminating middlemen\n\nCarr continues pragmatically, noting he sees evidence of this elsewhere at the conference.\n\nMore top of mind than any blockchain product for Carr is Chase Pay, the new mobile payments app rolled out by the US bank to a swirl of promising headlines. Interestingly, he sees how its design mirrors the underlying strengths of distributed financial technology.\n\nAs Chase Pay works by cutting the major credit card processors out of transactions, Carr notes the app removes interchange fees for merchants in the same way the blockchain does when consumers pay merchants directly for services in bitcoin.\n\nGiven innovations like Chase Pay, however, Carr doesn’t see as strong a use case for bitcoin as a consumer-facing digital currency, the use case most of his merchant clients are most interested in.\n\n“I think blockchain is a more serious technology, whereas bitcoin is an implementation of technology that has a lot of questions,” he added, though he admits he’s not exactly an expert on the subject.\n\nHeartland, he suggests, operates on a need-to-know basis, and right now, there might just not be that much pragmatic, customer-focused businesses need to know about bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nPayments evangelism\n\nAs the conversation ebbs on, it’s still not clear which camp to put Carr into, whether he’s a pragmatist or cautious optimist.\n\nCarr, however, begins to offer more insight, eventually identifying himself as an evangelist for payments technology as a whole. He smirks often when talking about how others may dismiss innovation, as if he’s a gambling man, or at least someone who lives by a kind of never-say-never philosophy.\n\nIt comes out over discussion about the attention on bitcoin and blockchain technologies at the conference. Given the breadth of the content, many of the industry attendees seem to feel a natural falling off in enthusiasm, if only for the girth of other options.\n\n“I think bitcoin and blockchain have gotten a lot of trade press,” he counters. “There’s a lot of evangelists out there and a lot of copy, but there’s also a lack of adoption by credible people, though I think it’s happening slowly.”\n\nCarr places bitcoin and the blockchain as part of the larger story of payment technology, where a small pool of believers eventually bring about seismic change in the financial industry. He compares this to the ATM boom that brought cash vending machines to corners across the developed world.\n\n“You get to the famous tipping point, where you get past early adopters and there’s a more rapid adoption ratio,” he said. “I think that’s what we’re going to see with these technologies.”\n\nWith the conversation fading out, he gets up to leave, his skeptical optimism leaving a bit of a wake. He turns and asks me where I think it’s heading. I don’t have a strong answer.\n\n“Well, someday you’ll look back and say you were there at the beginning,” he says, maybe at last revealing his hand.\n\nImage via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Virtual currencies are defined by the OECD as\n\n“digital units of exchange that are not backed by government-issued legal tender“\n\nBitcoin is more specifically a virtual cryptocurrency in that it relies on cryptography and peer-to-peer verification to secure and verify transactions. Bitcoin operates through a peer-to-peer network, on a completely decentralized basis and without any institutional intermediary. Each investor’s account is identified by a code number, with an encryption system granting transactions security. As long as no personally identifying information is required to be provided to acquire or transact in bitcoins, this ensures anonymity.\n\nThe production of bitcoin (so-called “mining“) is nothing but the contribution of software (and hardware) capacity from a “miner” (usually in a pool) to the bitcoin platform. In exchange, the miner receives a certain number of bitcoins as commission. Indeed, the more the miners gather and add capacity to the system, the more the encryption algorithm becomes complex.\n\nAre bitcoins taxed?\n\nBitcoin operators have started wondering whether all of this could eventually be taxed and, if so, how. The main problem regards the VAT/GST treatment for transactions which involve the exchange of cryptocurrencies for legal tender or vice versa. Many start-up companies involved in this business have spread so far: if a private investor wants to convert an amount of legal tender in bitcoins, a company provides this service by applying a predetermined exchange rate and retaining a percentage as commission. But the question is whether such bitcoin transactions are covered by VAT!\n\nIn Europe, only few governments have enacted provisions specifically stating that bitcoin transactions should be VAT exempt, namely Belgium, the UK and Spain. As regards non-EU countries, the US and Switzerland have done the same. On the contrary, EU Member States like Poland and Estonia have expressed an opposite view.\n\nThe position of the European Court of Justice\n\nThe European Court of Justice gave its view on the matter in its decision delivered on 22 October in Case C-264/14. The appellant in the proceedings was Mr. Hedqvist, a Swedish bitcoin operator whose company provides exchange services from bitcoins to Swedish crowns and vice versa.\n\nThe Court investigated on whether such services (yes, the Court concluded that it could not be qualified as a “supply of goods” for VAT perspective) could be taxed at all for VAT purposes. In doing so, it determined the nature of bitcoins as pure means of payments, whose function simply being to facilitate trade in goods and services. Therefore, even if not (yet) regulated by law, cryptocurrencies perform the same function of legal currencies. However, as long as Mr. Hedqvist’s company provides exchange services for consideration, this amounts to a provision of service which falls under the scope of VAT.\n\nHowever, the VAT Directive sets out a list of exemptions which rule out the application of VAT for peculiar transactions otherwise taxable. One of those exemptions covers transactions involving, inter alia, currency, bank notes and coins “used as a legal tender“. At first sight, the provision seems to exclude bitcoins transactions. However, the Court held it must not be interpreted in the sole textual meaning (which, besides, highly varies among the versions in all the languages of the EU).\n\nIn the view of the court, consideration should be paid on the purpose of the exemption. Such purpose consists in not to impede the convertibility of pure means of payments by the levy of VAT. The reasoning is set as follows. An efficient single market is made by frequent cross-border services. This implies the need to exchange currencies. Levying VAT on such exchange transactions would mean render cross-border services more expensive than domestic ones. Therefore, the rationale of the exemption\n\n“is to ensure that, in the interest of the smooth flow of payment, the conversion of currencies is as unencumbered as possible“.\n\nIn this respect, the ECJ found that there is no material difference between bitcoins and legal currencies, in that they both perform the same function of pure means of payment. Therefore, they should enjoy the same treatment and be VAT exempt.\n\nThe consequences of the decision on bitcoin\n\nThe judgment has the effect to bind all EU member States to consider the exchange of legal tender currencies for virtual currencies with bi-directional flow as VAT exempt transactions, even those States which had not expressed their position yet (like Italy).\n\nBut what is really worth noting is that the Court, in Hedqvist case, has laid down a principle of utmost importance capable of implications going also beyond VAT, which can be summarized as follows:\n\nas far as virtual currencies and legal tender share the same function of pure means of payment, the applicable tax treatment must be the same.\n\nSuch approach is totally consistent with the view expressed by the OECD in the context of the BEPS project. The digital economy is not a ring-fenced area which should be subject to special and differentiated rules for the simple reason that the digital economy is becoming the economy itself.\n\nThe ECJ judgment in Hedqvist is nothing but a witness of that.\n\nUnfortunately, we must conclude by playing the troublemaker role. Indeed, if bitcoins exchange transactions are VAT exempt, it means that the service provider has no right to deduct VAT paid on purchases.\n\nBut the most important news is still the good one: the non-applicability of VAT to customers!', 'Disgraced former Mt Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles was rearrested on fresh charges in Japan Wednesday with reports that that at least some of the stolen Bitcoin from the exchange was spent on hiring prostitutes.\n\nKarpeles had been previously arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department in July on charges of “fraudulently producing and using private electromagnetic records,” specifically that he had fraudulently manipulated Mt Gox’s cryptocurrency system and inflated the Bitcoin balance in bogus accounts, and then later arrested again in August on embezzlement charges, specifically that he misappropriated $2.6 million of deposits from the trading accounts of Mt Gox customers.\n\nAccording to The Japan Times the new charge relates to Karpeles moving ¥20 million ($166,000) in client money to his bank account, with at least some of this money being spent on “an unspecified sum on prostitutes” that involved “several women whom he met at venues that offer sexual services.”\n\nUnder Japanese law a suspect, once arrested, can only be held for up to three weeks without formal charges being laid, and a suspect must be rearrested if new charges are being considered, hence the requirement for Karpeles to be rearrested on the new accusation.\n\nStill missing millions\n\nSadly with the latest charges, Japanese police seem to be no closer to discovering the whereabouts of the some 650,000 missing Bitcoins that disappeared with the collapse of Mt Gox, although each charge brings new hope that as the investigation continues, more findings of impropriety in relation to Karpeles may eventually lead to discovering the lost millions.\n\nKarpeles for his part still denies all accusations against him and claims that Mt Gox was hacked, but as we’ve written before, the evidence posts towards the theft of $380 million odd in Bitcoin being an inside job, whether it was Karpeles himself or another employee.\n\nThe good news is that Karpeles has already been formally charged on the first allegation of embezzlement, and given Japan is said to have a high rate of court convictions, one way or the other he is going to jail, it’s just a question now on how many charges and for how long.\n\nIt may only be small solace to those who lost money in the Mt Gox collapse, but it’s better than Karpeles getting away with his crimes without jail time.', 'We would like to announce updated charts on CEX.IO.

Potential applications include cross-border payments, corporate accounting with increased transparency, securities trading, run self-executing smart contracts and more.\n\nAfter being chosen by ConsenSys to form the collaboration, Microsoft’s Director of Technology Strategy Marley Gray said in a joint press release:\n\nMicrosoft is excited to team up with ConsenSys for in Azure’s lead offering of Ethereum Blockchain-as-a-Service. Our enterprise clients will have the ability to deploy private and semi-private or consortium blockchain networks, as well as public Ethereum nodes with a single click on Azure.\n\nThe tools will be owned by ConsenSys, a software production studio comprising of a group of Ethereum-enthusiast coders and originally founded by Joseph Lubin, who also co-founded the Ethereum foundation along with Vitalik Buterin. The Brooklyn-based collective is made up of 60 full-time developers working in the space with 30 consultants working from all over the world.\n\nMicrosoft was and is arguably still is the largest company to commercially offer bitcoin as a payment method to consumers. The company has frequently shown interest in blockchain technology in the past, and a service like the Ethereum-blockchain offering to its users on its popular Azure platform has been a long time coming. The Redmond giant is experiencing a steady renaissance with shares climbing toward their highest ever rates since the bubble burst some 15 years ago. With a market capital of over $430 billion, Microsoft is the third largest company in the U.S. after Apple and Google.\n\nThe rates for the E BaaS service along with other essential information and features, as well as the tools themselves are expected to be revealed at the DEVCON (Ethereum Developer Conference) in London on November 10th.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'This giveaway has now ended, but you can sign up for our email list to be informed of other giveaways\n\nProduct: Trezor\n\nProduced by: SatoshiLabs\n\nCost: $99\n\nDescription: Trezor is a hardware wallet used for storing bitcoins without having to trust a third party. Essentially a USB dongle, it is designed to sign bitcoin transactions with private keys generated offline within the device.\n\nIt can be used to sign transactions on \'unsafe\' computers and is impervious to keyloggers and other digital threats.\n\nOptions: White, grey or black (black option is $109).\n\nSetting up your Trezor device\n\n1. Connect the device to your computer using the USB cable.\n\n2. Go to myTrezor and download a browser plugin.\n\nThe process is automated, although you need to allow the plugin to install.\n\n3. Once the plugin is activated, myTrezor will prompt you to choose a PIN.\n\nYou don\'t actually type the PIN, you have to click on an obscured numerical pad displayed in the browser.\n\nThe position of each number changes randomly, so every time you enter the PIN you will have to check your Trezor device for the layout.\n\nAn attacker using a simple keylogger, or even an attacker with complete remote access to the desktop, would not be able to determine the numbers, as they are displayed only on the Trezor device.\n\n4. Next, you have to write down a randomly generated sequence of 24 words, also known as a ‘seed’.\n\nThis seed will allow you to reconstruct your Trezor wallet in case you lose the device.\n\nThis is the only backup that can be used to recover your wallet in case of loss or theft.\n\nTrezor uses BIP39 and BIP44 standards for creating new wallets, so the generated seed can be recovered and used by other compatible wallets.\n\nImportant: Never make a digital copy or recording or your recovery seed. It\'s a good idea to just use a pen and paper to note down your seed backup. Just remember to keep it somewhere safe.\n\nAdding bitcoins to your Trezor/Receiving bitcoins\n\n1. In myTrezor, click on “Account #1” on the left of the screen and you will see an empty Transactions tab.\n\n2. Select the ""Receive"" tab to get your first Trezor bitcoin address (a long string of numbers and letters).\n\nIf you are transferring bitcoins from a mobile wallet, scan the QR code shown next to the address.\n\n3. When someone makes a payment to you, you will see a green (incoming) transaction appear in the transactions pane.\n\nAt first, the transaction will be marked as “unconfirmed”.\n\nTransactions can take up to 15 minutes to go through completely.\n\nWhen they do so, you will see the “unconfirmed” text replaced by the date and time of the transaction’s completion\n\nMaking payments with Trezor\n\n1. Go to the account page in myTrezor and press send. You\'ll be taken to a payment page like this:\n\n2. Enter the destination bitcoin address.\n\nYou can type in a destination address for your transaction and the amount you’re sending.\n\nYou can scan a QR code connected with the recipient’s wallet using myTrezor by pressing the scan QR code button in the address field and holding a picture of the QR code up to your computer’s webcam.\n\n3. You can send bitcoins to multiple addresses with one transaction by pressing the ‘+’ button in the right hand corner of the Send page.\n\nYou can also choose to add multiple transactions by clicking on the “Import from CSV” button.\n\n4. Press send and enter your PIN\n\n5. Confirm the transaction on your Trezor\n\nIf the amount and the payment address are correct, press the right button on your Trezor to confirm. If they are wrong, press ‘cancel’.\n\nOnce you have confirmed the destination address(es) and amount(s) of your bitcoin transaction, your Trezor will display the total amount of the transaction along with the transaction fee. Make sure these are reasonable before pressing confirm.\n\n6. You can watch the progress of your outgoing transactions by switching over to the Transactions window.\n\nOutgoing transactions are marked in red.\n\nFurther information\n\nTrezor is compatible with various bitcoin wallets, including myTrezor, Mycelium, and Multibit HD. The full list can be found in the Trezor Apps.\n\nThe Trezor device works with desktop operating systems such as Windows, OS X, Linux and Chrome. Trezor can also be used with Android-based devices with OTG support. For example, the Mycelium Android wallet can be used with Trezor using USB OTG.\n\nHere is the open-source library for Android OTG support on GitHub.\n\nTrezor are currently testing new features with their new myTrezor.com beta, which has new labelling features for accounts and addresses.\n\nMore information about Trezor can be found on the Trezor website, where a full user manual can also be found.\n\nAbout the giveaway\n\nWe have one Trezor hardware wallet by SatoshiLabs to give away. To be in with the chance of winning, you must provide a valid email address.\n\nThe winner will be chosen at random and contacted via email. They will have to respond within three working days and must give consent for their name to be listed publicly on CoinDesk.\n\nThe giveaway has now ended (12pm GMT 30/11/2015). The winner will be drawn, contacted and announced shortly. By submitting your email address you are giving consent to be added to our weekly digital currency email. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nFind out how your views on bitcoin security compare to others with this poll\n\nThis content is created collaboratively with the sponsor, SatoshiLabs.

10/30/2015,"['A cyber-security industry group has published new research on the CryptoWall ransomware campaign, finding that the attacks have generated more than $300m in ransom income and stem from a single source or entity.\n\nThe report was published earlier this week by the Cyber Threat Alliance, founded by Intel Security, Symantec, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet. Major takeaways from the organization’s research include evidence of as much as $325m worth of ransomware victim payments and more than 400,000 attempts to infect computers with the third variant of CryptoWall (CW3), many of which appear to have focused on targets in North America.\n\nBacking the idea that the ransomware is sourced to a single entity is evidence found in both the code as well as the web of bitcoin payments trackable on the public blockchain. The report notes that Armenia, Belarus, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine are blacklisted, meaning the malware won’t operate in those regions and suggesting possible points of origin.\n\nThe report’s authors add that an analysis of bitcoin transactions tied to known ransom campaigns points to the common use of bitcoin wallets across those campaigns, stating:\n\n""As a result of examining this financial network, it was discovered that a number of primary wallets were shared between campaigns, further supporting the notion that all of the campaigns, regardless of the campaign ID, are being operated by the same entity.""\n\nThe bitcoins accrued – known ransom demands range from the hundreds to thousands of dollars, according to the report – are then washed through multiple addresses and known bitcoin services, though none are named directly in the report. Some of the funds are essentially reinvested in new exploit kits or rent payments for botnets.\n\nRevenue-wise, the report’s authors note that, for its backers, CryptoWall ""is extremely successful and continues to provide significant income"".\n\n""One variant alone involved with the \'crypt100\' campaign identifier resulted in over 15,000 victims across the globe,"" the report states. ""These 15,000 victims alone would account for, at minimum, roughly $5m in profit for the CW3 group.""\n\nRead the full report below:\n\nCryptoWall Report\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The press coverage was increasing, for sure, but generally with a negative tone.\n\nThere were yet more tales of bitcoin being used in various nefarious ways, all ignoring of course the fact that U.S. dollars, euros and almost any other currency you can name were used in far more. The price of bitcoin was dropping, even up to having its very own “flash crash.” What little positive news there was was even more worrying for those that believe in and can see the potential of bitcoin as a currency. Most of the stories were about huge Wall Street investment, but in companies setting out to split “blockchain technology” from bitcoin.\n\nIn the last few weeks, however, it seems that the tone of coverage is subtly shifting. Articles such as this well reasoned piece in The Economist are appearing more frequently. Actually, just the fact that that respected, somewhat staid publication is giving bitcoin unbiased coverage is a huge step forward. The movement away from hysteria and towards reason, from both opponents and supporters of digital currency is a welcome sign.\n\nThat Economist article, though, still focuses on the blockchain and the concept of a distributed ledger, even while acknowledging the great strides that the currency has made this year. Forbes, however, who have themselves shifted from only hostile “it’s all a scam” type coverage to regular more reasoned pieces, published this Laura Shin story this week, highlighting one case where Wall street is actually investing in the currency rather than just the blockchain.\n\nIt tells of how New York life, Bain Capital and Mastercard (MA), among others have invested an undisclosed sum in Digital Currency Group, headed up by Barry Silbert. (Silbert was the man behind SecondMarket Solutions, which was bought by Nasdaq last week). In the article, Silbert is quoted as saying “The mission [of DCG] is to accelerate the development of a better financial system and we do that by building and investing in bitcoin and blockchain companies and leveraging our insights, our network and our access capital.”\n\nThe name of the venture and the fact that bitcoin is included in their plans make this a different animal from others that have recently attracted funding.\n\nThe interest from Bain makes perfect sense; they are interested only in the profit potential of companies that they invest in, but, without wishing to appear too paranoid, the presence of Mastercard in this consortium is a little worrying. They and other payment processors stand to lose the most if bitcoin, or for that matter another peer to peer digital currency, were to really take off.\n\nI have pointed out in the past that when large corporations are threatened by technology they first attempt to discredit it, then to fight it and, when it becomes apparent that they are fighting a losing battle, they then try to just buy it. Given that in the past, Mastercard executives have voiced the opinion that digital currencies’ “risks outweigh the benefits” and stated outright that bitcoin can't be trusted this investment marks either a major change of heart or a movement to the third stage of corporate technology denial.\n\nThat caveat aside, though, the last few weeks have seen a lot of positive news on the bitcoin front. That is no doubt in part due to the relative stability of the price over the last few months, and USD/BTC climbing fairly steadily above the psychologically important $300 level. For those that hold bitcoin, that in itself is welcome news, but over time the more accepting attitude towards the currency of Wall Street and the mainstream media may prove to be more significant."", ""The price of bitcoin has hit a new high for 2015, with the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) peaking at $333.75 this morning.\n\nBitcoin, which opened the day at $313.31, rose 6.5% to $333.75 at 8.16am (UTC). It has since decreased to $326.55 at press time.\n\nThe cryptocurrency began the year trading at $313.92, which was followed by a steep drop of more than 43% to $177.28 two weeks later, making headlines across the world.\n\nToday's peak price marks a 6.2% increase from the digital currency's value on 1st January 2015, but a 57% decrease from the same day in 2014, when bitcoin was trading at $770.44.\n\nThe news comes after a steady climb since mid-September. Two days ago, the BPI peaked at $300 for the first time since 13th July, when it reached a high of $310.09.\n\nRocket launch image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'Despite a stack of obituaries, Bitcoin is now selling for over $330, the highest price the cryptocurrency has seen in a full year.\n\nSix years into Bitcoin’s lifespan, the technology is notorious for volatility and what the Economist calls an “unfair” bad reputation of drugs and overzealous supporters.\n\nIn 2013, after U.S. law enforcement shut down the Silk Road black market and put Bitcoin into the world media’s spotlight, the currency’s value rapidly shot up to over $1,100 per bitcoin, only to take a series of wounding falls down to below $200. It was a sobering global introduction.\n\nToday, Bitcoin’s era of violent swings seems to have passed. After all the turbulence Bitcoin has been through, how did this rise happen?\n\nChina\n\nChina is such a powerful driver for the Bitcoin economy that the Chinese Yuan now makes up 88 percent of all Bitcoin transactions, compared to just 9 percent using the U.S. dollar.\n\nWe know that China is massively interested in Bitcoin. What we don’t know for sure is why.\n\nPinpointing the exact reasons behind Bitcoin’s price is notoriously difficult. This is a $4.7 billion market built on privacy, so diagnosing the ups and downs is often more art than science.\n\n“With price it’s always going to be a complicated question because there are so many variables ambiguating what moves where,” Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Bitcoin research and advocacy non-profit Coin Center, told the Daily Dot in a phone interview. “It’s pretty much impossible to know, but we can always speculate.”\n\nOne popular theory dominates the rest when it comes to explaining the China’s impact on Bitcoin: In a country that increasingly uses technology to beat government control, Bitcoin allows Chinese citizens to beat controls placed on money.\n\nThe Chinese government places tight controls on how citizens and residents can use their money, even when traveling abroad, in an attempt to keep more money inside the country. But China’s domestic economic woes are pushing Yuan investment around the world, making Bitcoin an attractive investment for people with global ambitions, according to Marshall Long, Chief Technical Officer of Bitcoin consulting firm FinalHash.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t suffer the limitations of borders, as it can be transferred worldwide instantly with no government oversight.\n\n“For what it’s worth, Bitcoin is at the very least a good way to fly low under the radar for capital controls,” Van Valkenburgh said.\n\nAs confidence in the Chinese economy continues on relatively shaky ground, and Beijing responds with tight controls, many say Bitcoin is one of the big benefactors.\n\nWorld currencies flow into BTC\n\nFiatleak\n\nBitcoin’s reward\n\nIn 2016, Bitcoin will change.\n\nBitcoin miners use powerful computers to complete complex math problems that are needed to create new bitcoins. Miners then receive a reward in the currency for their trouble. Right now, the reward sits at 25 Bitcoins, which is currently worth about $8,000.\n\nNext year, the reward will halve to 12.5 Bitcoins in 2016, significantly slowing the supply of new coins and, many hope, force Bitcoin inflation to a far lower level—and, importantly, lower than that of some national currencies.\n\nThe halving reward is “spurring on speculation,” Long told the Daily Dot. The hype for the coming halving percolates throughout the community, with supporters call the impending milestone “a triumph” worth celebrating. One hope is that countries like Venezuela and Ukraine will increasingly turn to Bitcoin as their own currencies falter.\n\nAdd that to the growing global payments industry that may continue to raise demand, and a slowing supply suddenly seems like a potential windfall—and a potential reason for immediate investment driven by that hope.\n\nNot everyone believes the Bitcoin halving, which is set to happen on July 25, 2016, is driving price increases today.\n\n“I’m more skeptical of this theory,” Van Valkenburgh said. “Yes, in a simplified way, supply will be halved and demand will go up. But there’s a concept in monetary economics called rational expectations that says any known future changes in supply are automatically priced in.”\n\nIn this respect, there’s nothing quite like Bitcoin. With, say, gold or the U.S. dollar, the future supply carries uncertainty—we could always find more gold, or the Federal Reserve could create more cash. With Bitcoin, we know there will be a total of 21 million coins minted and then the spigot will stop.\n\nWe also know the reward will half next year, so what are the chances there will be a spike in price when the change comes, predictable as it the change is? We’ll find out next July.\n\nDark Net\n\nThe media often focuses on the salacious and crime-friendly uses of Bitcoin at the expense of all else, drawing the criticism of the currency’s investors and enthusiasts.\n\nTheir criticism is more or less true—the media does often further a negative image of Bitcoin. And yet, a multi-million dollar drug trade in Bitcoin has undeniably existed since the currency’s early days. How much does this black market play a role in Bitcoin’s success this year?\n\nIf the Bitcoin economy is difficult to understand, the Dark Net is doubly so.\n\nBeginning in earnest in 2011 with the launch of Silk Road, which accepted Bitcoin as its sole payment option, the currency attracted criminals. Little has changed in the years since. Almost no one can be quite sure the size or momentum of the entire Dark Net economy. The people in the best position to know are market owners, who keep those details as tightly wrapped secrets.\n\n“The early adopters of any technology are often criminals,” Van Valkenburgh explained. “Criminals tend to be risk seekers, so you’re probably the kind of person who is comfortable with risky technology.”\n\nDespite extensive police action against the Dark Net, the black markets endure. But given all the major market casualties over the last year, there’s no reason to believe it’s kept up with Bitcoin’s overall growth in size.\n\n“Some of the early speculative bubbles and price support were people who wanted to use the technology for illegal purposes,” Van Valkenburgh argued, “but now that we’re seeing [Bitcoin] mature, these newer fluctuations go beyond that.”\n\nMaturity\n\nBitcoin’s price isn’t anywhere near its peak.\n\nThe highest-ever price came in late in 2013, when it hit roughly $1,200 per bitcoin. Now a whopping $900 below that high mark, how can anyone count today’s Bitcoin price as anything more than a loss?\n\n“One of the fundamental differences [between 2013 and 2015] is the amount of diversity in the market,” Van Valkenburgh argued. The landscape has changed.\n\n“With some of the previous bubbles, there’s a lot of reason to believe that a fair amount of that was artificially inflated from single choke points like Mt. Gox,” Van Valkenburgh said, referring to the major Bitcoin exchange that imploded in early 2014. “So if you wanted to pump the price, you could do it easily because there were only a handful of exchanges run by questionable characters.”\n\nThe biggest of the old Bitcoin exchanges, like Mt. Gox, collapsed, and their owners face police action for fraud. There are more exchanges today, and they are more geographically diverse, making it much more difficult to manipulate the currency through fraud.\n\n“There are a whole new range of exchanges in China and the USA now,” Van Valkenburgh explained. “At this point, it’s much more difficult to move the price through fraud because you don’t have a single exchange to do something nefarious on, you have a very competitive market.”\n\nIllustration by Max Fleishman', 'Screengrab: YouTube\n\nPatric Lanhed is trying to send one euro worth of Bitcoin from one digital wallet to another. But first, he has to hold a near-field communication (NFC) chip reader against his hand. Underneath his skin is a tiny computer chip, a popular modification among the bodyhacking crowd, which contains the secret key to his Bitcoin wallet.\n\nOnce the scan is complete, and custom software written by Lanhed and his collaborator Juanjo Tara—a software developer for Arduino—confirms that the key stored on the chip is legitimate, the pair anxiously watch a screen displaying a Bitcoin wallet, waiting for its balance to go up.\n\nWhen it does, Lanhed exclaims, ""It worked!"" and Tara whistles.\n\nWith that, Lanhed and Tara have completed what they call a Bitcoin ""bio-payment""—a way to send and receive cryptocurrency using data literally stored inside your body, and some custom software built on top of a Bitcoin wallet\'s developer API.\n\nWhat Lanhed and Tara have done really isn\'t all that different from what other implementations of NFC technology already accomplish. Circle, an app for Bitcoin payments, for example, has NFC functionality built-in. Medical bracelets with NFC tech have also been around for a few years. But the advantage with the implant approach, it seems, is that all of this tech is now handily stored in your hand. Just try losing that.\n\nWhen I reached out to the pair, though, they told me that Bitcoin is just the beginning of their plans. They want to create a general bio-payment terminal system that can be used in stores.\n\n""We are here to try to expand the frontiers of bio-functionality,"" Tara wrote me in an email, ""we started with bitcoins as a tribute of the revolution on the internet, and we believe in have the ownership of our data.""\n\nEventually, Lanhed added, they hope their software will allow people to store more than just their Bitcoin wallet keys on their chips.\n\n""Ultimately you will be able to connect you credit card to your implant and pay with that,"" Lanhed wrote. ""But this terminal is probably a generic product that can be used in other situations as well. It doesn\'t have to be payments, it can be reading medical journals or travel documents.""\n\nThe pair are hardly the first to merge the cyberpunk-leaning worlds of biohacking and cryptocurrencies, however.\n\nMartijn Wismeijer, founder of a Dutch Bitcoin ATM company, also implanted NFC chips containing the private keys to cryptocurrency wallets in his hands last year. It\'s unclear, however, based on the news coverage surrounding the event, if Wismeijer actually used his chips to send or receive Bitcoin payments, but he claims he used it to store his coins in his wallet. Hence, Lanhed and Tara are staking their claim as being the first to make an actual payment.\n\nThe crux of the system is a tiny chip developed by DIY biohacking company Dangerous Things that stores 888 bytes of data. It\'s not much, but it\'s enough to store bits of data like private keys and other information. Lanhed has used his chip as an ICE tag, which first responders may scan to get vital information about someone in the case of an emergency.\n\nEventually, Tara wrote, all of their code will be made open source, so that biohackers all over can start loading up their chips with everything from Bitcoin wallets to passport information.', ""It's understandable that you haven't heard about Bitcoin in a while. From an all-time high market value of $1,242 per Bitcoin back in November 29, 2013, the cryptocurrency is, at the time of this writing, trading at a much more humble value of about $246 per Bitcoin. (Update on 11/3/15: Bitcoin is currently trading at more than $400 per coin.)\n\nBut Bitcoin is still very much on the rise. The number of Bitcoin transactions per day has increased by 57% since 2013 and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently defined cryptocurrencies as commodities, paving the way for more open trading. That means everyday people like you and I will be able to trade Bitcoin more easily. (See also: 6 Mobile Payment Tools You Should Start Using Today)\n\nHere's what this historic announcement means for the average investor, as well as some best practices for getting into the cryptocurrency game.\n\nSo, What's a Bitcoin?\n\nIn very simple terms, Bitcoin is a form of digital money that you can use to make purchases, or save as an investment. Unlike other virtual currencies, such as Second Life's Linden dollars, Bitcoin adds a layer of security through cryptography on all transactions and emissions of new units.\n\nWhat Can I Do With Bitcoin?\n\nYou can use bitcoins for virtually anything. (Pun intended!)\n\nSince people can trade derivatives on Bitcoin, it was in the interest of the CFTC to classify Bitcoin as a commodity. That way the CFTC has jurisdiction over companies trading Bitcoin swaps, and can protect the interests of consumers.\n\nHow Do I Get Bitcoins?\n\nTo start using Bitcoins, you need first to get some coins into your digital wallet. The easiest way to get a hold of some bitcoins is to buy them at an exchange. Here's how to do it.\n\n1. Choose a Wallet\n\nYou can pick from many available desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux), mobile (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, or Blackberry), hardware, or web Bitcoin wallets to store and use your Bitcoins.\n\nEach type of wallet has it advantages and disadvantages, so take the time to review each option. Novice users of Bitcoin may be better off to sticking to a widely used alternative, such as Coinbase — it has 2.6 million users with four million wallets and is accepted by 40,000 merchants.\n\n2. Fund Your Wallet\n\nMost Bitcoin users complete their first deposit using a bank account. No matter what wallet you choose, you'll need to first verify your bank account with the company managing the wallet. Keep in mind that some wallets may require you to verify a bank account before you can start using the wallet.\n\n3. Get Free Bitcoins\n\nThere are a few ways to score some free coins. First, you could receive Bitcoin tips by posting awesome content on certain sites, such as Reddit, or connecting your social media accounts to ChangeTip. Second, you could receive cryptocurrency payments for completing small tasks, such as viewing websites or completing surveys, at BitVisitor and FaucetBTC.\n\n4. Buy and Sell Bitcoins\n\nDepending on your Bitcoin needs, you may need to buy additional coins when your balance is running low or to exchange coins into dollars. Fees vary per exchange and financial institution. For example, Coinbase doesn't charge fees for accepting and receiving Bitcoins, but does charge you a 1% fee when converting Bitcoins to dollars. Some banks may charge you a fee for transferring funds from your wallet to your checking account.\n\nWhat Are Some Best Practices?\n\nBitcoin is still in development, so it's better to be safe than sorry. Here are some key things to consider:\n\n1. Keep an Eye on Market Value\n\nThe price of a Bitcoin in dollars is very volatile. On January 3, 2015, the market value of one Bitcoin was $302.33 and on the very next day, it was $270.93. If you're risk averse, then Bitcoin isn't for you.\n\n2. Have Only What You Really Need in Your Wallet\n\nJust like you keep only a few hundred or thousands dollars in your checking account to cover your monthly expenses and the rest on a saving or investment account, you should keep your Bitcoin wallet only with what you need. You don't walk around with $10,000 on your normal wallet, do you?\n\n3. Understand That Bitcoin Payments Are Irreversible\n\nNowadays, even barbers and lawyers are accepting Bitcoin. When buying with Bitcoin, make sure to deal only with reputable merchants. Once a payment is completed, the only way to reverse it is by having the person receiving the payment reverse it themselves — which means they can refuse to do so. When making payments online, check out the company's reputation before handing over your coins.\n\n4. Learn How to Maintain and Backup and Online Wallet\n\nDepending on what type of wallet you use, you may be ultimately responsible for backing up its data. In the event that you receive a large amount of Bitcoins, it's a good idea to stash some of them in an offline wallet and have a backup. Learn from the lesson of the man who lost $7.5 million in Bitcoins when his computer hard drive got thrown away.\n\n5. Don't Put Your Life Savings Into Bitcoin\n\nUnlike bank accounts, Bitcoin wallets aren't covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC provides coverage of up to $250,000 for a wide variety of deposit accounts. Any losses that Bitcoin exchanges suffer have to be covered either by themselves or by an insurance plan that those exchanges pay for. Exchanges have to be very vigilant of malicious hacker attacks, such as the $460 million heist on Mt. Gox.\n\n5. There's More Than One Type of Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin is just one of several hundreds of cryptocurrencies. Just because Litecoin sounds like Bitcoin, doesn't mean that they are worth the same. One Litecoin is worth 0.01 Bitcoins. Some cryptocurrencies may have funny names, such as Dogecoin or Unobtanium, but they do have an actual market value.\n\n6. Learn the Tax Implications of Using Bitcoin\n\nSince the IRS treats Bitcoin as property, federal tax rules for property transactions apply to any transaction involving Bitcoin. If you only plan on using Bitcoin sporadically, keeping track of the market losses or gains of your few transactions won't be that hard. If you plan to pay with Bitcoin regularly, receive or issue wages in Bitcoin, or start a Bitcoin mining operation, then learn more about the tax implications of using Bitcoin.\n\nAre you considering buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?"", 'The price of bitcoin continues to rise, led primarily by the exchanges in China, which have, oftentimes, been trading at a premium of $10/BTC higher than the other major exchanges around the world. With China driving such an increase in the bitcoin price, many have been speculating that it could be driven by capital controls.\n\nIn China, the law stipulates that individuals cannot send more than the equivalent of $50,000 out of the country in a year. To get around this, individuals have hired smugglers to get cash out of the country, bought extremely expensive real estate in cities like New York and London, and even set up businesses in other countries with the goal of overpaying for inventory from China. All of this just to get money out of the country.\n\nAccording to pseudonymous blogger Tyler Durden of Zero Hedge , the primary driver has been the Chinese purchasing bitcoin as a way of getting around capital controls.\n\n“If a few hundred million Chinese decide that the time has come to use bitcoin as the capital controls bypassing currency of choice … sit back and watch as we witness the second coming of the bitcoin bubble,” he wrote in a recent blog post .\n\nBut is this, in fact, what is occurring?\n\nAccording to Bobby Lee, the Founder and CEO of BTCC, while a hedge against capital controls is certainly a use case for bitcoin, it’s not what is driving this run up.\n\n“I can tell you, being on the ground with the bitcoin exchange in China, I can guestimate that the vast majority of trading volume is not for that reason. The reality is, there are many loopholes around the capital controls. For the most part, it’s not a strict, strict capital controls,” he explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “If you look at countries like Myanmar and Argentina, which have very strict capital controls, you’ll have the price of bitcoin to USD [U.S. dollars] is much greater.”\n\nJack Liu, head of international at OKCoin, also disagreed with the notion that it had anything to do with capital controls. In an email to Bitcoin Magazine , he said, “I don\'t think so. It\'s speculation.”\n\nLeon Li, CEO of Huobi, said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, “to be clear, it’s not about capital controls.”\n\nBTCC, OKCoin, and Huobi are the three biggest exchanges in China. All three don’t see a fear of capital controls driving the recent run-up of the price of bitcoin.\n\nIf it’s not capital controls, what is it?\n\nIt’s About Perception\n\n“Over the last two months, we’ve seen a steady increase in bitcoin activity and bitcoin volumes and price appreciation. The reason this price has happened is because of renewed interest,” Lee explained. “All the bad news has come out over the past year and a half, and now it’s over.”\n\nLee walked through a list of the bad news that held bitcoin back: Mt. Gox imploding, the Chinese government offering ambiguous opinions on bitcoin, and the Silk Road bitcoin being sold en masse. “We’ve been in a bear market for the past 18 months,” he said.\n\nAnd with that bear market came the need for miners to liquidate more of their bitcoin than normal because they didn’t know what the future price would be, Lee explained. “There’s a constant selling pressured caused by bitcoin miners.”\n\n“The price is recovering on a rebound after several months in a narrow range. Some Chinese traders are expressing a view on the CNY exchange rate after the last devaluation, and you have interest by mainland speculators to move to other assets after the stock market fallout,” Liu of OKCoin said to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nWhat Lee does believe is that there is only one reason that the price of bitcoin is going up:\n\n“It’s mostly new users,” he said, referring to who was signing up for the site during this recent run-up in price. “Bitcoin price, if I may be bold, has been going up in the recent years for only one reason: more usage, more acceptance and more awareness. When bitcoin is in more hands, the price naturally goes up. It’s the law of scarcity.”\n\nLi of Huobi believes that there are a multitude of reasons driving the price higher. He touched on the recent regulatory environment with the CFTC saying bitcoin was a commodity and, in Europe, the courts saying that it was exempt from VAT.\n\n“More financial institutions entered this industry,” he said, “such as bitcoin-based ETN and ETF were founded in Europe. Organizations and individuals involved more in bitcoin market as the policy and funding is becoming in favor of bitcoin.”\n\nBut Li also offered some negative reasons in China that might support the recent rise.\n\n“Finance industry is developing rapidly in China during recent years, however, there still exists a distance in terms of trading mechanisms compared to the developed countries, which hindered the small and medium-sized investors from enjoying convenient services and trades,"" he said. ""Chinese banking industry is still charging high transaction fees despite the fact that we’re living in the Internet Age.”\n\nNonetheless, bitcoin is rising, and China is leading the pack. Whether this run will last for only a short while or this is the beginning of another bull run, no one is certain. But the energy within the community is certainly more positive, this run-up encouraging more people to talk about bitcoin.\n\nAnd as Lee said, as more people become aware of bitcoin, more people will use it, and that alone will drive the price up.\n\nHas purchasing #bitcoin to get around capital controls in China driven up the price? https://t.co/BFuTMWmxpN — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 30, 2015\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin. He runs a weekly digital currency and blockchain newsletter called Crypto Brief.', '', 'Bitcoin security platform BitGo announced the launch of the first automated open source Key Recovery Service (KRS) software that allows generating, securing and storing private backup keys, which should make it one of the most secure Bitcoin vaults in the world.\n\nA major problem Bitcoin wallet users encounter is the security of the keys. While most new secure wallets implement multi-signature, in which 1 or 2 keys are created and stored by the user, a problem arises when the user forgets one of the passwords as they would then lose access to the wallet and its contents. However, BitGo’s new software and 2-of-3 key model are configured to eliminate such a danger.\n\nBen Chan, Platform Lead, BitGo commented:\n\n“As a multi-sig, trustless wallet provider, BitGo believes the user has to be in control of the funds. At the same time, many users don’t want the burden of securing keys or remembering difficult pass phrases at the risk of losing their balance. However, we didn’t want to create more than 1 key for our users, which is why we’ve open sourced the software so others can run it and provide keys for creating wallets on demand.”\n\nAccording to the whitepater, BitGo’s KRS provides the user with one key, BitGo with the second key and the third party KRS (that the user can choose from a list of secure third party KRS providers) with the backup key. Thus, this model ensures the wallet owner never loses control of their digital assets.\n\nThe first company to integrate BitGo’s new KRS software is a bitcoin holding key backup service Keytern.al.\n\n“As longtime advocates for accessible and practical techniques to improve safety and privacy for end users, we are thrilled about the opportunity to work with BitGo to deliver these important services to customers of their multi-sig wallet,” said Jeffrey Paul, Co-founder, Keytern.al. “Our experience over many years of cryptography engineering as well as working with most of the world’s leading bitcoin exchanges showed unambiguously that multi-sig is the single best way to avoid many risks associated with using bitcoin, and expert, safe, and convenient key handling is key to the success of multi-sig deployments.”\n\nBitGo is also in talks with Elliptic with plans to bring on additional KRS providers in the coming months.\n\nYou can the reference implementation on Github or try the new service here.', 'In an attempt to further decrease energy costs and its impact on the environment, BitFury announced that it was launching the world’s largest two-phase immersion cooling (2PIC) project at its new data center in the Republic of Georgia.\n\nBy using the technology from Allied Control, bought in January, and the Novec 7100 Engineered Fluid from industrial giant 3M, the company is hoping to optimize its operations and make them more green. The firm intends on using 3M’s fluid to cool more than 40 megawatts of processing power.\n\n“The maintenance cost of traditional low-cost air cooling systems is quite high compared to immersion cooling, and it is very problematic to use low-cost air cooling systems in the areas with hot weather, it becomes very costly,” said Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nVavilov explained that the utilization of immersion cooling allows for a reduction in maintenance costs. Further, it opens up the possibility of the company launching mining operations in parts of the world that would otherwise not provide efficient cooling.\n\n“In addition, we are able to deploy it in the areas with hot weather climate which opens possibility to operate literally in any location in the world. Also, for chips, this fluid is ideal exploitation environment and it allows to run them with maximum possible efficiency that just cannot be achieved using low-cost air-cooled systems,” he explained.\n\n2PIC works by placing hardware in a specially designed tank with a liquid coolant such as the Novec 7100. What makes this fluid particularly useful is that it has a low boiling point, which means that as it heats, it starts to evaporate much more quickly. That pulls the heat away from the hardware in the device, allowing them to operate at a higher rate for much longer. When the vapor hits a water-cooled condenser coil, it becomes a fluid again and falls back into the tank, thus reducing the amount of fluid loss significantly.\n\n“One of the primary limitations for computer performance is the thermal environment. Two-phase immersion cooling with Novec fluids provides tight coupling between device temperatures and the fluid boiling temperature. This means that these devices operate in a narrower temperature band,” explained Michael Garceau, 3M Business Development Manager, Data Center Markets, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “This is true not just for the processors, but for the circuits and devices delivering power to them. This, in turn, allows the hardware to be driven harder on average than would be possible in air and “overclocked” as is often done in the most profitable early stages of a mining deployment.”\n\nGarceau also explained that because these 2PIC-specific boards don’t require heat sinks and cold plates, the processing hardware can be more densely packed with the 2PIC boards. This enables improved overclocking capacity.\n\n“500-watt ASICs have been successfully overclocked to well over 750 watts. 2PIC with a Novec fluid will enable BitFury to lower operational costs by allowing them to run ASICs more efficiently,” Garceau explained.\n\nThe Environment is Key for BitFury\n\nAccording to Garceau, “The streamlined system can deliver as much as 95 percent cooling energy savings with minimal fluid loss.” The cost of cooling hardware is an additional expense that many miners don’t consider when first starting out. Big scale fans require electricity.\n\n“Green transaction processing is a significant and important part of our business strategy. With our acquisition of Allied Control, we have been able not only to utilize renewable energy sources like hydropower in our datacenter located in the Republic of Georgia, but also achieve a very energy-efficient cooling despite hot daytime temperatures,” explained Vavilov.\n\nThe Novec Engineered Fluids are nonflammable, have zero ozone depletion potential, have a low global warming potential, are Hazardous Air Pollutant-free, and are U.S. EPA SNAP-approved. And because the majority of the fluid condenses and drops back into the tank, replenishment isn’t needed for multiple hardware generations.\n\nAll told, BitFury is focused on delivering blockchain transaction processing in an efficient and green environment.\n\n“We strive to ensure low carbon print and high efficiency of all our operations and already rely on renewable energy – thermal and hydropower – for all our operations,” Vavilov said. “We are also in the process of developing low-cost wind turbine technology that will provide another affordable and effective energy solution. We plan that by next year our data centers will be powered by the low-cost renewable energy generated by our new wind turbines. This will allow to further significantly lower our electricity cost and secure a long-term access to cheap electricity on a predictable basis.”\n\nWith electricity being the primary outlier that separates the profitable miners from the unprofitable, taking control of the supply of that power ensures that BitFury can remain profitable while also doing its part to reduce the significant carbon footprint found in bitcoin mining.\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

10/31/2015,"['Happy Halloween! Let’s talk about the scariest thing in the tech world today. No, no, not bubbles, drones, or unicorns: Bitcoin. Seriously. (Mostly.) Whether you think it’s a boondoggle scam, a libertarian Trojan horse that threatens governments, the scourge of Wall Street, or the thin edge of the post-capitalist wedge, you face two scary prospects: what if you’re right? And what if you’re wrong?\n\nI’m a long-term Bitcoin believer, in case it isn’t clear, esconced in the (counterintuitive, possibly hopelessly optimistic) “thin edge of the post-capitalist wedge” camp. And while you probably weren’t watching, interesting things have been happening in the Bitcoin world of late. Angry conflicts that could break the Bitcoin blockchain! Fascinating launches and proofs-of-concept! And, most entertaining of all, the ongoing teetering crawl towards mainstream acceptance! Be still your beating hearts.\n\nLet’s start with the angry conflict; everybody loves angry conflict.\n\nI Got The Blocksize Blues\n\nBitcoin 101: bitcoin transactions are stored on a globally distributed blockchain, which is, surprise, a chain of “blocks” of cryptographically verified Bitcoin transactions, each linking to the previous block in the chain. Lo these many years ago, Bitcoin’s implausibly mysterious1 creator Satoshi Nakamoto implemented a limit on the size of those blocks: 1 single megabyte. This was fairly clearly intended as a temporary restriction to avoid denial-of-service attacks.\n\nSince a new Bitcoin block is generated every 10 minutes (ish), this restriction limits the throughput of the entire Bitcoin network to a mere ~7 transactions per second. And so, many people (including me) believe the blocksize limit must ultimately be raised. The problem: this is a hard fork, i.e. will essentially create a blockchain incompatible with older versions of the software. If a meaningful number of clients don’t upgrade, the notion of a single undisputed master blockchain — the primary concept on which all of Bitcoin rests — could be at risk.\n\nSo the Bitcoin great and good got together and agreed on a wise upgrade plan! Right? You wish. Instead, after various proposals were advanced, two of the core developers essentially went rogue and released their own Bitcoin fork, Bitcoin XT, over the strenuous objections of many.\n\nGive those two some credit, though; their fork doesn’t activate unless more than three-quarters of Bitcoin miners adopt it (which seems vanishingly unlikely) and for better or worse, it successfully forced some progressive discussion on the issue. To my mind, the most sensible proposal by far, rather than adding complexity or locking in 20 years’ worth of changes, is that of Blockstream president Adam Back:\n\nStrongly agree. My suggestion 2MB now, then 4MB in 2 years and 8MB in 4years then re-asses. (Similar to BIP 102) https://t.co/1VjeF0SRP0 — Adam Back (@adam3us) August 26, 2015\n\n…and I will not be at all surprised if that’s the compromise that Bitcoin eventually settles on. The whole kerfuffle really highlights one thing, though; for a revolutionary initiative that has spawned countless startups, and a cryptocurrency worth billions of dollars, Bitcoin’s overall governance really is remarkably seat-of-the-pants right now.\n\nSidechains For Everyone!\n\nSpeaking of Blockstream, a Bitcoin core-infrastructure startup I’ve been fascinated by for some time, they’ve only just gone and released their first production sidechain, Liquid, into the wild. Which is pretty remarkable.\n\nSidechains are secondary blockchains whose tokens are fully mathematically convertible to and from Bitcoin — but which run under their own rules. For instance, you could create a sidechain that supports confidential transactions (Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous but completely public), or one that finalizes transactions much faster than Bitcoin does. Or even do both…which is exactly what Liquid is.\n\nThis isn’t what I would call a pure sidechain; transfers to and from it require validation by a consortium of entities. This will be necessary until and unless the Bitcoin protocol is modified to add a new smart-contract instruction type to make that validation automatic. (As a reminder; every Bitcoin transaction is in fact a program coded in Bitcoin’s scripting language. That language needs to be slightly more expansive to support sidechains.)\n\nBitshares and Lightning\n\nSpeaking of smart contracts — arguably the single most interesting and revolutionary thing about Bitcoin, the feature that makes it not just cryptographically scarce but programmable money — there have been numerous interesting developments there, too. Bitshares, a (blockchain-based, but separate from Bitcoin) “industrial-grade smart contract platform,” launched their 2.0 platform on October 13th. It features a whole cornucopia of interesting features.\n\n(Including, somewhat controversially, a “consensus algorithm” — the code which secures its blockchain — fundamentally different from Bitcoin’s: “delegated proof-of-stake” vs. Bitcoin’s “proof-of-work.” Which may sound to the non-cryptocurrenscenti like a dispute about angels dancing on pins, but trust me, it’s a fundamental and fascinating divergence. I may write about it at greater length in the future.)\n\nBitshares wants to be the go-to platform for financial applications worldwide … although given their dire straits only a few months ago, one has to wonder. And that still makes them much less ambitious than Ethereum, who I’ve written about before, and who recently partnered with none other than Microsoft.\n\nAnd then there’s the proposed Lightning Network (which I’ve also written about before) — essentially a write cache, a bit like Akamai for Bitcoin, that could let the currency scale to a truly gargantuan number of simultaneous transactions. Blockstream (yes, them again) commenced development on Lightning earlier this year, and it continues apace … although it too will require updates to the core Bitcoin protocol.\n\nBut What Does It All Mean?\n\nThe above may seem like a kaleidoscopic and disconnected series of developments. They are not.\n\nBitcoin as we know it, call it “Bitcoin 1.0”, is a fascinating technical breakthrough, and already valuable as is; but it suffered from several flaws, from a general user’s perspective. It didn’t scale to widespread use. Transactions were slow to commit, always irreversible, and anything but confidential. And Bitcoin’s governance, and its amendment/iteration procedure, were ad-libbed and/or difficult-to-nonexistent.\n\nAll of those flaws are currently being addressed, in more or less elegant ways, by the iterations itemized above. (I’m not a million percent sure about the reversibility, I’d need to dig into the technical guts, but my presumption is that a write-caching network like Lightning could at least in theory permit time-limited transaction reversals.) We are witnessing the growing pains of multiple new, improved, and far more powerful decentralized blockchain-based networks, all of which may well eventually be interwoven with one another.\n\nIn other words: you ain’t seen nothing yet. Interesting times indeed. And scary ones, too, if you’re a defender of the status quo…\n\n1I have my theories, which fit the evidence available to me. (Of course I do; I used to write thrillers for a living.) But they’re only theories.\n\nFeatured Image: Benjah/Wikimedia Commons UNDER A Public Domain LICENSE', 'US, October 31, 2015 at 11:56 UTC\n\nBitfinex, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in the world, today announced that it has partnered with Blade Payments to provide real-time debit cards to Bitfinex customers. By allowing use of the card without preloading currency, the Blade card can be used anytime, providing a frictionless user experience. Most bitcoin debit cards require that the user first sell bitcoin, then load their card, in order to withdraw fiat currencies. This new paradigm means those who wish to hold bitcoin only convert the exact amount they wish to spend, without waiting for a sale to go through.\n\n“We are very happy to be providing our users with access to their bitcoin at any time via Blade’s industry-leading debit cards” said Zane Tackett, Director of Community & Product Development at Bitfinex. “We see the ability to withdraw directly from one’s Bitfinex account using traditional ATMs around the world as a major benefit for our users.”\n\nCustomers will be able to use Blade cards for purchases with online merchants, brick and mortar stores, as well as to withdraw cash at millions of ATMs around the world.\n\nEd Boyle, CEO of Blade, stated “We are thrilled to be working with Bitfinex, one of the premier exchanges in the world. Our business is built on simplifying and expediting the process of launching a bitcoin spending card and we are excited to partner with Bitfinex to provide their customers the most sophisticated card in the market.”\n\nBitfinex believes that a card offering provides its customers a lower cost, more convenient alternative for spending bitcoin and making currency withdrawals. This card program enables customers to link their bitcoin holdings to the card and provide immediate availability of funds for purchases and cash withdrawals without having to first sell their bitcoin and prefund the card with currency.\n\nThe card will be made available in the coming months to select group of customers in Europe and Asia, and it will be available for order directly through the Bitfinex website.\n\nAbout Bitfinex\n\nBitfinex is the world’s leading Bitcoin exchange, and provides the most advanced trading platform in the digital currency space.

Customers should do their own research before investing funds in any company.', 'Bitcoin enthusiasts from across the world revelled in the news that the digital currency\'s price reached a new annual high earlier this week.\n\nThe cryptocurrency peaked at $333.75 at 08:16 UTC on 30th October, reaching its highest level since January 2015 – when it famously dropped below the $200 mark.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Bobby Lee, CEO of China-based bitcoin exchange BTCC, attributed bitcoin\'s recent surge to a series of factors, saying:\n\n""I think this price rise is a combination of the recent increased usage ... and also the recent good news in the industry, such as the no-VAT ruling in Europe, the end of the auctioning of Silk Road bitcoins, etc.""\n\n""Once again, people are re-discovering the many positive aspects of using bitcoin for payments as well as for holding bitcoin as a decentralised, safe and appreciating digital asset, immune to national central bank policies,"" he continued, adding that BTCC has seen a surge in trading activity.\n\n""It\'s been slowly rising since mid-September,"" he noted.\n\nMacro economic events\n\nSpeculation about bitcoin\'s price movements has always been rife with commentators often examining global macro economic events in an attempt to decipher the fluctuations.\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Price Index, the digital currency\'s price has been steadily rising since 21st September, when it opened on $230.86 and went on to close the day\'s trading at $226.61.\n\nSince then, bitcoin\'s price has continued trending upwards, rising by over 44% to reach its peak price on 30th October.\n\nA closer inspection of CoinDesk\'s BPI shows that bitcoin\'s price increased following the European Court of Justice\'s ruling which exempted bitcoin from VAT across all EU member countries on 22nd October.\n\nFurther afield, the exertion of capital controls in China also coincided with a price spike at the end of September.\n\nA China driven surge?\n\nRobert Viglione, a PHD student, who recently published an academic paper about the differences in bitcoin\'s price across the world, shared his take on the recent price rise, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""It\'s tough to ever say definitely what\'s driving asset price movements, but the most compelling story at the moment comes out of China. True to bitcoin\'s nature as a disaster asset, as China\'s government steps up capital controls to limit one widely used avoidance path, its citizens appear to be shifting resources to the next best option, cryptocurrencies.""\n\nIt is not of the first time that the implementation of capital controls by governments has a perceived influence in bitcoin\'s trading value.\n\nEarlier this year, bitcoin passed the $300 mark, gaining increasing momentum in the wake of the Greek crisis.\n\nLike Lee, Vigilione noted the upsurge in trading among some of China\'s bitcoin exchanges:\n\n""Chinese exchanges seem to be trading at about a 10% market at the moment, which is a big shift from a historical premium of about 48 basis points below the global average. Clearly something is happening in China; whether that\'s the primary driver behind the recent price run-up isn\'t as obvious, but is certainly as good a story as any.""\n\nLee elaborated on this theory, noting that bitcoin\'s price was trading up to 10% higher in the Chinese market in comparison to USD/BTC trades.\n\nHowever, the CEO ruled out that the recent price spike had been triggered by foreign currency controls.\n\n""Despite what people are suggesting, from what I can tell, it\'s not a currency controls issue, with people wanting to move RMB out of the country,"" he said. ""Rather, it\'s just higher demand for buying bitcoins, either for payments, speculation, or for long-term holding.""\n\nA combination of factors\n\nFor Harry Yeh, managing partner at investment managing company Binary Financial, bitcoin\'s value increase could be attributed to a wide range of factors which include recent positive news about blockchain technology. Speculation in China, however, could also be driving the price up, he said.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman at the Crypto Currency Fund, was of the view that the recent focus on blockchain technology was receding and that bitcoin was attracting more attention, as people realize that its blockchain is the most pervasive of available options today.\n\nOther short term factors, according to Enneking, included the launch of the Winklevoss\' bitcoin exchange Gemini, a recent court decision that exempted bitcoin purchases from value-addex tax in the EU, and MasterCard\'s involvement in Digital Currency Group\'s recent funding round.\n\nPeople image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The tale of a marionette puppet operating without assistance truly comes to life in what is arguably the film’s most memorable scene, which occurs after Pinocchio is introduced to the twisted Stromboli. Jiminy Cricket watches by a nearby lamppost as the curtain goes up on Stromboli’s traveling gypsy wagon to reveal the little wooden boy, marching down steps as he sings, “I’ve Got No Strings.”\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin is Superior To Cashless Systems Used Today\n\nBut somewhere in the middle of the song, Pinocchio stumbles and falls flat on his face at the bottom of the stairs. The audience laughs hysterically, while Stromboli, angry about the act going awry, curses loudly in Italian. However, immediately following the blunder, the presentation continues (such is life in the merry world of the theater), and Pinocchio is an instant hit among his viewers, who throw gold and flowers onto the stage in appreciation of his entertaining services.\n\nDespite the film’s present reputation as one of the greatest animated feats of all time, it was not financially successful upon initial release. Film historians often attribute this to World War II, which prevented the release of American films in Europe and abroad. It has taken 75 years for the film to earn its current level of popularity. The film shows us not only the magic of the original Disney studios but that sometimes things take time to establish themselves in the eyes of the public.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, we can see some of the same things. Much like the film’s title character, bitcoin has fallen into a downward spiral, yet right when all seems down and rumbly, it somehow rises back to the top to earn the appreciation it deserves. Over the past several months, digital currency enthusiasts have worried and regularly stressed over the price, which for a while, seemed to hover at a measly $230. While $230 is always better than $0, it certainly isn’t anything worth celebrating.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin has managed to pull a 180 and head north in dramatic fashion, reaching $260, then $275, and now $332, which is the current price according to Google (as of press time). That’s an increase of over $100 in just a matter of weeks. Like Pinocchio’s enthusiastic viewers, maybe it’s time to throw some gold and flowers and bear some smiles on our faces.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has often been looked at with disappointment by major businesses and financial institutions. “We can’t trust Bitcoin,” said most. “It’s a magnet for illicit activity,” and everywhere you looked, people seemed to be turning away, either out of displeasure or sheer ignorance. Integration seemed to be a long way into the future, and businesses appeared to be too attached not only to fiat currency but to traditional methods of finance and payment processing. In more ways than one, banks have been to bitcoin what war has been to Disney’s film.\n\nNow, things are beginning to change. American Express is investing in blockchain startups such as Abra, and financial institutions like Mastercard, a longtime adversary of the digital currency, are now funding bitcoin companies like the Digital Currency Group and looking to them for answers. Does the popular credit card suddenly see a light shining down in the bitcoin world? Is Mastercard now looking upon digital finance as the inevitable path of the future?\n\nSeveral decades have passed, and “Pinocchio” certainly seems to have found and retained its audience. Those of us who delve in cryptocurrency can only hope that things don’t take as long for bitcoin as they did for the cartoon classic, and perhaps if enough of us “wish upon a star,” Bitcoin can finally reign true with its audience.\n\nWill Bitcoin ever achieve the popularity many believe it deserves? Post your comments below!\n\nImage sources: Family-Flix & Coinsetter\n\nOriginally posted on: Bitcoin is “The Real Boy” of Money: No Strings Attached', 'In the 1910s, the number of cars in the U.S. exploded from 200,000 to 2.5 million. The newfangled machines scared horses and ran over pedestrians, who had never before encountered anything moving down a street at 20 miles per hour. The state of Georgia classified cars as ferocious animals. By the time any government could pass the very first traffic law, it had to accommodate cars. It could not stop them.\n\nToday, thanks to political gridlock in the U.S., lawmakers respond to innovations with all the speed of continental drift. As government gets slower, tech is going the opposite way. New technologies spread instantly by cloud-based apps and social networks, and take hold with almost no legal oversight. Then, by the time government can act, it’s usually too late to wind things back to the way they were.\n\nAnd this, as it turns out, is terrific for tech startups, especially those aimed at demolishing creaky old norms—like taxis, or flight paths over crowded airspace, or money. Lately, the law vs. tech gap is making headlines as it upends the rules around sports gambling. The daily fantasy sports sites FanDuel and DraftKings are showing how fast technology can exploit the gap and put government on its heels.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nFanDuel and DraftKings got their start when FanDuel’s CEO, Nigel Eccles, noticed a clause in anti-gambling laws that allow for games of skill, which could arguably include fantasy sports. This year, the two companies perfected their apps, signed up major sports leagues and teams along with ESPN as partners, raised a combined $575 million in venture funding, exploited the legal gap and took hold in the mass market.\n\nSo now government is upset about what happened when it wasn’t looking. Nevada says the companies need a gambling license. The Department of Justice is investigating the legality of the apps. Congress is harrumphing and rustling papers and saying it might hold hearings.\n\nBut the officials and politicians are probably too late. The real question for lawmakers is not whether FanDuel and DraftKings fit into old laws that apparently have more holes than Blackburn, Lancashire. It’s whether they’re willing to take action that would destroy the companies’ $2.5 billion combined value owned by important investors (and campaign donors) like KKR, Comcast, NBC, Major League Baseball and several Silicon Valley VCs. Oh, and maybe lawmakers will think twice before ending an activity enjoyed by around 50 million people, many of them the lawmakers’ constituents.\n\nIf government had examined the fantasy sites a year ago, shutting them down or putting them in a legal corner would’ve been relatively easy. Because government was so inept, now it’s the one in a corner. Speed to critical mass turns out to be a great strategy in the face of rickety laws and oblivious lawmakers. The faster companies move, the less government can get in their way.\n\nThis kind of thing is happening all around us. Drone aircraft are suddenly filling the sky, and a whole multibillion-dollar industry of drone making and drone services has taken hold. Now the Federal Aviation Administration is scrambling to catch up and make rules. If the FAA had been either farsighted or fast moving, at the first sign of drones it might’ve outlawed them or confined them to someplace like Oklahoma where they can’t get in the way of anything too important. But now the FAA is forced to accommodate drones, not the other way around.\n\nBitcoin is another example. The technology has spawned hundreds of startups funded by billions of dollars of investment. It could remake the global financial system. Bitcoin is becoming so mainstream, in Las Vegas you can now walk up to a Mike Tyson–branded bitcoin ATM machine. (The New York Post, as only it can do, reported the development this way: “Iron Mike Tyson has moved from bit ears to bitcoin.”) But have you heard the word bitcoin uttered once in any of the presidential debates? Government doesn’t even understand bitcoin, and that’s been really good for it.\n\nUber and Airbnb showed how to execute this outrun-the-government strategy. By the time cities understood what those companies were doing, it was too late to block or seriously limit them. New York tried to stop both, ran into outcries from its citizens and backed off. Other cities, like San Francisco, ended up passing laws that allow the companies to keep doing what they were already doing, as long as they pay some additional taxes.\n\nNow there are certainly dangers in this gap. “A genuine public policy crisis for the new economy has emerged,” writes Larry Downes, an author and expert on law and technology. Like FanDuel and DraftKings, startups that outrun laws eventually wind up in some kind of distracting or destabilizing fight, often spurred by legacy businesses, such as taxi owners, protected by regulations and laws. Downes calls this “an epidemic of misguided efforts by incumbent businesses to apply old laws to new products and services.”\n\nThe other danger is the risk to society of ungoverned technology. An unchecked plague of drones buzzing around cities would be a problem not unlike cars on anarchic streets in 1916. We want to protect our privacy, the nature of our neighborhoods, our safety and our money from potential harm by new technologies. Coming our way soon will be some really smart artificial intelligence that some super-successful people such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking think might pose a danger to humans. They’re calling for laws or codes of conduct that would protect us the way we’re protected from nuclear bombs.\n\nSo to both protect citizens and at the same time allow disruptive technology to flourish, let’s get government to stay on top of new developments in a smart, bipartisan, forward-leaning way.\n\nThat was a joke.', 'Whoever thought that lovers of gore-splattered, demon-possessed monsters were a valuable target audience? Or that a series called Ash vs. Evil Dead—about a middle-aged stock boy fighting an army of drooling “deadites”—could be a key show in a cable network’s niche strategy?\n\n“We talked to a lot of places about this show, met with a lot of high-falutin’ suitors,” says Ash vs. Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell, a fixture in the films on which the show is based and also a producer of the new series, which debuts on Halloween. “But Starz is the only place this could have worked. They got it.”\n\nAnd it looks they’ll continue to get it—before the show has even premiered, Starz said it would renew Ash vs. Evil Dead for a second season. The network could use a hit. Earlier this week its quarterly results fell short of expectations.\n\nTargeting groups that other networks have overlooked—and then using those communities to reach millions of other viewers—has been the plan at Starz (STRZA) since Chris Albrecht became CEO in 2010. “We really needed to come up with a point of view about where we were serving in the marketplace,” Albrecht told Fortune.com recently. “How we were differentiating ourselves? That took me awhile to figure out.”\n\nSince Albrecht joined Starz, the network has added 7 million new subscribers to become the second-most-distributed premium cable network after HBO (TWX). And one way Starz did that, says the network’s managing director Carmi Zlotnik, is to “super-serve the underserved,” by delivering shows that grab an appreciative audience and then push beyond.\n\nPower and Survivor’s Remorse are Starz series that have connected with African-American viewers while The White Queen and Outlander have brought in women. Now the network is going for horror-movie fans, with the latest addition to the venerable Evil Dead fear franchise.\n\n“We’re huge fans,” Zlotnik says of the Evil Dead franchise. “And that includes people like me who grew up with it, it includes the assistants in the office who are just getting into it.”\n\nThe Evil Dead is the epitome of a cult classic, collecting millions of fans over the last 30-odd years—with loyalists supporting the original trilogy of films, a 2013 reboot, videogames, comic books, and even a musical. But the horror/comedy hybrid can take some getting used to.\n\nLike Campbell, Evil Dead creator Sam Raimi is a big Three Stooges buff and it shows in scenes that routinely mix slapstick comedy and over-the-top gore. Campbell’s character, Ash, had to amputate his own demon-possessed hand in the second film. His stump is now outfitted with a chainsaw, and in the Starz series, he uses it to slice and dice the monsters whom he’s, once again, unwittingly unleashed.\n\nBut even with Ash vs. Evil Dead’s push-the-envelope horror, Campbell says no one at the network has told them to pull back.\n\n“We have complete freedom of carnage,” he brags. “That’s why I think Starz is the only place this could have worked. On most cable, Evil Dead would have been denuded. Even if we were doing this for theaters, we’d have to worry about getting an R.”\n\nStill, Campbell promises TV viewers, “We’re not going to abuse the freedom we’ve been given and destroy people’s psyches. It’s still entertainment, you know. It’s all about the tone. You can have a joyful beheading. You can have a celebratory shot to the head.”\n\nAlways pushing things just a little bit further is part of the Starz brand Zlotnik says, and he encourages fans to spread that passion.\n\n“It’s all about targeting each show to a certain demographic and psychographic and trying to hit that white-hot core,” he says. “And igniting a phenomenon where social media and word of mouth starts to bring out another audience. The fans become part of our outreach.”\n\nSo far, Evil Dead disciples are excited. Anticipation has been high, Internet chatter has been steady, and a cast appearance at this year’s New York Comic Con drew long lines.\n\n“Starz got something like 15 million views just for the first trailer,” Campbell says. “Twice as many hits as they’ve gotten on anything else, and this is a new show … I’ve worked with plenty of studios who didn’t get it, or didn’t want to, but [Starz knows] what they’ve got. They’re doing it for real.”\n\nZlotnik says it’s not only about knowing where you can go—an action-oriented series like Ash vs. Evil Dead has huge international possibilities—but knowing where you’ve come from. Keep the hard-core loyalists happy, and then build on that.\n\n“With an existing franchise, I think you take a Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm,” Zlotnik says. “Honor the fan base, peel back the layers, understand what it is about the franchise they love and then deliver on that. That’s what we did with Outlander, and part of what we try to do with everything. Deliver the sort of show that would give a person a reason to subscribe—and the kind of show that, if you took it away, there’d be rioting.”\n\nStephen Whitty is a two-time past chairman of the New York Film Critics Circle.

And the White House has no one but itself to blame for this.\n\nInterestingly or pathetically, depending on your political bent, the administration can actually take credit for bolstering the growth through massive increases in health-care costs with ObamaCare.\n\nThe report showed that health-care costs accounted for a 9.7 percent seasonally adjusted rate increase from the second quarter, despite the fact that GDP plummeted over the same period.\n\nThe $18.2 billion annualized increase in health-care costs was 30 percent of the $60.6 billion annualized increase in GDP.\n\nIncreasing health-care costs like ObamaCare is the kind of growth that comes out of your paycheck instead of adding to it.\n\nAnd why is the largest economy in the world behaving like a new social-media stock by having second-quarter GDP growth come in at 3.9 percent, followed the next quarter by 1.5 percent growth?\n\nErratic quarter-to-quarter massive inventory drawdowns do not say great things about the economy’s future — or its past.\n\nIn the second quarter, the inventory buildup was largely responsible for the outsized gain and, clearly, after discerning that the buildup didn’t pay off or took too long to sell off, businesses both large and small didn’t want to tie up scarce business capital with new inventory orders.\n\nAt its core, it means business managers are not very optimistic about future demand.\n\nThe US economy, with $18 trillion in assets, shouldn’t be vacillating between zero percent and 4 percent growth from one quarter to the next.\n\nSo if Washington wonders why Main Street has no idea how the administration can gloat about a strong recovery and sound economy, look no further than the GDP.', 'Attracta Mooney NOVEMBER 1, 2015 7 When central banks in the US, the UK and elsewhere in Europe announced plans to pump trillions of dollars into their economies in the wake of the global financial crisis, their aim was to stave off financial collapse. But quantitative easing, the process in which central banks create new money and use it to buy government debt and other assets from banks to lower interest rates, has had significant unintended consequences for large investors. QE might have prevented a re-run of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but around six in 10 pension funds say the central bank support has had a negative impact on their funding ratios, a measure of pension assets to obligations. More than half of pension funds also say the influx of central bank money has sown the seeds of the next financial crisis, according to a study of 184 European pension funds collectively managing more than €1tn of assets. The study points out that most EU countries now have high debt levels compared with their gross domestic product. Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the consultancy that carried out the research with French asset manager Amundi, says QE has been a factor in driving up this debt. “It was debt that caused the last [financial] crisis, and now [debt] is getting out of control again,” he says. “Policy tools [such as QE] are no longer working. We have a scenario here where things could go wrong quite easily.” One Danish pension fund quoted in the research says: “Debt has turned into a drug. But before long it will lose its potency and become the cause of our problems — again.” Investors also believe bond-buying by central banks has “acted like an opaque tax” on pension funds by inadvertently increasing their liabilities. This is because the price of bonds increased after governments snapped them up on the back of QE, forcing fixed income yields down in the process. Pascal Blanqué, deputy chief executive of Amundi, says: “QE has proved a mixed blessing. It prevented a 1929-style depression after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. But it has also delivered unintended consequences for long-term investors. The challenge for policymakers is to address them.” In Europe, more than 20 per cent of sovereign debt now has negative yields, according to the report, making it harder for pension schemes to meet their return targets. Ros Altmann, the UK pensions minister, warned in September that policies such as low interest rates and QE have caused pension liabilities to rise by as much as 50 per cent over the past few years. Mr Rajan says pension funds “are in a very difficult situation at the moment” because of QE. “Regulators need to step in and come up with new measures,” he says, such as giving pension funds more time to raise money to meet their liabilities. Matti Leppälä, chief executive of PensionsEurope, the trade body for workplace pensions, agrees that regulators need to “specifically consider and address the effects of QE on pension funds”. “Pension funds cannot be just seen as collateral damage of QE, as this concerns pension provision for millions of Europeans,” he says. The study shows that only a third of retirement schemes have a funding ratio of more than 100 per cent, meaning their assets outweigh their liabilities. More than a quarter have a funding level of below 80 per cent. Danny Vassiliades, managing director at Punter Southall Investment Consulting, the pensions adviser, says: “The impact of QE was to make [pension funds’] deficits bigger. QE has made it more difficult for pension funds to meet their funding obligations.” To improve funding levels, two-thirds of pension schemes have set a target return of 5 per cent. The remainder are aiming for even higher returns. Create believes this will be a challenge, given that more than 50 per cent of pension schemes’ assets are invested in low-yielding fixed income instruments. To achieve this level of returns, pension funds are also pushing into riskier assets such as equities, although there are concerns that these asset classes are overpriced. Not all retirement experts are convinced that central bank bond purchases are to blame for pension funds’ problems. Andrew Clare, professor of asset management at London’s Cass Business School, and a trustee on the board of two pension schemes, says: “All this blame on [quantitative easing] is silly. QE is not the cause here. It is part of the story, but it is certainly not to blame for where yield curves are now.”', 'No faltan quienes aún se le ponen los pelos de punta al leer el nombre de Mt Gox en algún lugar, y bien justificados están.

A report this week from S&P Capital IQ found that dividends and buybacks are on trend to hit a new high this year. And that’s after years of increases. For the past decade, S&P Capital IQ estimated that as much as $1 trillion had been spent by S&P 500 companies on buybacks and dividends.\n\nBuybacks typically cheer investors, because they lower a company’s shares outstanding, and raise its earnings per share. Activist hedge funds are part of what is pushing the trend. Warren Buffett, though, has warned that he thinks shareholder activists could be pushing companies to do buybacks that don’t make economic sense. And now investors, too, might be wondering if that money would be better spent elsewhere. This week, shares of IBM (IBM) barely budge after the company announced a $4 billion buyback. IBM, one of Berkshire’s largest holdings, has been struggling for a while, and some have wondered whether the tech giant has been spending too much on shareholder friendly buybacks, and not enough on research and development.\n\nStill, shares of Apple (AAPL) and General Electric (GE), the two U.S. companies that have bought back the most stock this year, are both up, 8% and 14%, respectively, this year.\n\nGraphic by Stacy Jones.']"
