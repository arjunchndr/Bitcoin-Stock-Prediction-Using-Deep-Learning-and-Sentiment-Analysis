11/01/2015,"['Although the Bitcoin market in Vietnam is virtually non-existent today, Dominik Weil, co-founder of Bitcoin Vietnam, is confident that “Bitcoin and Blockchain technology will play a crucial role here in the future”.\n\nBitcoin Vietnam became the first bitcoin exchange registered broker in the south-east Asian country, following some doubts, and even objection from the local government since its establishment in late 2013. Bitcoin Vietnam relaunched the VBTC exchange, which allows users to deposit and withdraw cash from more than 9,200 banking locations without a bank account, and developed a Bitcoin remittance platform called Cash2vn.com.\n\nWeil, a tech enthusiast, is also co-founder of Bitcoin Frankfurt. In an interview with DEALSTREETASIA, Weil shared his thoughts on developing Bitcoin in Vietnam. Edited excerpts:\n\nWhy did you launch Bitcoin Vietnam? Are there lots of businesses accepting Bitcoin payment? How do you see adoption of Bitcoin in Vietnam?\n\nWe started exploring the state of the Bitcoin economy in Vietnam by summer 2013 – this research took us a couple of months until the decision was made to move ahead with our venture; set up the company and build and launch our first product.\n\nThe reason why we are currently focused on the Bitcoin exchange business is, in order to develop a domestic Bitcoin ecosystem with all the other advanced use cases of the Blockchain technology, you need to have the very first infrastructure layer in place, which is fast and easy access to Bitcoin liquidity.\n\nTalking theoretically about how Bitcoin and the Blockchain will change the world as we know it may be an interesting thought exercise for developers and other tech enthusiasts, but without the chance to participate in the Bitcoin economy without major hurdles, it will be hard to convert these ideas in actual use cases for a broader audience.\n\nTherefore the decision was made to focus initially on building a reliable and easily accessible exchange platform, in order to allow the implementation of further applications and use cases on top of this crucial part of infrastructure.\n\nCurrently the adoption rate in Vietnam is still quite low. Apart from the Saigon-based future.travel travel agency, no business accepts Bitcoin in a “professional way”, while you may have luck though with some companies, if you mail them about possibly paying items you ordered via Bitcoin.\n\nWe are working on offering more professional solutions to the market in 2016, when we have other pieces of the puzzle in place, since the lack of secure online payment methods is still a great concern for merchants in the e-commerce space.\n\nEven if general adoption in Vietnam is currently still quite low, regions like South East Asia are poised to profit the most from adopting this kind of technology and basically leapfrogging into an age where decentralized, digital currency and the blockchain are powering the advancement of the domestic commerce and finance industry into the global markets.\n\nHow does bitcoin transaction work here in the country? Is it associated with any risks, and how do you minimize the risks?\n\nWhile Bitcoin transactions and the Bitcoin network itself are inherently secure and immutable, the biggest concerns for the end user are of course their device security.\n\nOne has to understand, that the way Bitcoin works is like cash – digital cash. It allows people to have control over their own money (unlike other forms of “digital money” like Paypal etc., which are basically just database entries at a third party), but this also comes with more responsibility.\n\nIf you look at the general cultural environment in Vietnam in regard of storing wealth, one can say that, people here are more willing to take that responsibility than the average person in the West. People here generally dismiss the idea of storing their wealth with third parties, they will hold cash, buy gold, buy real estate etc.\n\nMuch more education is necessary since it’s a completely new concept of storing wealth. People have been trained since thousands of years to take care of their physical properties, but the experience of humanity to take care of non-physical items like data (or in this case: the special form of data which your Bitcoin wallet represents) is just a very recent one and the absolute majority of the people don’t really have a good grasp on how to do it.\n\nNevertheless, this is mostly relevant when you are talking about Bitcoin as a part of your life savings, where the risk profile and necessary dedication to security is inherently different from just actually using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism, with usually relatively moderate amounts.\n\nHere the security can, in general, be outsourced to trusted third party providers, since the amount of time you hold your coins with them is pretty limited, as well as the amount of money which is at counter-party risk.\n\nUsing Bitcoin also reduces massively the risk of identity theft, since it is not necessary to submit your data to the merchant in order to pay for the goods you are ordering. Paying for goods online becomes therefore much more convenient and secure for the customer as well as the merchant, while the costs are reduced tremendously. Neither is there a need to have large data centres to scan for suspicious transactions which may be hinting to a possible theft of your credit card (data), nor does the merchant need to invest in PCI compliance programmes etc. to keep your data safe from hackers.\n\nBitcoin as “the money of the Internet” and its derived technologies will play an ever bigger role in how e-commerce is done globally.\n\nDid you encounter any difficulties doing bitcoin business in this market? What will you do to accelerate the use of bitcoin?\n\nIt has not been an easy walk, but we also did not expect it to be when we started our venture. Especially in the beginning we were also facing a lot of skepticism by the authorities and the media when we launched our business But that has changed now.\n\nVietnam is currently doing the next steps to elevate the local fintech industry, and we are convinced that Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology will play a crucial role here in the future.\n\nAdoption-wise, as I have stated above, we are now looking forward to building and offering more on-top solutions based on our existing infrastructure, which will actually help to boost economic efficiency for the average person/business. This is our roadmap for 2016.\n\nOtherwise, we are looking forward to continuing our work in the local non-profit Bitcoin Saigon community and hope that this community can serve as a “melting pot” in the crypto-landscape to launch new Blockchain-based initiatives based out of Vietnam.\n\nWhat is the impact of Bitcoin on e-commerce and the economy in general?\n\nIf we are talking about the general impact of Bitcoin on the domestic e-commerce, then we need to be honest here and say: They are as of now basically non-existent.\n\nIf we are talking about the future promise which Bitcoin delivers, then they are, potentially tremendous. We are very happy to have now with David Watson, the general director of future.travel – who explained why (online) merchants definitely should take a look into Bitcoin; therefore I think once we have the right tools in place here in Vietnam, Bitcoin adoption is a no-brainer for e-commerce business; especially when they are aiming for a global customer base.\n\nThings take time to evolve, but given how fast Vietnam’s society and economy is changing on all levels in a very short time pattern, once things start to take off, it will probably spread much quicker than we may anticipate.\n\nIs bitcoin more popular in Saigon (the old name of Ho Chi Minh City) than in Hanoi?\n\nThis is not an easy question to answer, since a lot of the larger Bitcoin activities are happening behind scenes here in Vietnam (mining and trading). From what we heard from insiders in this sector, the mining community in Saigon is operating much more large-scale efforts, while Hanoi seems to be more compartmentalised.\n\nIf we are talking about the strength of the local community, then I think our local community in Saigon is by now more organized than the one in Hanoi; probably also caused by the circumstances that we have more expats actively participating in the community in Saigon – which brings a very healthy mix of people from all around the world as well as the local Bitcoiners together.\n\nWe are working with the community in Hanoi, and hope to work with them also on the establishment of a nationwide Bitcoin advocacy group to spread knowledge and improve the connectivity between the fragmented groups of Bitcoin and Blockchain enthusiasts in the country, while pointing out the advantages of this innovation to media and regulators alike.\n\nHow about market penetration? Beside Bitcoin Vietnam, who are the other players?\n\nCurrently there are no other players in the market when it comes to registered companies.\n\nWhat you have of course is a large informal sector of P2P-Transactions (Localbitcoins or via forums) as well as some unregistered Proxy-Exchanges for trading BTCe codes.\n\nDespite the absence of direct competitors in our market, we are working relentlessly to improve our product line, the customer experience while building applications which will be able to have a direct impact on improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the domestic economy.\n\nAlso read: Opportunities and challenges in building Vietnam’s mobile ecosystem: Tung Bui\n\nBitcoin the future for transactions: David Moskowitz\n\nBitcoin, investment opportunities & Asian prospects\n\nBitcoin flounders in Australia as regulatory worries bite\n\nBitcoin group seeks legal framework for cryptocurrency in Philippines', 'Mom killed days before her son’s graduation\n\nThe family of Alicia Roundtree begged the community for help in finding her killer on Wednesday, December 13, 2017. Roundtree was hit by a stray bullet Saturday as she drove home in Miami Gardens.', '\n\nIf androids dream of electric sheep, then Plantoids dream of digital currency.\n\nThe robot plant species, debuted at last month\'s Ars Electronica festival by French artist group Okhaos, relies on bitcoin to stay alive and – once it has enough – even reproduce.\n\nHow does it work? Just as bees pollinate crops, members of the public \'feed\' the plant by sending funds to its bitcoin wallet. As the balance grows, its leaves unfurl one by one.\n\nThen, once it reaches its threshold – which varies from Plantoid to Plantoid – it will signal via ""a display of colour and light"" that it is ready to reproduce.\n\nOkhaos\' website explains:\n\n""Depending on their form and size, different Plantoids will require different amounts of funds, which they will store as \'starch\' in their personal bitcoin wallets. Perhaps the initial Plantoid will need $1,000 to fully turn into a blossom.""\n\nUsing smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain, it will commission a team of humans Okhaos has found – designers, artists, coders – to create its offspring.\n\nThe project originated in a brainstorming session on ways to represent the blockchain in an artistic manner, one of Okhaos\' members, who wished to remain anonymous, told CoinDesk.\n\n""It soon became clear to me that using the notion of a \'Plantoid\' to instantiate a self-owned and self-sufficient art piece was the perfect way to illustrate the potential of this emergent technology,"" they added.\n\nThe first Plantoid, which has so far received 0.01050490 BTC ($3.38) in online tips, is tucked away in Paris while a better location to display it is found.\n\nIdeally, Okhaos say, this should be a place that\'s publicly accessible so the Plantoid can perform its function of providing beauty and collecting money.\n\nArtistic interpretation\n\nArtists earn a slice of each Plantoid\'s tips and a cut from all of its future offspring (and their offspring, and so on) as a thank you for creating an attractive – and thus successful – specimen.\n\nWhile certain characteristics of the Plantoid are effectively \'hard coded\' into each specimen\'s DNA, for example the logic that dictates its growth and reproduction, others are open for artistic interpretation.\n\n""The rules underlying the reproduction [are] coordinated through the blockchain. In this way, individuals and groups are free to come and go according to the (autopoietic) laws of the work,"" the group states. For example, active members of the plant\'s DAO – its distributed governing team – can decide where it is exhibited or what it should look like.\n\nWhile the first Plantoid was assembled from materials found in an abandoned train yard, new Plantoids will see greater variation both in their appearance and in their code, or \'soul\'. And while the appearance of the robot species may change over time, its relationship with human pollinators and craftsmen may do too:\n\n""The first Plantoid is initially alone, but as time passes and more Plantoids are created from its collaboration with human beings – then new Plantoids will emerge, experimenting with new physical characteristics, but also diverse personalities and governance structures enabling them to communicate with other humans through the blockchain.""\n\nFurther down the line, if smart contracts governing it are sophisticated enough, a Plantoid may even be able make decisions like which artists to hire of its own accord.\n\nSelf-ownership\n\nSmart contract technology, a concept birthed by cryptographer Nick Szabo, has opened up the possibility of companies that can run without human control.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain for example, a cluster of these self-executing contracts can create a rudimentary business (aka a DAO) that functions using the logic \'if X, then Y\'.\n\nToday, something that would have taken a group of people both time and legal costs to achieve can be executed with just a few lines of code. Here, the code itself forms an ""incorruptible"" rulebook, a new kind of law enshrined in cryptography.\n\nIf this concept is taken to its extreme, DAOs will not just represent a group seeking to outsource labour into ""computationally intractable tasks"" but will be made for robots, by robots.\n\nThese autonomous agents could be a network of public bikes that can pay for their own repairs or a robot artist collective capable of selling and distributing its work.\n\nA video posted by nonhumans.net (@nonhumans_dot_net) on Jan 15, 2015 at 7:25am PST\n\nThere are still legal hurdles to overcome however. One day robots may be granted \'legal personhood\' and the ability to own things like money and property, but for now that\'s still a distant dream.\n\nThis can be both beneficial to robot artists (see the bot who was released by police after ordering ecstasy online) and limiting (see the Legend of Zelda characters-turned artists – shown above – whose profits are hauled up in a trust fund until they have a way to spend their money).\n\nBut for Okhaos, this \'algorythmic personhood\' doesn\'t need a stamp of approval from lawmakers. It\'s already here, they say:\n\n""A Plantoid can be be said to own itself, and in that way to be a free, or autonomous agent. A Plantoid may come and visit you (you may be allowed to look after it for a while), and a gallery may wish to exhibit them, but it is not possible to own one, and should they decide to leave you cannot stop them.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The ease of paying for goods and services by just scanning a QR Code at Point of Sale terminal is one such use which has been discussed often. Bitcoin PoS systems are already being implemented in places where bitcoin usage has gained good traction. Companies like BitPay, BitPagos have a considerable market share in these countries. While countries with active bitcoin communities have been enjoying these services, at the expense of conventional payments industry (at least that’s what some people think) what about those countries where bitcoin payments has not caught up?\n\nWhile the bitcoin community keeps on talking about these things at places where they are already implement, the conventional electronic payments giants are busy capturing those markets where most of the population are still clueless about bitcoin or bitcoin payments. Visa, one of the leading card and electronic payments company has already taken India by storm with its mVisa payment platform. Visa had announced the launch of its mVisa service in partnership with few leading banks in the month of August. In a span of less than3 months, the company has created a wave by onboarding a lot of merchants in leading metros.\n\nBangalore, one of the leading metropolitan cities in India which also happens to be the tech and startup capital of the country has turned into a leading hub for the company. In Bangalore, if anyone happens to visit a shop, the first thing they see at the counter is a QR code and an attractive blue mVisa sticker at the storefront. Customers with mVisa enabled accounts can pay their bill at the counter by scanning the QR code and transferring the amount from their bank account. Sounds familiar? Yes, it has to the same procedure one usually follows while paying with bitcoin.\n\nEven though paying bills using ones smartphone is not a new thing, the similarity to bitcoin payments, not to mention the sense of security the customer feels while making transactions. Unlike bitcoin transactions, the payments made using mVisa will be the same as making payments using debit or credit cards and it can be reversed. mVisa can be used for online payments and peer to peer transfer as well.\n\nWhile announcing the launch of mVisa, the company announced that it will be immediately onboarding over 20,000 merchants in Bangalore alone. At the same time Visa also opened a new technology development center in the city. The new center will be complementing other similar units the company has planned to open in Singapore and the United States.\n\nLately Visa has been bullish when it comes to technological advancements in the payments industry. The company has recently worked alongside DocuSign, a digital signature and authentication platform to create a blockchain technology based proof of concept application for car rental services. Continuing along the same lines, the company will soon be on the top when it comes to payment solutions and platforms.\n\nREAD MORE: DocuSign and Visa Showcase New Proof-of-Concept at Money2020', 'There is something new and fundamental happening in the world which could be the start of the next enlightenment period. The core of this is shifting from centralized to decentralized models in all aspects of our lives, both individual and societally.\n\nCryptocurrencies (Bitcoin), blockchains, and decentralization) are not just about 1) digitizing and modernizing money, payments, economics, assets, legal contracts, and governance, thereby 2) accelerating the transition to the automation and actualization economy from the labor economy, but 3) more fundamentally, these factors are allowing us to re-explore our reality, and specify it as more internally-determined than externally-determined.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Crypto Enlightenment: Social Theory of Blockchains\n\nSocietal Shared Trust is Algorithmic Trust\n\nThe tip of the iceberg is Bitcoin – digital money. Bitcoin runs on software called blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger, a decentralized computational memory of human interactions. As individuals, we can place our trust in the computational system, and no longer need to trust institutions, third-party intermediaries like banks and governments, to coordinate our patterns of activity. Blockchains are a more trustworthy trust: algorithmic trust, not institutional trust.\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology is technical (cryptographic ledgers); economic and political (a flatter more-extensible mode of organization); and psychological, sociological, and philosophical (new ways of conceiving reality). The real invitation and potentiality of blockchain technology is to radically rethink reality – what is it to decentralize everything we do and reconstitute life through a frame of abundance and immanence, attending to what is possible and desirable mindfully, not merely a reaction to a reality which seems determined by scarcity.\n\nA New Philosophy of Economic Theory\n\nA philosophy of economic theory is necessary since nearly all existing economic theories have taken scarcity as a central precept. These antiquated models configured by scarcity are weak philosophically because they are conceptually limited, and are also weak empirically since there is emerging and existing evidence of situations in the world where scarcity is not a parameter, and not the governing parameter. A ready example of this is digital goods, such as software or digital images, where there is essentially zero cost to producing another unit by copying the goods electronically.\n\nCrypto Enlightenment is a Rethinking of Authority\n\nThere have been some paradigm-shifting moments in human history. The Enlightenment (1650-1800) concerned knowledge, and also importantly, authority. While there has been much rethinking and progression regarding knowledge, there has been less regarding authority since the modern notion of the individual as an agent in society arose during the Enlightenment. Now with the advent of blockchain technology and decentralized models, there can be a new consideration of authority. There is a possibility of constructing alternatives to centralized institutional power which has become a juggernaut of extraction instead of support; a less-trustworthy diminisher of rights and social goods instead of an extender and promulgator. Decentralized models empower the individual in radical new ways and call for the rethinking of authority for both the individual and society. Per the Internet revolution, we as individuals now taking self-responsibility for many activities such as deciding what and how we consume news media, entertainment, financial services, (stock-trading, credit services, portfolio management), and health services. Next is economic and governance systems.\n\n\n\nTo rethink the place and definition of authority, a philosophy of immanence is helpful and necessary. Immanence is the idea of self-determination from within; everything comes from within in a system, world, or person; structure and content are emergent and not pre-specified. Immanence contrasts with transcendence where everything comes from outside a system, world, or person; pre-determining the system externally per fixed specifications. One way of seeing reality is as immanence and transcendence; there is one side that is focused on recouping a pre-specified baseline ideal, and the other of open-ended immanence. Human emotion is an example from the natural world of baseline-immanence, where negative emotions (fear, anger) physiologically narrow possible pathways of action to fight, flight, or flee, where as positive emotions (love, compassion) trigger general, non-directional cognitive activation, a widened range of unspecified novel, creative, and unscripted courses of thought and action.\n\n\n\nMuch of human psychological activity might be said to be concerned with the attempt to attaining a baseline ideal that has been pre-specified and externally imposed, and as an ideal impossible to ever attain. Some of the contexts where these ideals impossibly govern behavior and psychology are ethics, justice, equality, liberty, subjectivation, and the pursuit of the good life. Attaining the baseline is an idea rooted in fixity, where the form (morphology) one begins with pre-determines possible outcomes. Baseline is a stance oriented to negating and critiquing, to narrowing, circumscribing, and closing-off; a ‘no’ energy. Certainly ideas of ideals may come from outside an individual, and the distinction is not acquiescing and adopting them wholesale, but introspecting as to how they would be useful appropriated individually for me; internally, reworked and reclaimed with autonomy to empower the individual. (Seeing how immanence and transcendence interact, Hegel terms this dialectics, or conversation of appropriation, as an immanent process of transcendence.)\n\n\n\nThe other side of reality is immanence, a determining from within. This is the open-ended stance of novel construction up and out from baseline into new territory; “yes-and” improvisation energy, collaboration, creativity, novelty, the new, thinking out-of-the box, greenfield, emergent, dynamic, serendipitous, flow, complexity, fractalization, and multi-dimensionality. Moving out open-endedly from baseline is an idea rooted in capability; growth is dictated by capacity (which can grow) and not morphology (which is fixed); capability and attitude determine possibility. Immanence is a stance oriented towards the affirmation of the positive, to “yes-and” energy.\n\nCryptocitizen Sensibility\n\nThe sensibility of the cryptocitizen is being in a stance of immanence with ourselves; trusting our internal selves more. There is more self-responsibility-taking; questioning, deciding, and designing which economic systems, political systems, communities, and labor systems (productive work effort) in which we would like to participate. The distinction is between ‘selecting governance services’ and ‘being governed,’ where increasingly, there is the possibility of a much higher degree of self-determination and self-creation in selecting the communities and structures in which we participate, particularly those related to economics and politics. Per a singularity-class technology like decentralized cryptographic models, these systems for organizing multi-party activity can scale way down to backgrounded trust-invoking microlevels in ways that were not previously possible in hierarchical models.\n\nAbundance Theory of Flourishing\n\nTheories of flourishing address how we might organize ourselves individually and societally towards the endeavor of the good life. Leaving aside the problematic language and valorization of the ‘good’ life, there are been three traditional types of theories of flourishing (Parfit, Reasons and Persons, 1984). Theories of flourishing have been hedonistic (seeking the greatest balance of pleasure over pain), conative (seeking desire fulfillment), and objective list theoretic (seeking to list other aspects that might constitute well-being in addition to pleasure and desire fulfillment).\n\n1. Immanent Flourishing of Abundance: Sustenance + Actualization\n\nA new theory can be proposed in line with modern themes, an Abundance Theory of Flourishing. An abundance theory of flourishing can be developed first through the baseline-immanence framework. The traditional conception of abundance has most-often been one-sided, focusing exclusively on reaching the baseline of post-scarcity, having all needs for material goods satisfied. Instead, an immanence theory also envisions the open-ended upside of potentiality that is now possible with this baseline of material goods satisfaction having been reached. An abundance theory of flourishing includes the two sides of reality, focusing on both survival and actualization. To count as flourishing, there is not just an alleviating of suffering in the form of having sustenance needs met, there would also need to be something in the positive register of immanence, allowing new and emergent potentiality to develop; this would constitute a true immanent flourishing of abundance.\n\n\n\n2. Scarcity is a Social Pathology\n\nAn abundance theory of flourishing can be developed second through conceiving of scarcity as a social pathology. The conceptualization is that scarcity is not merely a constitutive parameter of existing economic theory, but that more pervasively, the notion of scarcity has been a psychologically harmful construct of thinking that needs to be overcome for a fuller realization of human potential. In an abundance theory of flourishing, scarcity is a social pathology to be resolved. Part of the justification for seeing scarcity as a social pathology is noticing the new and contributive social goods that are unavailable in the scarcity model and created by abundance. Some of these social goods include certainty, availability, reduced contingency, willingness, and cognitive easing and cognitive surplus.\n\n\n\nAbundance creates a psychology of certainty and availability, a reliable ongoing feeling of certainty that material survival needs will be met, as opposed to the continuous uncertainty and attending-to required by scarcity. Much current human cognitive and physical effort (as individuals and groups; families, corporations, institutions, and nation-states) is devoted to anti-scarcity measures: hoarding, manipulation, and control for the purpose of ascertaining the future availability of resources. It is like doing for emotional and cognitive attending what just-in-time inventories did for manufacturing; it is an invoking of certainty and reliance about the real-time availability for need fulfillment. Through abundance, there could be the considerable social good of relief and certainty, where a whole class of cognitively-exertional activities drop off the reality of what has to be considered for basic living. This would be unprecedented in human history, a trustable source of having basic needs met such that we do not even have to think about this.\n\n\n\nCryptosustainability: Collaborating in the Self-sustaining Micropolis\n\nThe cryptocitizen sensibility of the individual extends to embodying new ways for the individual to be in society. Reviving the notion of the Greek statesman, there is a sense of civic duty to serve the republic. This can be recast as the self-directed cryptocitizen’s sense of civic collaboration, where part of meaning and purpose may be derived from participating in community sustainability. The new polis could be the micropolis as groups of individuals form self-sustaining cryptocommunities.\n\n\n\nPeergrid Cryptosustaining Micropolises\n\nThe cryptocitizen’s civic collaboration is through providing peergrid resources. Here in communities of 20-50, I have a solar panel on my roof, my neighbor has a City Blooms hydroponic greens unit, the next person has a Tesla power wall, the next person is an ISP and hosts a Bitcoind node; etc. Each of us provides a piece of peergrid infrastructure supporting the overall sustainability of us as a community. The kids paper route of the future is maintaining the hydroponic greens unit. Individuals are civic infrastructure providers. Peergrids then are local community mesh networks of all needed resources including physical (energy, ICT, food, infrastructure) and emotional (empathy, belonging, contribution, meaning). Peergrid cryptosustaining micropolises can then federate, so the smartcity becomes a federation of local autonomous self-sustained communities. Blockchains are the trustable unobtrusive system for managing all of this in the background, allowing communities to move beyond free rider problems and other concerns that have prohibited easeful cooperative collaborations. Blockchains facilitate the ownership of community infrastructure (financing, transferring, operating, drawing assessments) in a community-based manner.\n\n\n\nCrypto-Enlightenment Governance\n\nThus through the volitional responsibility-taking of the cryptocitizen as an individual self-determining economic and political systems of choice, and as an individual in society, collaboratively participating in self-sustaining micropolises, governance can be recast as a process of support (immanence) as opposed to extraction (baseline erosion). The actualization economy can thereby focus on (1) sustainable material survival and (2) the social goods of liberation: self-respect, self-esteem, and self-realization. Cryptosustainability communities are finally a means of prescriptively destabilizing non-value-added elites, implementing the original esprit of Rousseau, Rawls, and Locke.\n\n\n\nBlockchains: a Grey Goo-Resistant Singularity-class Technology\n\nThe crypto-enlightenment includes seeing the potential impact of blockchains beyond the flexible recasting of human economic and political processes; blockchains are singularity-class technologies. A singularity-class technology is a technology for the large-scale trustful automated orchestration of vast and detailed processes. The power of singularity-class technologies, this level of technological orchestration of processes, possibly without our human participation, has given way to the fear of runaway technologies. The fear of runaway technology is in the same form, and persists across all singularity-class technologies, that AIs, robots, nanobots, 3D printers, matter compilers, space terraformers, synthetically-replicating bioengineered life, etc. will take over the world.\n\n\n\nBlockchains are a potential solution to the fear of runway technology in any of these areas. The fear of runaway technology can be allayed in noticing that the very nature and design principles of singularity-class technologies, certainly blockchains, and by extension, perhaps any singularity-class technology, are that the large-scale orchestration cannot proceed otherwise than through a system of checks and balances. The key blockchain functionality principles are being a very-large scale automated system of checks and balances where all ‘transactions’ must be validated, confirm via a reputation or other mechanism, employing algorithmic trust and smartnetwork consensus mechanisms.\n\n\n\nSingularity-class Technology Safety: Consensus Signing and Design Signing\n\nThis structure can carry into the implementation of singularity-class projects like friendly AI, autonomous lab robots (on-chain DAC IP discovery tracking), blockchain nano-compilers (Grey Goo worry: unchecked nanotech proliferation). Two key safety design principles in singularity-class technologies are 1) the required confirmation of any transaction or activity by smartnetwork consensus mechanisms which prevents non-bona fide behavior, and 2) signing; all transactions cannot help but be signed. Just as physical-world engineers sign the bridges they build (literally, as a claiming and responsibility mechanism), synbio, AI, space, etc. engineers cannot help but ‘sign’ their own building blocks like DNA designs. With traces as an inherent feature of technology, signing is unavoidable, so singularity-class technologies like propositional nanotech constructions would be either 1) signed by bona fide engineers, and 2) not be able to avoid having a traceable signature by befouled players (intentionally malicious or otherwise).\n\n\n\nSpacechains: Blockchains in Space\n\nA further as yet unconsidered application area for singularity-class technologies like blcockhains is spacechains: blockchains in space. The idea is that blockchains are not just an Earth-class technology, but also an extra-terrestrial-class technology for space projects. Blockchains can be used to coordinate very-large Earth-class terrestrial projects like billion-member DNA databanks and EMRs, and space-class problems too. Some of the many potential space applications of blockchains include space settlement, terraforming, asteroid mining, fuel generation, bombardment monitoring, and basic science observation. There could be colored-coin ledgers for energy, settlement, transport, and supplies. Further, spacechains are a fragility alleviation mechanism for terrestrial applications. It is surprising that we do not yet have backup for many terrestrial operations. Spacechains could help with this, providing data center back-up, geomagnetic solar protection, existential risk reduction, and Bitcoins in space (where there is an articulated project, (BitSats(like CubeSats)).\n\n\n\nCurious what ""Bitcoin and Blockchain are? Educational Resources:', 'The Cyber Threat Alliance, a conglomerate of various cyber-security vendors, has released a report that analyzes and breaks down the recent wave of CryptoWall 3.0 ransomware campaigns.\n\nThe Cyber Threat Alliance is made up of security researchers from companies like Symantec, Fortinet, McAfee (Intel Security), Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler, Telefonica, Barracuda, and ReversingLabs, all of which have contributed with their own private information, and pieced together the history and evolution of the CryptoWall ransomware.\n\nAccording to the report they\'ve put out, CryptoWall operators have launched 49 different campaigns in the past years, attempting to infect 406,887 users, most of them in North America.\n\nThe researchers have also discovered 4,046 different CryptoWall variants, working on an infrastructure that included 839 C&C servers, spread over 5 second-tier IP addresses.\n\nMost of the campaigns leveraged phishing emails (67.3%) and exploit kits (30.7%).\n\nBitcoin transactions involved in ransoms left a trail that researchers were willing to follow\n\nBecause all Bitcoin transactions are logged in the service\'s blockchain, researchers had the opportunity to take a closer look at the Bitcoin operations that involved the wallet addresses displayed to CryptoWall infected victims.\n\nMapping out a series of operations that included these publicly displayed wallet addresses and a multitude of intermediary wallets, the Cyber Threat Alliance group has observed that most of them led back to one main Bitcoin account.\n\nIt was easy for researchers to conclude that one single cyber-crime was behind all the campaigns. Past transactions and the amount of Bitcoin in the central and lower tier wallets show that the group has made around $325 million / €295 million.\n\n""The first and best way to defend against CryptoWall is to ensure that users are trained in common best practices to avoid the malware infecting their systems,"" say the researchers, who recommend, besides installing robust antivirus solutions, that companies also deploy more advanced protection measures that use sandboxing techniques.\n\nA few days ago, Kaspersky announced that, together with the Dutch Police, they were releasing all the decryption keys for the CoinVault and Bitcryptor ransomware. These keys will allow ransomware victims to decrypt their files for free. Right now, CryptoWall 3.0 victims don\'t have this luxury.', 'One thing that comes to mind when someone mentions digital currency is Bitcoin. For most people across the world, both young and old Bitcoin is the only digital currency they have known of heard of (and maybe the altcoins that followed bitcoin). But did bitcoin appear out of the blue? Was bitcoin a novel idea of a mysterious person calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nThe answer is no on all counts. However, bitcoin is the iteration of an old idea with new technology. The technology, blockchain as we know it is however unique enough to change the way the whole fintech industry works. There were many who came before Satoshi Nakamoto with the intention of creating digital currency that can power alternative economy, but failed due to technical, regulatory and ideological reasons.\n\nSome of these so called digital currencies include\n\na. E-gold – 1996\n\nThe concept of digital currency started while the internet was still catching up with most parts of the world. E-gold is one such example. Started in 1996 by an oncologist named Douglas Jackson, a lawyer managed to have over 5 million user accounts by 2009. E-gold grew so big, that even merchants had started accepting it. The digital currency was backed by gold and it turned out to be a very successful venture until it entered the favorites list of criminals and hackers. Continued attacks on the platform by cybercriminals and use of e-gold as favored currency by extortionists and money launderers led to its downfall.\n\nb. WebMoney – 1998\n\nWebMoney was started in 1998. Except for the decentralization part WebMoney is a form of digital currency for all practical purposes. The Moscow based company offers a wide range of financial services including peer to peer payment solutions, merchant services, online billing and payments and even internet based trading platforms. WebMoney became the next best thing after e-gold and attracted many users, both good and bad from e-gold once it was shutdown. However, WebMoney made changes to its services soon after that to prevent its usage for illegal activities. WebMoney currently supports a number of international currencies including GBP, USD, Russian Rubles and even bitcoin .\n\nc. Liberty Reserve – 2006\n\nLiberty Reserve can be taken as a botched attempt towards creating a centralized anonymous money transfer business. It allowed users to create accounts on the platform and transfer money to anyone without any verification. User accounts were not verified and users also had an option to hide their Liberty Reserve account information from those whom they are transmitting money to.\n\nHowever, as expected it became the most favored place for cybercriminals and the government didn’t like it. Liberty Reserve was forced to shut down by authorities from multiple countries and its promoters jailed for money laundering and supporting illegal activities. By May 2013, the platform was shut down by regulatory authorities.\n\nd. Perfect Money – 2007\n\nPerfect Money is another digital currency platform that works with multiple currencies including USD, EUR, GBP, BTC and more. Like most of the other digital currency platforms in the past, death of one established platform will result in a surge in growth of its successor. The same thing happened with Perfect Money. Customers from Liberty Reserve flooded Perfect Money after the former was shut down by regulators. Perfect Money also offers services similar to that of Liberty Reserve sans the lack of verification. However, Perfect Money is not available in the United States and for United States citizens located anywhere in the world.\n\ne. Bitcoin – 2009\n\nBitcoin was first introduced in 2009 as a working decentralized digital currency platform. Unlike all the other digital currencies in the past, Bitcoin has an advantage in the form of its decentralized nature which leaves the whole platform in charge of a much larger community than an individual or corporation. This will also eliminate the possibility of someone running the whole setup to manipulate the public in order to satisfy their own greed and selfishness. Not to mention the fact that the bitcoin protocol is open source, preventing anyone from having a monopoly over the whole system. The security and transparency associated with bitcoin is worth mentioning as well.\n\nBitcoin seems to have hit the right chord, satisfying all the apprehensions about digital currency that have been built over years of experience with centralized, proprietary digital currency platforms. Following the popularity of bitcoin, there are new digital currencies that have come up, including national currencies. Ecuador has adopted its own digital currency and even Barcelona; Spain has plans on including digital currency as its legal tender.', 'La tienda Beloved Shirts vende todo tipo de prendas de vestir con estampados de casi cualquier cosa, desde pizzas hasta calaveras y más.

Este suéter que se encuentra disponible por un precio de 0.2 BTC y el resto de las prendas de la colección son ideales para los amantes de los estampados extraños, fanáticos de Doge.', 'The recent developments in the United States Senate seem to have created an opportunity for bitcoin to become the currency of the future. Earlier this week, the senate ended up passing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act better known in its abbreviated form – CISA. The act will now facilitate information sharing between companies and the US government.\n\nThe main purpose of CISA is to make it easier for governments to collect personal information of internet users easily and more openly from companies in possession of it. Previously, sharing personal information without consent or without a court order qualified as illegal and companies were liable for compromising the privacy of individual(s) whose information was shared without authorisation. However, with the implementation of CISA, companies sharing their customer/user information with the government agencies are indemnified from such charges. According to CISA, these companies will no longer be obliged to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests regarding the shared data.\n\nWith CISA, the United States now shows all signs of a police state in the making. This also puts individuals at risk, taking away their right to privacy and any other possible protections one enjoyed under the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution in the form of rights to protect oneself from self-incrimination and the exclusionary rule. CISA will now enable government agencies to target, arrest and charge individuals or groups by collecting evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment with the help of shared data. Under CISA companies will be free to share any private and sensitive data including ones health records, bank account information, internet history and more.\n\nIntroduction of CISA and the resulting unlimited powers to violate privacy has made client level encryption ad encrypted communication protocols a need of the hour. With no personal information safe from the eyes of the government it now makes perfect sense for people who care about privacy to explore alternate options. Bitcoin and the technology behind it can be a perfect example of such alternate options.\n\nThe decentralized nature of bitcoin combined with the security and a certain degree of anonymity the digital currency offers when used following the best practices makes it an excellent tool. At the same time decentralized internet networks like Maidsafe and applications built over that platform can be utilized by people instead of regular internet services to minimize the amount of data that falls into the hands of companies who can potentially hand it out to the government. When it comes to communications, clients like Darkmail which offers end-to-end encryption are can offer an alternative to services run by Google, Microsoft and other US based multinational corporations.\n\nIt is just a matter of time before CISA is misused by the government and it may as well act as a tipping point for the emergence and wide spread adoption of bitcoin and other lesser-known platforms and services.', 'In a trial starting on Monday, Morgan Stanley will confront a Russian billionaire’s claims that it illegally short-sold a company based on inside information at the height of the financial crisis.\n\nThe lawsuit against the global financial services firm is being brought in Manhattan federal court by Veleron BV, a Dutch company created as an investment vehicle by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who is also the founder of United Company Rusal Plc, one of the world’s largest aluminum companies.\n\nVeleron claims Morgan Stanley obtained inside information through a relationship it had with the company’s lender.\n\nThe dispute arose from Deripaska’s 2007 investment through Veleron in Canadian auto parts maker Magna International. That investment was financed with a $1.2 billion loan from BNP Paribas, with Veleron’s Magna shares as collateral.\n\nThough Morgan Stanley was not directly involved in that loan, it entered into a swap agreement with BNP Paribas under which it assumed some of the risk of the loan in exchange for fixed payments.\n\nOn September 29, 2008, with Magna’s stock falling amid the global financial crisis, BNP made a $93 million margin call to Veleron. Morgan Stanley subsequently learned from BNP that Veleron would likely not meet the margin call and would have to liquidate its Magna stock.\n\nThat information was forwarded from Morgan Stanley’s global capital markets group to one of its traders, Kerim Tuna, who traded mostly for Morgan Stanley’s own account.\n\nTuna immediately began short-selling Magna stock, according to court papers. Morgan Stanley stood to lose $6.6 million because of Veleron’s default, but thanks to Tuna’s short-selling, it was able to offset $4.6 million of that.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Morgan Stanley’s actions constituted insider trading because Morgan Stanley used its knowledge of Veleron’s impending default for its own benefit days before it became public. The lawsuit claims that the short-selling drove down the price of Magna stock. It seeks more than $10 million in damages.\n\nBut Morgan Stanley claims it has no duty to Veleron that could give rise to an insider trading claim, and that it was simply hedging against exposure to risk.\n\nIt sought summary judgment dismissing the case, but U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon ruled in July that it should go to a jury.\n\nJury selection and opening arguments are expected Monday. Deripaska himself is not expected to testify at the trial, which the parties expect to last about three weeks.\n\nReporting By Brendan Pierson in New York']"
11/02/2015,"['The technology behind Bitcoin -- that electronic money almost nobody understands -- is finally on the verge of going mainstream.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP), Bain Capital, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs (GS), MasterCard (MA), the New York Life Insurance Company, the New York Stock Exchange -- all of them have poured millions of dollars into Bitcoin firms recently.\n\nOverall, a record-breaking $1 billion so far has been pumped into Bitcoin-related tech startups. Banks are investing in the technology that powers Bitcoin, but not the currency itself.\n\nThis technology promises to change the way we trade stocks, send money to each other, get paid at work, and much more.\n\nWhat powers the Bitcoin network is an incredible system called the blockchain. It\'s the reason the software can verify transactions all over the world. That\'s what\'s attractive to banks and high-tech firms.\n\nIt\'s essentially a perfect record log. That same record log lives on every computer on the Bitcoin network. And it gets updated every few minutes with a new ""block"" of transactions. The thing is, the next block is built on top of the old one, so you can\'t just go in and change old data.\n\nIt\'s a effective way to stop fraud.\n\nThat\'s hugely different from today, where records are centralized. Hack into a bank, and it\'s easy to falsify them. But the blockchain keeps the same record in lots of computers. A fake record would be immediately spotted by every other computer on the network.\n\nThere are all sorts of purposes for this kind of record keeping.\n\nNasdaq is tapping blockchain technology to create a more secure, efficient system to trade stocks.\n\nDocuSign, a company that specializes in electronic contracts, just unveiled a joint idea with Visa to use blockchain to track car rentals and reduce paperwork.\n\nNext week, Microsoft (MSFT)will unveil details about its venture into ""smart contracts"" that use blockchain technology. It\'s partnering up with Ethereum, a blockchain project that operates outside of Bitcoin but uses the same concept. Microsoft wants to incorporate that into its Azure service, which rents out computer servers.\n\nMeanwhile, this new obsession with blockchain technology has reached a point that companies are even experimenting with creating smaller, ""private blockchains"" inside their own offices. They hire companies like BlockCypher, a startup out of Redwood City, California.\n\nAmong the top of the list is Chain, a company that helps others apply the blockchain to their business. Earlier this year, it raised $30 million from Capital One (COF), Citi (C) Ventures, the Nasdaq (BANK) stock exchange, Visa (V) and others.\n\nThe appetite became most apparent last week at Money2020, the largest financial conference in the world. One in five attendees at the conference thought Bitcoin\'s blockchain technology will have the biggest impact on financial services in the next three to five years, according to a Capital One survey.\n\nWhat\'s driving that investment rally? Stodgy banking and venture capital companies are finally embracing the technology instead of demonizing it as weird and dangerous.\n\nSure, Bitcoin has anti-establishment roots. It\'s an all-digital currency. It belongs to no country. It\'s recognized by no government as ""legal tender."" It was created anonymously online.\n\nBut it\'s moving beyond its initial devotees, militant libertarians who hate central banks.\n\nAnd there\'s now a way for investors to get into the action. Just last week was the launch of Digital Currency Group, which claims to have ""the largest early-stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain ecosystem."" It\'s led by Barry Silbert, an entrepreneur who specializes in creating markets for difficult-to-trade items. Silbert launched the firm with financial help from Bain Capital, MasterCard and others.\n\nSilbert\'s funding round helped push the total amount raised in Bitcoin-related companies to just over $1 billion last month, according to several venture capital firms involved in the space.\n\n""This signals a broad endorsement that the blockchain is of critical importance to financial innovation,"" Will O\'Brien, a senior strategic advisor to venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, told CNNMoney. ""The early days of dismissing Bitcoin as a tulip bubble are behind us.""\n\nAnd this is why the price of Bitcoin -- which peaked at $1,151 two years ago and now hovers at $328 -- just isn\'t that important.\n\nThe technology lives on.\n\nJose Pagliery is the author of Bitcoin - And the Future of Money (Triumph Books, Chicago).', 'The Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has declared Bitcoin to be illegal in Taiwan, following a recent high-profile kidnapping accident involving ransom demands made in Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin by a largely tech-savvy population in Taiwan wherein citizens have the means to buy bitcoin in popular convenience store chains, the Taiwanese FSC has today declared Bitcoin to be illegal in the country.\n\nThe announcement came after a recent high-profile incident wherein a prominent Hong Kong business tycoon was kidnapped by a criminal gang who demanded HK$70 million (approx. 30,000 BTC or over USD $ 10 million) in Bitcoin. The victim was rescued soon after a payment of HK$13 million (approx. 4,800 BTC or USD $1.6 million).\n\nFocus Taiwan, a national news agency reports that Tseng Ming-Chung, Chairman of the FSC deemed any usage of the cryptocurrency in the country to be illegal. Furthermore, he also stated that the FSC would collaborate with Taiwan’s central bank and law enforcement agencies to “crack down” on any illegal activities relating to Bitcoin.\n\nThe Chairman also reportedly said:\n\nThe FSC will also publish a statement jointly with the central bank to inform other countries of such regulations.\n\nIn early 2014, Ming-Chung had stated that bitcoin holders are “on their own” and aren’t entitled to legal claims nor guarantee of conversion after noting that the cryptocurrency was not issued by a monetary authority.\n\nHe was also completely dismissive of the possibility of a bitcoin ATM operating in the country, noting that the ATM would require approval by the FSC which, he added, “will not be given.”\n\nTo openly flout the statement, adopters of the cryptocurrency installed a Bitcoin ATM in April, 2014, merely months after Chairman Tseng drawing the line about the possibility of Bitcoin ATMs operating in the country.\n\nLast year, there were two functioning Bitcoin exchanges in the country namely Bitage and Bitquick. Bitage’s website is not functioning at the time of publishing and Bitquick, while active, does not show up with an HTTPS certificate.\n\nCuriously, selecting a different Bitquick country-portal (USA/EU and India) shows that both websites do have encryption. At this time, it is still speculation to see any reason to relate the Chairman’s comments about Bitcoin to Bitquick’s website not functioning as it normally would.\n\nBeyond speculation, the very real possibility of banning Bitcoin in the country is bound to have a profound impact on a Taiwanese population that has grown to buy and even pay for utilities and bills using the cryptocurrency.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Wikipedia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Two ransomware strains, CoinVault and Bitcryptor have been put to bed due to the joint efforts of law enforcement in Netherland and an independent cybersecurity firm. The authors of the malware sought ransom payments from victims in Bitcoin.\n\nRansomware thieves who took Bitcoin payments in return for victims to access their files freely after their rogue file-locking methods have been put out of work. Two authors who allegedly developed the ransomware were arrested in Netherlands and Kaspersky, a cybersecurity firm has confirmed that it has amassed 14,000 decryption keys that are required for victims to access their vaulted files.\n\nRussian software security firm Kaspersky revealed the outcome of the operation on a website which also provides a decryption tool that victims can download for free.\n\nThe two ransomware strains had successfully infected thousands of PCs to encrypt data files on the victim’s hard drive before demanding a ransom payment worth hundreds of dollars in Bitcoin.\n\nCryptographic Ransomware\n\nCoinVault and Bitcryptor are ransomware belonging to the cryptographic locker family of ransomware Trojans. They are malware with similar traits, chief among them a ransom demand seeking Bitcoin. These infections affect hundreds of thousands of users worldwide and employ sophisticated techniques to make it hard for law enforcement to trace payments, including those made via bitcoin wallet transfers.\n\nWhen innocent victims trigger the ransomware through an infected file or a download, the malware quickly encrypts the user’s files before cutting off access to the data. At this time, a web page or a window opens up to demand Bitcoin from the victim in exchange for access to the files again.\n\nThe CoinVault malware has even been known to offer a “free decrypt” to users, letting them pick any single file from their computer as proof to show that the files will be decrypted and available, as long as the bitcoin ransom is paid. The image below shows the GUI of the CoinVault window, complete with the cybercriminal’s bitcoin address.\n\nA standard rate of 0.5 BTC is demanded with the ransom increasing by $100 every 24 hours the demands aren’t met.\n\nAlso read: Ransomware Racket Nets Developers $325 Million in Bitcoin: Report\n\nA successful ransomware campaign that affects 15,000 computers can minimally net $5 million, according to a recent report that looking into Cryptowall 3.0, the latest variant of an even bigger, far-reaching ransomware strain.\n\nDecryption Done\n\nWith the success of the joint investigation with Netherlands’ law enforcement and the country’s National Prosecutors Office, Kaspersky has announced that the two ransomware variants are effectively dead. The cybersecurity firm has also added 14,000 decryption keys required to unlock infected computers and is offering a decryption tool that’s downloadable for free.\n\nDespite the takedown, the authors of larger, more diabolical Cryptowall 3.0 are still unknown and very likely to be a single group pulling the strings of a worldwide operation. Those behind the ransomware are said to have gathered $325 million in bitcoin ransom payments.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and WebRoot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About halfway through the conversation at Money20/20, discussion turns to Kodak.\n\nIt’s not without merit. The photography giant once boasted more than 145,000 employees and $16bn in global revenues, but its empire all but crumbled due to rise of digital photography. To digital currency proponents, this shift has been held up as an example of what happens when incumbents fail to innovate when new technologies lead to the creation of new behaviors.\n\nIn the face of tech that enables value to be sent at a low cost across national borders, industry supporters have long argued remittances are the first and most obvious area for disruption, and that industry giants like MoneyGram and Western Union will be among the initial firms to see bottom lines impacted.\n\nFor all the capital deployed against this thesis, Peter Ohser’s level of incredulity when faced with this possibility is a bit surprising. The executive vice president of business development at global remittance giant MoneyGram has heard these arguments before, but feels digital currency doesn’t pose any threat or solve pressing problems.\n\n“If you could actually leverage [bitcoin] the way people want, we’d be there,” he said.\n\nAt the end of the day, he argues, consumers want physical cash, something MoneyGram with its network of partners in 200 countries, is equipped to provide.\n\nIn response, I bring up traditional photos, how today's consumers don’t think anything of sending and receiving digital images, and that perhaps, a similar change, however unlikely, it may seem, could take place with cash. Ohser, however, fights against this narrative.\n\nCameras, he said, were expensive, heavy, prone to error and inconvenient. He throws around words like cumbersome before just calling the process “a real pain in the ass”.\n\nInterestingly, Ohser doesn’t see remittances in the same light, telling CoinDesk that he believes existing payment behaviors are too entrenched, and that bitcoin is unlikely to offer enough utility:\n\n“Payments are already digital and real time. I can send cash using the existing rails. It’s there and it’s real. [Digital currency] is not solving a problem … There’s also a trust factor. People trust paper more than they trust data and that behaviour is not going to change.”\n\nStill, Ohser allows for a certain margin for error in his rationale, at times suggesting that MoneyGram might be inclined to leverage bitcoin if it solved what he believes are its key problems – acceptance and scale.\n\nLast-mile challenge\n\nFrom the onset, it’s clear that Ohser has been paying close attention to the industry. For example, he’s quick to bring up the so-called “last-mile challenge”, the theory that no matter how quickly money can be sent, getting physical funds into the hands of consumers is the greatest and most costly challenge.\n\nIn particular, Ohser cites a recent article by one of the founders of Rebit, a Philippines-based bitcoin remittance firm, who left the company over concerns about its business model and his company’s issues overcoming this challenge.\n\n“We’re always paying attention to everything,” he says. “We don’t take anything lightly.”\n\nHowever, Ohser does seem to dismiss bitcoin and digital currencies in many regards. For one, he is adamant that there’s only one way for bitcoin to solve that last-mile challenge – by becoming a widely accepted global currency, and he doesn’t believe that's very likely.\n\n“We don’t see bitcoin in particular as a solution today to be able to one disrupt us or provide a better or different service,” he adds.\n\nOhser believes the blockchain, the digital currency’s open distributed ledger, holds more promise. For one, it’s not “tainted” by early challenges, but he still believes it doesn’t solve the problem of getting users money that can be converted into goods and services.\n\n“You can send money to a phone, but these people need cash,” he continues. “They need to buy their food and pay medical bills. People are spending most of that money within 24 hours. They’re living hand to mouth.”\n\nRegulatory hurdles\n\nThroughout the conversation, Ohser seems to shift in his views, sometimes indicating that the problem with digital currency is one of technology, while other times blaming regulatory concerns as the main issue.\n\nHe’s quick to praise the technology, before listing it’s issues today, and always seems willing to add the caveat that these opinions are subject to change, however unlikely that may be.\n\n“[Bitcoin] is still not an ecosystem that is clean, and so the banks won’t touch it,” he says before calling the promise of the technology equally “amazing” yet out of touch with the “practical reality” of how government and law enforcement want money to move.\n\nIn other instances, it’s clear the positioning of the technology in the public discourse bothers Osher, who goes so far as to call comparisons between bitcoin and email unfounded given that regulations never applied to email.\n\nHe’s also equally willing to suggest bitcoin just won’t be allowed to succeed, and that this is out of the power of anyone in the financial industry.\n\n“There are two things, one you have regulators and two you have central banks, and they’re never going to give up control of their currency. It’s a very effective way to manage a global state. If you think bitcoin is rising up to become a global currency, the state is never going to let it happen,” he continues.\n\nAs evidence, Ohser cited the ongoing developments in Russia, where the state’s Ministry of Finance is seeking to ban bitcoin under a law pertaining to money substitutes, and Australia, where banks have seemingly closed the corporate accounts of industry firms.\n\nMerging data and money\n\nStill, the conversation isn’t without debate. Early on in the conversation, Ohser brings up how MoneyGram “moves data and money separately”, to which I ask if he believes bitcoin and blockchain-based systems have the potential to bridge what would seem like an inefficiency.\n\n“If you’re sending money, I need to collect that money. That’s the model, we’re moving money and we have to move money through traditional banks, and the data flow is separate,” he explained.\n\nHere, Ohser allows that a system that requires the management of two accounting units comes with costs and frictions, ones that mount given that everyday money and data move between its accounts and 65,000 partners in 300,000 locations.\n\nHowever, he believes perception is the battle, and that today, this isn’t a perceived issue.\n\n“[Consumers] don’t think of data as money, they think it’s real money being sent. It’s not, it’s trusted parties saying you’re authorized to pay this out,” he continues. “If you can move money and data in real time there’s value there.”\n\nSoon, though Ohser adds another caveat, that he believes that because bitcoin must be converted into fiat currency, even a bitcoin or blockchain system will have added costs, ones that may be higher than those it pays today specifically because MoneyGram moves “so much money at scale”, and thus receives discounts.\n\nUltimately, he argues systems like Ripple, which aim to disrupt correspondent banking are “interesting” but don’t change MoneyGram’s cost structure.\n\n“Until bitcoin can be a global currency, it’s not going to solve most of our problems,” he said. “The banking system works, it’s flawed for sure. Everyone in the room will agree on that. But there’s benefit to fixing flaws versus full disruption. Incremental improvements will benefit everyone, and slow the growth of true disruption.”\n\nEmotion over technology\n\nIf Ohser was more restrained in his opinions at the beginning of the talk, he grows even bolder as the conversation progresses, saving his bluntest statements until last.\n\nAt one point, he grows animated when voicing his belief that MoneyGram is already “winning through innovation”, when compared to FinTech startups.\n\n“Bitcoin will not be a significant player in the remittance industry,” he says flatly.\n\n“It’s not happening. It’s not about technology. It’s about customers and behaviour, how they trust money, why they use cash.”\n\nOhser went on to critique attempts like Abra – which has so far raised $12m to take an Uber-like approach to remittances – as misguided for effectively attempting to sidestep traditional laws by having app users act as mobile money-exchange kiosks.\n\n“Anyone who touches the funds, we do criminal background checks,” he explained. “It’s a massive expense. Regulators are not going to let anyone with a mobile phone be a money transmitter.”\n\nBy the end of the conversation, Ohser is still moving closer to some sort of certainty in his opinions, stating that I can expect to see him and MoneyGram at Money20/20 this year, the next and the next, no matter what advances bitcoin makes.\n\nHe concludes with a challenge, which I accept, stating:\n\n“We can make this conversation an annual thing.”\n\nImage credit: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It may be 25, 100, or 500 years from now, but those days are in our future. For some people, the future is now, as the world’s first verified bio-payment using Bitcoin has been performed through a microchip implant into a man’s hand.\n\nMeet Patric Lanhed\n\nWith the help of fellow computer software developer Juanjo Tara, Lanhed has started the age of Bitcoin bio-payments. The video below shows Lanhed being the human guinea pig for the first verified Blockchain entry, literally by hand, using an NFC (Near Field Communication) scanner. They used a microchip developed by Dangerous Things, which stores 888 bytes of data, enough to hold up to 26 Bitcoin private keys. The two developed the software that takes the NFC scan and transmits it to their online bitcoin wallet portal, providing a quick confirmation.\n\n“We are here to try to expand the frontiers of bio-functionality,” Tara reports to Vice’s Motherboard. “We started with bitcoins as a tribute of the revolution on the internet, and we believe in have the ownership of our data. Ultimately you will be able to connect you credit card to your implant and pay with that. But this terminal is probably a generic product that can be used in other situations as well. It doesn’t have to be payments, it can be reading medical journals or travel documents.”\n\nIn that vein, they have proven this is only the first step in their bio-ventures. They have made another video using this system where medical information is stored in the hand and transmitted to a smartphone for viewing by medical first responders. They will make their code open source, so that the online community can follow in their implanted footsteps.\n\nMr. Bitcoin\n\nWhile this is the first verified bio-payment using Bitcoin, it is not the first hand implant of private keys. Martijn Wismeijer, founder of the Bitcoin ATM company, Mr. Bitcoin made news about this time last year by getting not one, but two glass 2mm x 12mm chips implanted into each hand to store his bitcoins. There is no proof of him making payments with these chips, but he says the chips can be read by the latest Apple iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphones.\n\n“I did it because I wanted to experiment with strong bitcoins using subdermal implants because that’s what I thought would be the Holy Grail of contactless payments,” he told the IBTimes.“I found you can use them for lots of different things, even as an alarm snooze button. To switch off my alarm I need to scan either one or two of the implants, so this way it takes a little bit of fiddling so you never oversleep again.”', 'Legendary news publication “The Economist” has seen fit to not only acknowledge the innovations of Blockchain’s technology but produce a feature story on it for the current October 31 weekly edition. The cover story’s title is called, “The trust machine - How the technology behind bitcoin could change the world.” Here we go over some excerpts and the basic tenor of the piece.\n\nThe Economist is one of the Western world’s oldest and most trusted publications\n\nAs you may already be aware, Bitcoin does not have a sterling reputation within the mainstream media, if that fact has alluded you to this point, The Economist makes sure you get that realization stated up front as fact within the story’s first sentence, which succinctly reads “Bitcoin has a bad reputation.” The online edition fails to reveal a name of an author for this story.\n\nThis first sentence sets up the article with a short summary of why the generally negative reputation has been established, so far. By the middle of the second paragraph, it does not refute any issues with the public image Bitcoin. They seem to have little interest in disputing its validity, but they rush to the defense of the technological flavor-of-the-month, Bitcoin’s revolutionary Blockchain technology, whose impressive skip set is attracting venture capitalists and banking magnates like moths to a flame.\n\nAn original point of view was the use of Napster as the progenitor, the guiding light, for all future peer-to-peer networks, be it Napster, Spotify or Bitcoin. The article covers the broad strokes of what a blockchain is and how it may help businesses become more efficient in a multitude of business fields, from banking to real estate registry in Honduras. A swing at Bitcoin, while catapulting “The Blockchain” is pretty much a prerequisite in such an editorial piece.\n\n“Bitcoin itself may never be more than a curiosity. However, blockchains have a host of other uses because they meet the need for a trustworthy record, something vital for transactions of every sort. Dozens of startups now hope to capitalize on the blockchain technology, either by doing clever things with the bitcoin blockchain or by creating new blockchains of their own.”\n\nIt has some other facets of the interaction between the mainstream and the blockchain that I won’t spoil. The representation of how a major pillar of the mainstream media with 1,400,000 weekly readers covers a revolutionary technology like Bitcoin and its blockchain is worth a read. The piece is generally quite positive, if fairly predictable, but the idea of promoting the blockchain over Bitcoin reminds me of something my favorite Bitcoin guru Andreas Antonopoulos said. He said the following at a recent Wired Money Bitcoin education seminar in July that is quite salient, to put this in perspective.\n\nAntonopoulos:\n\n“The Blockchain, in itself, is boring technology. It’s a slow ledger. Don’t make the mistake of ignoring the disruptive potential of Bitcoin, and so you can get some watered-down, CompuServe-like, smooth jazz, soft version of it that feels nice and comfortable at the executive Board Room. There are two places you can be. You can be Blockbuster or your can be Netflix. That’s why Bitcoin is the important thing, not The Blockchain.”\n\nReading The Economist piece is a good idea, as is watching the video of Andreas’ dissertation at Wired Money.

Now Moves into 30-Day Public Crowdsale.\n\nVoxelus, the world’s first end-to-end virtual reality content creation platform and marketplace, has completed its private pre-sale of 1.2 million Voxels (VOX) for a total of 1,022 BTC ($350,000 USD at the close of the pre-sale), with the vast majority of orders coming in the final 48 hours, following in-person presentations to industry leaders at the Money 20/20 and Bitcoin Investor conferences last week.\n\nThis represents the largest amount ever raised in a private crowdsale of a cryptographic token. The prior record was held by Swarm, which sold $250,000 of its tokens privately before selling a total of $1 million in the combined private-public crowdsale. The all-time record for a public crowdsale of a cryptographic token was last summer’s Ethereum crowdsale, which raised 31,529 BTC across a 42-day public crowdsale (valued at $18.4 million at the time).\n\nVoxel’s public crowdsale at sale.voxelus.com will last 30 days and will sell up to the remaining 30.3 million tokens it has made available for the crowdsale. The tokens are priced in Bitcoin and are available for 0.0001 BTC (approximately $0.34 USD) each, based on today’s exchange rate. This rate will only be available for 24 hours, ending on Tuesday, November 3, at 8:59 am pst. After that, the rate will increase to approximately $0.38 USD (900 voxels per bitcoin) through Wednesday, November 11, at 8:59 am. Final tiers are at approximately $0.43 USD (800 voxels per bitcoin) through Sunday, November 22, and $0.45 USD (750 voxels per bitcoin) through December 2 (earlier if all voxels sell out first).\n\n“We are delighted by the strong response from both the VR and cryptocurrency communities, who are excited by the possibilities that an in-game cryptocurrency can contribute to accelerate and globalize the spread of virtual reality content,” said Martin Repetto, CEO and co-founder of Voxelus. “Voxelus allows the 2.5 billion people in the world who have no bank account but have a mobile phone to create, buy and sell virtual reality content, and it’s just as easy for people in developed countries as well.”\n\nThe 30-day crowdsale is being facilitated by ShapeShift, a Voxelus strategic partner and investor run by iconic bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees. ShapeShift also recently facilitated the back-end for successful crowdsales for Augur (raising $5.2 million) and Spells of Genesis.\n\nFifteen percent (31.5 million) of all possible voxels will be sold during this time. The remaining 85 percent will be released over the next 20 years and will be used for development, content creator bounties, marketing and other corporate purposes. Unlike many cryptocurrencies which use crowdsales to build their token, the Voxel platform is already substantially complete, including wallets and internal mining pools, and will have its initial distribution of Voxel tokens following the crowdsale.\n\n“Voxels are the official currency of virtual reality,” said Voxelus chairman and co-founder Halsey Minor, who previously founded or co-founded iconic companies CNET, Salesforce, Vignette and Google Voice. He is also founder and chairman of Uphold (formerly Bitreserve), Voxelus, and Reality Lab, which recently announced the first-ever 360-degree live broadcast VR camera.\n\n- Voxelus chairman and co-founder Halsey Minor\n\nUphold is the world's leading cloud-based money platform. After the crowdsale, the voxel will join 24 other currencies and Bitcoin that members can move, convert, hold, transact and spend just like any of the fiat currencies supported. Approximately 22 percent of the world's publicly traded Bitcoin has been transacted on Uphold’s platform in less than 11 months, making Uphold one of the largest digital currency companies in the world. The Voxel will be the only cryptocurrency other than bitcoin supported by Uphold.\n\nVoxels are the “coin of the realm” to purchase any of the thousands of digital assets, animations, games and immersive worlds on the Voxelus marketplace, which will go live in Q1 2016. Voxelus will offer a revenue share with content creators, 20,000 of whom have downloaded the creator software. Given the high cost of production prior to Voxelus and current paucity of available content, Voxelus co-founder and CEO Martin Repetto predicts that the Voxelus platform will quickly become the repository for the majority of the world’s VR content, including games.\n\nAbout Voxelus\n\nFounded in 2015, Voxelus is a revolutionary platform that allows anyone to create Virtual Reality games, experiences and virtual spaces without writing a line of code. The platform consists of Voxelus Creator, a 3D design app for PC and Mac; Voxelus Viewer, which works on desktop PCs, Oculus Rift and Samsung VR devices; and the Voxelus Marketplace, which allows creators to sell and user to buy VR content and games for the Voxelus ecosystem, using the unique voxel in-game cryptocurrency."", 'Ulbricht at trial. Image: AP\n\nWhile Ross Ulbricht, convicted creator of the drug marketplace Silk Road, starts his sentence, internet sleuths are still digging through the blockchain, looking for other stories to tell around the site\'s history.\n\nNow, a pair of investigators may have discovered a previously unknown forum account belonging to Ulbricht, one he apparently used to asked for help finding over 40,000 bitcoins that had disappeared from his wallet\'s balance, and paid others hundreds of bitcoins for help on technical issues.\n\nAn investigator known as \'imposter\' and Gwern Branwen, a researcher and moderator of the /r/darknetmarkets subreddit, allege that a user named kohlanta on the popular Bitcoin Talk forums is in fact Ulbricht.\n\n""I was revisiting Gwern and my research into the Silk Road / Mt. Gox connection,"" imposter wrote on the Bitcoin subreddit Sunday. ""Found something very interesting on the \'1MR6pXD\' address. Oh Ulbricht...""\n\n""1MR6pXD"" refers to a bitcoin address the pair previously discovered after identifying a Mt. Gox account used by Ross Ulbricht for Silk Road transactions. This was through a combination of filings in the Ross Ulbricht trial, a 2014 leak of the Mt. Gox database, as well as information from an ""Mt. Gox insider.""\n\nRecently, imposter found a thread dating back to August 2012, where the user kohlanta claimed ownership of the bitcoin address in question, and asked for help to recover the over 40,000 BTC stored within.\n\n""kohlanta\'s address [...] is the one involved in the Ulbricht withdrawals/deposits,"" Branwen writes.\n\n""If you look it up in the blockchain, you can see that currently it contains 44,914.031337 BTC,"" kohlanta wrote at the time. ""As you can see, the address is present in the wallet, and the blockchain is up to date, yet the balance reads zero,"" he continued, before writing ""100 btc to anyone who can help me solve this problem. Thanks!""\n\nQuickly, a solution was found. All that was required was running the command ""bitcoind -rescan,"" which would cause kohlanta\'s Bitcoin client to synchronize with the blockchain. The helper received his 100 BTC reward shortly after. At the time, bitcoins were valued at around $10 each, so the helpful user made around thousand bucks for their suggestion.\n\nHumorously, someone noticed the strangeness of someone having 40,000 BTC, a truly huge amount, without really knowing to how handle their Bitcoin software.\n\n""Makes me wonder whether this is a viable business model: Technical support for large holders of bitcoins who have a lack of computational skills,"" the user wrote.\n\nThat wasn\'t the only time kohlanta offered rewards for technical advice. In January 2013, he asked for some tips on handling Bitcoin software again in exchange for 10 BTC, and then in March put forward 5 BTC for some help with PHP.\n\nBranwen and imposter also note that Ko Lanta is a tourist hotspot in Thailand, a country which Ulbricht traveled to.\n\nIn his journal, Ulbricht documented the process of essentially learning to code on the fly while building and maintaining Silk Road. He also received substantial help from other, secret staff members to code the marketplace.\n\nBut this new discovery shows that others may have contributed to the development of Silk Road too, without even knowing it.', 'Most of the people who have ever heard of Bitcoin will be able to recall the story about how one person paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas a few years ago. Even though that might seem like a gigantic waste of money in hindsight, this was one of the first times Bitcoin was used as a payment method for tangible goods. A recent study shows how Millennials can’t get enough of pizza these days, which creates an interesting scenario for Bitcoin adoption.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin is “The Real Boy” of Money: No Strings Attached\n\nYoung Americans Adore Pizza Over Phones\n\nOne of the most common misunderstandings these days is how Millennials seem to be spending tons of money on phones and other smart devices. While there has been an increase in expenses focusing on these gadgets, there are other things that are even more popular; Pizza is one of those things, as it is cheap and quite accessible in the US.\n\nCNNMoney recently received some data from Venmo, one of the popular peer-to-peer money transfer applications used by Millennials these days. Although this data is a less obvious that one might expect, Venmo users will have to include a brief message when sending money to other users. In most cases, this message comes in the form of an emoji, indicating which types of payment are most common when using this peer-to-peer platform.\n\nIn cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, and San Francisco, the most commonly used emoji is pizza. While it may seem like a far stretch to automatically assume pizza is one of the most often paid-for items on the Venmo platform, the company strongly feels this is exactly the case. Areas like New York – taxi- and Philadelphia – beer – show different trending emoji’s, which seem to be on par with what these places are famous for.\n\nThe recent growth of Venmo is indicative of how our society will evolve, especially regarding finance and sharing. Peer-to-peer platforms will start playing a bigger role in the future. Now that PayPal has announced Venmo integration in an official capacity, the number of transactions per quarter is likely to keep increasing over the next few years.\n\nPizza is cheap, accessible, and quite delicious. Millennials are well aware of how the economy works and which products they will prefer over others. As far as electronics go, smart devices and other gadgets will always remain popular in this demographic. But there is a noticeable trend of how people will use peer-to-peer payments when enjoying a social gathering.\n\nOpportunity for Bitcoin and Pizza?\n\nBitcoin and pizza share quite the history together. Now those statistics confirm this is the item most Millennials seem to prefer using peer-to-peer payments for, there is a huge opportunity for Bitcoin acceptance in this market. The time has come for an educational campaign on how Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment platform similar to Venmo, but without relying on traditional payment methods, and with lower transaction fees.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are not too many places in the US where Bitcoin payments are accepted in exchange for pizza. All of that can be circumvented by using “temporary” solutions such as a Bitcoin debit card. However, if pizza businesses want to attract this demographic, it would be in their best interest to look into Bitcoin payments sooner rather than later.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on using peer-to-peer payments for pizza? How can Bitcoin benefit from this trend? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nSource: CNNMoney\n\nImages courtesy of Venmo, Crust AU, Thuisbezorgd\n\nOriginally posted on: Pizza Poised To Help Boost Bitcoin Acceptance', ""“I HAVE moved on to other things.” Thus wrote the mysterious creator of bitcoin, who calls himself Satoshi Nakamoto, in an e-mail in April 2011. Except for a few messages, most of which are believed to be hoaxes, he has not been heard from since. Nobody has ever met him in person, no photos exist. Even the roughly 1m bitcoin (currently worth more than $400m) which sit in digital wallets once controlled by him have not been touched. So who is the elusive creator of the technology which powers the digital currency?\n\nMost books on bitcoin feature a lengthy chapter about who Mr Nakamoto may be. Each has its own theory, often based on the same sources. Some locate him in Britain (because of his use of Britishisms, such as “bloody hard”). Others reckon he is somewhere in the eastern parts of the Americas (because of the timestamps on his e-mails). He has been variously identified as a Finnish sociologist, a Japanese mathematician and an Irish student. The names mentioned most often are Nick Szabo and Hal Finney, two American cryptographers, but the former denies it and the latter died in 2014. In March last year Newsweek, a magazine, identified a man living in California, named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, as the real Nakamoto—which turned out to be an embarrassing (and predictable) canard. Then there is the argument that Mr Nakamoto's bitcoin code is so good that it must have been written by more than one person.\n\nUpgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors’ Picks newsletters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeculation about Mr Nakamoto’s identity is likely to continue, much like other evergreens such as who really killed JFK or whether Elvis is still alive. A more interesting question is whether Mr Nakamoto's absence is a good thing for bitcoin. Whether it was planned all along or not, Mr Nakamoto’s disappearance is at least as brilliant as the technology he created in 2008. The vanishing act not only guaranteed ongoing publicity, it bequeathed bitcoin with a powerful creation myth, helping the currency attract followers and gain momentum. It befits a system which powers a currency without a central bank to have no leader. And it makes the project less vulnerable: had Mr Nakamoto stayed around, or even founded a startup to manage his creation, he would have become the target of all kinds of attacks—as did the founders of Napster, the first sizeable peer-to-peer music-sharing service.\n\nYet in recent months the absence of bitcoin’s creator has become a serious drawback. In the currency’s early days it was Mr Nakamoto who made important calls on how to improve the system’s software, which is open-source. But bitcoin has grown so fast that its community of developers has yet to agree on the kind of robust decision-making processes it needs in the absence of a benevolent dictator. Currently, the rule is unanimity among the project’s lead developers: a recipe for stasis. And now they may be heading for a schism: two camps are locked in an ugly fight over how to expand the system’s capacity. If they cannot settle their differences, some worry, the digital currency may split into two incompatible versions. Unsurprisingly, some now call for Mr Nakamoto to come back and knock some heads together. But it may be too late for him to reappear: even if somebody now stepped forward and claimed to be the lost crypto-prophet, would people actually want to believe him? If Saint Satoshi were a real person, the world of bitcoin would lose much of its magic.""]"

Bitcoin is now illegal within Taiwan.\n\nFinancial Interest Decide What is Illegal, Then Tell Police the New Law\n\nIn many developed countries, a separate government body, like a Parliament or Congress, would create laws after a vetting process of checks and balances, with a somewhat legitimate voting process. The banking interests are presumed to control the action from behind closed doors. Not in Taiwan apparently, where the FSC, similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States, has decided on its own that Bitcoin will no longer be allowed to be transmitted in Taiwan. The legislative controlling position of the financial industry is very clear and open in Taiwan.\n\nAccording to Focus Taiwan News, Tseng said in a hearing Monday that Bitcoin was illegal and he pledged that the FSC would work with the country\'s Central Bank and police to crack down any illegal activity. The FSC will also publish a statement jointly with the central bank to inform other countries of such regulations. This is tantamount to the SEC in the United States holding a press conference and saying: “Bitcoin is now illegal. We’ll tell federal law enforcement and the Federal Reserve what to do next regarding its future use.”\n\nAs CoinTelegraph recently reported, this FSC action follows the kidnapping of 68-year-old Pearl Oriental Oil chairman Wong Yuk-Kwan. According to the latest information on this case, the tycoon was allegedly abducted on September 20, then shackled and held for 70 million HK dollars, or over US$5M. He was in captivity until October 27, when he was rescued in a rare joint operation between Hong Kong and Taiwan police, who said no ransom money was paid by the Yuk-Kwan family countering previous that a bitcoin was sent to the kidnappers.\n\nTaiwan authorities believe one of Taiwan\'s biggest organized crime groups, the United Bamboo gang, was hired by persons unknown to snatch the businessman. Fifteen United Bamboo gang members have been arrested in association with this case. Sources say two of the suspects ventured to Hong Kong to collect the ransom money but were unsuccessful. They were followed by law enforcement back to houses in Taiwan, where Yuk-Kwan was held captive.\n\nThe captors stayed in contact with the Wong family via email, and sent videos of Yuk-Kwan in distress, having him confirm and make demands of the family. One transmission was from October 22, where he said the following to his daughter:\n\n""My dearest daughter, it is Daddy. Today is October 22, 2015, on Thursday. Please come to help mum remit the remaining amount [of ransom] tomorrow. Stay strong. Wait for my return.""\n\nYuk-Kwan is currently out on bail in his own criminal case, which has been adjourned until December 9. He is under suspicion of fraud and money-laundering in relation to the acquisition of an oil field within the United States.\n\nThe only loser here is Bitcoin and the innocent people of Taiwan\n\nSo to summarize, a crime against a billionaire means huge potential ramifications for the Taiwanese Bitcoin community. Wong Yuk-Kwan is safe and sound, receiving medical treatment for some facial injuries while awaiting trial in his own criminal case. No Bitcoin or money from the Yuk-Kwan family was lost to gangster criminals, who were apprehended. Yet, the people of Taiwan can theoretically no longer use Bitcoin, just because it was mentioned as means to an end by criminals looking for a ransom payment, which they never received.\n\nHow Taiwan banking and law enforcement authorities plan to ban the transmission of bitcoin, which cannot be physically held, and can be sent digitally through smartphones, apps, websites, and the black market is as yet unknown.', ""Brian Armstrong, CEO of record-funded Bitcoin wallet service and exchange Coinbase , plans a code update to allow for bigger blocks in the second week of December, and has indicated he prefers BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 101 . This makes Coinbase the latest Bitcoin industry heavyweight to endorse the proposal as adopted by alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT , although the company is still open to other solutions.\n\nArmstrong recently sent out a series of tweets in support of a block-size increase, in which he stated the intention to upgrade his company's code by December. It was not clear, however, whether these tweets indicated support for BIP 101, the block-increase proposal that is programmed to increase the maximum block size eightfold to 8MB, doubling each other year until it reaches 8GB. While BIP 101 is endorsed by several leading companies in the Bitcoin space, other proposals have gathered significant support , too.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Armstrong confirmed that Coinbase plans to upgrade its code to allow for bigger blocks in December of this year. And while the preferred solution is not set in stone, Coinbase currently favors BIP 101.\n\n“We are open to evaluating all proposals which increase the block size. But we do plan to upgrade around the second week of December, so this will require working solutions in code by then. The only one I'm aware of which currently has working code is BIP 101,” Armstrong said.\n\nMoreover, Armstrong indicated that he'd like the Bitcoin industry to switch to Bitcoin XT, the alternative Bitcoin implementation run by Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen that implemented BIP 101 in August of this year.\n\n“In my view, Bitcoin XT is the best option I've seen so far. Not just because it has working code, but also because it has a simple implementation that is easy to understand, the block-size increases seem about right to me, and I have confidence in the people behind the project. My preference at this point would be to have Gavin step up as the final decision-maker on Bitcoin XT, and have the industry move to that solution with help from Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik and others that wish to do so.”\n\nThe CEO believes an upgrade is urgently needed in order for the Bitcoin network to handle a sudden increase of Bitcoin usage. As such, Armstrong emphasized that Coinbase will not wait for consensus to form among the Bitcoin development community.\n\n“We will upgrade regardless of whether Bitcoin Core is updated,” Armstrong said. “Capacity planning is something you should try to get ahead of. Growth can be unpredictable, and I want to remove all blockers to Bitcoin's success. I've been disappointed to see how slow Bitcoin Core has moved on this issue, and we're open to switching forks.”\n\nIn an open letter published in September, a selection of prominent Bitcoin developers urged the Bitcoin community to take the time to evaluate proposals that have been put forward and agree on the best solutions via the consensus-building process. In particular, many of these developers argue that a switch to bigger blocks represents a big, perhaps even existential security risk .\n\nArmstrong told Bitcoin Magazine that he is aware of the potential risks of increasing the block-size limit, but said he believes these are being overstated.\n\n“When people offer opinions on things like this, it's important to consider their qualifications. In my case, I've implemented a Bitcoin node from scratch. I created the first version of the one Coinbase uses in production today, and I've helped us scale this bitcoin node from 0 to 2.7 million customers. So I've learned quite a lot about scaling a Bitcoin node during that time.” Armstrong explained. “It is a difficult judgment call, but I believe it is low enough risk, and the upside is considerable enough to make it worth it.”\n\nOther leading Bitcoin companies published an open letter in August in which they vowed to upgrade their code to increase the maximum block size. The letter expressed support for BIP 101, although three of its signers have since indicated that alternative block increase proposals will be considered as well.\n\nPhoto\n\nTechCrunch\n\n/\n\nFlickr (CC)"", 'The price of bitcoin has risen to its highest level of 2015, surging $50 (£32, €45) over the past 24 hours amid speculation of a ""second bitcoin bubble"". The cryptocurrency\'s price peaked at $377.36 on 3 November, representing a 75% increase in price since August.\n\nAnalysts have attributed the rise to various factors, ranging from positive news surrounding bitcoin, to the tightening of capital controls in China. Bitcoin exchanges in China have been leading the price rise, sometimes trading at $10/bitcoin higher than other exchanges around the world.\n\nThe second coming of the bitcoin bubble... could make the previous all time highs in the digital currency seem like a low point - Zero Hedge blog\n\nObserving this trend, some analysts have suggested traders in China have driven up the price in their efforts to get around capital controls. Individuals cannot send the equivalent of more than $50,000 out of the country, according to Chinese law, leading to individuals looking for creative ways to bypass such controls.\n\nA recent blogpost on Zero Hedge by the pseudonymous Tyler Durden speculated: ""If a few hundred million Chinese decide that the time has come to use bitcoin as the capital controls bypassing currency of choice, and decide to invest even a tiny fraction of the $22tn in Chinese deposits in bitcoin (whose total market cap at last check was just over $3bn), sit back and watch as we witness the second coming of the bitcoin bubble, one which could make the previous all time highs in the digital currency seem like a low point.""\n\nCapital controls were also attributed to another bull run experienced by bitcoin in the summer of 2015, following the crisis in Greece that saw them strictly implemented. However, despite the correlation, some have claimed capital controls have had little influence on the price of bitcoin.\n\nThe CEOs of the three largest bitcoin exchanges in China – BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi – have all put the most recent price surge down to perception and speculation.

My second addition to Unicode, probably more useful than the group mark. https://t.co/ZOoBGGMmX3 — Ken Shirriff (@kenshirriff) November 3, 2015\n\n“The Bitcoin symbol is clearly popular enough that it should be in Unicode,” said Ken Shirriff, the author of the proposal, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “Getting the Bitcoin symbol into the Unicode standard was clearly the right thing for Unicode and the right thing for the Bitcoin community.”\n\nShirriff, who showed how one could mine for bitcoin with pencil and paper or with a 55 year old mainframe, felt that it was a huge oversight to not have the symbol part of Unicode. Since he had experience getting another symbol approved by Unicode, “I figured I needed to make this happen.”\n\nIn his proposal, he wrote, “There is substantial demand for [Bitcoin Symbol] to be added to Unicode, the user community supports adding the sign to Unicode and its addition would fill a significant gap in Unicode’s currency symbols. This proposal has the support of the Bitcoin Foundation as well as other Bitcoin organizations, companies and developers.”\n\nThis wasn’t his first time getting a new symbol added to Unicode. “I have been helping restore an IBM mainframe from the 1960s and it uses a strange character set (BCDIC). When I tried to write about the computer, I discovered that one symbol (the group mark symbol) was missing from Unicode. I figured I’d try to get that character added to Unicode, so I followed the steps that the power symbol people suggested, wrote up a proposal, and got the group mark symbol added to Unicode.”\n\nShirriff explained that part of the process was showing the symbol used in “running text. “People on reddit.com/r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org were very helpful and gave me a ton of examples, everything from web pages to research papers,” he said. Originally, the Bitcoin Foundation was pushing to get the symbol added to Unicode, but after a year, there had been little progress. Shirriff submitted the proposal at the beginning of the month and gained acceptance last night.\n\n“The Unicode 9.0 standard will come out in June, so the Bitcoin symbol should be in that version,” Shirriff said, though he cautioned that font support could take longer. Between the next bitcoin halving and this symbol, it seems like Summer of 2016 should be a very exciting time.\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

Stretch your wings and expand your understanding of life in startup land as I take you on a journey over to the Love Nest, a technology commune made mostly of bitcoin stars in Palo Alto, California.\n\nThe Love Nest is a little Burning Man, a little startup incubator. Friends, co-founders and what the house calls “tech nomads” gather to work and play in the house’s many rooms.\n\nYou’ll see people doing early morning yoga in the backyard or enjoying a late night hangout in the hot tub. There’s a tea room, a meditation room, bunk beds for those passing through, an emphasis on a vegan lifestyle and of course, an homage to Elon Musk in the bathroom.\n\nMany of the members of the house came from the infamous Startup Castle.

Check out the video above for a birds eye view into this quintessential Silicon Valley co-living space.', 'Does Worldpay support bitcoin and the blockchain?\n\nThe answer, according to senior vice president Chester Ritchie, depends on how you frame the question. Today, the £3.6bn payment processor isn’t doing anything internally with digital currency or the blockchain, he says, but like many payment services companies, it is interfacing with the industry in an effort to best serve merchant clients.\n\n""I don’t know how public it is,"" Ritchie tells CoinDesk at Money20/20 in Las Vegas. ""We do have partners that are doing something in their solution for bitcoin.""\n\nRitchie said that bitcoin startups such as BitPay and Coinbase already plug into Worldpay’s payment gateways, through which small and large businesses can accept a variety of payment methods, from credit cards to boleto payments to bitcoin.\n\nAs for his personal feelings toward the technology, Ritchie believes it ""remains to be seen"" whether bitcoin and the blockchain, the digital currency’s distributed ledger, can be leveraged to foster changes in Worldpay\'s business model or the wider payments industry.\n\nFor one, Ritchie acknowledges that the technology is becoming more widely thought of as a database or asset management innovation. Also, he believes that the industry has gradually moved toward these use cases as others, like payments, have proved problematic.\n\n""Is bitcoin the actual cryptocurrency that we think could impact payments?"" he asks. ""I\'m still skeptical because of the limited number of bitcoins. People would rather hang on to them rather than spend, so I’m not sure it’s the perfect fit for a currency.""\n\nIndustry observation\n\nStill, Ritchie is enthusiastic about the development space, even if it’s clear he views the technology as a bit of a novelty, or at least something that while entertaining, doesn’t exactly have the practical applications that would be needed to entice consumers and businesses today.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the company isn’t taking small steps though. Ritchie said Worldpay is headed toward implementing bitcoin as part of its gateway product SecureNet, though he\'s less clear about how exactly it will fit into the multi-channel commerce product.\n\nRitchie says Worldpay is also following developments closely through a partnership with the Georgia Institute of Technology, one of the small but growing number of US universities at the forefront of engaging their student bodies in bitcoin and blockchain work.\n\nThe university has so far allowed bitcoin to be used to top up student payment cards, and has its own branded bitcoin wallet. With its US headquarters in Atlanta, Ritchie says, Worldpay works closely with Georgia Tech’s incubator, where it sponsors hackathons that specialize in FinTech.\n\n“We have a sandbox where we have this technology and [students] can come up with solutions and we do that all around the incubator. That’s how we keep abreast on this,” he said, adding:\n\n”Large companies don’t innovate, small companies do.”\n\nAreas of disruption\n\nThough Ritchie is a bit bearish on bitcoin as a digital currency, he seems genuinely enamored by some of the big ideas in the space.\n\nHe talks excitedly, for example, about how the blockchain, which can be used to back shared ledgers among financial institutions, could decrease the cost of data centers used for payment processing and the management of such resources.\n\n“I think you’ll see that happen as the first step in the evolution, there could be some application of blockchain technology there,” he said.\n\nNotably, Worldpay is currently in the midst of expanding its data centre presence and migrating to facilities with increased capacity following its sale from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in 2010, according to its 2014 annual report.\n\nRitchie sees a potential opportunity for the blockchain with tokenization as well, suggesting blockchain tokens could be used as a stand-in for cardholder data in online card-not-present (CNP) transactions that currently increase checkout times at e-commerce websites.\n\nSuch an idea has also been suggested by security experts at conferences like Keynote 2015, where discussions centered on replacing today\'s tokens with those logged in shared ledgers.\n\nLevel playing field\n\nBy easing friction at the point of sale via the blockchain, Ritchie believes that the currency could come to wider acceptance alongside mobile payments, which he argues would then be more convenient for online consumers.\n\n“As retailers start to realize that, they’ll see that they don’t want to take anything but mobile payments,” he continued. “Then [other mobile options] will be on an equal footing with the Coinbase wallet. Whether you’re using PayPal or bitcoin, it’s all the same interaction.”\n\nRitchie implies that he doesn’t see this transition taking place soon, voicing his perception that most merchants, or even attendees at Money20/20, aren’t familiar with digital currency.\n\n“My perception is if you were to go around and ask ‘Have you bought a bitcoin?\' 99% of [Money20/20 attendees] will say no,” he said. “They haven’t figured it out, it seems complicated.”\n\nBut, that’s not to see they couldn’t be made aware of the technology.\n\nOver time, Ritchie can see blockchain-based systems “democratizing the financial system” and returning savings to merchants, who he feels pay too much for processing.\n\nRitchie concludes:\n\n“Payments are costing them 25% on their bottom numbers. So something like bitcoin, you don’t have a lot of these intermediaries, you can knock that down to a full percent.”\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

11/04/2015,"[""Because there is no central authority in Bitcoin — just the network of users keeping the records — there is no one to shut down accounts or demand personal information from Bitcoin users. Anyone can open an account and spend whatever Bitcoins they have as long as they have the password — or secret key — for their account.\n\nWhere do Bitcoins come from?\n\nFrom the moment the Bitcoin network started operating in 2009, a new bundle of Bitcoins — initially 50 — was released every 10 minutes or so, essentially for free, to one of the computers helping to update and maintain the blockchain ledger.\n\nComputers on the network take part in a sort of computational race to win these new coins, a process that came to be called Bitcoin mining. This giveaway provided an incentive for people to join and support the network with their computers. New coins will be released in this way until there are 21 million in the world (currently scheduled to happen sometime in 2140).\n\nOnce a user wins a new bundle of Bitcoins he or she can divide them up in any way — up to eight decimal points — and distribute them to anyone else with a Bitcoin address. Initially, people sent their Bitcoins to friends for free. Now, there are exchanges on which people offer to buy and sell Bitcoins and the price has swung wildly, reaching a high above $1,200 in intraday trading in late 2013.\n\nHow do you spend a Bitcoin?\n\nAnyone with a Bitcoin address, which is similar to an email address, can send and receive Bitcoins from anyone else with a Bitcoin address. Creating a Bitcoin address is free. Each address comes with a private key, a sophisticated password, that provides access to the coins in the address.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These companies will generally provide a Bitcoin address where money can be sent in order to complete a transaction. For the merchants, Bitcoin is preferable to credit-card payments because the merchant doesn’t have to pay a fee to a credit-card company. For consumers with credit cards, there is less of a clear advantage to using Bitcoin.\n\nWhy was Bitcoin so attractive to drug dealers?\n\nThe online drug bazaar known as the Silk Road offered a place for vendors to sell illegal goods, like heroin and cocaine, for Bitcoin.\n\nBecause Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world almost instantly, essentially for free, and because the payments can be sent without either side knowing the identity of the other, the system is an obvious choice for criminal activity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLaw enforcement officials have had some luck in tracking down Bitcoin users by looking at the I.P. address associated with a particular Bitcoin address, or by tracking down users on the blockchain ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. But this has proved to be a slow and relatively unsuccessful investigative method.\n\nThe operator of the Silk Road was eventually apprehended, not because his Bitcoin transactions were traced, but because he accidentally left his personal email address on a public website. The Silk Road was quickly replaced by imitators that are still flourishing today, offering drugs for Bitcoins.\n\nIs Bitcoin useful for things besides buying drugs?\n\nThe Silk Road helped demonstrate that Bitcoin could be used to send money quickly and cheaply around the world, without requiring a bank account.\n\nSlowly, there is increasing interest in using the Bitcoin network as a payment system for legitimate purposes. One often-discussed use is as way for immigrants to send remittances more cheaply to family members overseas who don’t have bank accounts or government identity cards. This has begun to catch on in places like Argentina, Indonesia and Africa.\n\nOther developers have looked to use Bitcoin for very small online payments, of a few cents, which are generally not possible in the existing financial system because of the minimum payments required for credit-card transactions.\n\nMore recently, financial institutions have grown interested in the idea that the Bitcoin network — and its ledger, the blockchain — allows for direct online transactions of all sorts, even those that don’t involve Bitcoins. Banks and financial firms are now looking at using the blockchain to allow for cheaper, faster stock and bond trades."", 'Izabella Kaminska, Dan McCrum and Robin Kwong NOVEMBER 4, 2015 34 The price of the cryptocurrency bitcoin surged on Wednesday to its highest in more than a year amid a wave of Chinese testimonials for a “social financial network” called MMM, which bears the hallmarks of a pyramid scheme. New members of MMM have to buy bitcoins to join the scheme, which is the brainchild of Sergey Mavrodi, a former Russian parliamentarian since jailed for fraud. The bitcoins are sent to other members of the network as “mutual aid”. Participants are promised a 30 per cent return per month, with bonuses for referrals or posting testimonials online. “Today, on October 31, I received 20 per cent interest and [a bonus] as a recommender, for a total of $7,750. I truly experienced the greatness of 3M and the sincerity of all the participants,” said Wen Qiang, one of the hundreds of MMM evangelists taking to YouTube in the past 24 hours. The bitcoin price surged by more than a fifth to above $490 on Wednesday, in the latest spike for the virtual currency created in 2008 by an anonymous mathematician. Championed by technologists and libertarians for its lack of centralised control, bitcoin lost three-quarters of its value in 2014 after the failure of MT Gox, a prominent exchange. Despite its fringe reputation bankers have in recent months expressed mounting interest in the underlying technology known as blockchain. The Big Read Technology: Banks seek key to blockchain Financial groups race to harness the power of the bitcoin infrastructure to slash costs Continue reading MMM has elements typical of pyramid schemes, characterised by rewards for recruitment and the promise of outsize profits. The flawed economics of such schemes all but doom them to collapse. MMM claims on its website that, as the scheme involves money transfers between private persons, it is entirely legal and breaks no laws. The price of bitcoin has more than doubled in the past month, rising by a fifth alone on Wednesday, to value the stock of existing bitcoins at more than $7bn. Mr Mavrodi was charged with fraud in Russia in 1997 after the collapse three years earlier of a pyramid scheme he operated, also called MMM. Tens of thousands of Russian citizens lost investments. A decade later he was found guilty of defrauding investors of Rbs110m ($1.7m). Podcast Fixing the eurozone, digital currencies and peer to peer lending Patrick Jenkins and Martin Arnold discuss the highlights of this week’s FT banking summit in London, including reflections by Yanis Varoufakis, former Greek finance minister, on how to fix the eurozone, a prediction on the future of digital currencies and what direction peer to peer lending will take next. The Chinese scheme has been running for at least a year, but began to attract significant attention in the last month as the price of bitcoin rose. On his website, Mr Mavrodi couples the investment case for MMM, which claims to operate in 60 countries, with a defiant stand against the established financial order. “This is a community of ordinary people, selflessly helping each other, a kind of the Global Fund of mutual aid,” his website reads. “The goal here is not the money. The goal is to destroy the world’s unjust financial system.” Copycat social financial networks describing themselves as platforms for “helping each other” have also emerged in China in recent months. In 2013, Indian police arrested six officials, including three Russians, for operating an Indian version of the scheme, known locally as the Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox India.

Dimon said despite the fact that bitcoin is getting some lip service in Washington, as politicians try to say they support Silicon Valley innovation, he thinks eventually there will be a crackdown.\n\n“Virtual currency, where it’s called a bitcoin vs. a U.S. dollar, that’s going to be stopped,” said Dimon. “No government will ever support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesn’t have the same controls. It’s not going to happen.”\n\nJust the same, Dimon said JPMorgan had established a study group to examine the blockchain technology used to record bitcoin transactions.\n\n“Blockchain is like any other technology,” said Dimon. “If it is cheaper, effective, works, and secure, then we are going to use it.”\n\nRight now, the verdict on blockchain tech is mixed, Dimon said. He added that the loan market could be a good candidate for blockchain because there is a lot of paperwork involved in that line of business and that transactions can take 20 days to close. But he said in other areas of financial markets, like trading stocks, the block chain probably wouldn’t offer significant improvement.\n\nThat said, Dimon made it clear that bitcoin, or any other virtual currency, would never be a major competitor to the U.S. dollar. “The technology will be used, and it could be used to transport currency, but it will be dollars, not bitcoins.”', 'A smoke shop in Atlanta, Georgia, was robbed of its bitcoin ATM during a brazen heist this week.\n\nAccording to a report provided to CoinDesk by the Atlanta Police Department, the Village Smoke Shop on Juniper Street had its Lamassu bitcoin ATM stolen at approximately 10:45 PM EDT on Tuesday night.\n\nVideo surveillance of the incident was published earlier today.\n\nThe incident report notes:\n\n""When the suspects were confronted by employees, one of the suspects brandished a handgun and fired one into the floor of the business before fleeing with the machine. The suspects were observed entering a late 1980s model red Chevrolet Caviler [sic] with an unknown license plate.”\n\nThe video depicts an initial struggle to remove the ATM, which store manager Amanda McCollum says was bolted down to a table. The firearm’s discharge sparked a moment of panic in the store, as shown in the video.\n\nMcCollum – who confronted the robbers – said that she initially thought they were reacting to a problem with the machine itself. After the round was fired, McCollum said, those involved fled out and behind the building with the ATM, where a getaway vehicle was waiting. The Atlanta police incident report notes that two additional suspects were waiting in the car.\n\n“[He] shoots the floor, and with the machine walks around back of the shop to the getaway vehicle that was parked behind our back alley and drives off with it,” she told CoinDesk.\n\nThose behind the incident may have been planning the heist for some time. According to McCollum, two individuals came to the store last week and asked questions about the bitcoin ATM. The individuals later stole a wallet from the store’s office.\n\nA representative for the Atlanta Police Department said that so far, there are no indications as to who was behind the robbery.\n\n“Currently there are no leads in this case,” the department said in an email.\n\nA recording of the incident can be viewed below:\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The organization was not immediately available for comment when reached.\n\nShirriff’s 14-page proposal was the second to be considered by the Unicode Committee, and brings to a close a process that began in fits and starts as far back as 2011.\n\nSubmitted in March of that year, the first proposal, entered by Sander van Galoven of the Netherlands, was ultimately turned down by the committee.\n\nAccording to committee minutes published at the time, the 2011 proposal was rejected on the grounds ""that the use of the bitcoin symbol in (running) text"" had not been demonstrated and because Bitcoin.org was using the symbol as a logo.\n\nIn 2014, the Bitcoin Foundation began putting together a working group to develop a Unicode proposal, though no submission developed as a result of that process. The Foundation would later endorse Shirriff’s proposal.\n\nIn an interview with CoinDesk, Shirriff said that he saw a need for a submission that drew from an understanding of how exactly the Unicode Consortium goes about approving proposals, explaining:\n\n""It seemed that nobody else in the bitcoin community really understood the Unicode process and because I had gone through it earlier with a totally unrelated character, I had some familiarity with how it worked. So I decided I should just do it myself.”\n\nHe cited contributions from volunteers on the bitcoin subreddit as well as the Bitcoin Talk forum for providing sufficient evidence to back the proposal, citing the need to establish its common use as a text icon. He also pointed to past experience with the Unicode Committee in getting a symbol from an obscure character set approved as a result of restoration work on a 1960s IBM mainframe.\n\nFrom here, the approved proposal is set to be enshrined in a future Unicode standard release, meaning that eventually the symbol can be used on almost any computer.\n\nThe Consortium’s latest version, Unicode 9, is scheduled to be published sometime next year.\n\nBitcoin symbol image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

And some people want to know how their investment in bitcoin is doing, too. Well, enough of them for USAA to creep into the world of cryptocurrency by partnering with a bitcoin wallet provider.\n\nThe San Antonio bank has integrated Coinbase\'s application program interface, which lets customers monitor their Coinbase wallet balances when they log into their bank accounts, the companies announced late Tuesday.\n\n""Our highly mobile member base is looking at new innovations,"" said Darrius Jones, assistant vice president of enterprise innovation for USAA, in an interview on Wednesday. ""Our military members move quite a bit compared to other consumers. What better than being able to look at your various household account balances in a single place?""\n\nPrevailing wisdom has written off the cryptocurrency as toxic for regulated institutions. The politically correct move has been for banks to experiment with distributed ledgers and databases inspired by bitcoin\'s blockchain while disowning the currency. The tide, however, seems to have changed a bit recently for bitcoin, as several financial companies have announced bitcoin investments and other partnerships. The USAA-Coinbase announcement also comes amid a rally in the price of bitcoin, which has surged 48% since Oct. 4 to $465, after lolling around $200 for most of this year.\n\n""There have been a lot of banks interested publicly in blockchain technology but it\'s not clear what they mean by that,"" said Nick Tomaino, business development manager at Coinbase. ""Most are talking about private blockchains versus bitcoin technology and none have shipped anything. This is a bank actually talking about bitcoin and is shipping something.""\n\nThe bank participated in Coinbase\'s $75 million funding round early this year and has since been in talks with the USAA corporate development and innovation teams.\n\nJones said he sees that bundling of nonbank financial services into the digital banking platforms as a differentiator between USAA and other banks.\n\nIt is then perhaps unsurprising that USAA is the bank to bring bitcoin into the fold of its retail products. USAA has established itself as one of the more proactive U.S. banks in the innovation game and a competitor in the personal-financial-management space. It was first to offer online and mobile check deposits — that was in 2011. Now, it\'s building on the financial health theme, which FitBit-for-money-type companies such as Moven and Simple are helping grow, by providing financial readiness scores to its customers through online and mobile portals.\n\nIntegrating a way to view cryptocurrency balances is a ""logical evolution in digital transactions,"" said Ghela Boskovich, director of global business development for banking software company Zafin. ""Cryptocurrency is becoming better understood and we are no longer as married to fiat currencies,"" Boskovich said. ""USAA is recognizing that there is a demand there. It is still a limited interest, but they\'ve recognized it and are taking a practical business step to catch the first part of the wave.""\n\nFor now, members can only view their bitcoin balance on USAA\'s channels. Whether USAA will allow its customers to exchange currency or transact in bitcoin will depend on the results of the pilot, which began on Monday and will run for about 90 days.\n\n""You can imagine some other things they might be able to do on USAA.com,"" Tomaino said.\n\nNeither Coinbase nor USAA could disclose the figures, but Tomaino said the overlap between their customers is ""really high.""\n\n""We kind of scratched our heads together and thought: what makes the most sense for them to experiment with bitcoin?"" Tomaino said.\n\nIn their research, the companies said that there was both qualitative and quantitative data that showed USAA members were interested in being able to monitor their bitcoin wallet through their primary USAA banking channels. Given their prowess in digital innovation, perhaps their customers have come to expect the bank to be an early adopter, too.\n\n""We\'re focused on having that new technology they\'re more able to adapt or willing to try,"" Jones said.\n\nBrad Smith, managing director at Cornerstone Advisors, said the announcement mainly reinforces USAA\'s brand of being user-centric. In other words, it is good marketing, but may not result in much activity.\n\n""It expands awareness of a mobile wallet and mobile banking app, expands awareness of a company they just invested in and allows them to see how many customers are actually using this feature.""\n\nAccount aggregation has been around for a long time, he said, but realistically, many that were initially excited about that kind of feature would say that initiative has failed; that there hasn\'t been widespread consumer adoption of account aggregation, at least in its first and second iterations.\n\n""This is a niche within a niche within a niche,"" he said.\n\nStill, he praised USAA as an early adopter and leader in innovation.\n\n""A whole lot of traditional banks watch what USAA does because most of their bets have been right,"" he said. ""They\'re a pretty good bellwether for technology-based convenience goods and services.""\n\nRobert Barba contributed to this report.', 'Coinbase announced Tuesday on its blog that the United Services Automobile Association (USAA) has partnered with Coinbase to bring bitcoin to its 11 million members.\n\nAccording to the blog post, the USAA now allows a select group of its members to view their bitcoin balance on USAA.com and the USAA Mobile App as part of a pilot that was rolled out to its employees in September.\n\nFounded in 1922 by a group of U.S. Army officers that were unable to get auto-insurance because they were deemed to be high-risk by traditional financial service providers, the USAA provides insurance, banking, investments, retirement products, and advice to 11.2 million current and former members of the U.S. military and their families.\n\nCoinbase said in the blog post that bitcoin was created also to serve the needs of people that traditional financial services don’t sufficiently serve, and that the partnership is another small step in their journey to help bring bitcoin to more people in the U.S.\n\n“We’ve enjoyed working with the USAA team so far and look forward to collaborating with them more in the future,” said the blog post.\n\n“If you are interested in learning more about the pilot, please visit here.”\n\nImage credits:\n\nCoinbase logo – Courtesy of Coinbase\n\nUSAA building photo – Via USAA’s media kit', 'Bitcoin price printed a high of $503 earlier today on Bitstamp, then a price correction wave pulled it down to $470 , at the time of writing of this article. The historical bullish rally that we witnessed during the past few days will slow down during the next couple of days, as the price seems to have hinged around the $500 level to ignite a temporary reversal of this bullish wave.\n\nBollinger Bands Signaling Price Correction Attempts:\n\nLet’s examine the 1 hour (BTC/USD) charts from Bitstamp (look at the below chart) ; plot the “Bollinger Bands” volatility indicator and extend the Fibonacci retracement levels we plotted on our analysis on the 2nd of November:\n\nBitcoin price overshot above the 61.8% Fib retracement level at $478, before the uptrend started reversing and price dropped down to print a low of $436.5 a few hours ago. Accordingly, the $478 level is a significant resistance level that is preventing further advancement of the bullish wave.\n\nThe Bollinger Bands can be used as a tool that signals minor downwards price correction waves, as we can see on the below chart that once the price rose above the upper band, the trend was reversed and bitcoin price started dropping. This also happened yesterday when the price touched the 50% Fib retracement level and rose above the upper Bollinger band, a downwards price correction wave was ignited to pull the price back down below the upper band.\n\nBearish reversal on 4 Hourly Charts:\n\nBy studying the 4 hour (BTC/USD) charts from Bitstamp (look at the below chart) and plotting the 20, 50 and 100 period EMAs, we can conclude the following:\n\nWe can spot a “Bearish engulfing” pattern (look at the 2 candlesticks inside the grey ellipse on the below chart). The bearish red candle totally engulfs the bullish greenish candle which signaled a reversal of the uptrend throwing the price down below $340 earlier today.\n\nThe price is still above the 20, 50 and 100 period EMAs which means that generally speaking, the bullish wave can continue to push the price to higher level after a brief downside price correction attempt, which can take the price down to test the support level at $353.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBitcoin price exceeded $500 earlier today, before a downside price correction pulled the price to a low of $436.5.

This is generally considered great news, because it means that Bitcoin's potential has improved drastically. In particular, the patch that was proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd allows for the proper establishment of payment channels. This means that Bitcoin users will be able to transact cheaper, faster, and at a higher volume than usual, while maintaining all of the advantages as offered by the blockchain.\n\nWhat is CheckLockTimeVerify?\n\nThe CLTV concept is fairly simple. Essentially, it allows users to create a bitcoin transaction of which the transaction outputs are spendable only at some point in the future. As such, the bitcoin sent in that transaction are time-locked until either a specified date, or until a certain number of blocks has been mined.\n\nThis in itself is a neat addition that can be used for various purposes. It would be easy, for example, for a dad to grant his son bitcoin as a present, but which the son could use only when he turns 18. Or it could perhaps be used to pay rent on a specific date.\n\nThese sorts of applications are relatively straightforward. But CLTV gets really interesting when combined with additional Bitcoin tricks.\n\nWhat are payment channels?\n\nAs perhaps its most important function, CLTV is necessary for properly functional payment channels. These channels are effectively a series of “off-chain” transactions, that benefit from all the security of typical on-chain transactions, and with some added benefits.\n\nLets say that Bob streams a video, which costs one satoshi per second to watch, and Alice wants to watch that video. It would not be a great idea to use regular bitcoin transactions worth a satoshi for each individual second streamed, since a typical transaction fee costs more than one satoshi, and transactions confirm only once every 10 minutes on average. On top of that, the Bitcoin network is currently limited to a handful of transactions per second, which means that Alice's transactions would be a huge burden on the system. Moreover, only a handful of people could watch Bob's stream at the same time before the whole Bitcoin network clogged up.\n\nTherefore, Alice and Bob decide to open a payment channel instead. Before she starts watching the video, Alice sends – say – one bitcoin to a multi-signature address. And Alice and Bob each control one of two keys required to send funds from that address.\n\nNow, Alice wants to start watching the video. She signs a transaction from the multisig address, in which she sends 99,999,999 satoshi's to herself, and one satoshi to Bob. Bob could now sign this transaction at any time, and claim the satoshi attributed to him. Therefore, he allows Alice to watch one second of his stream.\n\nHowever, and importantly, Bob doesn't actually claim his satoshi right away, because he believes Alice will probably want to watch longer than one second. And here comes the trick: Alice signs a new transaction from the same multisig address, this time sending herself 99,999,998 satoshi's, and sending Bob 2 satoshi's. Once again, Bob could sign this transaction at any time, and claim the two satoshi's attributed to him. But he could not sign and broadcast both transactions, as that would constitute a double spend! Therefore, he would have to choose. And unless Bob is keen on losing money, he would always sign the biggest transaction. If he does, he will effectively receive one satoshi per second – even though he didn't actually receive a new transaction worth a single satoshi every second.\n\nThis process can be repeated as long as Bob doesn't sign his part of the transactions. So for every second that Alice watches the video, Bob can claim an additional satoshi, with no need to wait for confirmations on the blockchain. And since only one transaction – the last one for Bob to claim – is actually recorded on the blockchain, Alice and Bob do not clog up the Bitcoin network with micro-transactions, and they need to pay only a single mining fee.\n\nSo why do payment channels require CLTV?\n\nThere is one problem. What if, for some unforeseeable reason, Bob cannot or will not transmit the transaction at all? Perhaps because he falls of a cliff, or he loses his private key, or maybe he holds Alice's bitcoin ransom and demands a bigger cut, or some other reason. In that case, Alice will have lost her bitcoin, even if she didn't watch Bob's video stream long enough for it to be worth a bitcoin.\n\nThat's where CLTV comes in.\n\nAlice can add CLTV to the initial bitcoin transaction, using it to send the whole bitcoin back to her own address. This transaction is validated – for example – one day later, but only if Alice and Bob didn't sign the multi-signature transaction before that time. Now, if Bob doesn't sign the transaction at all for whatever reason, Alice can sign it by herself and is guaranteed to get her money back.\n\nWorst case scenario for Alice is that she would need to wait a day. She might be a bit annoyed, but she will not lose any money. As such, the whole process has been made completely trustless.\n\nActivation\n\nOn a final note, it should be mentioned that the CLTV concept is actually not new at all; it has existed in Bitcoin since the early days. With the previous incarnation of the time-locked concept, however, locked transactions were not actually included in the blockchain until a certain point in time. Rather, they were kept by Alice and (more importantly) Bob, to transmit over the Bitcoin network once the time-lock expired.\n\nBy actually baking it into the protocol as CLTV does, the payment channel process is better streamlined and more robust. Perhaps most importantly, it disables payment channel failures caused by transaction malleability .\n\nAlthough CLTV is officially merged into Bitcoin Core now, it's not quite in use yet. First, it will be rolled out with the latest version of Bitcoin Core: 0.12. This is scheduled for early 2016. Alternatively, CLTV might be implemented in an update to Bitcoin Core 0.11, in which case CLTV will be available at an earlier (so-far unspecified) date.\n\nAfter that, a super-majority of Bitcoin miners – 75 percent of hashing power – will need to signify they are ready and prepared to allow CLTV. This seems unlikely to cause much trouble, as there is no real opposition to the patch.\n\nThanks to Blocktrail CTO Ruben de Vries and Bitonic CEO Jouke Hofman for added feedback."", ""During the price gains over the last several weeks, the focus has been on the big bitcoin exchanges, particularly the Chinese exchanges that are trading at a premium to U.S. exchanges.

Instead of one company being in charge of a central database, everyone who sets up a node on the network has a copy of it. Imagine a bank with a database of deposits and withdrawals. As a customer, you have to trust that the bank is tracking your funds correctly. Now imagine instead that a large network of customers is tracking all withdrawals and deposits, constantly verifying against each other\'s records in order to maintain the integrity of the ledger. This is how the digital currency Bitcoin works.\n\nNow, imagine that instead of withdrawals and deposits, it\'s votes.\n\nAdvocates say blockchain-based elections are transparent and secure. They\'ve been tested by the Liberal Alliance in Denmark and the European Pirate Party. And now, Blockchain Technologies Corp. is developing an actual voting machine that will record votes using a blockchain.\n\n""We\'re going to embarrass Diebold""\n\nHere\'s how it works. Voters register as they normally do. Come election day, they fill out a ballot that looks roughly like a traditional election ballot. This ballot, however, features three small QR codes sit at the bottom: one representing a blockchain address, which is like a unique cryptographic number; one representing the ballot ID; and one for the election ID.\n\nAs the votes are scanned into the machine, each ""vote unit"" is transferred to the appropriate candidate. Each candidate has a unique address, also called a wallet, which is how the machine knows where to send the votes.\n\nYou can look up the candidate\'s address to see how many votes each candidate has, using a tool called a blockchain explorer that pulls up the information about each section of the ledger.\n\nThe Blockchain Technologies Corp. team showed me a prototype; it looks like a fax machine connected to a screen. The machine stays disconnected from the internet to keep malicious actors from manipulating the votes as they are coming in, and burns the ballots to a DVD before it\'s connected to the internet. It will also be encased in a chassis and ""impervious to electromagnetic funny business,"" one developer told me.\n\nThe specifics of how to configure the blockchain will be up to whoever is putting on the election. It\'s possible to use the same blockchain Bitcoin uses. Blockchain Technologies Corp. has developed a new blockchain called VoteUnit that works much the same way, but without requiring transaction fees for each transfer the way Bitcoin does.\n\nHowever, there\'s only so much that blockchain technology can do. ""Blockchain technology can provide untamperable audit trails, but it doesn\'t solve the hard problem that erroneous or malicious software in the voting machine may cast votes other than how the voter intended, and the voter will never be able to know,"" explains Jeremy Epstein, senior computer scientist at SRI International who actively warned about the security of Virginia\'s machines.\n\nYoung admitted as much. ""There is no such thing as an unhackable system,"" he said. But his team does implement several safeguards.\n\nA prototype of the blockchain voting machine. Photo: Blockchain Technologies Corp.\n\n""The open source code combined with the paper, DVD, and blockchain audit trails may not completely eliminate fraud in the voting process, but it will be a step in the right direction. Especially compared to the 10-15 year old, buggy electronic voting machines we use today,"" Young said.\n\nThere is more than one problem with current voting machines—Steve Borelli, software developer at the company, pointed to those manufactured by the banking and security company Diebold. One is that they use proprietary software that outsiders can\'t inspect. Blockchain Technologies Corp plans to open source its voting machine software. ""Anyone who knows Python can look at every nook and cranny of the code,"" Borelli explained. ""Diebold can\'t do that.""\n\nThe machines will also use widely-available commodity hardware, so that broken parts can be replaced easily. The hardware for some voting machines is notoriously difficult to replace when the machines have been discontinued.\n\nOne especially important voting machine design decision, according to the developers, is to include a paper trail. Hacking may go undetected if there isn\'t a paper trail for voters to look at and verify that the votes counted in the voting machine database are correct, and haven\'t been manipulated, as was one significant problem with voting machines that were finally pulled from Virginia\'s elections over the summer. Say if the blockchain data doesn\'t match up to the data on the DVD, whether because of error or outside manipulation, the paper ballots can be used for a recount.\n\nFurthermore, if you enter a vote into an electronic touch screen first, and then it spits out a result, then it\'s vulnerable to manipulation before it reaches physical paper form, Borelli explained.\n\nThe team expects to complete the machine before the 2016 election, although they\'re not sure whether states will pick up the machine. Until then, they are in talks with unions. They recently merged with GAHC, a company with a subsidiary Global Election Services, which holds more than 4,000 labor union elections a year. Young expects it to be a ""great test bed.""\n\nConsidering the depressingly icky state of voting machines in the US today, the team at Blockchain Technologies Corp. believes that the machine is an improved machine for states that are strapped for cash, even if it\'s still an imperfect alternative.\n\n""We are going to embarrass Diebold,"" Borelli said.', 'Christine Lagarde, chief of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and finance minister under former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, said this week that banks don’t have much to fear from bitcoin or the blockchain.\n\nThe Financial Times reported today that, while speaking at a conference in New York City, Lagarde said attendees worried that the banking industry could be altered or rendered obsolete by the blockchain should ""pause for a second"".\n\n""Many of you have heard about not only bitcoins but blockchains and that unbelievable technology that underlies the bitcoins of this world at the moment, and how incredibly convenient it will be to actually generate trust and identify players and whatever pseudo they decide to use,"" she said, according to FT. ""And many of you in the industry are actually worried that those technologies are going to massively disrupt the current industry.""\n\n""Pause for a second,"" she is said to have told the bankers, continuing:\n\n""If those new technologies, and as long as those new technologies are going to abuse, take advantage of, the yield for anonymity, I think the banking industry has quite a few good days ahead of it as long as it takes ownership of those issues of capital and culture in order to actually restore the trust without which you see no trade, no transaction, no business can take place.”\n\nAccording to FT, Lagarde’s comments referenced a report by FT Alphaville’s Izabella Kaminska on the connection between the recent rise in the price of bitcoin and a suspected Ponzi scheme operating in Asia.\n\nLagarde has run the IMF since 2011, when she took over from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, another former French finance minister who resigned from the IMF in the wake of sexual assault allegations and an arrest in New York City.\n\nPrior to serving as finance minister, Lagarde ran other French ministries, including the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nImage credit: Gil C / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", ""With the recent spike in bitcoin's exchange rate, there has been a surge in transaction volume on the Bitcoin network, too. And while most in the Bitcoin community welcome the significant uptrend, some have also expressed concern . This might be the first “Bitcoin boom” to be influenced by the 1 megabyte maximum block size, which limits the number of possible transactions on the network to about three per second.\n\nBitcoin XT developer Mike Hearn, in particular, predicted in May of this year that a new hype-cycle could lead to full blocks, rising fees, increased confirmation times, a bulging memory pool, nodes dropping of the network, more attempted double spends, and ultimately, users leaving Bitcoin for good.\n\nSo how are we doing so far?\n\nAre blocks filling up?\n\nYes.\n\nBlocks are filling up, or at least some of them are. The number of transactions on the Bitcoin network has roughly doubled over the past weeks, which has resulted in an average block size of about 700 kilobytes (0.7 megabyte). That is still below the maximum of 1 megabyte, but that is to be expected; for various reasons some miners produce some of their blocks well below the maximum capacity.\n\nAre fees rising?\n\nYes and no.\n\nThe average transaction fee has been relatively stable over the past weeks. However, this is mostly because users (or their wallets) refrain from paying a higher fee, even though that would shorten the time for their transaction to confirm.\n\nUnfortunately, statistics on the average fee required to have a transaction confirmed in the very next block are currently unavailable. But over the past week the average fee required to have a transaction included in the next two blocks has increased from 140 bits to about 200 bits.\n\nAre confirmation times increasing?\n\nYes.\n\nAverage confirmation times have increased quite a bit. Transactions were previously included in blocks within some 12 minutes on average. At the height of the price spike, transactions took an average of about 30 minutes to confirm.\n\n(Of course, as explained above, users who want to be relatively sure their transaction is included in the next block can opt to pay a higher fee.)\n\nIs the memory pool building up?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, not to problematic levels, that is. Of course, the memory pool – consisting of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in a block – is building up in between blocks. That is how Bitcoin is designed, and happens regardless of how full blocks are.\n\nBut so far, the memory pool has not been building up to unusual levels, and has been much larger in the past.\n\nAre nodes dropping of the network?\n\nNo.\n\nOn average, there are no nodes dropping of the network. Over the past week, the number of full nodes has been stable at around 5,500. And this number has even risen a bit over the past couple of days.\n\nAre double spends increasing?\n\nUnknown.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no reliable statistics available concerning the amount of attempted double spends by users who believe their transactions take too long to confirm. The only statistics that come close concern the number of failed transactions . These appear to be very high, but that is mainly because of the ongoing transaction malleability attack . As such, the statistics on actual double spends are skewed, and cannot be trusted.\n\nAre users leaving?\n\nProbably not.\n\nWhile it is practically impossible to know for sure whether some users are disappointed in Bitcoin's performance and leave completely, it seems unlikely for now.\n\nSave for a slight increase of confirmation times (or required fees), Bitcoin is performing quite well. Moreover, volume on exchanges is huge and, based on the increased exchange rate, it seems fair to assume that more new users want to get in rather than out.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite some alarming forum posts, tweets and other reports, the spike in bitcoin's exchange rate has so far not caused any serious capacity problems for the Bitcoin network.\n\nOf course, this does not disprove Hearn's theory, and does not in itself mean there is no reason for concern. If bitcoin's surge maintains, and if volume on the network continues to grow, this might still lead to complications at a later stage.\n\nBut so far, all is well on Bitcoin's blockchain.\n\nThanks to\n\nBlocktrail\n\nCTO Ruben de Vries for providing additional statistics."", 'Bitcoin. This may be something you wish you knew more about. You may have heard about trading Bitcoin and wondered how you could do it. It may seem unreal since it does not involve anything tangible.\n\nA visit to the Bitcoin web page informs the visitor, “Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money.” It further notifies the public, “Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.”\n\nBitcoin was invented in 2008. In early 2010, each Bitcoin was worth only $0.04. Just last week, on October 29, it was reported that Bitcoin was trading above $314, near the highest since December 2014. This rise in price was thought to be related to the Fed statement that had been released the day before, but also strongly tied to China easing which appears to go straight to Bitcoin. (See Bitcoin Soars Near Highest Since 2014 As China Outflows Accelerate)\n\nToday, CNBC reported Bitcoin trading at more than $410, a price jump of more than 70 percent in one month. According to an article on Zero Hedge, after the price jump, there was a massive sell off causing the digital currency to drop by nearly $50. This article attributes the volatility to the influx of new Chinese buyers who have caused this surge “in order to bypass China’s tightened capital controls.”\n\nAs you can see from the news reports above, Bitcoin can be insanely volatile. It can move 40 percent in one day. In checking current charts, Bitcoin has rebounded and is currently trading around $470.\n\nIn order to illustrate different ways Bitcoin can be traded, let’s look at how Bitcoin was trading on October 29. Look at the chart below.\n\nTo view a larger image, click HERE.\n\nThis is a Nadex Bitcoin daily chart, which can be accessed from their trading platform. You can see that Bitcoin has surged up through 314. There was some long-term resistance at 314. The market had tested that level in January, February, June and July before breaking through on October 29. When this happens, you can usually expect that it will meet a little more resistance and then pullback.\n\nThere are a couple of different ways you can play this. You could expect it to expire below the high of the day at 319. If so, you could check out available strikes that you could sell. When you check for a contract, sometimes there may not be many contracts left, because of the surge in the market. Nadex offers bitcoin binary options with 21 strike prices for the 3:00 PM ET daily expiration, except on Fridays, which lists 15 strike levels. The interval width between each strike level is 1.5.\n\nThe next image shows the different strike prices that were available at the time. When you look for the sell strike, you see that there is a 315.5 available for around $21. Choosing this trade would allow you to make a little bit of premium if you wanted to go short.\n\nTo view a larger image, click HERE.\n\nIf you believe the market will stay above 314, you can look at buying a contract. Again, checking the strike prices, there is one available at 314 for about 65, with the profit potential of $35.\n\nFor October 29, it appears that 314 is the magic number, the resistance level right now. By knowing this information, you can have a better understanding of the expectations of the market. Here is another image taken a short time after the other image, which showed strike prices. You may notice that both the buy and sell prices have increased as has the indicative index.\n\nTo view a larger image, click HERE.\n\nHowever, for this example, with the strike 314 at 70.75, it is $0.76 above the strike.

The next green bars are other traders coming in thinking there is a big rally. Take note here, all of a sudden at the short red bar, they start getting rid of their trades. Next, they dump off the rest and everybody bails. This is how it usually goes in trading. This is how you learn to follow the sharks without getting eaten by them and staying out of their way. The sharks will go in, pump up the market and then sell it off. You get your one warning shot, the short red bar, and then BAM!

11/06/2015,"['The crypto currency is not attached to any single country. It exists at low exchange rates for the entire world and is not manipulated and controlled by central banks, says Jeffrey Tucker from the Foundation for Economic Education.\n\nThe bitcoin exchange rate surged to above $490 on November 4 - its high point of the last year. This spike is supposedly linked to the rising popularity of ""financial social network"" MMM created by entrepreneur Sergei Mavrodi in China.\n\nRT sat down with Tucker to discuss this recent surge of interest in the currency.\n\nRT: What do you think about the volatility of bitcoin market?\n\nJeffrey Tucker: The bitcoin space is still extremely volatile because there aren’t many people involved in it. A handful of players can make a huge difference in the price up and down. This is what you see at the beginning of any new technology – it is not surprising at all. Investors need to be very wary.\n\nThe tragedy of all of this is that people get interested in bitcoin when it is going up and they start buying, and then they ride it all the way down. And then they lose interest when it is low when they should be buying. So, they get robbed in either direction – this is typical of any new technology, actually. There are something like several thousand scams in the bitcoin space and they have been there for about three years. Investors need to be extremely wary of them.\n\nBitcoin will be 6th biggest reserve currency by 2030 – study https://t.co/HIaYXRCjCVpic.twitter.com/hC8Mk1aKoq — RT (@RT_com) November 4, 2015\n\nRT: How is the price of bitcoin going to be affected by this down the line? Is it likely to remain very volatile or is it going to stabilize, in your opinion?\n\nJT: Against the volatility – absolutely not. That is part of bitcoin. We are still in a price-discovery phase and we probably always will be. We have to remember that bitcoin has just experienced its seventh birthday; for the first probably four- and-half to five years nobody even cared about bitcoin. So, we are still very early on in the space. Regular investors haven’t cared anything about bitcoin until relatively recently.\n\nIt is only been in 2015 where we’re starting to see the big banks, credit card companies and other big players on the market starting to get interested at all in block chain technology. My own feeling is that it has been undervalued for about a year. So, the recent rise didn’t surprise me. But, I must tell you that yesterday I saw that it was happening too fast – this is not the way financial assets should increase, it shouldn’t be so dramatic and so quickly.\n\nSo, when you see this kind of thing happening the best thing to do is to stay out of the market, wait it out, see where the price settles and then think about buying.\n\nI got to tell you, the last 24 hours to 48 hours I’ve received probably 150 messages from people asking me: “How can I buy bitcoin?” You see how this happens – people get interested because the price is going up, and then they want to buy. It’s the worst time to buy.\n\nThis is what happens and then people get interested for the first time – this is why the ‘smart money’ wins and the ‘dumb money’ loses. People hear about bitcoin in the news and they go: “I should buy”. And if it keeps going up which it may or may not, this is what happens, people get interested in that and they buy it at the peak of markets, and then they ride it all the way down and sell it at the bottom. Smart investors wait until assets are out of the news. And then get interested in them. When people are not talking about them. Dumb investors wait until they’re being covered by the financial press and then jump in at the market. This is my third bitcoin bubble, so I know something about the subject.\n\nRT: What are the advantages of bitcoin on the market and what should we expect of it in the future?\n\nJT: It is already bigger than many currencies in the world. I’m very bullish on bitcoin generally over the long-term, I would say, the next five to ten years. And one reason is that it is a global currency, it is not attached to a single nation state. It exists for the entire world and it is not manipulated and controlled by central banks. That I think is a very good thing for many countries in the world – it allows Chinese to trade with Russians, Russians to trade with Americans, Americans to trade with Brazilians instantaneously at very low fees that you almost don’t even notice. You can’t do that with national money.\n\nAlmost everybody - other than Americans - is tired of the dollar standard for the world. It doesn’t make any sense that one national currency would be the primarily liquid asset for the entire world. It gives the US really unmerited economic, political and military power. So, dollar imperialism is an unjust system and we need some replacement – and nobody has been able to come up with another replacement.\n\nBitcoin is nowhere near competing with the dollar. However, at some point, within the five or ten years it could actually become a serious player in the world currency exchange market.\n\nLISTEN MORE:', 'Bitcoin-powered social media platform ZapChain has raised $350,000 in seed funding and is launching a new digital goods initiative in partnership with Coinbase today.\n\nThe money was raised from venture capitalist and Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) partner Tim Draper, Boost VC founder and CEO Adam Draper and the Boost Bitcoin Fund.\n\nAccording to ZapChain chief operating officer Dan Cawrey, the funds are being used to expand its ranks of content creators and digital community members.\n\n""I invested in ZapChain because the company is giving bitcoin one of its highest and best uses,"" Tim Draper said in a statement.

In October, American Express invested in Abra, a bitcoin app focused on remittances, and MasterCard invested in the Digital Currency Group, which includes a portfolio of virtual currency companies overseen by Barry Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket.\n\nIt was MasterCard’s (MA) first investment in any kind of digital currency business, and a MasterCard spokesperson says the company’s thinking is that DCG is “well placed to assess technologies in the digital currency and Blockchain spaces.” As for Visa (V), executive VP of innovation Jim McCarthy tells Fortune, “We have been evaluating blockchain technology for some time, seeing its potential to create new ways to transfer non-traditional currencies, such as gift cards or loyalty points.”\n\nLook closely at those statements. MasterCard and Visa are being careful to stress the blockchain, rather than bitcoin itself. Indeed, that has become the popular phrasing from those outside of virtual currency to justify their interest. Even some within virtual currency happily disparage bitcoin while praising the blockchain, like Anthony Watson, a former CIO of Barclays and Nike who is now CEO of Uphold: “I’ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years. The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology.” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, even though his bank has launched a study group to look into blockchain technology, said this week that he expects bitcoin will be shut down by the government.\n\nAs Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees writes in a recent blog post, the blockchain “is so hot right now” while bitcoin “has been left by the wayside, ignored like an embarrassing relative at a family gathering.” Voorhees continues: “Some of us have been amused by this development, but many confounded. Why is everyone talking about the blockchain, and ignoring its central fuel, Bitcoin proper?”\n\nThe answer is that bitcoin, the currency, comes loaded with all manner of negative connotations: it has been used for crime; some of its earliest innovators are now in prison; and, above all else, the currency itself remains volatile. Just look at the past month: the price of bitcoin has gone from $244 all the way up to nearly $500 (some foreign exchanges had it hitting $500) and has sunk back to $385 at the time of writing.\n\nOverall, the bitcoin industry is still the subject of far more negative headlines than positive ones. (See: The five stages of bitcoin understanding.) This is why incumbent payment giants like MasterCard and Visa are careful to emphasize the currency’s underlying technology as the source of their interest. Bitcoin, the currency, appears to make them nervous.\n\nTheir reticence was clear in remarks that MasterCard CEO Ajay Banga made to Fortune last year for a story about the company’s efforts to ramp up technology. At one point, the subject of bitcoin came up. Banga said:\n\n“My view of bitcoin is that the concept of a digital or a virtual currency is interesting—if I could figure out what it does for everybody. If all it does is allow you to anonymize your money movements, I’m not so hot about that. Because that to me starts bumping up against societal rules, which I worry about. Right? If I’m buying something and you’re selling it to me, you want to know that if you sold it to me for $10, you don’t have to run somewhere to change the $10 into gold because you’re not sure the 10 will stay a 10. Bitcoin doesn’t do that for me. It doesn’t give me the safety and security of knowing that I am who I am, and I’m paying who I know, which is what traditional currency does. It’s fluctuating too rapidly. And who’s behind it? What system is behind it? Those aspects are worrisome. But the idea that as the world goes more and more into digital thinking, there’s this merger of the world of physical and digital—is there a role to be played for some kind of digital exchange? Yeah. I don’t know if it’s a currency. So I think a little about it, but I’ve done nothing. I’ve watched it.”\n\nWhen Fortune reached out to MasterCard recently to ask if the company’s thinking has since changed, a spokesperson sent this comment from its head of emerging payments, Ed McLaughlin, who sounds only a bit more upbeat (and note his reluctance to use the word bitcoin): “Innovation in payments is needed and necessary. New ideas, technologies and applications can drive toward a better experience for people and merchants. But innovation for its own sake is not the answer. The bottom line for any payment system and currency is that it must be safe, stable and reliable for consumers. We believe there needs to be a level playing field for how digital currency is approached, regulated and monitored.”\n\nVisa executives, in various interviews with Fortune over the past year, sounded similar. Sam Shrauger, the company’s senior VP of digital solutions, had this to say about bitcoin:\n\n“I think from a virtual currency standpoint, the way we look at it is, ‘What’s the problem it’s solving? Who’s it solving it for? And how well does it do the job of solving that problem?’ There are a lot of use cases where virtual currencies make sense. But if you think about it, it’s kind of a way of abstracting real money from the context. And I think for most things that consumers do—with the exception of things like gambling and gaming, where virtual currencies work really well—people want to use real currency. And they want to use currency that they know and they trust. I don’t think most consumers have a problem with currency. I think there are definitely interesting things in the blockchain and in the cryptocurrency structures that are worth looking at from a technical standpoint. But is everyone going to start paying for everything with digital currency? You’d have to have a problem with currency right now that needs a solution.”\n\nThat payment processors are now dipping their toes into bitcoin is encouraging for the space. But for now, it’s with an eye toward the technology, not the currency that fuels it, and it’s only a dip.', 'Nearly 25 years after receiving my PhD in Finance from the University of Chicago, I finally heard from the Prize Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel -- popularly known as the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. No, I was not awarded the prize -- I was not expecting to. The committee has invited me to nominate someone for the 2016 Prize. I feel honored. Frankly, this is as close as I am going to get to the Nobel Prize. The names of a few deserving candidates quickly flashed through my mind. The names that most people in the Economics profession would agree with, Paul Romer who is at NYU, Doug Diamond at the University of Chicago, Steve Ross at MIT -- the usual suspects -- for their influential work in 1970s and \'80s. In all likelihood, they will receive the highly coveted prize sooner or later.\n\nI then started thinking whose ideas are likely to have a disruptive influence in the twenty first century. The name of the inventor of Bitcoin suddenly jumped up in my consciousness and I have not been able to get it out of my mind since then, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nWho is Satoshi Nakamoto? We don\'t really know.\n\nWhere does he work and which country does he live in? We don\'t know.\n\nWhich scholarly journals in the field of Economics or Finance has he published his research in? Not in any of the reputed journals that one would look for -- American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, Journal of Finance, Econometrica.\n\nHas he published anything? Yes, a nine-page white paper titled, ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" that he posted on the Internet on May 24, 2009.\n\nSo, ""why does he deserve the Nobel Prize in Economics?"" I am sure the Nobel Committee who entrusted me -- among a few hundred others, to suggest nominees for the Prize -- would want to know. Am I being somewhat whimsical in nominating a complete outsider, Satoshi Nakamoto, for Economics Prize just as perhaps Romain Rolland was when he nominated, Sigmund Freud for the Nobel Prize in 1936 - not in Medicine but - in Literature.\n\nNo, in fact, I am completely serious in suggesting Satoshi Nakamoto for the Prize. The invention of bitcoin -- a digital currency -- is nothing short of revolutionary. Many physical currencies have been used historically -- from beads, sea-shells to precious metals such as gold or silver, to even consumables such as cigarettes in times of hyperinflations, to sports cards. Paper money, or what is formally known as Fiat currencies, are what are now ubiquitous all over the world with different regions and countries issuing their own currencies for facilitating trade and exchange.\n\nBitcoin, the currency, sometimes referred to as Digital Gold, on the other hand is digital and exists purely as a mathematical object. It offers many advantages over both physical and paper currencies. It is secure, relying on almost unbreakable cryptographic code, can be divided into millions of smaller sub-units, and can be transferred securely and nearly instantaneously from one person to any other person in the world with access to internet bypassing governments, central banks and financial intermediaries such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal or commercial banks eliminating time delays and transactions costs.\n\nBut beyond demonstrating the possibility of creating a reliable digital currency, Satoshi Nakamoto\'s Bitcoin Protocol has spawned exciting innovations in the FinTech space by showing how many financial contracts -- not just currencies -- can be digitized, securely verified and stored, and transferred instantaneously from one party to another. The implications of this are immense. This will likely create an open, decentralized, public infrastructure for moving both money -- as Stellar.org is trying to create - as well as other smart contracts -- as Ethereum.org is attempting to foster -- as easily as email but with security and nearly zero transactions costs. The cover and a lead story in the October 31, 2015 issue of the Economist magazine explain this well and in some detail.\n\nNot only will Satoshi Nakamoto\'s contribution change the way we think about money, it is likely to upend the role central banks play in conducting monetary policy, destroy high-cost money transfer services such as Western Union, eliminate the 2-4% transactions tax imposed by intermediaries such as Visa, MasterCard and Paypal, eliminate the time-consuming and expensive notary and escrow services and indeed transform the landscape of legal contracts completely. Many industries such as Banking, Finance, Law will see a big upheaval. The consumers will be big beneficiaries and indeed the poor and marginal sections of the society will reap the benefits of financial and social inclusion in the coming decades. I can barely think of another innovation in Economic and Finance in the last several decades whose influence surpasses the welfare increases that will be engendered by Satoshi Nakamoto\'s brilliant, path-breaking invention. That is why I am nominating him for the Nobel Prize in Economics.\n\nSuppose that the Nobel Committee is convinced that Satoshi Nakamoto deserves the Prize. Now the problem it will face is how to contact him to announce that he has won the Prize. The usual protocol is that the committee obtains the awardee\'s telephone number and calls the person to announce that he or she has won. But in this case, no one really knows who is, where he lives or what his phone number is. But that does not mean he does not exist. He does. He exists online. He can be informed by contacting him online just the same way people have communicated with him in the past and he has anonymously communicated with the computer science and cryptography community. If he accepts the award, he can verifiably communicate his acceptance.\n\nHe will most likely not appear in person -- and reveal his true identity given that he has chosen to remain anonymous all his life -- to accept the award in Stockholm, Sweden in the formal ceremony in December. I would be happy to go and accept the Prize on his behalf. What about the acceptance speech? That won\'t be any problem either. He can write his speech, digitally sign it and send it to me securely. I would, of course, rehearse and deliver it on his behalf at the Prize ceremony.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of the Prize money. No, I am not hoping to get the money just because I accept the award on his behalf and deliver his acceptance speech. The Nobel committee can easily buy bitcoins for the award money from any reputed online Bitcoin exchange and transfer it to him instantaneously. A very early bitcoin transaction suggests that the bitcoin address 1HLoD9E4SDFFPDiYfNYnkBLQ85Y51J3Zb1 likely belongs to him. Of course, he could easily and verifiably let the committee know which address he wants the money to be transferred to.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto already is in possession of several hundred million U.S. dollars worth of bitcoins so the additional prize money may not mean much to him. Only if he wants, the committee could also transfer the prize money to my bitcoin address, 165sAHBpLHujHbHx2zSjC898oXEz25Awtj\n\nMr Nakamoto and I will settle later.', 'ARK Investment Management LLC, which manages the first exchange-traded fund (EFT) with exposure to cryptocurrency, has almost doubled its money since September after investing in bitcoin, thanks to the virtual currency’s recent price surge, according to Bloomberg News. The overall fund has gained 15% this year, which represents more than 98% of the unleveraged ETFs in the U.S.\n\nCathie Wood, who founded New York City-based ARK in January of 2014, said Greece, China’s devaluation and a U.S. interest rate increase drove price swings resulting in a capital exodus from emerging markets, elevating bitcoin.\n\nAlso read: How the Bitcoin Investment Trust pushes bitcoin into mainstream finance\n\nA Convergence Of Factors Boosts Bitcoin\n\nAshraf Laidi, CEO at Intermarket Strategy Ltd. in London, said volatility in stocks, fixed income and currencies has eroded investment funds’ performance this year. He noted that China’s devaluation, the risk of Greece’s exit that subsided but could return, and the weak outlook of Fed rate hikes all raised the volatility risk. All of these factors enhance bitcoin’s credibility.\n\nETFs cannot purchase bitcoin directly. ARK added 1,100 shares ($33,000 USD) in Bitcoin Investment Trust to its Web X.0 fund in September. ARK has increased those holdings to a total of 3,786 shares. As of Thursday, those shares were worth $193,086.\n\nWood said she is not concerned about cryptocurrency’s volatility. Bitcoin’s volatility stabilized for almost 12 months in the $200 to $300 range following the “near death experience” with Mt. Gox. Investors have more comfort that it is not going to implode, she said.\n\nARK’s Web X.0 Fund: Crypto Among 12 Sectors\n\nCryptocurrencies are the second smallest portion of ARK’s Web X.0 fund. Among the 12 fund sectors listed on the company’s website as of Sept. 30, 2015, ,cloud computing represents 28%, followed by big data, 14%, Internet of Things, 14%, social media, 10%, devices and gateways, 9%, e-commerce, 9%, media ecosystem, 7%, health care, 5%, point of sale, 2%, connectiv\n\nity, 2%, cryptocurrencies, 0.5%, and sharing economy, 0.2%.\n\nThe fund is concentrated in the information technology sector and includes issuers that have their principal business activities in the Internet information provider and catalog and mail order house industry, the company notes.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and ARK Invest.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) addressed bankers to say that banks and financial institutions do not have to worry\n\nabout bitcoin or the blockchain.\n\nIt’s that time for global financial figures to be dismissive of Bitcoin and its underlying technology, the block chain.\n\nIMF Chief Christine Lagarde quelled bankers’ fears of the blockchain posing a threat to the current banking industry in banking conference at New York\n\nAs reported by The Financial Times, Lagarde said:\n\nMany of you have heard about not only bitcoins but blockchains and that unbelievable technology that underlies the Bitcoins of this world at the moment, and how incredibly convenient it will be to actually generate trust and identify players and whatever pseudo they decide to use.\n\nShe continued, adding:\n\nAnd many of you in the industry are actually worried that those technologies are going to massively disrupt the current industry.\n\nLagarde’s comments referenced an FT article about a potential pyramid scheme stacking up in a Chinese social network that is now using Bitcoin. She cited the potential for abuse in such technologies, the way she sees it.\n\n“Pause for a second,” Lagarde said, calming the audience of bankers, before continuing:\n\nIf those new technologies and as long as those new technologies are going to abuse, take advantage of, the yield for anonymity, I think the banking industry has quite a few good days ahead of it as long as it takes ownership of those issues of capital and culture in order to actually restore the trust without which you see no trade no transaction no business can take place.\n\nBorn in Paris, Lagarde is a lawyer and formerly was France’s Trade Minister between 2005 and 2007. She is approaching the end of her five-year term as the head of the IMF and recently spoke about being prepared to serve another term.\n\nLagarde joins JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to pour scorn over the longevity of Bitcoin in recent days and question the likelihood for it to threaten the current banking system.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""On November 3, two robbers stole a Lamassu Bitcoin ATM at the Village Smoke Shop in Atlanta, Georgia, according to local news website Clatl.com.\n\nAccording to Atlanta’s Police Detective Scott Bowers, the thieves got away with Bitcoin ATM (also called BTM) filled with about US$2,000 as it was recently emptied. What’s more is that one of the perpetrators fired a gun shot, though luckily no one was injured.\n\nIt seems that the thieves wanted to get their hands on this machine in particular. Amanda McCollum, an employee in Midtown's Village Smoke Shop, witnessed the crime. She saw that the suspects “walked in, went straight to [the Bitcoin ATM], took it and only it, and walked out.”\n\nHowever, stealing a Bitcoin ATM is not a good idea. While a Lamassu Bitcoin ATM itself is valued at US$7,000, the criminals would not be able to re-sell it because it is registered to the buyer with serial numbers linking them to the original owners. Moreover, no one except the owner will be able to get any bitcoins from the machines while most BTMs don’t hold a lot of cash inside as a rule.\n\nNevertheless, one must be cautious when installing a small BTM in the shop and security measures must be taken to prevent theft.\n\nCo-Founder of CoinOutlet Bitcoin ATM, Eric Grill, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Thieves see these as machines that have a lot of cash in them just like a traditional ATM machine which obviously they are not. You need to make the machines very difficult to steal. This is exactly why having a small lightweight machine that is a vault for cash is a bad idea. One of the reasons CoinOutlet went with a large heavy model is based on years of experience with traditional ATMs where people would snatch and grab them making the almost impossible for anyone to steal. This incident is less about Bitcoin ATM. They are steel enclosures so they also aren't easy to get into and we also have a vault inside to protect the cash.”\n\nWhile this is the first case of a BTM robbery in the US, it is not the first. In the beginning of year, CoinTelegraph reported how two BTMs were stolen in Amsterdam in one swoop. One of these machines was a two-way BitAccess BTM from Thai restaurant and the second was a one-way General Bytes BATMtwo from a local cafe, which also served a dual role as the Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam.\n\n“We will just need to be a bit more selective on where exactly to place them,” said the owner of the General Bytes BTM, Martin Wismeijer, who’s also known as Mr.Bitcoin. “On top of that, newly placed BTM's will all be insured against theft.”"", 'Anyone else remember the time way, back in 2013, when any economic expert or establishment figurehead was saying Bitcoin was a waste of time and was doomed to fail? Basically laughing at it, while they stood on their bully pulpit?\n\nFunny just how much the narrative has changed two years later. Today, Bitcoin’s Blockchain is great, and the other half of Bitcoin, the currency, is still bad. Is that what two years’ of education does, huh? Maybe in another two years, and another 15% rate of inflation in the interim, they will see the value in the digital currency?\n\n2015 has been the “Year of the Blockchain” as the world’s leading financial institutions flock to study Bitcoin’s underlying advancements. Whether the establishment admits it or not, this stampede of positive energy in the economic sector towards the Blockchain indirectly validates Bitcoin’s core value.\n\nThe argument against the merit of Bitcoin becomes pretty thin when your Fortune 500 corporation is going to spend the rest of the decade breaking down what makes your appreciating asset class tick. Yet, is building a privatized and centralized blockchain for your bank a sweet idea? Or are those banks, failing to learn from history, are just repeating history?\n\nLet’s take a look with four reasons why banks will fail in building viable internal blockchains.\n\nReason #1: If you could build a blockchain for a bank, why not turn it into a business\n\nThe legendary economic weekly “The Economist” featured Bitcoin’s Blockchain as their cover story, crystallizing the mainstream’s new love affair with Bitcoin’s technological backbone. In conjunction with this, The Economist created a panel discussion on the topic, which included Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert. He had the following to say about bank-managed blockchain construction:\n\n“I think they’re going to fail, and I think, ultimately, the people working on these projects at the banks are going to end up leaving the banks to work at startups that are building it outside.”\n\nBanks are rife with regulations, bureaucracy, and red tape - things that should take months usually end up taking years for a bank to approve. The few people who might be able to put together a blockchain will simply run out of patience and either start their own blockchain business or pool their resources with other private practices in the field.\n\nWhy build one blockchain for one bank when you can brand your efforts and work for multiple businesses, while automating your processes, and build towards your own IPO? If you’re smart enough to build a blockchain properly, you’re also smart enough to monetize the concept for your own gain, not the bank’s, right?\n\nReason #2. By the time a bank actually builds one that MIGHT work…..\n\nBanks have about as much history building innovations in technology as they do lowering credit card rates. Their business is making money off of their customers and the society as a whole, not advancing the state of the art.\n\nAnyone, like me, who has any history with banking, knows a new product (that is really just a spin off an old product) takes a minimum of two years before it sees anything resembling the light of day. Think a debit card redesign with new features and benefits. You can double that timeframe for something as revolutionary as blockchain technology due to the issues mentioned above.\n\nDo you know how far forward Bitcoin’s true blockchain, and the private sector, will be by the time their first system mock-up will be ready for action? It’s like hitting a moving target. Private companies may already be 2-3 years in, selling the technology and refining it in the real-world.\n\nReason #3. We went through this paradigm shift 20 years ago\n\nRemember the Internet back in 1995. The telecoms and banks went through the same things the banks are facing today when the paradigm shifted back then.\n\nWhat did they do with this new technology? They tried to co-opt it, without integrating it, just like today, as history repeats itself. The incumbents created a bunch of bad ideas like colored fax machines, ISDN, and corporate “Intranets,” where companies modeled the Internet, while taking all of the useful parts out of it.\n\nHistory is not on the side of the banks maneuvering around the real blockchain with a knock-off. Banks don’t build great technology. They really don’t even use great technology, but if they do, it certainly didn’t come from within. Banks don’t want better, they just want control.\n\nReason #4. At the end of the day, the blockchain is just a ledger and a slow one at that\n\nThe ledger concept is so old it predates banking, and can be seen in evidence in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. Banks are ledgers. Assets and liabilities, credits and debits - this is the one thing they actually do well and are leaders in.\n\nWhat do they need a slow database for? The key to Bitcoin’s success and their interest is really not the blockchain at all, but the merits of decentralizing monetary transfer, canceling out double-spends, and many other abilities the banking industry clumsily solves with counter-parties. After which, there arises a need to over-regulate for counter-party risk mitigation and fraud protection.\n\nThe banks are really causing their tail here, because no matter what the blockchain can do, they’ll still be on the same counter-party risk/fraud protection system twenty years from now. The blockchain won’t disrupt that and the flaws built into that system. They’ll feel their toes in the sand but will never bathe in the waters of decentralization.\n\nLook at the bright side\n\nThe bad news for the banks is good news for Bitcoin. Every time the blockchain is mentioned by a mainstream heavyweight, the Bitcoin economy and community gets a pat on the back, whether intentional or not. Banks will never compliment Bitcoin as a currency because it is not in their best interest. Every dollar invested in Bitcoin is a dollar taken out of their fiat currency system, which is good for the planet, but bad for the stockholders.\n\nSo the Blockchain love affair is as close to a “you were right, we were wrong” as the Bitcoin community will ever get from the mainstream. Only when the banks can’t make a go of turning the blockchain into an internal cash cow, I’m sure they’ll say “See! Told you there was nothing there!”\n\nTell that to Bitcoin owners four years from now, sitting on quite an ROI after sticking with the real McCoy, and not buying into some CompuServe rehash. C’est la vie.', 'Bitcoin Foundation Ukraine and KUNA Bitcoin Agency are expected to announce a Ukrainian blockchain project to set up an E-Governance system in Odessa, Ukraine.\n\nThe corresponding memorandum was already signed by the First Deputy Head of Kyiv Regional State Administration Lev Partskhaladze, said KUNA founder, Michael Chobanyan to CoinTelegraph. Now Odessa Oblast may become the first administrative center to adopt blockchain technology for governance. Though it has not yet been confirmed just exactly which ""blockchain"" will be implemented.\n\nAs the first step in the project, Bitcoin Foundation Ukraine will hold a government real estate auction on the blockchain. It will ensure fair, transparent auction and eliminate the chance of document forgery. This blockchain-powered auction system is currently in the pilot stage.\n\nAccording to the signed memorandum, the local IT-community will help develop the project in Odessa. They will study ways to integrate blockchain technology for various public services such as personal identification, public records, banking, etc.\n\nThe official announcement will be aired on Ukrainian TV, which can be seen later here.', 'Forex has always been one of the most attractive investment options for less experienced traders. Now, bitcoin is bringing a new breed of investors to the forex trading space, and many brokers are opening its doors to the digital currency.\n\nIn fact, this year all along, several Forex brokers started to deal with bitcoin, and it seems the interest, both from traders and brokers, in this type of investment is growing exponentially.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market is the largest market in the world. It is where foreign currencies are exchanged and where every day more than 4 trillion dollars are traded. The huge volume of daily transactions makes it the most liquid market in the world. The enormous size of the Forex market is what ensures that no one can control the market; not even banks or big financial groups can control the market for a long period of time.\n\nForex essentially goes around about eight major currencies and is open 24 hours a day, enabling traders to have the best chances whenever they hear a financial scoop.\n\nA few years ago there was no Broker willing t o work with bitcoin, but now this is changing; currently we can find a lot of brokers that enable investors to trade forex pairs using BTC. It looks like Forex trading via bitcoin is revolutionizing both Forex trading and BTC investments. Several brokers already let user’s trade forex pairs by investing with bitcoin.\n\nA Few Examples of Forex Brokers accepting Bitcoin:\n\n1Broker – https://1broker.com/\n\nAvaTrade – https://www.avatrade.com\n\nBit4X – https://bit4x.com/\n\nCFD1000 – https://cfd1000.com/\n\neToro – https://www.etoro.com\n\nForex.ee – https://www.forex.ee\n\nJustForex – http://justforex.com/\n\nFX Choice – https://myfxchoice.com\n\nNova FX Trading – http://novafxtrading.com/\n\nPlus500 – https:// plus500.com\n\nSimpleFX – https://simplefx.com\n\nVenetFX – http://venetfx.com/\n\nBenefits of investing in Forex:\n\nLately, we have seen many bitcoin enthusiasts using Forex to protect themselves against the shallow periods of the bitcoin market. And this is mainly because, oppositely to what we find in the Bitcoin markets, in Forex, the huge liquidity and trading volume makes it easy to get the big picture of what’s going on, and what is possibly going to happen.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin and Forex is pretty much the same. The only real big difference is that with bitcoin, traders are willing to take a lot more risk in exchange for bigger profits. While Bitcoin markets are known to be highly volatile Forex markets are normally pretty steady and predictable. This makes the perfect chance to safeguard Bitcoin investments, by turning them into Forex investments. This makes the perfect option for someone wanting to hold their investments with much less risk than bitcoin.\n\nLike Forex, The price of a Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand, however, with Forex markets there is a lot of agreements and regulation that makes it pretty stable. On the other hand, Bitcoin is still heavily unregulated and there is still a lot of speculation leading the price to stay highly volatile. This is the main reason leading traders to invest their BTC stacks in Forex in an attempt to leverage their investment and safeguard against the bitcoin critical periods.\n\nThroughout 2015, we have seen bitcoin traders jumping into Forex as a way of enlarging their portfolio as well as a method of safeguarding against the bitcoin price volatility. This clearly indicates that Bitcoin is fast becoming a new forex trading prospect.\n\nImages: 1, 2']"
11/07/2015,"['It seems like Bitcoin has been the only thing worth following in the mainstream for the last week or so. Granted, good news has been in short supply for the digital currency. Yet, before the massive leaps and bounds of Bitcoin’s price over the last few days, the mainstream has been sure to ignore Bitcoin, only to befriend its online ledger brother, Blockchain. Well, according to Fortune magazine, executives in the highest places of economic industry have had plenty to say about Bitcoin. Let’s see where executives stand on “The Honey Badger of Money.”\n\nSome surprising commentary from Uphold CEO Anthony Watson\n\nBitcoin is short on friends these days, except when its price blows the markets away. After reviewing all of the commentaries, the most surprisingly negative comments came from Uphold’s Anthony Watson.\n\nUphold recently changed its name from BitReserve, and handled over US$400,000,000 in Bitcoin transactions, but has changed its focus away from Bitcoin solely, and towards a more varied economic market strategy. These comments reflect that disconnect rather profoundly. Given Watson’s banking background, formerly of Barclays, his movement being in lockstep with the banking industry may not be such a surprise after all. He said:\n\n“I’ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years. The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology.”\n\nMasterCard has proven to be much more interested in Bitcoin than most money exchangers, making news by producing anti-Bitcoin videos last year. Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga is actually more circumspect in his assessment of Bitcoin and its impact on the global economic scene. He maintains a level of interest, but it will remain from afar. Banga:\n\n“My view of bitcoin is that the concept of a digital or a virtual currency is interesting if I could figure out what it does for everybody. If all it does is allow you to anonymize your money movements, I’m not so hot about that. If I’m buying something and you’re selling it to me, you want to know that if you sold it to me for $10, you don’t have to run somewhere to change the $10 into gold because you’re not sure the 10 will stay a 10. Bitcoin doesn’t do that for me. And who’s behind it? What system is behind it? Those aspects are worrisome.”\n\nThe last part of that indicates a lack of understanding in Bitcoin’s technology and protocol, echoed by Mastercard’s Ed McLaughlin. He is Mastercard’s head of Emerging Payments, and he had this to say:\n\n“Innovation in payments is needed and necessary. New ideas, technologies and applications can drive toward a better experience for people and merchants. But innovation for its own sake is not the answer. The bottom line for any payment system and currency is that it must be safe, stable and reliable for consumers. We believe there needs to be a level playing field for how digital currency is approached, regulated and monitored.”\n\nVisa has been more curious with Bitcoin in 2015, working with startups in Visa’s European Collab initiative, and adapting cars to the use of Bitcoin’s Blockchain tech through mobile apps. Sam Shrauger, the company’s senior VP of digital solutions, had this to say about the future of digital currency:\n\n“I think from a virtual currency standpoint, the way we look at it is, ‘What’s the problem it’s solving? Who’s it solving it for? And how well does it do the job of solving that problem?’ There are a lot of use cases where virtual currencies make sense. But if you think about it, it’s kind of a way of abstracting real money from the context. And I think for most things that consumers do—with the exception of things like gambling and gaming, where virtual currencies work really well—people want to use real currency.”\n\n“And they want to use a currency that they know and they trust. I don’t think most consumers have a problem with currency. I think there are definitely interesting things in the blockchain and in the cryptocurrency structures that are worth looking at from a technical standpoint. But is everyone going to start paying for everything with digital currency? You’d have to have a problem with currency right now that needs a solution.”\n\nWhat have we learned from the views of the standing economic elite?\n\nSuffice to say, those within the Bitcoin space see many problems inherent in current economic systems that need addressing. Bitcoin fills a need in micro-payments, banking the 4-6 billion unbanked people worldwide, potentially replacing inflationary fiat currency with the appreciating value of sound money, taking debt out of global economics, removing identity theft risk from transactions, and much more.\n\nIt appears that the understanding of Bitcoin as a currency is limited, at best. Generally, the more people learn about Bitcoin, the more they appreciate its unique skill set, not unlike the nascent technology of the Internet from twenty years ago.\n\nWhen you send your first US$100 in bitcoin to someone on the other side of the world via a Skype video conference by simply raising your smartphone and showing a QR Code, in fully encrypted security, these questions of Bitcoin’s value to the marketplace tend to fade into the background rather quickly.\n\nWhile not as dismissive as the hubris of a mogul like Jamie Dimon, the lack of Bitcoin understanding is palpable. Reminds one of an old saying, “Best to remain silent, and be thought of as a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt.”', 'Apple recently started to give more freedom to iOS app developers in integrating digital currencies and in-game tokens including bitcoin.\n\nYesterday, the California-based tech giant has approved another bitcoin-based mobile game application called Wheel of Bitcoins, which pays bitcoin directly and immediately to users’ email, from the app.\n\nWheel of Bitcoins is a casual roulette game, with which users spin to win different combinations of bitcoins. Once users earn bitcoins in the game, the app sends it through Xapo directly to users’ emails, allowing users to instantly withdraw or cash out bitcoins.\n\nSince the approval of various bitcoin tipping-enabled iOS games and applications such as Game of Birds in June, bitcoin has been increasing its presence in the Apple Store, with 7 bitcoin-enabled games and applications being registered in the store over the past few months.\n\nPopular bitcoin-based mobile game developer Bitcoin Alien has had 3 of their applications in the Apple store for over 3 months, after the approval of the Apple team. According to the company, Apple is well aware of the game’s bitcoin payout system and is happy with it.\n\n“The team was actually accepting of them, had a few questions but they absolutely know that we pay out bitcoin and had no problem with it. We actually give out around 5-7btc a week between these 3x apps now, and if you search for ""bitcoin"" the app ""Bitcoin Free"" is 2nd/3rd in the Apple store,” stated the Bitcoin Aliens team.\n\nHowever, some bitcoin-enabled applications such as Wheel of Bitcoins have received an increasing number of criticisms from the community for choosing Xapo over other wallet platforms with simplified verification and identification systems.\n\nXapo, one of the world’s leading bitcoin startups and wallet service provider requires users to undergo an extensive verification process upon registration due to its Know Your Customer and Money Laundering policies and regulations.\n\nHowever, as emphasized by the developers of Game of Birds in an exclusive interview with CoinTelegraph, the idea behind bitcoin-based games is to help the currency to become more mainstream by allowing users that are unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies to use it.\n\nAnonymous users of Wheel of Bitcoins told CoinTelegraph that Xapo’s lengthy identification procedure makes it difficult to use the app and requires as much information as fiat-based financial platforms and systems.', 'Virtual reality content creation platform and marketplace Voxelus has announced a unique bonus and rewards system for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and buyers of its in-game digital currency Voxel, after raising US$500,000 in the first day of its 30-day token crowdsale.\n\nThe crowdsale of Voxel will be distributed into 3 phases that will last until December 2, 2015. Early buyers and participants of the crowd sale will be able to purchase the digital currency for as low as 1200 voxels per bitcoin.\n\nAs the crowd sale progresses however, the price will increase gradually and the tokens will eventually be sold at 750 voxels per bitcoin, 7.5% higher than the initial rate.\n\nThe 30-day crowdsale is currently being facilitated by instant cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, the company which also recently facilitated a series of crowd sales for blockchain-based cards trading game Spells of Genesis and Ethereum-built decentralized prediction market Augur.\n\nAccording to the Voxelus team, the company is offering 15% of all possible voxels during this crowd sale. The remaining 85% will be gradually released over the next 20 years, which will be allocated for software development, content creator bounties and marketing.\n\n“Voxels are the official currency of virtual reality,” claimed Voxelus chairman and co-founder Halsey Minor, who previously founded several iconic companies including CNET, Salesforce.com, Vignette, Google Voice and manages prominent financial technology startups such as Uphold (formerly BitReserve).\n\nSimilar to a Kickstarter campaign, investors of the crypto crowdsale will also receive various rewards, including a customized Voxelus T-shirt, founder’s badge, custom made avatar, Voxelus-branded Samsung Gear VR and a dinner with leading Bitcoin celebrity investors.\n\n“We felt it would be fair to those who are just now hearing about the power of Voxel to participate at the lowest price, as long as they purchase a higher minimum than was required on the first day of the crowdsale,” said Martin Repetto, co-founder and CEO of Voxelus.\n\n“In addition, we are offering Kickstarter-like rewards for purchases at various levels, which were not available during the presale. Anyone who purchased at higher levels in the pre-sale will now earn these rewards as well, and anyone who would have gotten pre-sale pricing under our new plan on the first day will also be given extra tokens.”', ""This week the Bitcoin Uncensored Podcast with Junseth and Chris Derose interviewed the winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics, Eugene Fama. Bitcoin Uncensored has given CoinTelegraph the first peek at the interview so that we could publish it for the greater Bitcoin community.\n\nProfessor Fama is the father of Modern Finance, and one of the biggest proponents of what is known as Efficient-Market Hypothesis (EMH), which states that markets are efficient and that their information is broadcast in their current price. In its different forms this also means that it is impossible to “beat the market”, and that technical analysis of stock markets is ineffective.\n\nThis is basically saying that it is impossible to buy undervalued stock or sell it a higher rate, making arbitrage an illusion. The EMH hypothesis is very close in conception to the mathematical random walk hypothesis, that states that prices follow a random pattern. Random patterns are unpredictable by nature, so then the arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nBitcoin Uncensored: Hello Professor Fama.\n\nEugene Fama: Hello.\n\nBU: To begin with, what do you know about bitcoin?\n\nEF: Ohhh. I have a cursory knowledge of it. To me it seems like I really don’t know the difference between bitcoin and a checking account. I read all these papers in the 80s about how when you conduct transactions to a bank you check a wire that’s really just an accounting system for exchange...running in the background to clear accounts. And it seems that bitcoin is pretty much the same thing. It’s an accounting system of exchange. I don’t know, maybe it’s a better protocol or whatever, but I don’t really know the difference between the two.\n\nBU: Well, there’s a lot of ways to explain the differences. but right at the top, the existing settlement solutions are solutions by the way of a centralized authority such as the bank or such as some clearing house.\n\nEF: But really, it’s just a computer.\n\nBU: Correct. But it’s also a computer tied to censorship and subject to moderation, which is unlike cash.\n\nEF: There is no anonymity, that’s the main difference as I can tell. Bitcoin gives you anonymity, and transactions through a bank. For example, all transactions higher than ten thousand dollars are reported.\n\nBU: Bitcoin is more like paper money. Subject to the same type of assurances that paper money is subject to, without fear of chargebacks.\n\nEF: Yeah, it’s basically anonymity.\n\nBU: That would be a huge part of it. Certainly.\n\nEF: I don’t know, what would be the other part?\n\nBU: Bitcoin has added value in the form of censorship resistance and other tangentials that can be built onto the protocol. Regarding the financial aspects of it. What do you think about the volatility of a currency with regards to markets in general? In this case being Bitcoin.\n\nEF: Yeah, that’s a very good question because, the standard belief among monetary economists, is that a unit of account—which is what bitcoin is—to which prices get stated, can’t survive if it’s highly variable. People won’t use it because basically it’s very difficult to know how much you need to settle. It is quite variable, they won’t want to hold it as just a way of settling payments, they will try to get rid of it quickly, as they do; and that’s not good for the survival of that kind of a unit of account. As if it doesn’t have a stable value it’s probably not going to survive as a unit of account. What that means is that it’s value is likely to go to zero at some point. What value does it have except as a unit of account?\n\nBU: Bitcoin can be used as a store of value, and it has censorship resistance components.\n\nEF: No, it’s a not a store of value. Unless it has some other value, the core value has to come from something. It comes from its use as a unit of account in transactions. If people decide they don’t want to take it in transactions it’s value is gone. I don’t get what people who defend the censorship resistance are talking about. I guess that for a drug dealer that has a lot more value. But otherwise, I don’t see the big value about that.\n\nBU: How do you feel about gold? Where there's no stable unit of account, and it is nonetheless store of value.\n\nEF: Gold has the same problem. It's a highly volatile store of value.\n\nBU: But it hasn’t gone to 0 either.\n\nEF: Gold has other uses. For example, I have a wedding ring on, that’s a use right there. Gold has a limited value because it can be substituted for other metals and goods for some uses. It depends a lot on people being willing to use it for other things. In fact it depends entirely on that. It's use as money has long gone. Nobody is on the gold standard.\n\nBU: What value would Bitcoin have, let’s say to dark markets. Forbes estimates about 11 trillion dollars on untapped economic activity. What if Bitcoin’s only value was in censorship resistance for those markets?\n\nEF: Well, I don’t know how much value it would have then, and so, people who are concerned about that would have to say: “Ok, that’s worth so much to me, I’m willing to accept the volatility of the value of bitcoin in settling my transactions because this anonymity is worth so much to me.” Now, to me, that is a tough sell. *laughs*\n\nBU: Bitcoin has a built-in deflation mechanism that caps at a maximum of 21 million coins. In a world where Bitcoin continues to retain value, what does this mean for things like taking out a loan in Bitcoin?\n\nEF: It’s just another way in which you do things, you can say: I will lend you this many bitcoins and you have to pay me that same number whatever plus a interest, that’s like saying: I will lend you so many dollars and you will pay me back so many dollars with interest, but you’re not really paying me back dollars. What happens in the background is that there is an exchange of assets, basically financial assets. And that’s how everything settles, bitcoin will work the same way if it has to survive.\n\nBut again you have this problem, if I take out a loan in bitcoin and I, for example, buy a house; or I take out a 500k dollar loan, denominated in bitcoin, and all of a sudden, it’s value goes down or up or whatever, what I’m gonna owe paying back is going to be different in real terms. I don’t think that’s going to work.\n\nBU: Bitcoin has the potential to lower transaction fees to even fractions of a penny, with little to none settlement costs. What can tell us regarding that?\n\nEF: *laughs* You’re going to run into competition in that case. So what’s gonna happen is, if bitcoin gets popular for things like that you’re gonna see the transaction fee in traditional services…disappear.\n\nBU: Isn’t that inconsistent with the efficient market hypothesis? Because that traditional cost reflects the cost of processing the transaction.\n\nEF: No, my bank will process my wire transfers for nothing. No matter how big they are. Or how small they are, because I’m a good customer. They don’t check anything for that. In a wire transfer, which is basically the way everything settles, the costs are zero. It’s just accounting. It’s an entry on a computer, the cost is zero.\n\nBU: Bitcoin is like paper money in the same way, that with a piece of paper money you don’t have a relationship with any banking institution.\n\nEF: You don’t carry around bitcoin in pieces of paper, do you?\n\nBU: Yes, you absolutely can.\n\nEF: Ok, then you can do the same thing as with dollars, and if you carry around pieces of paper marked with bitcoin that’s no different than carrying around dollars.\n\nBU: That’s correct, except that you can actually put a million dollars of bitcoin into one piece of paper.\n\nEF: Who cares about a million dollars? Who is this valuable to? Drug dealers *laughs*.\n\nBU: If you’re carrying that much cash, you probably would want the anonymity features of bitcoin. On another note, why do we have 2% processing charges on credit cards you would say? If in fact the cost of moving money is zero.\n\nEF: Well, on credit cards transactions, that’s different than a transaction with a bank. The credit card company is taking a risk that you won’t pay. A bank is not taking that risk because when I send in a check or wire transfer to a bank, they know whether I can cover that transaction. The credit card company doesn’t know if you can cover that transaction, so that 2% you pay or whatever it is 1.5% that’s basically a bad debt charge, to cover the amount that they lose to people who can’t eventually pay their account. That possibility doesn’t exist with bitcoin. Because you either have it or you don’t, right? It’s like a deposit in a bank, my bank knows exactly how much what I can write and what I can cover. It can refuse checks that are too big.\n\nBU: Yes. Why don’t we do wire transfers online at free cost? Why do we use the debit transfers at 2%?\n\nEF: You know, that’s just competition. If Bitcoin catches on, those charges are going to disappear.\n\nBU: What about talking in terms of sending money from the US to foreign countries in a very short time? A wire transfer from here to Spain takes 2 to 3 days...\n\nEF: No, no, no, no. That can be done instantly. The system, the computers, are all linked.\n\nBU: Why do we pay charges on remittance then?\n\nEF: There you're paying a fee for the change from one currency into another. You're paying a broker's fee basically. Depending on how good a customer you're that would determine the size of that fee. There's bids and spreads on currency transaction which basically has to be paid.\n\nBU: How much of that is regulation, with regards to remittances? How much of it is tax for example? Perhaps tax alone is a substantial amount.\n\nEF: I don't know. I don't think there's any specific number because I know that's a negotiable sum. Bitcoin pays none of that, it definitely has an advantage. *laughs*"", 'Figuring out the future of Bitcoin and blockchain technology seems like a nearly impossible task for most people right now, but there are certain individuals who seen this technology evolve over the years and may be able to take an educated guess at what’s coming next. Eric Lombrozo is the founder, Co-CEO, and CTO of Ciphrex Corporation, and he has contributed code to multiple blockchain-related projects such as Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. Lombrozo has watched this technology evolve since the earliest of days, which is why it makes sense for him to give a presentation on the future of crypto at the upcoming Inside Bitcoins Conference in San Diego. The Ciphrex CTO recently shared some some of his thoughts on where Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems could be going with Inside Bitcoins.\n\nAlso Read: Voting Machines Running Blockchain Technology Are No Longer Just A Theory\n\nNew Protocols Allows Blockchains to Be Settlement Layers\n\nAlthough many Bitcoin proponents believe that all transactions will eventually be processed directly on the blockchain, Lombrozo sees the future of cryptocurrency differently. He explained that it is the protocols built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that hold promise for the future of crypto in general:\n\n“Some pretty big innovations are taking place, especially regarding layered protocol designs and cross-chain contracts. Things like payment channels and the Lightning Network promise to bring about a new generation of crypto protocols.”\n\nExpanding on his thoughts related to micropayment protocols, Lombrozo claimed that these new innovations will allow Bitcoin (and perhaps other blockchains) to primarily act as settlement layers:\n\n“It’s looking more and more like blockchains will become primarily a settlement layer allowing us to build protocol layers atop them where we can negotiate contracts directly with counterparties. Blockchains provide well-defined settlement guarantees, but settling on blockchains is too slow and costly to support certain killer use cases. With layered protocols, the contracts themselves needn’t always touch the blockchain, making things like cheap, instant micropayments a practical reality.”\n\nLombrozo also added that the ability to process microtransactions on the Bitcoin network could have implications for the protocol’s scalability:\n\n“Having the ability to do trustless instant micropayments, we finally might have a way to fix the incentive issues that are making it hard to securely scale this technology.”\n\nAlternative Tokens vs Alternative Blockchains\n\nAs someone who has worked on multiple blockchain and fintech protocols, Lombrozo also has a unique perspective on the viability of alternative token systems and altcoins. Although Lombrozo sees possible value in the existence of many different tokens, the Ciphrex Co-CEO thinks having a variety of blockchains could be an issue when it comes to security:\n\n“There could well be many different tokens, from generated tokens to issued tokens – I think there’s room for that. But we need to be careful to distinguish between tokens and blockchains. Blockchains provide strong guarantees of irreversibility and censorship resistance. But in order for these guarantees to hold, the blockchain must be public and permissionless and be expensive to attack. If hashing power is split amongst many different chains, it weakens them all, making them all more susceptible to attack.”\n\nBitcoin is Not a Replacement for Credit Cards\n\nOne final point that Eric Lombrozo shared via email was that Bitcoin is not ready to replace credit cards and payment processors. Instead of trying thrive where traditional payment options already dominate, Bitcoin developers should work on use cases that create completely new types of transactions that were not possible in the past. Lombrozo explained:\n\n“Many people have been pushing for adoption of Bitcoin and crypto in traditional retail settings as an additional payment method. While this indeed could eventually occur, I think where we’re most likely to see great inroads with crypto in the nearer term is in certain markets where crypto is particularly attractive, namely, digital content distribution, network services, and sharing of computational resources.”\n\nAlthough many individuals like to track the bitcoin price and merchant adoption more than anything else, the reality is that these early days of the technology’s evolution will not involve using the digital commodity as a currency for day-to-day purchases.\n\nTo hear more of Eric Lombrozo’s thoughts on the future of Bitcoin and crypto, make sure to check out his afternoon keynote presentation at Inside Bitcoins San Diego on December 15th.\n\nFeatured image via m anima.\n\n\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured on VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, RT’s Keiser Report, and many other media outlets. You can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.', '“Remember, remember!\n\nThe fifth of November,\n\nThe Gunpowder treason and plot;\n\nI know of no reason\n\nWhy the Gunpowder treason\n\nShould ever be forgot!”\n\nNovember 5th just passed and most of us know that it was Guy Fawkes Day. The ‘guy’ who almost bombed the English parliament in the 16th century and died for it. While the day was originally commemorated in the United Kingdom for his failure to bomb the parliament and assassinate the king in the process, his mask now stands for something quite the opposite.\n\nThe present day symbolism of the Guy Fawkes mask is influenced by the movie V for Vendetta. It stands as a symbol against oppression and autocracies committed by politicians, governments and financial institutions against common man. Guy Fawkes mask, November 5 and Bitcoin have a lot in common.\n\nWidely adopted by the well-known hacktivist group Anonymous and the symbol of Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Movement, Guy Fawkes mask has become the symbol of rebellion. It is similar to the poster of Che Guevara which has become the mascot of revolution. Guy Fawkes Day is now an international event where people take to the streets protesting against the system and the failure of democracy in many countries.\n\nBitcoin is a revolutionary currency which also aims to prevent banks, financial institutions and governments from controlling money and dictating terms to citizens. Decentralized nature of bitcoin ensures that the power does not lie in one single man’s (or organization’s) hands and it is the collective, the people who decide what’s good for them.\n\nImplementation of CISA, attempts to silence Julian Assange– the founder of WikiLeaks and the example of Edward Snowden who is now called a traitor instead of hailing him as a whistleblower are all the things which Guy Fawkes mask stands against and it will continue to do so till people have free will and the drive to fight against oppression.', 'The end of an era has been reached. The final Silk Road bitcoin auction took place on Thursday, November 5th and unfortunately, the results couldn’t be more disappointing.\n\nAlso read: The Final Silk Road Bitcoin Auction Has Occurred\n\nMuch like “Lost,” “Dexter” and “The X-Files,” this exciting series administered and organized by the US Marshals Service (USMS) has delivered a real flop for its finale, with a mere eleven participants placing bets and going through the motions. This marks the lowest number of bidders since the second auction that took place nearly a year ago in December of 2014.\n\nOverall, a total of 30 bids were placed on the remaining bitcoins, which were separated into 22 different blocks. 21 of these blocks contained 2,000 bitcoins each (valued at around $790,000). The 22nd block, the “supreme leader” so to speak, contained 2,341 bitcoins, worth approximately $926,200.\n\nAs previously reported, Tim Draper did not take part in the event. Draper has yet to comment on his reasons for staying out of the limelight this time around.\n\nThe bidding process has been a mixed bag with each auction. The first one arguably drew the most participation (likely due to being the first), attracting almost 50 registered bidders and 63 individual bids. Interest in the auctions has waned over time, although the third auction, which took place last March, witnessed higher participation than its December predecessor, with 14 separate bidders placing over 30 bids. Despite what was pumped up to be a grand close to a steady year-and-a-half-long adventure, Thursday’s auction proved weaker than expected.\n\nOne thing is still unclear. Did the auction help with pumping bitcoin’s price? In a related story, after much excitement and joy over bitcoin’s ascension up the financial ladder, the price has finally hit a rough spot and dropped down to about $390.\n\nGiven the sudden drop and the lack of interest in the latest auction, it could be said at first glance that the event had little influence on the price increase and that China is still the main influence in this arena. However, when we delve a bit deeper, there is certainly evidence to suggest the opposite. First of all, registration for the auction took place right at the same time as when bitcoin’s price began spiking. Then, the price started declining, just as the auction came to a close. Could this be a coincidence? Perhaps we’ll never know, but considering that past auctions have influenced the digital currency’s price before, it’s not a far-fetched thought.\n\nTransfers will be finalized on Monday, at which point the winners will likely be announced.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the final Silk Road auction? Post your comments below!\n\nImages courtesy of US Marshals\n\nOriginally posted on: The Final Silk Road Auction: Part II', 'Chris Flood NOVEMBER 7, 2015 0 The future of “synthetic” exchange traded funds that use futures to follow an index was dealt another blow last week after Lyxor, the French asset manager, dropped the synthetic structure for one of its biggest funds. Lyxor, Europe’s third-largest ETF provider by assets, has converted its flagship $8.6bn Euro Stoxx 50 ETF into a physically traded equivalent that buys the companies in an underlying index. Half of the Paris-based investment manager’s $50bn of ETF assets will be converted into “physical” products by the end of next year. The shift is another knock for the synthetic ETF industry, which has faced fierce criticism from regulators in previous years due to the complexity and potential lack of transparency of these derivative-linked products. Deutsche Bank’s asset management arm and UBS, the Swiss bank, have similarly converted large numbers of their synthetic ETFs into physical equivalents. Deutsche’s decision, taken at the end of 2013, was seen as particularly significant as the German lender had long argued that synthetic products were a cheaper, more efficient option for investors than physical ETFs. The continuing retrenchment is widely regarded as a reaction to diminished investor appetite for such funds amid the hostile regulatory environment. Peter Sleep, senior portfolio manager at 7IM, the UK wealth manager, says: “My personal view is that there is not a lot of economic difference between synthetic and physical ETFs, but some clients do not feel the same way. “We took a commercial decision not to use synthetic ETFs in those sensitive accounts where clients show a positive bias towards physical ETFs.” Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, the consultancy, adds: “Many investors find synthetic ETFs to be difficult to grasp, while an ETF holding physical securities is a less complicated structure to understand.” Lyxor first began to reduce its reliance on synthetic products in 2012 when the asset manager converted its government bond ETFs into physical products. The French fund house reinforced the shift in 2014 by converting ETFs tracking the equity markets of France, Germany and Spain into a physical format. Supporters of synthetic ETFs argue that they are more efficient at tracking indices, particularly in less liquid markets. However, the costs of the derivatives used for synthetic ETFs have risen at a time when rival providers such as BlackRock’s iShares and Vanguard have been able to cut fees on directly competing physical ETFs. Arnaud Llinas, the global head of Lyxor’s indexing business, says it is now possible to track the Euro Stoxx 50 ETF more efficiently with physical replication than by using derivatives. More changes are in the pipeline. Lyxor plans to convert five developed-market equity ETFs into a physical structure by the end of 2016. The asset manager will favour physical replication for developed-market exposure while retaining synthetic replication for more complex strategies such as emerging markets, credit and smart beta, according to Mr Llinas. “There is simply no single replication method that works best in every case. We aim to take the best of both worlds, and use each method where it works best for investors,” he says. The French asset manager registered net inflows of $8.2bn into its ETF business in the first nine months of 2015, compared with the $5.6bn gathered over the whole of 2014, according to ETFGI. Lyxor has not announced fee cuts to accompany the latest changes in its ETF range, but Mr Llinas says he is ready to act if there is evidence the cost of buying rival ETFs is lower than Lyxor’s product range.', ""Dot-Com Millionaires. Almost everyone has heard this term.\n\nImagine registering mortgage.com twenty years ago. If you did, you can bet you probably wouldn’t need a mortgage today.\n\nBut that was twenty years ago. So, what if we told you that the greatest domain-name-appreciation era really started only a couple of years ago and is in full swing today, with China as the place everyone has to thank?\n\nWell, it did and it is.\n\nChina is home to some of the greatest wealth in the world, but converting that wealth to investment (especially overseas) has long been a challenge to its citizens. This obstacle has fueled the growth of many alternative investments in the past. Some investments turned out quite well, while others (like Bitcoin) were too young to maintain such growth.\n\nSo, what happens when you have an asset that comes along and is digital, tax-free, rare, portable and has a proven wholesale market? An unprecedented rise in value is what happens.\n\nWhen wealthy people decide to invest in something, it’s usually something rare in nature. It’s also usually something the general public typically knows little about. When the odd mainstream article mentions a painting selling for $100 million or a rare coin fetching $245,000 at auction, the real story is often underneath. And that real story typically contains an established wholesale market, an ever-growing demand over time and a verifiable sales history.\n\nDomain names have long been a core alternative investment for those in the know. Monthly reported sales are often over $20 million and unreported sales are estimated to be much higher. This isn’t something new either. DNJournal first started reporting domain name sales fourteen years ago. In the past few years alone, brands have been paying high dollars for important domain names. Witness Facebook acquiring FB.com for $8.5 million and the Texas Rangers’ purchase of Rangers.com for $375,000.\n\nBy almost all measures, the aftermarket industry for domain names has grown by leaps and bounds over the past decade. The industry conference, NamesCon, is even expected to draw well over 1,000 attendees from all over the world this January in Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, the real story today is not a single domain sale that fetched millions. The real story is the adoption of rare domain names by Chinese investors as an alternative investment. Domain names that fit the Chinese buying criteria are traded like commodities now, based on the rarity of the domain. Tens of millions of dollars are being put into domain name investment and the train doesn’t look like it's stopping any time soon.\n\nWhat’s happening in the domain name industry is far different than what happened with Bitcoin. As Tracy Fogarty ofeNamingpoints out, “Domain name sales is an established trade going back over two decades now. Regulators are probably not looking at domain names with a jaundiced eye because they do not have the same potential to disrupt traditional banking systems.”\n\nAnd it makes sense. Domain names act a lot like Bitcoin in terms of storage and portability, but domain names are different in three areas that matter.\n\nRarity\n\nThe domain name industry historically reports weekly sales of keyword and brand domains that are among its top earners. Domains like HomeCare.com, Timeless.com and Whisky.com.\n\nToday is different, with numeric and short domains (often unpronounceable to the Western world) defying all traditional domain-name investment logic and shattering record charts. For example, according to DNJournal:\n\n989.com was just sold for $818,181.\n\n899.com changed hands for $801,000.\n\n588.com grabbed $1,000,000.\n\nWhile these type of domain names have always had value, the explosion has also led to five-number domains (like 87899.com), six-number domains and even longer combinations attracting thousands of dollars in bids.\n\nChina, after all, is a numbers culture.\n\nAnd the demand doesn’t stop there.\n\nFor non-Chinese investors, domains like mzqy.com and yybw.com were traditionally of lower demand since they never passed the radio test. Today, however, four-letter combinations are bringing in ever-increasing prices. Take one look at leading auction house NameJet’s home page and you will see a vast number of four-letter dot coms or visit LLLLsales.com to view market sales activity for only four-letter domains.\n\nOn the surface, this may seem to make little sense.\n\nBut it certainly does.\n\nFor many domain-name buyers, the Chinese alphabet is unknown. That’s because there is none. Numbers and symbols have the most meaning in Chinese, with certain letters representing many possible combinations of meaning. The one big difference is that there are no vowels represented. Any domain name with an A, E, I, O or U, or with the letter V, is considered second tier. Domains without these letters are considered premium.\n\nGoing back to the rarity of things. Every type of dot-com domain has a defined supply. There are only 100 Number Number (NN) dot-com domains – standing for two-digit numbers, such as 51.com or 86.com. Additionally, there are only 1,000 three-number (NNN) dot coms and 676 two-letter dot coms (like AA.com, MC.com and other well-defined sets of domain names).\n\nInvestors even break these small groups into more valuable groups. Only so many contain an 8, only so many have repeating numbers, only so many have premium Chinese characters, etc. While it may sound like millions of domain names, the reality is that the number of dot coms defined as premium is relatively small.\n\nBitcoin didn’t have this. There are more than 12 million Bitcoins available today and each one is worth the same value. Bitcoin was built as a currency model; domains were not. As the old expression goes: “They’re not making any good dot coms anymore.” It’s true. The best dot coms were taken long ago and the ones that expire today are typically bid on by many investors.\n\nLiquidity (Established Wholesale Market)\n\nPeople have been buying and collecting domain names for years, with millions sold every week. Public companies like GoDaddy, Web.com and Marchex earn millions from domain name auctions and sales every year.\n\nHaving an extremely liquid market with thousands of wholesale buyers is something Bitcoin didn’t have relative to its scale. Bitcoins were hard to convert to cash. Companies like Coinbase only entered the market a couple of years ago, and for people outside of North America the options for liquidity were even fewer. Sure, you could own a million dollars in Bitcoins but cashing out was not an easy thing to do. This has certainly improved, but Bitcoins (or almost any crypto currency) don’t have the long history of an established market. Domain names do.\n\nPortability\n\nNo customs declaration. No property taxes. No annual fees (outside of a $10 registration fee). Domestic and international escrow services. Ownership privacy. If there was ever an asset made to handle Chinese wealth, it was domain names.\n\nWill it last?\n\nWho knows. But even if values do back down a little, there seems to be a pool of investors willing to buy in. If there’s any good time to learn Chinese and the importance of numbers and characters in the Chinese culture, it’s today."", 'Madison Marriage NOVEMBER 7, 2015 1 Several senior staff have left Franklin Templeton as the US investment house struggles to halt billions of dollars of outflows from its funds amid a challenging environment for emerging markets. Senior employees across the company’s investment, sales, operations and human resources teams have quit Franklin Templeton in the past six months, according to an asset management consultant that has worked with the company. The departures have taken place during one of the worst years on record for Franklin. It has suffered $33.4bn of net outflows since January, following $6bn of withdrawals last year, according to Morningstar, the research group. Last week Franklin also fell out of a ranking of the 20 largest fund houses globally for the first time in five years. The group’s assets under management dropped 11 per cent in the three months to the end of September, to $771bn. The consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “Franklin Templeton has [suffered] substantial outflows of people, not just on the investment side but also on the corporate side [of the business]. “There are questions to be asked for Franklin. It had been a well-performing business for a long time.” A spokesperson for Franklin, which has seen its share price fall by 25 per cent since January, said: “Like every firm in our industry, we recognise portfolio manager changes will occur. We have some of the longest tenured senior investment leaders.” Rory Callagy, an analyst at Moody’s, the rating agency, said Franklin has been at the centre of a “perfect storm”: overexposure to emerging markets, misguided bets on energy prices, weak performance and heavy withdrawals. One of the most senior employees to have left is Amy Wang, who ran the company’s Beijing office for the past 12 years. Ms Wang joined Pioneer Investments, the Italian asset manager, in September as its head of institutional business for Greater China. Matthew Pang, Franklin’s former deputy head of institutional business in China, moved to Schroders in April, while Robert Elfström, its former sales director for the Nordic region, left to join UK asset manager F&C in May. Several experienced investment staff have also left the company this year, including Steven Bowen, who quit Franklin in March after working as an analyst on its Mutual European fund for eight years, and Lisa Myers, who quit as a portfolio manager in May. A New York-based headhunter said: “We have seen movement [of staff out of Franklin in relation to] internal changes and restructuring. We have had people thinking about leaving who [previously said] they would not leave.” A former Franklin employee, who left the company’s European business last year, added: “There have been a few sales departures. You have to think about the pressure on profits and the fixed income losses.” But he added: “Franklin is very long term so they tend to ride out any period of volatility. I don’t think the company will be overly worried.” Profits at Franklin Resources, the asset manager’s parent company, fell 44 per cent in the three months to the end of September, largely as a result of customers pulling money from its flagship funds.']"
11/08/2015,"[""2015 was a good year for Bitcoin; and some say this could very well be reflected in its overall value the past two months. The currency has reached yearly highs in both volume and price over the course of September-October. This enthusiasm may be because of the large quantities of capital being injected into the digital infrastructure. Excitement grows as Bitcoin and blockchain firms within the industry have received a record US$1 Billion in investments as the year comes to an end.\n\nThe virtual currency experienced a record year of investments as money poured into crypto-related startups, seed accelerators and incubators. At the end of 2014, Uphold (formerly Bitreserve) received a record US$9.5 Million from a Series-B investment round. It was the second largest venture capital investment in the industry for the year. At the beginning of the New Year, the price of bitcoin reached new lows but the groundwork for blockchain infrastructure continued. The first quarter of 2015 revealed blockchain-related venture capital investments had surpassed the entire 12 months of funding from the previous year.\n\nThe wallet and exchange service Coinbase was the first to collect one of the largest funding rounds of 2015. The venture backing of US$75 Million came from the Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) Growth Fund led by the prominent blockchain investor Tim Draper. Among the DFJ investment capital injection also came from groups like, the New York Stock Exchange, USAA, BBVA (Spain), Andreessen Horowitz, and others. This news marked one of the first investments from traditional finance institutions and legacy banks. It was the year Bitcoin Jesus told us ‘2015 is the Year Bitcoin Will Integrate with the Traditional Finance System,’ which seems to have come to fruition.\n\nThe same month in January, the Winklevoss twins announced their Bitcoin exchange Gemini that was reported to come with a completely legal and regulated service. This news was followed by Overstock.com’s Patrick Byrne disclosure of his new concept Medici a “next generation” stock-exchange that implements blockchain technology. Byrne’s platform in its beta stage later rebranded as TØ and enabled a real-time short sale over the blockchain showing the team was serious. Then the Winklevoss twin’s Gemini exchange passed through the regulatory process and opened its doors to traders.\n\nOver the course of the year, new businesses and services continued to be built and were generously funded throughout the industry. Blockchain investments kept flowing into startups from groups like Blythe Masters Digital Asset Holdings LLC and Boost VC. Adam and Tim Draper’s Boost VC has funded the start of roughly 120 new Bitcoin and distributed ledger companies. This July, Tally Capitals CEO Matthew Roszak helped start a Chicago Bitcoin-focused incubator that the company launched in the cities infamous 1871 building. Another seed accelerator Blockchain Capital a digital-tech focused venture capital fund helped deploy 17 portfolio startups as well this year.\n\nMore capital funding came to companies like Circle Financial and BitFury showing many were scrambling to be leaders in the new crypto-architecture being built. Circle has been growing its enterprise quite a bit in 2015 thanks to the US$50 million in funding from Goldman Sachs. While BitFury is building a technology park in Georgia with its capital investments and also partnering with 3M to build the world's largest two-phase immersion cooling system.\n\nThe year has shown a larger increase and constant investments all year long in contrast to 2014. Overall positive media and increased trust from traditional institutions as 9 of the largest banks in the world are interested in the technology. This along with strong bitcoin buying volume across the continent of China has seemed have to pumped up the cryptocurrency’s value, and created much enthusiasm throughout the community. 2016 is sure to have its surprises as bitcoin has always been an investment that is filled with unexpected events and celebration. With 1 Billion in capital funnelled into the environment so far, we're just getting started!"", ""Europe-based bitcoin services provider Cashila has recently released a Bitwage-like Euro-to-Bitcoin payroll system, allowing European employees to request their wages to be paid in bitcoin through a simple bank or SEPA payment.\n\nThe payment process of the sender or the employer will stay the exactly the same. On the Cashila platform, the receiver will create a payroll request with the inclusion of necessary bank details, including specific reference number, IBAN Bank account number, payment amount, etc.\n\nOnce completed, employees and freelancers can export the invoice as a PDF or send it via email to their employers and wait for the payment to be processed by the bank and Cashila.\n\nThe users of the platform may also receive bitcoin through a European bank account, by transferring bitcoins to the platform’s Euro Wallet, then immediately converting to Euros.\n\nThrough this service called “Reserve Cashila Feature,” the Cashilla team aims to help spur mainstream bitcoin growth in Europe, and protect freelancers and employees from bitcoin price volatility.\n\nCashila co-founder Jani Valjavec stated:\n\n“This is a faster and cheaper version of banking as we know it. Your version.”\n\nUpon its launch, the service received criticism from the bitcoin community due to its inefficient payment setup. For example, one anonymous Cashila user explained that it is time-consuming and inefficient to generate a reference message for each transaction.\n\n“Give me my own personal IBAN (my own not a catch-all one) with automatic conversion to bitcoin and automatic sending of the bitcoins to a wallet of my choice. That's what I want,” stated the user.\n\nHave you tried Cashila or any other bitcoin payroll service? Please comment and share your experience below!"", 'The value of bitcoin has rocketed higher since late August, gaining more than 60% as investors around the world clamor to buy into the cryptocurrency.\n\nIt recently hit new highs for the year.\n\nLong-term bitcoin watchers have seen this happen before, and they know that bitcoin rallies can be huge.\n\nThe last time bitcoin\'s value began soaring the cryptocurrency went from below $200 in September 2013 to more than $1100 by early 2014.\n\nRight now – after the recent gains – bitcoin is trading at around $380. That\'s right, after that peak last year, bitcoin crashed – badly damaging investor interest. It took more than a year for that interest to return.\n\nSo what\'s bringing people back? The digital currency is gaining traction both in the consumer marketplace, as a tradeable security, and with regulators. To illustrate - you can donate to the American Red Cross in bitcoin, buy a new personal computer with it, or even book a holiday.\n\nIt isn\'t just digital-currency enthusiasts that are bullish. Equity research firm Wedbush expects it to rise to $600 because of the growing adoption. That target includes a ""high discount rate to account for uncertainty,"" the firm says in a Nov. 4 research note. In other words, there is a lot of risk here, but even factoring that in, the potential exists for a big gain.\n\n“We’re crossing the chasm from early enthusiasts to mainstream adoption,"" says Adam White, a vice president of business development with bitcoin exchange Coinbase.\n\nAs more people use bitcoin, retailers have become increasingly welcoming of it.\n\nCompanies including Dish, Microsoft, Dell and Expedia are accepting cryptocurrency as payment.\n\nPerhaps most crucial: payments startups and legacy players including Square, Stripe, and PayPal are integrating it into their offerings.\n\nRegulation is evolving\n\nRegulators in the US and internationally are embracing bitcoin now, instead of fearing — or, worse still, thwarting — it.\n\n""What there needs to be is greater regulatory clarity,"" said Jerry Brito, executive director at Washington-based advocacy group Coin Center. ""It\'s a very different world than it was in 2013.""\n\nBitcoin legislation is being readied in several US states, Brito said.\n\nIn October, a consortium of startups announced the establishment of the Blockchain Alliance, a partnership between bitcoin companies and US and foreign agencies including the Department of Justice, FBI and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, among others.\n\nLast month, the European Court of Justice said bitcoin transactions will be exempted from a consumer tax, which could lead to even greater use of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAnother big step, yet to come, would be the declaration of bitcoin by US regulators as a security.\n\nBig investors are buying in\n\nAnother factor lending greater legitimacy to bitcoin is the investment capital being poured into related startups.\n\nRecently, the total dollar volume backing startups in the sector crossed the $1 billion threshold. But the investors behind the money have also increased bitcoin\'s visibility.\n\nThe roster of bitcoin startup backers includes Wall Street investment banks; the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ; and leading credit and debit card companies including Visa, MasterCard and Capital One.\n\n""The global banks and wire-houses have meaningfully gotten involved in the space,"" said Michael Sonnenshein, director of business development and sales at Grayscale Investments, which manages the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a publicly listed vehicle that tracks bitcoin. ""In 2013, they were beginning to dip their toe, but primarily behind closed doors and within internal working groups.""\n\nThere are still lingering issues surrounding bitcoin\'s validity.\n\nTo be sure, it is volatile and – because its loosely regulated – a draw for frauds and criminals.\n\nSome big names in the crytptocurrency community — perhaps most notably Blythe Masters, the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings — have been critical of bitcoin and say the underpinning blockchain technology is actually what\'s most sexy to Wall Street.\n\nBut right now, to many investors, bitcoin is hot. And it could stay that way.', 'Bhagwan Chowdhry, a professor of finance at UCLA, has nominated Satoshi Nakamoto, for the 2016 Nobel Prize in economics, according to the Huffington Post. The professor was asked by the Nobel Prize committee to nominate someone for the prize.\n\nChowdhry said likely candidates for the prize include Paul Romer at New York University, Doug Diamond at the University of Chicago, and Steve Ross at the Massachusetts of Technology, for the work they did in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBut in thinking about whose ideas have had a disruptive influence in the 21st Century, Chowdhry said Nakamoto jumped to his mind. He noted that Nakamoto has not published in any of the scholarly economics or finance journals where one would normally look to for an honoree. But Nakamoto has published a 9-page white paper, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” which he posted on May 24, 2009 on the Internet.\n\nA Whimsical Nomination?\n\nThe nomination of Nakamoto is somewhat whimsical as he is an outsider to the economics profession, similar to Romain Rolland nominating Sigmund Freud for the Nobel Prize in 1936 – in literature, not medicine.\n\nBut Chowdhry said he is completely serious in nominating Nakamoto since bitcoin is a revolutionary invention. Physical currencies have been used historically for currency. Paper currency is now ubiquitous globally with countries and regions using their own currencies to support exchange. Bitcoin, on the other hand, exists only as a mathematical object and is digital. The currency offers numerous advantages over paper and physical currencies; it is secure as it relies on a cryptographic code. It can divide into smaller sub-units, and it can transfer nearly instantaneously and securely from one individual to another via the Internet, circumventing central banks, governments and financial intermediaries. The ability to bypass intermediaries reduces time delays and transaction costs.\n\nBitcoin Will Change Finance\n\nIn addition to creating a reliable currency, bitcoin has spawned innovations in the financial technology sector since financial contracts can be digitized, stored, verified and transferred instantaneously. Chowdhry said this will result in an open, decentralized public infrastructure for transacting money.\n\nBitcoin will change how people think about money and will likely disrupt central banks’ role in conducting monetary policy, Chowdhry said. It will also undermine costly money transfer services like Western Union and eliminate the transaction tax levied by intermediaries like MasterCard, Visa and PayPal. In addition, it will remove lengthy and costly notary and escrow services.\n\nIndustries such as banking, law and finance will transform due to bitcoin.\n\nThe poor will benefit from greater financial and social inclusion in the future.\n\n“I can barely think of another innovation in economic and finance in the last several decades whose influence surpasses the welfare increases that will be engendered by Satoshi Nakamoto’s brilliant, path-breaking invention.”\n\nAlso read: New bitcoin short film: Finding Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nWill Satoshi Accept The Prize?\n\nWhile Nakamoto cannot be contacted, Chowdhry said that does not mean he does not exist. He exists online. Nakamoto has anonymously communicated with the computer science and cryptographic community. If he accepts the award, he will be able to communicate his acceptance.\n\nWhile Nakamoto will not likely appear in person to accept the award, Chowdhry said he will accept it for him at the ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden in December.\n\nNakamoto could choose to send an acceptance speech which Chowdhry said he would be happy to present on his behalf.\n\nChowdhry said he is not looking to get the prize money by accepting the award on Nakamoto’s behalf. He said the Nobel committee can buy bitcoins from an exchange and transfer it to him. He noted there is a known bitcoin address for Nakamoto from an early transaction.\n\nImages from Shutterstock, UCLA & Wikimedia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'New Bitcoin ATMs now up and running\n\nAndrew Konja from Novi stands next to one of his Bitcoin ATMs on Friday, Nov. 6, 2015 at Timmy\'s Market in Detroit.

Many of his regular customers were at first perplexed by the odd device with a weird name.\n\n""A lot of people ask, \'What is this?\' "" Mikhael said last week. ""I say bitcoin. They ask, \'What is that?\' ""\n\nBitcoin emerged from tech geek obscurity two years ago as a hot new currency for the Internet age without ties to any country or central bank. Coveted by futurists and libertarians, the currency\'s exchange value rocketed from under $14 in early 2013 to over $1,000 for 1 bitcoin by that December.\n\nTales of Bitcoin Millionaires hit the media, and online merchants such as Overstock.com started accepting bitcoin payers. As curiosity grew, a small number of bricks-and-mortar businesses in Michigan began accepting bitcoin and a handful of bitcoin ATMs popped up.\n\nBut momentum faded throughout 2014 as bitcoin\'s exchange value began to plummet back to $200. Negative factors included the collapse of the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange in Japan called Mt. Gox, where nearly 650,000 bitcoins were ultimately lost or stolen, and an unpopular Internal Revenue Service declaration that bitcoin would be treated as property for tax purposes and not currency.\n\nBuy Photo Tracking Bitcoin\'s ups and downs.

Whether the currency ever expands beyond its niche and goes mainstream is an open question.\n\n""Does every average consumer need to have bitcoin to survive? I don\'t know that we\'re at that stage yet,"" said Michael Dupree Jr., a Michigan native and owner of EasyBit, a Denver-based bitcoin ATM company. ""But if you\'re a consumer and you want to go online and buy stuff and potentially get a better deal using bitcoin, I do highly recommend it.""\n\nMore than 30 metro Detroit businesses currently take bitcoin payments, according the CoinMap website, or more than triple the number in January 2014. However, several of the listings are small online catalogs; two others, including a cosmetic surgeon\'s office, denied accepting bitcoin when contacted for this report.\n\nDonald Katz Law in Birmingham is one of two or three law practices in the state that currently takes bitcoin as payment from clients. In an interview, attorney Donald Katz said his firm got into bitcoin in the belief that some type of digital currency is bound to eventually catch on.\n\nThere are at least 6 bitcoin ATMs now in metro Detroit (Photo: JC Reindl)\n\n""If you want to pay me in Visa or MasterCard or bitcoin, to me there\'s no difference,"" Katz said. ""I would take beaver pelts as long as I can convert it to cash and put it in my retirement account.""\n\nHe has done two bitcoin transactions for legal services since last fall: one for an individual and the other involving a company. One of those clients was overseas in a country with tight currency controls and needed a way to move money, he said. He subsequently transferred the cyber currency into real dollars through a bitcoin exchange website.\n\n""I look at it as an asset transfer,"" Katz said. ""For a big transaction, it makes a lot of sense. If you\'re buying a company and you want to buy it in bitcoin, we can do that.""\n\nOther recent bitcoin converts include Chickpea in the D eatery and Urban Bean Co. coffee shop, both in downtown Detroit. Chickpea owner David Ayyash said he gets about four bitcoin-paying customers a week, typically men in their 20s and 30s.\n\n""We had a couple customers ask for it and so we figured, \'Why not?,\' "" Ayyash said. ""We don\'t get a ton of bitcoin customers, but it seems to be increasing.""\n\nBitcoin fans praise the Bronx Deli in Pontiac and Farmington Hills as the first Michigan restaurant to allow take bitcoin. The Farmington Hills location currently gets about three bitcoin customers a day, which is slightly fewer than when it had a bitcoin ATM on premises, said cashier Morgan Pearson. (The ATM was removed this summer for maintenance and has not returned.)\n\nThere is a dark side to bitcoin as well. It has become a favored currency among extortionists, drug dealers and underworld types.\n\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan said last year that computer hackers had seized control of a city database and demanded 2,000 bitcoins -- or nearly $750,000 at current rates. The city did not pay that ransom because it didn\'t need the database.\n\nMore recently, the 67-year-old chairman of a Hong Kong oil exploration company was abducted in September by kidnappers who demanded a bitcoin ransom equal to $9 million. He was rescued in Taiwan by police, who found him with shackled feet and bruises and cigarette burns, according to media reports.\n\nFor other, non-criminal reasons, some early bitcoiners have gone back to only dollars.\n\nMatthew Abramsky, co-owner of Tony’s Ace Hardware in Hazel Park, started accepting bitcoin in late 2013 to see if the new currency would attract new customers. Bitcoin transactions avoid the typical 2.5% to 3.5% transaction fees on credit cards, although merchants must still charge customers sales tax.\n\nAbramsky said he did about $500 worth of bitcoin business, including the sale of a snow blower, but discontinued the experiment after a processing problem with a transaction.\n\n""It was nice to be there at the beginning, but it was also nice to get out before something bad happens,"" he said last week.

He speaks at bitcoin conferences, regularly transacts business with it and personally owns about 260 bitcoins, worth just under $100,000 as of Friday. He praises bitcoin for its ability to lower the barriers to conducting business between richer countries and poorer countries that have less developed financial services and fewer people with bank accounts.\n\nA bitcoin ATM at Ace Check Cashing in Detroit (Photo: JC Reindl)\n\nSmith initially viewed the currency as simply an investment opportunity, ""but then I got into bitcoin and found out all the cool things it could do for people and fell in love with it.""

""I think I would ride it all the way down"" he said.\n\nSmith recalled an atmosphere of near euphoria during a late 2013 bitcoin conference in Las Vegas that he attended while the currency\'s exchange value was climbing above $1,000 for 1 bitcoin. One year later, the mood was much more subdued, even though bitcoin had become more useful as a currency. The big difference was the collapse in price.\n\n""I wasn\'t around for the tulip bubble, but there were probably a lot of similar characteristics,"" Smith said, a reference to the mid-1600s Dutch ""tulip mania"" that is considered a classic example of a speculative bubble that inevitably bursts.\n\nThe bitcoin ATM inside Timmy\'s Market, 17700 W. Seven Mile in Detroit, is one of six in southeast Michigan belonging to Southfield-based MT Group. All of them are located in gas stations, check-cashing or party stores.\n\nThe machines are all one-way ATMs that change dollars into bitcoin for a person\'s virtual wallet, but do not spit out cash. The machines typically charge a 3% to 6% markup and pay small commissions to the owner of the store.\n\nThe six ATMs have a $100 upload minimum and collectively do 100-150 daily transactions, said Andrew Konja, MT Group\'s owner. The machines have a driver\'s license swipe and fingerprint reader for extra security on large transactions.\n\nCashing out of bitcoin is typically done via bitcoin exchanges such as Coinbase.com that change and deposit dollars into a banking account. Bitcoin experts say a small number of two-way bitcoin ATMs do exist in the U.S., although so far none in Michigan.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to buy significant quantities of bitcoin with a credit card either online or through an ATM because of fraud concerns.\n\nFor economists, one significant innovation found in virtual currencies like bitcoin is the ability to conduct fast, secure and friction-less monetary transactions across borders, especially in countries such as China with rigid governmental controls over how much money is allowed to leave.\n\n""It\'s the fact that you can move the money without it being controlled by a minister of finance or anyone else,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\'s Ross School of Business and its law school. ""That\'s what I think will give it mainstream allure.""\n\nThat theory could explain the recent observations of Sam Kulaak, a clerk at Ace Check Cashing, 20011 Plymouth Road in Detroit, who has chatted with people who used the location\'s new bitcoin ATM.\n\n""I ask sometimes what they use it for, and they say, \'Well, I\'m buying something from China,\' "" Kulaak said.\n\nContact JC Reindl: 313-222-6631 or jcreindl@freepress.com.

Currently, China is leading the digital currency exchange Industry by having one of the largest concentrations of cryptocurrency exchanges and where the highest bitcoin trading volumes can be found.\n\nMost of the Chinese Bitcoin exchanges have large trading volumes. Besides the high trading volumes, some of the possible motivations leading newcomers to use Chinese exchanges are the low fees and other benefits (such as referral programs that offer up to 50%) which many Chinese exchanges offer to their customers.\n\nHigh trading volumes are essentially the main attraction tempting traders to come to the exchanges; however, a lot of other techniques are used to motivate traders to choose an exchange over the other. In this sense, Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges have quite a roll of benefits that raise the bar for other competitors. Taking it as an example, LakeBTC, one of the largest Chinese bitcoin exchanges does not charge a fee for deposits. Users can deposit Fiat currency via a bank transfer without having extra costs. It works as an incentive for traders and helps leverage the profits from trading activities.\n\nLakeBTC is a big Chinese BTC exchange. It is one of the “Big Four” BTC exchanges. Founded in early 2013, the exchange integrated a Ripple gateway enabling its customers to bypass all the delays and international bank transfers associated costs. The exchange allows customers to trade in 4 of the major Fiat currencies and it charges very low to virtually no fees. All these advantages are certainly good methods of attracting new traders to the exchange.\n\nTo have a more incisive view on the Chinese Bitcoin landscape, NewsBTC interviewed Jeremy Cho, the Communications Manager at LakeBTC.\n\nNewsBTC – Can you tell us a little bit of LakeBTC history and vision?\n\nLakeBTC was started in March 2013 by a group of financial industry veterans. Initially, it was like a side project for a small group of professional capital market traders from investment banks and hedge funds. Later that year, the team decided to incorporate and officially run the exchange under the current domain name. Unlike many other companies in this sector, LakeBTC was born with strong risk management genes and customers’ assets are in good hands with us. Today, LakeBTC is dedicated to bring the latest technologies into the financial services industry and serve users from all over the world. We support trading services between cryptocurrencies and FIAT currencies, and our wallet service is secure, reliable, and free.\n\nNewsBTC – We would like to hear your comments on the Chinese Digital currency exchange landscape.\n\nAgain, our focus is aimed at international market. Zero trading fees in the Chinese market is not a healthy indicator at all. If an exchange makes no money from the trading commission fees, it will make it up by either getting involved in high-risk business or committing fraud eventually. No matter what the users will suffer all the loss. Recently bitcoin price pump-and-dump is probably related to a market manipulation, especially for those places with 5x to 50x leverages. LakeBTC has a comprehensive market surveillance program to make sure we provide a secure, liquid, and fair marketplace to all participants. We have offices in Shanghai, but our customer base comes from all continents. As a matter of fact, the majority of our users are from outside China. That being said, we do have our perspectives and sources to interpret the Chinese regulatory and ecosystem landscape. Compared to many other countries, Chinese authorities do have an accurate and clear understanding of cryptocurrencies. As of now, the regulatory environment is reasonable and appropriate – to fight against money laundering and Ponzi schemes on one hand, and to encourage innovations on the other. LakeBTC is compliant with all applicable laws/regulations and we do strict AML/KYC checks. This is to the best interest of our users too.\n\nNewsBTC – LakeBTC is one of the major Chinese BTC exchanges. We heard you have some interesting plans for 2016. Can you comment on that?\n\nOur goal is to make financial services affordable and accessible to all users globally. To that end, we’ll add more financial products to LakeBTC, make deposits and withdrawals more convenient and cost-efficient to people from different countries, and make our application more user-friendly. We’ll further strengthen our technology security measures, risk management, and internal control processes. LakeBTC is probably the only major exchange with zero security events since inception.\n\nNewsBTC – Bitcoin and the Blockchain are going mainstream. Many investments are being made in the industry. Besides your plans for 2016 what more can you tell us about future prospects for the exchange?\n\nLakeBTC started from a bitcoin exchange, but we will be more than that. LakeBTC is a wallet plus an exchange, and its way beyond bitcoin. The goal is to enable all users to send/receive payments worldwide easily and instantly for free, to trade currencies, equities, bonds, commodities, funds and all other financial products and asset classes they like, to manage their day-to-day spending and balance long-term risk appetites and returns without paying hefty fees.\n\nNewsBTC – What’s your take on the digital currency Industry current situation?\n\nAs far as bitcoin industry is concerned, there are both positive and negative signs. It’s getting more attention from the public and big banks (and the regulators). On the other hand, hashing power concentration, politics in the community, security scandals, and market manipulations cast a shadow on the reputation and the future of bitcoin. There’s still a long way ahead of us and we are still in the early stage of the development of bitcoin. LakeBTC, as a leading bitcoin firm, will be working hard to bring more innovations to all users and at the same time, stress on security, liquidity, and fairness more than ever before.\n\nImage', 'We are in a digital currency age. In the past couple of years, the startup ecosystem has experienced a bitcoin boom signified by an increasing number of startups focusing on bitcoin and blockchain related technologies. The advantages of blockchain technology is now widely recognized, especially by the banking and financial sectors.\n\nThe growth of interest in cryptocurrency technologies and its implementation in various critical operations makes it important to ensure the quality of software standards in terms of usability and security is fit to meet the requirements of the organizations/institutions implementing it. This situation has given rise to software review, audit and certification requirements.\n\nCryptoCurrency Certification Consortium is one such organization which has taken upon itself to establish standards in the cryptocurrency industry. The non-profit entity within the Bitcoin industry’s who’s who on board is focused on developing a yardstick for the industry which can be used to measure cryptocurrency technology based applications and platforms on various fronts including usability, privacy, security, trust and decentralization. The member on the board of directors of the organization includes Andreas M Antonopoulos, Vitalik Buterin, Joshua McDougall, Pamela Morgan and Michael Perklin. The organization’s website also lists executives and developers from various established bitcoin companies as advisors.\n\nCryptoCurrency Certification Consortium offers certification programs to those who are interested to venture into the bitcoin sector. These certifications will help newbies as well as those who are already involved with bitcoin understand the history, various aspects of bitcoin technology, bitcoin based products and its uses, security features, best practices when it comes to coding and more.\n\nCryptoCurrency Certification Consortium currently has two certification programs in its offering – The Certified Bitcoin Professional (CBP) and Certified Bitcoin Expert (CBX). These certification tests will include a series of questions which requires in-depth understanding of bitcoin and blockchain to answer. Those who clear the exam will be certified as a bitcoin professional by the organization. While CBP is suited for everyone who enters the bitcoin domain, CBX is tailor made for those who are directly involved in development and testing of digital currency environments. The CBX program will be soon available for those who are involved in development, security, audit and digital forensics.\n\nThe consortium has also created a draft security framework that sets security standards for cryptocurrency systems across the world. The CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium seems to be all set to take upon itself a role similar to that of ISO in the Bitcoin industry.', 'Scalability is an issue that keeps plaguing the world of computer science and electronic engineering. Even though computer chips are becoming smaller and smaller over time, there is only so much space that can be filled with all of these electronic components. Addressing the scalability issue is just a matter of decentralizing the computing processes, according to various industry experts. But IBM is not so convinced, as they are experimenting with 5D blood to solve this problem.\n\nAlso read: Talib Kweli and Bitcoin Is Music To Our Ears\n\n5D Blood Provides Power and Cooling to Computer Chips\n\nIntroducing any form of liquid to computer parts sounds like a dangerous task, but in most cases, it is relatively safe to do so. That is, assuming the people working on this concept know what they are doing. In the case of IBM, it is safe to say they have a few people on hand who know a thing or two about liquid-cooled computer chips.\n\nIn fact, liquid cooling has allowed companies and consumers to cram more hardware into a PC case than ever before. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of “empty room” left, which can not be feasibly filled with any components at this point. Once again, there is only so much that can be achieved without thinking so far out-of-the-box there is no box left in sight.\n\nHeat dissipation is a key issue when stacking more and more hardware into a pc case. Granted, there is an option of making PC cases larger, but that isn’t a solution to the problem by any means. Solutions have to be found to make everything even more compact, yet allow for more components to be stacked close to one another. This is where the concept of “5D blood” comes into play.\n\nThe idea of 5D blood has nothing to do with human or animal blood as we know it, but rather creating a way to dissipate heat and provide power at the same time. One should look at 5D blood as charged-up electromechanical fluid, which can both cool computer chips and provide power to it at the same time. Once it has completed this job, 5D blood needs to be recharged through an internal system loop, and repeat this task over and over again.\n\nSo far, IBM has reached an “early stage of development” for creating 5D blood, as the company managed to get the whole thing to work as advertised. At the time of publication, roughly ten milliwatts of power can be delivered to a chip, although it is still too early to tell whether or not 5D blood properly works as a cooling solution as well. More research is needed over the next few years, but if IBM can achieve the numbers proposed in their research paper, the future of computing will look vastly different.\n\nAn Interesting Concept With Bitcoin Ramifications\n\nAssuming this project ever matures into a mainstream solution for both providing power and cooling computer components, 5D blood could play a key role in the future of Bitcoin mining. Right now, there are a lot of concerns regarding Bitcoin mining, as there is a ton of energy required to do so, and cooling machines is becoming incredibly difficult.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it looks like hardware manufacturers have reached a theoretical invisible wall regarding making computer chips more efficient to generate Bitcoins. There is only so much that can be done with the minuscule surface of computer chips these days. Solutions like 5D blood can tackle both energy requirement and cooling issues, as well as improve overall device efficiency down the line.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the concept of 5D blood? Will it have an impact on Bitcoin mining at all, in your opinion? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nSource: Ars Technica\n\nImages courtesy of IBM, Shutterstock\n\nOriginally posted on: Is 5D Blood The Answer To Making Bitcoin Mining More Efficient?', 'Ryan X. Charles published a Medium post that gained a lot of attention earlier this year due to the former Reddit employee’s contention that Bitcoin could help solve some of the problems associated with the “Frontpage of the Internet”. The perpetual Bitcoin developer is now working on a decentralized version of Reddit, known as Datt, and he believes that the financial incentives involved with this new platform could foster higher quality content than people are used to seeing on most social media platforms. Although Datt is often referred to as a new, improved version of Reddit, Charles contends that the feel of this new social media app will be completely new and different.\n\nAlso Read: The Final Silk Road Bitcoin Auction Has Occurred\n\nReddit is Not Interested in Financial Incentives\n\nRyan X. Charles recently provided an update on the development of Datt at a SF Bitcoin Meetup, and he contrasted his new, Bitcoin-powered social media application with Reddit at a few different points during his talk. According to Charles, one of the main differences between Datt and Reddit is that Datt embraces financial incentives and free markets. During his presentation, Charles made the point that Reddit is not interested in making finance any part of the user experience:\n\n“Reddit is actually philosophically opposed to everything I’ve been saying in this talk because they’re opposed to making finance any part of the Reddit experience. It’s all free. You cannot sell a subreddit to someone. That’s against their terms of service; you’ll get banned. You cannot buy upvotes; that’s against their terms of service. Any time you start paying for anything on Reddit, it’s against the rules.”\n\nFree Markets are Embraced by Datt\n\nCharles added that Datt will embrace commerce and allow users to buy and sell nearly anything they want on the platform. Due to the integration of financial incentives, such as attaching a small amount of bitcoin to each upvote, it would seem that Datt could become a platform for content creators to publish and monetize their work directly. Charles summarized his overall view of bringing commerce to social media during his talk:\n\n“[Commerce] is not against the rules on [Datt]. You are paying other people for producing content. If you write something good and people pay you, that’s a good thing. I want to create a market. If there end up being subreddits on this thing that people own, then I want people to be able to buy and sell the subreddits. The feeling will be completely different.”\n\nThere are plenty of individuals and businesses who already use Reddit as a marketing tool, but Datt will be a more explicit version of this concept. An early version of Datt will be available in November, and this bare bones implementation could offer a chance for Charles, the rest of the Datt development team, and content creators to see what works and what doesn’t.\n\nAdding Financial Incentives to Social Media\n\nAt its core, Datt is adding financial incentives to social media. Whether this concept will fail or succeed is unknown at this point, but Ryan X. Charles believes there is a chance for the platform to generate higher quality content than what is found on Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media applications. Charles briefly explained this point during his presentation:\n\n“My goal is to create something a little more professional. I think if we do this correctly, the content quality will be higher. People will be correctly incentivized to, say, write a really good article; they’ll spend five or ten more minutes on it and make it really good because they’re like, ‘It might make a difference.’”\n\nIf the financial incentives are structured in the correct manner, it’s possible that Datt could become the new, preferred publishing platform for content creators. It’s unclear if attaching money to upvotes is a good idea, but it seems that the general idea of creating a social media platform that is also a vessel for generating income is a concept that may hold some promise.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

A report from Online Headquarters of Kaspersky Lab security experts securelist.com shows that in Q2 2015, the percentage of spam in email traffic was 53.4%. According to cnet.com, about 30% of Americans knowingly open spam, to which they say: ""I know I shouldn\'t, but I will."" It\'s time to say “No”.\n\nScammers demanding money for the Syrian Electronic Army in New Zealand\n\nThe latest report on major email scams comes from a news website stuff.co.nz, based in New Zealand. Hackers claiming to be the Syrian Electronic Army are sending emails demanding a ransom of $1,500 in Bitcoin to support ISIS\' army in its war. Hackers demand to send money to a specified account within 72 hours, otherwise someone from the email recipient’s family is promised to be killed. The text of the email says:\n\n""If you refuse to pay the money all the important files from your computer will be deleted. Also, if you will go to the police after you have paid the money we will destroy you and all your family.""\n\nEmails contain personal information of the recipient, such as their phone number, IP address and date of birth. Moreover, the alleged terrorists promise to keep track of the recipient\'s phone calls, internet traffic, as well as keep an eye on their house.\n\nAccording to Scott Rees, Senior Sergeant at the local Police District Command Centre, he had received four reports of the email on Saturday morning alone. Police is working on identifying the perpetrators, and also to find out how did the scammers obtain people\'s personal information.\n\n""It makes me really angry that they\'ll be emailing people less cynical than I am and probably scaring them out of their wits,"" said a woman, who reported about the threat email. She used to live in Auckland but moved to Australia in 2012.\n\nIgor Mikitasov, who lives in Bangkok but has his family stay in New Zealand, posted on Facebook that he received a similar email demanding to send money to help SEA fight the Russian Army.\n\n“The e-mail shows specific personal information about me and my family members, who are living 10 000 km away from Bangkok. They not only have electronic personal data, but also things that could only be discovered by physical surveillance.”\n\nIgor asked if there are network security experts out there, who can locate these scammers, find out who they are and fight back for a bounty.\n\nHow to fight against hackers and scammers demanding Bitcoin ransom\n\nWhile Bitcoin is a digital currency that provides a certain level of anonymity, some people try to misuse it in different kinds of scams. Amid these worrying reports, one has to be able to counter the threat of financial cybercrime. Fortunately, modern security specialists and law enforcement agencies have developed specific solutions to fight back. Cointelegraph has asked several IT and security specialists to share their opinion on the case.\n\nMichal Wendrowski, an internet security specialist and the founder of Rublon said to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“It is not clear who the author of those emails really is. Today\'s state of the world, with the current refugee crisis and most people\'s inability to judge IT security risks, makes a great combination for such a criminal initiative. […] This case actually reminds me of CryptoLocker and CryptoWall, malware that encrypts data on your hard drive and asks you to pay in order to decrypt it. Last month, Joseph Bonavolonta, Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Cyber and Counterintelligence Program in the FBI\'s Boston office, said that the FBI often advises people to just pay the ransom. According to one study, up to 40% of victims of CryptoLocker paid to unlock their files. I doubt that the this Syrian Electronic Army email will be as effective because there is no proof of real danger (unlike with CryptoWall, where you can\'t access your data anymore). A few percent might pay though. People will be looking for advice. The media will play an important role here educating those who received these threats.”\n\nMichal Wendrowski believes it is a scam. His advice is to ignore these messages and report them to the Police.\n\nAnother “NetSec Genius” calling himself “Hacker sp00f3d” also commented on this:\n\n“Hard to say, how to fight against it. It\'s one thing to deal with the attack, and another thing to deal with the phenomenon. There are two possible ways of fighting against it: technological and administrative. US has an Echelon system. Russia have systems SORM1 or SORM2. These systems, when used properly, can help to catch such villains.”\n\nAlena Vranova, Co-Founder & Director at SatoshiLabs commented:\n\n“To me it looks like someone trying to scam people through a database of stolen records. I would not react to that the same way I don\'t answer to African bank transfer requests. […]More importantly this may be yet another event resulting from companies\' and governments\' inability to protect private data online. The way we approach and maintain sensitive data has to change. ""Don\'t collect what you can\'t protect"" should be a basic security mantra for most companies. Of course, legislation doesn\'t help much here, on the contrary, we see attempts of regulators to enforce more data collection and even waiving liability in case of data breaches.”\n\nNever pay the ransom\n\nUsually, security specialists and agencies advise users and companies to never pay the ransoms that are demanded in such emails.\n\nToday, Acting National Crime Manager Paul Berry said that the NZ police are investigating the case of SEA emails. Users who do feel at risk are advised to contact their nearest Police station. Berry also commented:']"

It is generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field.\n\n“The committee has invited me to nominate someone for the 2016 Prize,” writes Chowdhry in The Huffington Post. “I then started thinking whose ideas are likely to have a disruptive influence in the twenty first century. The name of the inventor of Bitcoin suddenly jumped up in my consciousness and I have not been able to get it out of my mind since then, Satoshi Nakamoto.”\n\nWill Satoshi Nakamoto, the Inventor of #Bitcoin, Win the 2016 #NobelPrize in Economics? https://t.co/NhTErS6iM9 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 9, 2015\n\n“The invention of bitcoin – a digital currency – is nothing short of revolutionary,” continues Chowdhry. “[Bitcoin] is digital and exists purely as a mathematical object. It offers many advantages over both physical and paper currencies. It is secure, relying on almost unbreakable cryptographic code, can be divided into millions of smaller sub-units, and can be transferred securely and nearly instantaneously from one person to any other person in the world with access to internet bypassing governments, central banks and financial intermediaries such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal or commercial banks eliminating time delays and transactions costs.”\n\nOf course, Chowdhry is aware that the Nobel Committee is unlikely to accept the nomination of a pseudonymous candidate. That’s why the article’s title is “I (Shall Happily) Accept the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economics on Behalf of Satoshi Nakamoto.”\n\n“There’s no real precedent for awarding the Nobel Prize to an unknown person (or possibly even group of people), so it’s difficult to say how the Prize committee will deal with the nomination,” notes Gizmodo. “But even so, the fact that Bitcoin and Nobel Prize in Economics are being talked about in the same breath is significant all on its own.”\n\n“I would be happy to go and accept the Prize on [Nakamoto’s] behalf,” says Chowdhry. “What about the acceptance speech? That won't be any problem either. He can write his speech, digitally sign it and send it to me securely. I would, of course, rehearse and deliver it on his behalf at the Prize ceremony.”\n\nEven so, it still seems unlikely that the Nobel Committee will accept the nomination. But it’s interesting to imagine that Nakamoto could choose this moment to reveal his identity, which would force the Committee to accept his nomination and take it seriously. As Chowdhry notes, Satoshi is so rich that the financial reward wouldn’t matter much – he is still sitting on a huge stash of bitcoin that he could sell anytime – but the temptation of joining the very select club of Nobel Laureates is difficult to resist. If Satoshi ever chooses to disclose his identity, now seems like a very appropriate time.\n\nThat Satoshi Nakamoto deserves a Nobel Prize is difficult to deny. As Chowdhry notes, bitcoin as a currency and an efficient payment means is just the tip of the iceberg. The disruptively innovative nature of Bitcoin lies in the possibility of decentralized trustless agreements and digital contracts that can be digitized, securely verified and stored, and transferred instantaneously from one party to another.\n\n“The implications of this are immense,” says Chowdhry, and adds that Bitcoin is likely to upend the role central banks play in conducting monetary policy. “The consumers will be big beneficiaries and indeed the poor and marginal sections of the society will reap the benefits of financial and social inclusion in the coming decades,” he says.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that Satoshi Nakamoto might have already received the Nobel Prize in Economics. In fact, the rumors that the unknown identity behind Satoshi could be the mathematician John Nash of A Beautiful Mind fame, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994, never quite died out. Nash, who openly proposed many ideas for next-generation economics that can be related to Bitcoin and considered as precursors, for example the Ideal Money concept, passed away in May 2015."", 'New York-based bitcoin exchange itBit has revealed it successfully secured five auction blocks as part of last week\'s bitcoin auction overseen by the US Marshals Service (USMS).\n\nThe event saw the government agency oversee the sale of 44,000 BTC (valued at $16.6m at press time) on the open market, with each auction block consisting of 2,000 BTC or more.\n\nBobby Cho, Director of Trading at itBit, told CoinDesk:\n\n""We confirm that itBit\'s auction bid, organized on behalf of a syndicate of our exchange and OTC trading clients, won five blocks in the final USMS auction.""\n\nThe exchange had originally declined to comment on its involvement in the auction, which drew a total of 11 bidders.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'The block-size limit dispute, at its heart, represents a trade-off between efficiency and security. Bigger blocks allow for more transactions on the Bitcoin network but could reduce mining power utilization and lead to centralization. Engulfed in sometimes heated debates, several developers have submitted proposals to strike a right balance between the two and reach community consensus – but so far to no avail.\n\nA group of Cornell University researchers, meanwhile, took an entirely different approach. Instead of attempting to strike the right balance, post-doctoral associate Ittay Eyal, doctoral student Adem Efe Gencer, computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer and research scientist Robbert Van Renesse, proposed Bitcoin NG, a radical redesign of the Bitcoin architecture meant to solve the block size trade-off entirely.\n\nOn key blocks\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin miners include two main types of data in blocks: a proof of work which allows the network to determine the longest chain, and a number of transactions to be selected by the miner. As its main differentiator, Bitcoin NG splits these two functions by creating two separate types of blocks: key blocks and microblocks, both of which are still part of the same chain.\n\nKey blocks include the proof of work, a reference to the previous block, and the coinbase transaction (mining reward) – but none of the other transactions. In Bitcoin NG\'s current design, and much like “normal” Bitcoin blocks, key blocks are found every 10 minutes on average. And, also like “normal” Bitcoin blocks, the amount of hashing power used to find the block determines the longest chain. In other words, it determines which blockchain is the real one.\n\nTo explain the benefits of using key blocks, Eyal told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\nSince key blocks don\'t include any transactions, they require very little data to be transmitted over the network. This results in faster block propagation, and, therefore, in fewer pruned blocks [\'orphans\']. As such, less mining power is wasted, and the incentive to centralize mining is reduced.""\n\nOn microblocks\n\nApart from the proof of work, a reference to the previous block, and the coinbase transaction, a miner includes one more type of data in a key block: his own public key. Subsequently, the corresponding private key is required to sign the other type of blocks: microblocks.\n\nAs opposed to key blocks, microblocks do not include any proof of work, but merely store transactions. These microblocks are created much more often: on average once every 10 seconds in Bitcoin NG\'s initial design. As such, the miner of a key block is essentially in charge of confirming transactions on the network until a new key block is found.\n\nOn poison transactions\n\nThere is one problem. The fact that microblocks are not secured by proof of work, means a miner (the key block signer) could easily double spend a transaction; he can simply sign multiple microblocks with contradicting transactions to different entities at the same time.\n\nTherefore, Bitcoin NG uses so-called “poison transactions.” If the network notices a double spend, a poison transaction is created, which destroys the revenue – the mining reward and fees – of the double spending miner retroactively. As such, miners are incentivized to remain honest.\n\nTransactions included in a microblock on the Bitcoin NG blockchain would be much more reliable than unconfirmed transactions on the current Bitcoin blockchain,” says Eyal. “But microblocks would not offer the same level of security as key blocks. Only key blocks would offer a similar level of security as blocks on the current blockchain do, meaning it would still be wise to wait for several confirmations when the value of a transaction is significant.”\n\nRadical\n\nCompared to alternative proposals circulating that address the scaling issue. Bitcoin NG is probably the most radical redesign of the Bitcoin protocol as we know it today. By basically flipping the current process of Bitcoin mining on its head, the Cornell research team has proposed an alternative that is completely incompatible with the existing consensus rules. Whether Bitcoin NG actually has any type of future, therefore, remains to be seen.\n\nThere are several ways where this could go,” Eyal explained. “We could reach a consensus among the Bitcoin community to change the way the blockchain works, and implement Bitcoin NG to be the new Bitcoin. Or, if someone is inclined to implement all the technical differences, Bitcoin NG could become an altcoin. Personally, I\'m interested in the technology and the science behind it, as a research project. I think this is a better way to do a blockchain.”\n\nFor more information on Bitcoin NG, see Eyal and Sirer’s blog post on Hacking, Distributed.', 'Certainly you’ve heard of bitcoin. But do you know about blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin? If not, you should. We believe it has the potential to be one of the top technologies in the supply chain.\n\nFew have written about blockchain to date with the same level of analysis as bitcoin, but those who have been are singing blockchain’s praises. “Pivotal” and “potent,” as it’s been called, the technology could meet the growing demand for transparency in the supply chain.\n\nBut what is it? A blockchain is a shared, distributed ledger — really a new type of database structure — that runs without a single centralized operator. It is a secure, public and external system of record that participants can inspect, audit and update, and within it, all transactions are recorded.\n\nAs The Economist reported, “It is what makes possible a currency without a central bank.” Information stored in the blockchain system is boiled down into a code or “hash.” If someone tries to change the information, the hash will appear different, making it easy to detect any foul play.\n\nThe security of the technology is designed to prevent any one person from altering the legitimacy of the information being exchanged over it, which is why it seems like a great approach to bring more transparency to transactions in global supply chains.\n\nDr. Jutta Steiner, chief operating office of Provenance, a real-time data platform that helps companies increase transparency, said blockchain can “entirely change the game” around certifying and determining the true origin of products — something consumers are increasingly demanding. It’s a level of transparency not attainable when companies put third parties in charge of overseeing supply chains, she said. If just a single party is overseeing this process, a bias can develop. This is especially true if the brand itself is overseeing its own supply chain. In this case, the brand is likely to be selective about what information it discloses, the op-ed continued.\n\nMore reliable, true information is achievable with a blockchain system, however. Blockchain has the potential to do away with the problems associated with “opaque supply chains,” Steiner wrote.\n\nOr as Adrian Gonzales suggested in an article from earlier this year, blockchain could become a new “supply chain operating system” based on its decentralized architecture, which “has the potential to trigger a new wave of innovation in how supply chain applications are developed, deployed and used. The blockchain, in essence, could become the new operating system for supply chain operating networks — like Descartes, Elemica, GT Nexus, LeanLogistics, One Network Enterprises, and others that combine B2B connectivity with software applications — and also help federate those networks.” To this list we also might add Ariba, which has direct materials network ambitions, GXS, Coupa, Nipendo, SciQuest, Tradeshift and others.\n\nBut why does our own supply chain expert Jason Busch think this technology is so valuable? We asked him:\n\nWhat makes blockchain such a game changer for the supply chain?\n\nJason: It has implications far beyond payments via bitcoin. The ability to truly externalize a ledger with n-tier participants is incredible. For example, think about the ability for cascading POs, invoices, change orders, receipts, ship notifications, other trade-related documents and inventory data across a supply chain to move beyond basic matching to trigger threshold-based payments, replenishment, aggregation programs and more based on codified rules in a specific blockchain. What makes this possible is a new, externalized platform — a radical new type of system of record that brings with it shared rules, understanding and more. Imagine the combination of Amazon AWS, Force.com, FASBI, FINRA, SEC and related types of capabilities, standards bodies and oversight authorities wrapped in one. The system of record inside a company would essentially take a back seat to new external, autonomous systems of record between organizations, which, theoretically, from an accounting and ledger standpoint, would be far more secure than internal systems needing to be audited internally or externally with judgement calls made as to particular treatments.\n\nWhat do people need to know about blockchain?\n\nJason: Get smart on the implications and the possibilities. Do your homework on both the underlying technology, the use cases — just as you would explore cloud-based solutions today — and technology disruptors.\n\nFor example, as The Economist suggests in one example:\n\n“All sorts of companies and public bodies suffer from hard-to-maintain and often incompatible databases and the high transaction costs of getting them to talk to each other. This is the problem Ethereum … wants to solve. The brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, a 21-year-old Canadian programming prodigy, Ethereum’s distributed ledger can deal with more data than bitcoin’s can. And it comes with a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level. Such cleverness … will allow the formation of ‘decentralised autonomous organisations’— virtual companies that are basically just sets of rules running on Ethereum’s blockchain.”\n\nWho is maintaining the blockchain in supply chain scenarios?\n\nJason: The blockchain is maintained by the participants collectively and potentially enabling third-party delegates, participants or providers.\n\nHow can users apply blockchain technology to their supply chain transparency efforts?\n\nJason: This is where, on a philosophical basis, blockchains become true disruptors. Imagine any type of object that flows through a supply chain having a permanent, unalterable recording of its activities — what it did, who touched it, how it was touched, how it became part of a bigger object — attached to it. Think of it as a fractal bill of material with provenance. The implications are huge. For example, there would be no need for conflict mineral surveys of suppliers, since all the underlying tin, gold, tungsten and tantalum that goes into a particular SKU would have a “stamp” going back to the smelter or mine and that would travel with whatever that gram, ounce, pound or kilo of material became.\n\nIn short, for transparency, it’s not just game changing. It’s trade changing. Sorry I could not resist with that last quip, but I have been won over to the concept in large part because the underlying technology systems exist today to bring the blockchain to the supply chain and it’s so critically needed in the market.', 'It has been a bit amusing watching as intellectuals and “thought leaders,” financial industry executives, technologists and even the media itself have fallen in love with “the blockchain,” “distributed ledgers” and other phrases to talk about the innovation happening in how trust and value exchange work on the Internet.\n\nNotably absent from this high-minded and purportedly insightful thinking is reference to bitcoin, the actual open platform that distributes trust and provides a highly secure ledger to exchange value around the world.\n\nIf bitcoin is referenced, it’s dismissively, as if smart people are in the know that bitcoin (the digital asset) isn’t necessary or important to fueling this global network of distributed and decentralized trust. For the most part, it’s just a cop-out and intellectual laziness; I have yet to meet anyone who shares these thoughts who actually has any idea how any of the technology actually works.\n\nWhen pressed, proponents of “permission blockchains” espouse the need for control, for building multilateral consensus-based settlement networks; they speak of the incredible savings in IT expense and back offices of financial institutions. These are real use cases, and bitcoin’s blockchain can’t solve all use cases, just as HTTP doesn’t solve every form of data and information transfer on the Internet. But for the most part, what people are saying is that “they want all the benefits of bitcoin, without bitcoin.”\n\nImagine back 20 years, when the core protocols of the Internet were getting going (HTTP/HTML, SMTP, etc.), and venture capital began to pour into software and Internet companies, while the leading media, telecom and communications companies plotted to create their own private, gated online services. Remember, the Internet was unreliable, insecure, and filled with creeps and hackers. People wanted safe, secure, trusted and proprietary networks. That was the future. Throughout the world, national monopolies, government-run telecoms companies and large commercial industry players drafted up strategies for building closed and proprietary systems to deliver “the information superhighway” to consumers.\n\nAll of these companies were interested in the “technology behind the Internet,” but not in the Internet itself. They sought to build “permission Internets,” where they could control what went online, who could publish and who could access the information. And they’d take a toll, as they always had, for providing these commodity information utilities.\n\nWe all know what happened. Smart creators and engineers from all around the world got inspired by the open Internet, and rather than waiting around, started coding and building on these limited, but conceptually transformative, protocols. More and more people got connected to the network. Permissionless innovation took hold, and we changed the world.\n\nThere are so many lessons for us here, and when we think about where we should apply our energy and focus, what ideas we should support and build upon, we need to have intellectual honesty and not fall into the trappings of established power and institutional biases.\n\nWhy are we here, working on this project? What’s important about the work, and how does that relate to the technology choices and investments that we make?\n\nIt’s an incredibly unique moment in human history — in the past 10 years, we’ve connected almost every human on the planet, we’ve radically expanded access to knowledge and information, we’ve made it possible for commerce and communications to flow in ways that were unimaginable just decades ago.\n\nWhat was it about the open Internet that helped all of this to grow and flourish? What lessons can we draw from that when we think about the prospects for bitcoin and blockchain technology?\n\nThe DNA of the Internet\n\nI like to think of the Internet as having a set of embedded ideals, a kind of intellectual and ultimately technical DNA.\n\nThe Internet uses a distributed and decentralized architecture, originally conceived by the Defense Department as a way to provide greater security and no single point of failure in the network. With its commercialization, the Internet is also a permissionless network. Anyone can join by putting a computer on the network that speaks sufficient protocols. You don’t need permission to run a mail server or Web server, you just plug in.\n\nThe Internet is not truly governed by anyone — no government controls the Internet; no private corporation controls the Internet. If anything, the Internet is governed by open and free intellectual property, by open standard protocols that technical contributors around the world help to shape year in and year out, through standards organizations, hacking and open source software. All of this intellectual property is free for the world, a gift to the global commons. It’s also now the very fabric of our global society and economy.\n\nEncoded in this DNA is also a very deep democratic and liberal ethos focused on freedom of expression, personal privacy and creative freedom; despite attempts to limit this, that ethos still breaths heavily even through the darkest and most controlled parts of the Internet.\n\nBitcoin itself is an outgrowth of this same DNA: A distributed and decentralized network, based on open standard protocols, open source software, that is permissionless — anyone can join and use the network. But instead of providing protocols for sharing information and communications, bitcoin and the blockchain network are for sharing value in a trustless fashion.\n\nIn order to create a transaction settlement network without a central intermediary, there needs to be a way to secure the network from abuse, especially if the network’s purpose is to record ownership in an irrefutable manner. With bitcoin’s protocols, newly created ledger entries themselves act as a token which market participants can earn by conducting work on behalf of the network. And, once issued, those tokens are what allow value to move on the ledger. This ingenious model, leveraging proof of work, has demonstrated tremendous resilience. To date, no one has devised a better scheme to build a global trust and transaction ledger.\n\nDo we really think that financial industry consortia and alt-chain startups can challenge the open Internet? Does anyone really think these “permissioned blockchains” have an iota of a chance at accomplishing anything more than building buggy, insecure closed back-end IT systems for banks?\n\nOf course, many people are now starting to realize that this $5 billion asset and secure ledger are quite powerful, and that many other layers of applications can be built on this infrastructure. With greater extensibility and programmability, bitcoin can evolve to enable transformations in how all forms of property are secured and exchanged, how voting and governance function, including spilling into the automation of commercial law, audit and accounting. Essentially, just as the early Internet disrupted and transformed media and communications, this wave will disrupt the “trust and assurance” industries, which includes government, law, accounting, insurance and, last but not least, finance.\n\nBut it’s not a currency\n\nOn one point, I think some of the “blockchain is good, bitcoin is bad” narrative is reasonably accurate. Bitcoin the token is not a government-issued currency. At this stage in its evolution, I don’t think it’s helpful to think about bitcoin as a currency, but rather as a new kind of asset — a “digital asset” — that provides a valued token necessary to exchange value in a secure manner globally. It’s the fuel that powers the blockchain network, and it’s increasingly important that there be robust liquid marketplaces globally to access and use this powerful digital asset, as it can be used to secure and exchange nearly anything of value, including fiat currencies.\n\nSo what about a hybrid digital economic model? Most people don’t want a new currency, they are quite happy with their dollars, euro, pound, yuan and yen. They get paid in these currencies, they pay their taxes in these currencies, they understand their purchasing power in these currencies, etc.\n\nBut, pretty uniformly, people want the benefits of bitcoin and the blockchain — near-instant transfers, globally available on any Internet-connected device, highly secure and nearly free value transfers.\n\nIn such a model, consumers and businesses rely on whatever currency is important in their lives, but can share value globally and instantly for free, by using the bitcoin blockchain as an open and secure ledger and settlement network. For the duration of a transfer, local currencies are converted into and out of “digital tokens,” and the transaction is settled over the Internet.\n\nSoon, we’ll be able to share value globally, and soon thereafter, we’ll start to layer in other forms of value — property, securities, insurance — and then later we’ll build in smart rules and business logic that can run on this global secure network in a trustworthy manner, and we’ll all be part of constructing new rules of global commercial and legal governance.\n\nEveryone, it’s okay to say the word “bitcoin” and acknowledge that it is the actual platform that is driving this innovation that we’re all building on. It’s also okay to say “the bitcoin blockchain,” or “the blockchain,” if you’re afraid that people will think you’re weird. But until someone actually builds, ships and scales a global open platform, open like the rest of the Internet, that can do what the bitcoin blockchain can today, there’s really nothing else to talk about.\n\nJeremy Allaire is an Internet entrepreneur who has spent the past 20 years building and leading global technology companies with products used by hundreds of millions of consumers and millions of businesses worldwide.

Charles wrote about how Bitcoin could be used to solve some of Reddit’s core issues earlier this year.\n\nAlthough many believed that this new social media application would be nothing more than a copy of Reddit with a few Bitcoin-centric features added to it, Charles recently told an audience at an SF Bitcoin Meetup that the final product could look quite different from the “Frontpage of the Internet.” Instead of an alternative to Reddit, it appears that Charles’s creation, Datt , will be a completely new kind of experience.\n\nBitcoin Attached to Upvotes\n\nDuring his recent presentation, Charles displayed a few mockups of what Datt could look like when it’s ready for some sort of public release. The examples shown in his presentation slides looked quite similar to Reddit, but Charles noted that the functionality associated with upvoting and downvoting worked a bit differently:\n\nThis is an example of the front page. It looks similar to Reddit -- you see links, you see images -- with one difference being those little dots you can see on the left. When you press that dot, when you highlight the dot, that’s the same thing as like upvoting on Reddit, but you’re actually paying the person bitcoin. So, you’re giving them a little bitcoin tip. You can think of it -- it’s sort of if ChangeTip were integrated to a website or if Zapchain looked like Reddit, it would look like this.\n\nFeatures, Storage, and Onename Integration\n\nOf course, Datt is not just about cloning Reddit and attaching bitcoin to upvotes. There will be other features added to the system, which could make the platform a bit more dynamic. For example, Charles noted that there could be some features that are similar to what is found on Twitter:\n\nThere will probably be following, like Twitter, so it won’t be exactly the same as Reddit.\n\nCharles also wanted to make the point that a user does not need to have any bitcoin to use Datt:\n\nYou do not need to have bitcoin to do anything. That’s another question -- people ask about this a lot . . . You don’t have to have bitcoin to view content or to post content. It’s sort of a feature, but you don’t have to have it.\n\nWith this being an open-source project with the promise of decentralization, it makes sense that user data and content will not be stored on a centralized server owned by Datt. Charles noted that IPFS or another P2P protocol where each user is able to store data related to the subreddits (or whatever Datt communities are called) they’re interested in could be used for storing content, while Onename will likely be used to solve the identity problem.\n\nHow Will Datt Be Monetized?\n\nIn addition to explaining how Datt will work as an application, Charles also spent some time discussing how a profitable business could be built around the platform. He sees monetization as a non-issue, and he thinks taking a cut of each transaction made on Datt could be a business model that works over the short term:\n\nTo me, this is a non-issue. I think it’s very obvious -- we will just take a portion of payments. Almost no one is going to modify the client to take out that portion. It’s technically optional, but we’ll just take a cut of the payments. I think that will work; we’ll see.\n\nCharles pointed to OB1 (the company behind OpenBazaar) as an example of an alternative business plan, but it’s clear that he will try monetize the protocol first:\n\nThere are other ways we could earn money. We could provide services [like what OB1 plans to do. OB1] is going to do more like creating other products and services, not so much monetizing the protocol. I’m trying to monetize the protocol. When people make payments on this thing, a cut goes to the company by default. At least, that’s the plan.\n\nIt’s still somewhat difficult to imagine what Datt will look like when it’s released to the public early next year, and an early prototype release in November could help Charles and the rest of the development team figure out which direction to move in next. Anyone interested in getting involved with the development process can visit the Datt GitHub page.', 'Bitcoin payroll service Bitwage is joining six other startups as part of an incubator backed by French telecom giant Orange SA.\n\nThe startups represent the fifth class of startups included in the Orange Fab incubator, which began operations in 2013.

11/10/2015,"['A charity auction for Dorian Nakamoto features art pieces by well-known Bitcoin-only artist Crypto Graffiti, whose work explores cryptocurrencies and the big banks he believes Bitcoin undermines. The pseudonymous artist is the first to use a public-facing bitcoin wallet for donations for street art. His work can be seen in The Wall Street Journal and other publications.\n\nAfter Newsweek claimed it had found Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, a media whirlwind circled Dorian Nakamoto, who until this day denies being Bitcoin’s founder. Nakamoto claimed his world was turned upside down and received donations for the mess in which he found himself.\n\nAround that time, Crypto Graffiti reached out to Dorian with the idea to create art for his benefit. Now, Dorian finds himself in ill health (Crypto Graffiti wouldn’t say why out of respect for Dorian) making the project for timely than ever. Crypto Coins News sat down with Crypto Graffiti to learn more about the project.\n\nWhat is your relationship like with Dorian Nakamoto?\n\nCG: Dorian and I are friends and communicate frequently. I initially approached him shortly after the Newsweek fiasco offering to create a work of art for his benefit. Long story short, he is in financial trouble and I made the piece currently up for auction to help out.\n\nWhat is he like?\n\nCG: Dorian is a good man. He is intelligent, calm and good-humored. His growing knowledge of Bitcoin has surprised me.\n\nWhy is Dorian Nakamoto an important figure in Bitcoin?\n\nCG: There is considerable negativity within our community and recent controversies such as the block chain debate have unfortunately divided us. The outpouring of support for Dorian during the Newsweek fiasco shows that when the rubber meets the road, we help one another. We came together to right a wrong. Mainstream media was attempting to profit from nefarious actions. Many would argue that Bitcoin was founded based on similar principles.\n\nRead More: Dorian Nakamoto Goes On Epic Tirade About Bitcoin & Global Economy\n\nHow is art important to Bitcoin?\n\nCG: For Bitcoin to grow, we want all walks of life to participate. Remember all the cliques in high school? We want all of ‘em. The more the merrier. But right now, the large majority of users are still early tech adopter types. Millions of people have already tried and failed to grasp Bitcoin after hearing a jargon-laced pitch from their Comp-Sci-major friend. Art and design can help the concept sink in with this visually-inclined segment of the population.\n\nWhen someone asks what I do and I tell them I make Bitcoin-related art and design, their defenses come down. They feel at ease and ask me questions they’re too afraid to ask a programmer at the risk of sounding stupid. They feel like I’m one of them.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite art/bitcoin projects? (either technology or artwork)\n\nCG: Augur’s prediction market is fascinating. It takes some real balls to publicly attempt a project of that nature knowing heavy scrutiny lies ahead. Verisart has taken on the incredibly ambitious task of solving verifiable provenance by cataloguing all of the world’s art on the block chain.\n\nArt: Christopher Steininger’s “The Slaying of the BearWhale” is great. Hate to admit it, but I really like the infamous Newsweek issue cover art too.\n\nDo you plan on expanding from crypto topics in your work?\n\nCG: No, my art will remain exclusively Bitcoin-related. I was the first artist to only accept Bitcoin for my work and this will also continue.\n\nRead More: Newsweek Journalist Broke Law To Reveal “Face Behind Bitcoin”\n\nDo you feel you’re in violation of any copyrights?\n\nCG: It depends on the logo in question, but considering how much central banking has fucked us over, I don’t have any qualms about it.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Aron van Ammers, Chief Technology Officer and Founder of BlockStars.io, visited the first day of the Ethereum Devcon1 and gave Cointelegraph his view of the most important problems, discussed there. We give you the text as it is.\n\nThe focus of the first day of the fully booked Ethereum Devcon1 was focused on research: the future of Ethereum and related technologies. The current live version of Ethereum Frontier, is an early version of Ethereum 1.0. The focus of today\'s sessions was Ethereum 2.0 and beyond. The 300 attendees of Devcon1 immersed in ideas about what is yet to come.\n\nScaling\n\nIf Ethereum is to achieve wide adoption, it needs to scale. Being a general purpose blockchain, scaling Ethereum is arguably more difficult than scaling Bitcoin. As Ethereum is still a young platform there still is a lot of space for innovation.\n\nIn a panel discussion on scaling, technical founders and developers of Ethereum discussed several strategies. Vitalik Buterin described a ""hub and spoke"" model which has similarities with Bitcoin sidechains. Dominic Williams suggested a strategy of verification layers, where only a limited set of nodes will verify transactions a similar level of security can be achieved as to the current way where every blockchain node validates every single transaction.\n\nLater in the day Vitalik Buterin explained a strategy for asynchronous programming that could be applied to achieve interoperability between the public Ethereum blockchain, external blockchains, and even private Ethereum blockchains. This could enable a world of securely interconnected blockchains, opening up a range of possibilities for building decentralized applications with various levels of security and value interaction.\n\nAaron Davis presented Metamask, a way to access Ethereum DApps from a normal web browser. Projects like Metamask could tremendously lower the barrier to adoption of decentralized applications as users won\'t have to go through complicated install steps to get their first DApp experience.\n\nJuan Benet, founder of IPFS spoke about the possibilities of IPFS as the layer for a new internet. Because of its decentralized character, IPFS is highly suitable as a component in a decentralized application infrastructure. Use cases include distribution of the DApp itself, storage of encrypted datasets and decentralized content distribution networks (CDN\'s).\n\nConsensus mechanisms\n\nBlockchains provide a single source of truth, established by consensus: participants agree on the data through a consensus mechanism, and that makes it true. Vlad Zamfir of Ethereum explained how economic consensus systems are a very new phemenon and not a lot of research has been done yet. Economic consensus is the only strategy we currently know of to achieve consensus in a fully public system.\n\nIn economic consensus, participants in a consensus system (i.e. miners) are considered economic rational actors. This means they will choose whatever option gives them an economic advantage. Those economic advantages can come from within the blockchain, but also from outside the blockchain: consider the scenario where an external attacker bribes a majority of miners in order to censor specific transactions. Zamfir argumented that builders of economic consensus systems should consider these worst case examples, even though we see in practice that miners don\'t always make purely (short term) rational economic decisions. The reasoning being that if a blockchain is resilient to a large-scale attack vector, it surely is resilient to smaller scale attacks.\n\nThe new proof-of-stake mechanism of a future Ethereum version, called Casper, was also introduced by Zamfir.\n\nFormal verification of smart contracts\n\nThe young discipline of writing smart contracts is quickly professionalizing. This was illustrated by a focus on formal verification. A smart contract on Ethereum is, on the one hand, an extremely powerful financial instrument, but on the other hand, just a piece of software that can contain bugs and can have unintended consequences when running them. Because the possible impact of a bug in a financial instrument is huge, we need a high level of reliability.\n\nFormal verification is a strategy to build highly reliable software, common in, for example, military and aviation software, but also in the financial world. Several initiatives towards formal verification of smart contracts were presented.\n\nLucius Greg Meredith of Synereo introduced the concept of monadic design patterns, which combined with a compositional architecture can lead to highly reliable and scalable blockchain systems. Grant Passmore of Aesthetic Integration described how their solution Imandra can provide formal verification of financial contracts. The solution is geared towards large financial institutions using trading systems and venues, delivering fully automatic analyses of trading infrastructure.\n\nThe day was closed with a scientific angle with Jack Petterson and Robert Edström presenting their master thesis on a new smart contract language that provides specific formal verification features. Finally Peter McBurney, Professor of Computer Science at King\'s College, London, explained the basic concepts of formal verification and how they can be applied to shared ledger systems and protocols.\n\nWrapping up\n\nThe first day of Ethereum Devcon1 showed a vision of a highly reliable, highly scalable future version of Ethereum. We\'re left to eagerly dive in what\'s possible today, which is the subject of the following days of the conference.', ""Banks, financial service providers, venture capitalists, and even governments, are showing more and more interest in blockchain technology. Venture capital money is flowing into blockchain companies, banks, credit card companies are experimenting with blockchain-related pilot projects, and public administrations are taking a more active role not only in regulating blockchain-based services, but also in stimulating the development of blockchain-related fintech and startups.\n\nAt the same time, a difference is often made between the blockchain technology and the specific blockchain implemented in the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is considered as far too open and anarchic to be a suitable foundation for a solid financial system.\n\nJeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of digital financial service provider and “bitcoin bank” Circle, has written a thoughtful analysis of the blockchain vs. bitcoin issue on Re/code.\n\n“If bitcoin is referenced, it’s dismissively, as if smart people are in the know that bitcoin (the digital asset) isn’t necessary or important to fueling this global network of distributed and decentralized trust,” says Allaire. “For the most part, it’s just a cop-out and intellectual laziness; I have yet to meet anyone who shares these thoughts who actually has any idea how any of the technology actually works.”\n\nAllaire notes that the troublesome features of Bitcoin – its openness to everyone and its lack of centralized control – are exactly what make the Internet work. The success of the Internet and the failure of all the closed, regulated versions of the Internet that have been implemented, should suggest that openness is necessary for a robust blockchain system to work.\n\nIn many recent articles, Bitcoin Magazine reported the trend toward private, “permissioned” non-Bitcoin blockchains, supported by Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters .\n\nPermissioned blockchains, under development by giant Swiss bank UBS , Bitcoin exchange itBit and others, would offer the advantages of digital currencies powered by public blockchains – fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared ledger – without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be a node on the network anonymously.\n\nInstead of anonymous miners, only banks and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate transactions in permissioned blockchains.\n\nAllaire notes that “they want all the benefits of bitcoin, without bitcoin,” and asks, “Do we really think that financial industry consortia and alt-chain startups can challenge the open Internet? Does anyone really think these 'permissioned blockchains' have an iota of a chance at accomplishing anything more than building buggy, insecure closed back-end IT systems for banks?” “[Until] someone actually builds, ships and scales a global open platform, open like the rest of the Internet, that can do what the bitcoin blockchain can today, there’s really nothing else to talk about,” is Allaire’s conclusion.\n\nLike Allaire, legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo thinks that the mainstream financial establishment should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\n\nAllaire notes that bitcoin shouldn’t be considered as a new currency, but as a more efficient settlement network.\n\nMost people don’t want a new currency, they are quite happy with their dollars, euro, pound, yuan and yen,” says Allaire. “They get paid in these currencies, they pay their taxes in these currencies, they understand their purchasing power in these currencies, etc. But, pretty uniformly, people want the benefits of bitcoin and the blockchain: near-instant transfers, globally available on any Internet-connected device, highly secure and nearly free value transfers.”\n\nServices that use the bitcoin blockchain as a transparent channel for value transfers, for example cross-border transactions where a fiat currency is spent at one end and another fiat currency is paid at the other, are emerging.\n\nWe can hide bitcoin technology in the background,” noted Jack Liu, head of international at OKCoin, Bitcoin Magazine reported in October. “Liu added that OKLink transactions aren’t affected by the volatility of bitcoin. “Because you are doing instant buy of bitcoin and sell of bitcoin, you are not affected by the bitcoin price,” he said. “[Consumers and businesses] can share value globally and instantly for free, by using the bitcoin blockchain as an open and secure ledger and settlement network,” notes Allaire. “For the duration of a transfer, local currencies are converted into and out of ‘digital tokens,’ and the transaction is settled over the Internet.”\n\nEarlier this year, Circle started offering customers in the United States the ability to hold their funds in U.S. dollars, which could be followed by similar offerings in other countries and permit transparent, cheap, fast bitcoin-mediated transfer between one currency and another."", 'Dan McCrum NOVEMBER 10, 2015 73 General Gregor MacGregor returned to Britain in 1821 an exotic war hero, dubbed a Cazique, or prince, of Poyais by the Latin American kingdom’s royal family. His stories of the democratic and fertile land prompted investors to snap up land certificates and £200,000 in Poyaisian sovereign bonds. Unfortunately, Poyais did not exist. MacGregor had fashioned a tale to fit the obsessions of the age, democracy and settlement, along with a vogue for exotic investments such as Latin American bonds. Acquitted in an early example of failure to prosecute complex fraud, he then ran into competition from lesser scam artists imitating his hoax. The latest incarnation of MacGregor, in a tradition that runs from Dutch tulip bulbs through the stamp scheme of Charles Ponzi, is MMM, a “social financial network” run by Sergey Mavrodi, a convicted fraudster and former Russian parliamentarian, powered by YouTube and the cryptocurrency bitcoin. New members must purchase bitcoins to join MMM, and then receive a bonus for online testimonials describing their improbable profits. The fad helped to power an explosion in the bitcoin exchange rate, from less than $200 in September to more than $500 per bitcoin last week. Yet the question prompted by the recent movement in bitcoin is whether it marks a resurgence for the cryptocurrency, or merely highlights its turn in the endless parade of get rich quick schemes, which prompted Walter Bagehot, former editor of the Economist, to write “one thing is certain, that at a particular time a great deal of stupid people have a great deal of stupid money”. The cryptocurrency was invented by an anonymous mathematician in 2008, and championed in the years that followed for its technology. At a time when many were unsettled by the actions of central banks after the financial crisis, bitcoin offered an alternative way to manage a currency, through mathematical rules rather than a metaphorical printing press. It also fit the vogue for technological innovation. Bitcoins are created by computers solving mathematical problems, with the total number that can be calculated into existence over time limited. An open ledger allows the community to track the distribution of coins. At a time when small start-ups were earning multibillion-dollar valuations for their power to disrupt industries, anyone with a good idea and a neat bit of software could make a fortune. As bitcoin attracted more attention, its price rose, attracting more money and attention. Early adopters got rich quick, or bemoaned how they would have done had their bitcoin hoard not gone in the bin aboard a discarded hard drive. Bitcoins could be used to buy goods and services in the real world, although not usually without a third party intermediating. The attention and limited supply meant that by December 2013 bitcoins traded for more than $1,200 each. However, in 2014 the cryptocurrency lost three quarters of its value after running into an old world problem, the failure of an overextended broker. Mt Gox, a prominent bitcoin exchange, collapsed. Then the seizure of the Silk Road, a popular website for trading bitcoins for drugs and other frowned on goods and services, prompted a crash in the price to almost $100. Such big swings in price undermine the case for bitcoin’s use as a currency. “It’s value is so volatile it’s not likely to serve as a medium of exchange”, says Eugene Fama, the Nobel Prize winning economist. He pointed to examples such as Zimbabwe. “When a currency has a variable value, the people just switch to a different currency, or to barter.” Bitcoin also lacks another feature of currencies: the balance sheet of a central bank standing behind it. They might be intangible, but a balance sheet has two sides to it, lists of assets and liabilities. The bitcoin ledger, by comparison, is just a glorified list of liabilities, keeping track of where the bitcoins are located. Furthermore, while the number of bitcoins is limited, the number of times the cryptocurrency can be replicated is not. There are a host of imitators, including Doge coin, started as a joke in 2013 at the height of alt-coin fever. Before Mr Mavrodi switched to bitcoins, MMM was operating with Mavros as the unit of exchange. The inherent flaw of pyramid schemes is that they must always suck in new converts to avoid collapse, and the exponential growth in users is impossible to sustain. Bitcoin shares some of these features. It requires constant evangelism because its value derives from its use. The limited supply of bitcoins then becomes a fatal constraint. The more people use it, the greater the price must rise, dissuading its use as a currency. Bobby Lee, head of BTCC, the largest bitcoin exchange in China, argues its use for everyday transactions makes it a currency, and is frank about its price, saying: “The reason bitcoin has value today is scarcity, that is all.” He also agrees bitcoin has the character of a pyramid scheme, but compares it with bubbles in housing markets, which might also appear pyramidical. He adds: “It all comes down to what we think of a pyramid scheme. Is that a good thing, or a bad thing?” Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT', 'Dan McCrum was only mostly wrong in his factual assertions about Bitcoin recently.\n\nIt was a bit sad to see someone demonstrate such little actual understanding, but deliver such an offensive opinion about Bitcoin. To his credit, McCrum did interview at least one mining pool operator for his article, but nevertheless managed to even get that person consider the idea that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. This idea has been debunked for so many years that it’s irrelevant. But here we are:\n\nBobby Lee, head of BTCC, the largest bitcoin exchange in China, argues its use for everyday transactions makes it a currency, and is frank about its price, saying “the reason bitcoin has value today is scarcity, that is all”. […] He also agrees bitcoin has the character of pyramid scheme, but compares it with bubbles in housing markets, which might also appear pyramidical. […] He adds: “It all comes down to what we think of a pyramid scheme. Is that a good thing, or a bad thing?”\n\nThroughout the article, which starts out talking about the recent viral scam, MMM, which has decided to use bitcoins as a currency rather than Euros or anything else, Bitcoin is called a pyramid scheme. Simply because people are evangelical about a technology does not make that technology a scam.\n\nAlso read: China’s New National Economic Plan Seeks Innovation\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is secondary to the fact that it cannot be stopped, it cannot be erased. Its value may drop to zero, but people on dark markets and others wanting to hold their value in a non-traditional way, they would still use it. That’s where much of the use comes from.\n\nThe value, however, on a given day, is largely due to the excessive amounts of trading that take place 24 hours a day with Bitcoin. This did not stop the writer from making a fundamentally foolish assertion:\n\nThe inherent flaw of pyramid schemes is that they must always suck in new converts to avoid collapse, and the exponential growth in users is impossible to sustain. Bitcoin shares some of these features. It requires constant evangelism because its value derives from its use.\n\nA Sale in Bitcoin = A Sale of Bitcoin\n\nWhat he doesn’t acknowledge is that usually a sale in bitcoins equals a sale of bitcoins, which makes sell orders, which typically mean the price is vulnerable to taking a small hit. Now Bitcoin markets are huge at this point, and so it takes some serious effort to bring them down, but nevertheless, the point remains: a sale in bitcoins equals a sale of bitcoins. A sale of bitcoins is a dropping of the price, potentially, because it signals a sale at whatever price the sell column will immediately produce.\n\nTo be clear, MMM is a dangerous Ponzi scheme. Other Ponzi schemes take place in Bitcoin all the time. Occasionally, we write about some here. It’s part of the work we like to do, informing people about such things. But for the writer at a reputable publication, this late in the game, to be denigrating Bitcoin as a mere “Ponzi scheme,” well, it’s just not right.\n\nFor Bitcoin to be a Ponzi scheme, the early adopters would have to profit by the loss of the new adopters. The fact is that if I buy in at $124 and you buy in at $154, we both profit when the price goes to $300. I may profit a little more, but it’s not based on losses you’re sustaining. The new buyers are more like new buyers of stock than they are new members of a Ponzi scheme, objectively speaking.\n\nTherefore, the article by Dan McCrum was, really, inflammatory and unnecessary. Bitcoin has been around quite awhile now. It seems like, at this point, many of the people reading such a publication probably know more about Bitcoin than the writer appears to. The silly thing he said about the value of Bitcoin isn’t the only thing wrong in the article, however.\n\nThe author also mentioned Dogecoin, but failed to acknowledge how much actual value the cryptocurrency carries today. Even at its height, it was nothing compared to others like Litecoin, which started out as just a Bitcoin clone done in Scrypt instead of SHA-256.\n\nIt seems there will always be people like McCrum who cannot accept that a currency was born outside the halls of government and needs no government to protect or govern it. It’s a form of digital cash, and while there are hundreds of variants, only a few are truly secure from attack at this point, while the rest are just sort of wandering in the breeze.\n\nRespect for Bitcoin is not a requirement to intelligence, but it seems obvious that many intelligent people do respect it, and understand that it is not a scam. There is no centralized point where someone could overwhelmingly profit from the losses of others, no one place where the master of the scam can collect, so such an assertion rings false.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Encryption can keep your communication private and your files safe from prying eyes, but it can also be turned against you. In recent years, online criminals have been using a class of malware called ransomware to extract money from victims by encrypting their files and holding them ransom. As if that wasn’t bad enough, security researchers have now identified a new strain of ransomware that targets Linux-based web servers, holding an entire website hostage until the owner pays up.\n\nThe ransomware is currently being called “Linux.Encoder.1,” and security firm Doctor Web has reportedly seen it bite only a handful of websites so far. Victims are currently in “at least tens,” but each time it locks down a website, it demands one Bitcoin in payment. With the recent uptick in value, that’s about $500.\n\nMany of the infected systems were accessed through a vulnerability in the Magneto CMS. A patch was issued to close this security hole on October 31st, but not all users will get the new version installed right away. The funds from the first wave of attacks could also be used to purchase a previously undisclosed exploit, which could widen the scope of attacks.\n\nLike other ransomware schemes, after Linux.Encoder.1 gains access to a web server, it encrypts all the mounted volumes and encrypts a variety of file types with an RSA-2048 key that cannot be duplicated by the user. The malware seeks out Apache, MySQL, and Nginx installations in the server before going to work, thus ensuring it locks important files that someone will want back. It goes after files like Windows executables, program libraries, and JavaScript documents, and more.\n\nIn each directory it encrypts, Linux.Encoder.1 helpfully leaves a text file called README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt (see above). This is the ransom note. It explains that the contents of the server are encrypted, and in order to recover the files, you’ll need to pay one Bitcoin to the attackers at a specific Bitcoin address. It provides an address linked to a deep web using a Tor2web redirect.\n\nIf the victim pays up, the attackers say they’ll provide the decryption key to access all the locked files. That, of course, assumes you believe they will follow through. This process is less sophisticated than some previous ransomware attacks, and the files in question might be of greater commercial value. That makes it more likely owners of the web servers will pay the ransom. The best way to avoid being scammed by this malware is to keep your security up to date and have a backup of your important server files stored in a different location.', 'Jack Tatar is the author of the book, ""Safe 4 Retirement: The Four Keys to a Safe Retirement"" which takes a holistic approach to retirement that considers not only the financial aspects but the need to focus on health, wellness, mental attitude and staying involved as keys to living a long and safe retirement.

You\'re an affluent investor who understands the concept that taking on more risk may bring higher rewards. You also understand the importance of asset allocation and not putting all of your eggs in one basket. One day, you\'re playing golf with a friend who keeps checking his smartphone during your round and his constant smiling is beginning to annoy you (especially after you missed that short putt on the last hole). Finally, you ask him what they\'re looking at on their phone.\n\n""I\'m watching this investment I have go up 25% just today. In fact, it\'s gone up about 50% just this month. Pretty good, huh?""\n\n""What\'s the investment?"" is your immediate reaction. After your friend tells you what it is, you\'re surprised that he was even able to invest in it. You soon learn that it\'s not an investment that that any of his financial advisers told him about. He also reveals that he only has a small amount of his overall portfolio in this holding, because, well, it\'s risky, but clearly with that risk comes sizeable reward.\n\nThis is not fiction. This occurred to a friend just recently. The investment is the Bitcoin Investment Trust GBTC. Yes, any investor can currently buy it in any of their investment accounts and no, your financial adviser is probably not going to tell you about it unless you ask.\n\nSince its transition from an investment only for accredited investors to the OTCQ exchange (June of this year), where it can be bought and sold by the general public, the trust has ranged from $28.55 to a recent price of $51 in less than six months. The trust is simply intended to mirror the price of bitcoin, which has been on a tear as of late.\n\nI wrote about this investment in various columns on this site in the past and earned many sneers (a nice way of putting it) from those who thought that I had lost my mind. Many of those who criticized bitcoins were those who felt that gold was a better way to gain exposure to an alternative investment. A recent column on this site discusses how bitcoin has actually been a better current investment than gold.\n\nFull disclosure: My involvement with this investment began when I invested a recent SEP contribution into the trust, when it was only available to accredited investors and bitcoin was trading well over $600. With bitcoin on the rise and trading even at the $450 level, I still have a loss on my original investment.\n\nHowever, I did this investment as an alternative investment for asset allocation purposes and committed only a small portion of my portfolio to it (less than 5%). Those investors who have financial advisers have probably had discussions with their advisers over the last few years about the merits of including alternative investments in their portfolio as a means of asset allocation. Typically, those alternative investments have been hedge funds or private-equity funds that provide little transparency about what they contain or have strategies that even your adviser will admit that he or she doesn\'t understand.\n\nSo, with the performance of GBTC at this point, the question I have is whether or not your financial adviser may begin bringing up the option of investing in bitcoins for your portfolio. I believe that over the next year, you\'ll begin to hear them doing just that, whether it\'s discussing GBTC or how various companies, such as established banks, are integrating bitcoin and blockchain technology into their businesses and the potential impact that will have on their bottom line and stock performance.\n\nThe question you may also ask is if they\'re not discussing this topic and these options with you, are they the right financial adviser for you? These are not investments for everyone, but certainly you\'ll be reading more and more about them over the next year and your financial adviser should be prepared to discuss and advise accordingly on them, as they are available to all investors.\n\nRegarding my friends who were playing golf. Once it was revealed how much was made over the course of the day in GBTC, it was decided that the next hole was the 19th hole, and that my smiling friend would be buying the refreshments. I know for a fact that he used cash and not bitcoins to pay for that.\n\nDisclosure: Tatar owns shares of GBTC.', ""Bitcoin Family is a new non-commercial Bitcoin popularization project, in development by a young Bitcoin enthusiast Dima Vollo.

11/11/2015,"[""Microsoft is partnering with ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based startup that specialises in blockchain, to bring bitcoin and its associated technology to financial institutions, Reuters reports.\n\nBlockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, is essentially a vast, decentralised ledger that registers every transaction anonymously.

In his widely-covered article, Chowdhry wrote that Nakamoto deserves the prize because his invention, bitcoin, is ""nothing short of revolutionary"".\n\nFollowing its publication, however, some observers raised the question of whether Chowdhry violated nomination rules by publicly disclosing his intention to back Nakamoto.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Göran K.

No reversal candlesticks have formed yet so a larger pullback could be in play.\n\nMeanwhile, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level coincides with an area of interest visible on the daily chart. This is the top of the previous ascending triangle consolidation pattern from which bitcoin price made a strong upside breakout.\n\nIf this holds as support, bitcoin price could resume its climb to the previous highs near the $500 mark. On the other hand, a downside break could spur a much longer-term selloff for bitcoin price.\n\nTechnical indicators are still favoring a correction for now, as stochastic is on its way down while RSI is just turning from the overbought zone. This shows that bears have plenty of ammunition at this point, keeping them in control of bitcoin price action until the oscillators have reached the oversold area and turned higher.\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the 200 SMA for the time being but the moving averages are way too close for comfort. This ups the odds of a downward crossover, signaling that more losses are in the cards.\n\nResistance turned support at the $300 level could still pave the way for a bounce, as a lot of traders are likely placing their buy orders there. This is close to the moving averages and the triangle support, adding to the strength of the barrier.\n\nIntraday support level – $300\n\nIntraday resistance level – $500\n\nTechnical Indicators Settings:\n\n100 SMA and 200 SMA\n\nStochastic (8, 3, 3)\n\nRSI (14)\n\nCharts from BitStamp, courtesy of TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Bizarrely, just before the closure of the site but months before prosecutors claimed Coin.mx was knowingly used by Shalon and his partners to funnel money from a cornucopia of criminal activity, two-time Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul carried out a three-part interview with a social media expert contracted by the exchange.\n\nThe interview is essentially a primer on Bitcoin and a little slice of pro-libertarian, pro-Coin.mx propaganda, with both sides decrying financial regulation, but in light of the charges now facing Shalon, it may be that Paul was really used to bring some legitimacy to one arm of an alleged multifaceted criminal campaign that prosecutors claimed earned its perpetrators hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nIt might not have been the first time Paul was seen hanging with the Coin.mx crowd. One of the men allegedly involved with Coin.mx was Anthony Murgio, who prosecutors said ran the Florida-based firm from the U.S., as Shalon sent the orders from Israel. What appears to be Murgio\'s LinkedIn page includes a photo with a man who looks much like Paul (he hadn\'t confirmed or denied it at the time of publication).\n\nIn 2013, the Murgio who used that LinkedIn profile registered a large number of sites to do with Bitcoin, including a 365coinexchange.com, bcoinbarter.com, bcoinbuzz.com, bcoindepot.com, bcoinmarket.com, bcoinshop.com, bcoinstore.com, bcoinworld.com, buybitcoinswithpaypal.com, ichangexchange.com and icoinmarket.com. This year, it appears he was more interested in delivering weed via drone too, registering chronicdrone.com, dopedronedelivery.com, highflydelivery.com and toastydrone.com, amongst others.\n\nIf Coin.mx was simply a way for Shalon to make more profit from criminal escapades, he went to great lengths to make it look like the real deal, which may have included charming the former Republican Congressman.\n\nThose efforts stretched to substantial PR efforts and some sneaky business practices, according to public records and the indictment. The company, set up in 2013, was ostensibly represented at Bitcoin conferences and across Twitter by social media consultancy SM3. Paul’s interviewee, another Florida resident Ania Amador, claimed in the jovial confab that she’d “been with Coin.mx since 2013”, though her LinkedIn page indicates she has never worked for Coin.mx, and in 2013 was CEO of SM3, a service she set up in 2010.\n\nI’ve emailed both Paul’s team and Amador, but neither had offered a response at the time of publication. Questions remain around how much they knew about Coin.mx\'s activities. There\'s no evidence they knew of anything untoward.\n\nThe Collectables Club\n\nAccording to the indictment, the exchange was operated through a phony company called “Collectables Club” [sic] as the criminals sought to trick authorities into believing the organization offered a members-only area for discussing and selling collectible items, from stamps to sports memorabilia, according to the indictment. That court filing also claimed that in 2014, Shalon’s co-conspirators acquired control of a federal credit union, installed people on the board of directors and transferred coin.mx’s banking operations to the union. That was then used as a “captive bank” for unlawful business, prosecutors claimed.\n\nThe Coin.mx website, still accessible over the Wayback Machine, showed it was a relatively slick affair, even if the language was somewhat sloppy.\n\nIts Facebook page, which had garnered just over 15,000 likes, described the firm as ""an American-based money exchange that allows you to buy, sell, and exchange digital money such as Bitcoins, Litecoins, and more"". Both the Coin.mx homepage and the Facebook page listed the company’s address as 2591 Dallas Pkwy, Frisco, TX 75034, even though the alleged operators were based in Florida.\n\nAll this was enough to convince Bitcoin owners, whether legitimate or criminal, to use the service. Between October 2013 and January 2015 it handled $1.8 million in Bitcoins on behalf of tens of thousands of customers, said the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe site was used to exchange Bitcoins for cash for all kinds of criminal activity, prosecutors claimed. Intriguingly, the U.S. Attorney accused Coin.mx of knowingly exchanging cash for Bitcoins derived from ransomware attacks, where criminals infect people’s PCs or smartphones, lock their files away using encryption and demand payment to unlock them. In the case of Coin.mx, it was said to have delivered dollars to those behind the Cryptowall ransomware, a particularly nasty strain of malware targeting Microsoft Windows PCs.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Coin.mx was used alongside other illegal payments firms IDPay and Todur. These were allegedly run by Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, two of the three named in the indictment filed in Atlanta alongside Joshua Samuel Aaron, to handle money from unlawful pharmaceutical sales, fake and malicious anti-virus software, a range of illegal online casinos and dollars coming in from the Bitcoin exchange. Shalon and his colleagues were said to have run at least 12 unlawful online casinos, hacking into competitors to steal customer databases, or hitting them with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks after “perceived misconduct” on his own casino sites.\n\nIDPay, which no longer appears to exist, was embroiled in malicious activity as far back as 2011, when independent journalist Brian Krebs claimed it was being used by a large number of fake anti-virus pushers and at least two rogue pharmacy affiliate programs that paid hackers and spammers to promote fake pharmacy sites.\n\nLooking at the domain registry records for IDPay.com, one email address of interest was revealed - yellowsoul123@gmail.com, ostensibly belonging to a Dimitri Randal (this may be a fake name). A quick look at the other domains registered by that character, using DomainTools’ Iris service, brought up a range of other sites that looked interesting, including beauty-experts.net, c4v.biz and casinotitan-ads.com. Others have linked the same email with spam activity. I tried emailing that address, but had no response at the time of publication.\n\nCoin.mx was, according to the indictment, a small part of a massive cybercrime operation, which, along with the huge JPMorgan breach, saw one financial firm hacked via the Heartbleed bug, attacks on providers of operating software for casinos, and collusion with corrupt international bank officials. One co-conspirator, said the court filing, described the operation as a payment processing, casino, software and pharma “cocktail”.\n\nThe cases against Coin.mx and its related businesses are a startling reminder of just how wide criminal networks can stretch.', 'Following the significant Bitcoin price growth to nearly $500 last week, it went down sharply on November 10-11. Just a few days ago, the Bitcoin price faced the first wave of decline to the $370 - $390 level. During the last 24 hours, the price lost almost 20% on all major cryptocurrency exchanges and dropped to as low as $308 on some of them.\n\nOne of the reasons for this downward trend could be a significant reduction of Bitcoin trading volume on the market. On the other hand, there are theories about speculation on some of the Chinese exchanges and information that the recent Bitcoin rally could be caused by growing activity of Sergei Mavrodi’s and his Pyramid Scheme “MMM” in China.\n\nExperts forecast\n\nSeveral cryptocurrecy experts have shared their opinion about the recent Bitcoin price “rise and fall” with CoinTelegraph:\n\nRonny Boesing, CEO of CCEDK:\n\n“It may have something to do with people realizing that bitcoin may have been pumped in connection with the MMM scheme. [The Bitcoin price can be] around $310 end of day, and end of week Sunday $275. That’s my bet.”\n\nVladimir Dubinin, CEO of Distributed Lab:\n\n“The price fluctuated around $220-230 for a long time. I expected it to rise to $300, because in terms of technical analysis, the market has already tried to reach this level several times. After the $300 was passed, the next big goal of $400 was taken very rapidly and reached the peak of about $490, which is now a new psychological high. My prediction there will not be a large number of sellers at the price $320-330. Therefore, the price won’t fall below $300. One way or another in the nearest future the price will try to get back to the recently reached level of $400.""\n\nMartin Repetto,CEO of Voxelus:\n\n“The falling price of Bitcoin has many selling or diversifying into other digital assets. With Voxel still priced in Bitcoin - and the best prices still available for larger purchases for the next ten hours - this makes it a great deal.I believe it’s going to settle in $300 area.”\n\nAt the moment of this article\'s writing, the BTC price fluctuated at $318-333.', 'JOHANNESBURG – Bitcoin, arguably the world’s most well-known digital currency, is on a tear. It is up 18% year-to-date, which according to Brave New Coin makes it the best performing currency of 2015. It has also risen more than 108% since its January lows to trade near the $380 mark, largely driven by a 39% rally last month alone.\n\nWhile it is unclear what set-off October’s surge, investments in block chain technology – a public ledger in which all bitcoin transactions are recorded – by major financial institutions and news that one of China’s largest bitcoin exchanges would accept direct deposits from banks are thought to have renewed interest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nMoreover, the surge in bitcoin prices coincided with weakness in the gold price (see chart above). Is this a mere coincidence or is bitcoin overcoming its negative reputation to be considered a credible alternate investment to the yellow metal?\n\nWith the likes of Microsoft, Dell and Virgin Galactic accepting payment in bitcoin, the non-government issued currency is gaining in popularity (see chart above) but authorities can’t seem to agree as to what exactly it is. According to European Union’s Court of Justice bitcoin is a currency and thus exempt from value-added taxes when traded. In the US, however, the Commodity Futures Trade Commission declares it a commodity, while its Internal Revenue Service considers it a taxable property.\n\nHardly surprising as it exhibits qualities of both currencies and commodities. Like most fiat money and commodity money, the price of bitcoin is a function of supply, albeit limited in that only 21 million bitcoin can ever be created, and demand. “It is the price a willing buyer and seller are willing to transact in, usually relative to some local currency,” founder and CEO of BitX, Marcus Swanepoel said from Singapore.\n\n“Given that bitcoin can be transferred within minutes at almost no cost around the globe, there are enough people willing to ensure that no (significant) arbitrage opportunities are available… which ensures that the bitcoin price does not differ meaningfully between currencies and exchanges,” said Frans Lategan, IT Security Consultant at SensePost.\n\nLike the price of gold, a traditional safe haven asset, the Greek debt crisis proved a boon for bitcoin, driven by demand from Greek buyers. According to Lategan, bitcoin could become a safe haven asset, “…it is liquid, easy to transfer and cross borders, and almost unregulated. [It is] almost impossible to impose estate duty, export control or even seize bitcoin if properly protected and backed-up. [But] the total market cap of available bitcoin is just too low for this to be feasible for anyone but individuals currently, and also excludes very rich individuals, until the price rises sufficiently”.\n\nRight now, Julian Jessop, head of commodities research at Capital Economics views bitcoin as a “very poor substitute for gold on practically every count”. “It is intangible, lacks depth and liquidity, and does not have any comparable track record as a safe haven or inflation hedge. While there might be some small investors happy to switch between the two, bitcoin is simply not a credible alternative as a reserve asset or diversifier within a larger portfolio,” he wrote in a note.\n\nJessop also dismissed the inverse correlation between the gold price and that of gold, saying that gold price weakness is a result of US interest rate expectations. “In contrast, the surge in the price of bitcoin appears to be another speculative bubble, unrelated to anything happening in the gold market,” he said.\n\n“As with all hype-driven surges it will probably decline at some point in the future again. I am of the opinion that this is just another brief bubble in the long-term upward trend, and will be followed by a pull-back, but to a slightly higher level than before,” Lategan agreed.\n\nSpeaking to Mineweb from Johannesburg, independent technical analyst Frans de Klerk alluded to a correction: “Below $360, the first sign of weakness will appear. Then the shares can easily pull back below $335, $320, $310 and even $300”. He said the price would likely find support at the $300 level from which it can rise again.\n\nAccording to Swanepoel, it is important to distinguish between the bitcoin currency and the Bitcoin network. “We’re happy when the market becomes more interested in bitcoin – driving up the exchange rate, more transactions, more utility – but we’re far more interested in the Bitcoin network. Even if the price of bitcoin fell to a few cents, it would still have huge technological opportunities and benefits,” he said.\n\nAt the same time, Wedbush Securities expects the price of bitcoin to rise to $600 over the next year, citing future opportunities. “With bitcoin supply mostly predetermined, we estimate bitcoin applications’ large and growing addressable market, anticipate an inflection point of bitcoin application adoption 5-10 years out and apply a high discount rate to account for uncertainty,” Wedbush analysts said in a note.\n\nAs for the gold price, uncertainty as to when the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, especially now that chair Janet Yellen said it may push interest rates below zero if the country’s economy were “deteriorate in a significant way”, is still expected to weigh on the market.\n\nIt will certainly be interesting to see how bitcoin’s growing acceptance will play out on the markets, whether it manages to achieve safe haven status and if the future prices of gold and bitcoin still appear to be inversely related.', 'In an effort to create more dialogue between regulators, law enforcement, and digital currency companies and organizations, the U.S. Department of Justice convened a seminar at the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the DOJ, the summit included “approximately 175 government and industry participants, including representatives of federal and state law enforcement and regulatory agencies, digital currency and blockchain companies and organizations, and other technology companies and financial institutions.”\n\nThe event was organized by Kathryn Haun, who has been put in charge of the Digital Currency Task Force, a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, the U.S. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security and local agencies based in San Francisco.\n\n“Generally, the point of the summit is to share information about common concerns. Regulators, industry leaders and law enforcement all have a common interest in responsibly developing these new technologies and keeping them free from those who would use them for illicit purposes,” said Abraham Simmons, assistant U.S. Attorney at the Department of Justice in San Francisco, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nAlong with the government agencies, there were leading bitcoin and blockchain companies in attendance as well. Some of the panel speakers in attendance were Wences Casares, CEO of Xapo; Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase; Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain; and David Rutter, CEO of R3CEV.\n\nJerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, moderated a panel about regulation, with Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of FinCEN, Jan Lynn Owen, commissioner of California DBO, and Erin Schneider of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Mood is Changing\n\nBitcoin has come a long way from a regulatory standpoint since it first came out. Whereas only a couple years ago, senators were decrying it for its use in purchasing drugs, now there are defined rules and regulations from FinCEN, the CFTC, the a much clearer understanding for law enforcement. More importantly, the mood has changed.\n\nThere was a similar gathering in February at the Treasury Department, and that was a little more formal, very stiff,” Brito said. “This one was interesting just to see so many of the same people eight months later. There’s a much more relaxed attitude and people understand this is not going away. They understand the industry is serious and wants to comply with regulation and wants greater clarity on regulation.”\n\nBrito offered his hope for gatherings of this nature:\n\nWhat’s important to me is that the day something bad happens we don’t want that to be the day we start exchanging information. We’ve already established friendships and relationships.”\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin. He runs a weekly digital currency and blockchain newsletter called Crypto Brief.', ""Avalon, the first company to manufacture ASIC mining chips and sell them to consumers, has returned to the marketplace with a new chip after an absence of several years. Avalon has announced a new A3218 mining chip that will be released in the Avalon6 miner.\n\nAccording to Avalon, each server can process 3.65 TH/s at a power efficiency of 0.29 W/GH. Each server is composed of 80 of the Avalon A3218 chips. The system requires, at minimum, a 12VC DC, 1,100 watts PSU output. Unlike the other companies that have been developing 14nm chips, Avalon decided to stick with its 28nm ASIC chip.\n\n“What I can tell you is that Avalon was offered the 14nm Samsung chip many months ago, and they declined,” explained Sean Walsh, Founder of BlockC, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine . “The 14nm process node is very new, very slow to design/produce, very difficult, very expensive and doesn't currently yield efficiency gains that even come close to compensating for all this. Avalon will produce at smaller process nodes, but only once it actually makes financial sense to do so.”\n\nCanaan-Creative, the parent company of Avalon, and BlockC have recently announced a partnership that results in BlockC becoming the global distributor (except in China) of all Avalon products and services in the bitcoin space.\n\nAccording to Walsh, 1 petahash of processing power would cost approximately $350,000 to $360,000.\n\nThis is quite a bit cheaper than the only other seller on the market, Bitmain, for two reasons,” Walsh said. “First, Bitmain is currently advertising prices of about $380,000 per petahash. Second, Bitmain is not shipping any miners until mid-December, which is a full month later than BlockC.co ship dates. One Petahash currently earns about $90,000 per month in gross profit (after paying electric bills). Running the numbers, BlockC/Avalon is about 7 percent lower on sales price, plus the 25 percent you gain by emerging your PH a month sooner. That’s an effective savings of over 30 percent.”\n\nBlockC expects the first batch of Avalon6 miners to arrive in their California datacenters by November 12, 2015. It is currently selling the servers in batches of 10, providing 36.5 TH/s for $14,950.\n\nWho is Avalon?\n\nAvalon is one of the oldest bitcoin mining hardware companies in the ecosystem. Canaan Creative, the parent company of Avalon, was founded in 2012 by NG Zhang, Jiaxuan Li, who goes by the name Lee, and Xiangfu Liu. The first miner they released was the Icarus, which was a programmable Xylinx FPGA chip released in the beginning of 2012. Soon after, they released the Lancelot, which was also based on the Xylinx FPGA.\n\nHowever, Avalon is best know for releasing the first Bitcoin ASIC miner. In October 2012, NG and Lee began working on Avalon 1, which was a 110nm ASIC chip. Less than a year later, the miner was released, ushering in an era of high-powered, specialty bitcoin miners.\n\nThey faced some backlash during 2013 due to some production delays, coupled with some probably overly optimistic claims that Yifu [Guo] had made to the public,” Walsh explained. Yifu Guo agreed to do sales and marketing for NG and left in 2013. “However, they resolved the issues, and refunded many tens of thousands of bitcoins to customers. I believe all customers were compensated generously.”\n\nThroughout its history, Avalon has released five generations of Bitcoin ASIC chips: 110nm, 55nm, 40nm, and now two 28nm designs. The A3218 is its latest generation.\n\nWhile Avalon has kept a low profile for the past few years, Walsh explained that the company is planning to expand beyond just mining. They recently closed a large series A of venture capital financing, which the company will use for acquisitions and organic growth initiatives.\n\nAvalon was (and still is to a large extent) 100 percent devoted to open source software and hardware, as well as the global mainstream adoption of Bitcoin,” Walsh said.\n\nWith so many other firms taking their bitcoin miners in-house and not selling to the general public, an additional competitor in the public-mining space could bring about continuous development in new, more advanced chips.\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

Yesterday, the price stood at $311. That’s about $800 below its high point in late 2013, just before Mt. Gox, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, completely imploded amid claims that hackers had broken into its systems and stolen more than $460 million in customer funds. “The question prompted by the recent movement in bitcoin is whether it marks a resurgence for the cryptocurrency,” wrote The FT, “or merely highlights its turn in the endless parade of get rich quick schemes.” Fair question.\n\nBut for Brian Armstrong—the CEO of Coinbase, today’s dominant bitcoin exchange and a company with the backing of some very big Silicon Valley players—the price of bitcoin (see graphic above) isn’t the best way of judging the health of the digital currency. “Sometimes, I feel like running a bitcoin company must be like running a public company,” he says. “Everyone is so focused on the price, and that causes short-term thinking.”\n\nA better barometer, he says, is how much the world is using bitcoin (see graphic below). And that figure continues to rise. Bitcoin usage has risen pretty much steadily since the brief dip it took in the wake of the Mt. Gox implosion. In fact, last week, as the price of bitcoin topped $500, the usage rate reached an all-time high, after roughly doubling over the past twelve months. “The real usage is catching up to the hype,” Armstrong says.\n\nArmstrong’s point is that for people like him—and companies like Coinbase—the ultimate aim is to turn bitcoin into something that anyone can use to more easily store, send, and receive money. “We want the world to have an open payment network,” an Internet for money, he says. And, well, the price of bitcoin may not have much to do with that. Yes, bitcoin is also a means of speculation, a way of making money from money. And according to Peter Van Valkenburgh—director of research at the Coin Center, a non-profit dedicated to bitcoin public policy issues—the recent price fluctuations are likely driven by such speculation. But this is only part of the bigger bitcoin story.\n\nMore Bitcoins Moving\n\nTo be sure, that graph showing the rise in bitcoin activity doesn’t necessarily mean that lots of people are actually using the digital currency to pay for stuff like socks and food and apps. In early 2014, Overstock.com started accepting payments in bitcoin—becoming the largest online retailer to do so, and nearly two years later, bitcoin transactions account for only about 0.05 to 0.1 percent of the company’s sales, according to company spokesperson Judd Bagley. Armstrong’s graph shows the total number of transactions on the bitcoin network—the worldwide network of Internet machines that drives the digital currency—and that includes any movement of bitcoin from one place to another, not just people paying for goods and services.\n\n“With basic payment applications, we do see usage creep up. But it’s important not to be overly optimistic there,” Van Valkenburgh says. “It’s fairly clear that a American consumer—someone in a developed country—has a fair number of ways to pay for stuff already.”\n\nWhat’s more, a lot of that recent bitcoin activity is probably just, well, speculation. But the fact remains: more and more people and organizations are adopting bitcoin for one reason or another. The big question—and it’s not that far from the question asked by The FT—is whether bitcoin will ever become a mainstream currency, rather than just a trading commodity. We don’t have an answer yet, but there are signs that we’re moving in that general direction.\n\nMoney Without Borders\n\nCoinbase says that more than 41,000 businesses and 2.8 million people are using its various services, which include not only an exchange for buying and selling bitcoin, but also digital wallets for storing bitcoin and making payments, as well as tools that let apps and websites accept payments. It’s signing up about 3,500 new users a day, and this rate jumped about 70 percent in the wake of last week’s price rally. And across the pond, European bitcoin payment processor Coinify says its business is growing 30 percent a month, and 600 percent year-over-year—though it doesn’t provide specific user numbers.\n\nMeanwhile, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for suing Mark Zuckerberg over the creation of Facebook, recently launched a new bitcoin exchange with approval from regulators in New York and other states. And an exchange called ItBit has received similar approval. Regulators, even here in the U.S., are beginning to embrace the technology in ways they haven’t in the past.\n\nAs more and more businesses and people adopt bitcoin, the currency comes closer to Armstrong’s vision of an Internet for money. If you have an open network for money—as opposed to networks controlled by banks and other big companies—we can more quickly and easily build and adopt new financial technologies. “A lot of innovation is blocked today because of the red tape—or hurdles or friction or whatever—that comes with launching a new business and accepting payments or paying money out to people,” Armstrong says.\n\nIf bitcoin goes mainstream, it would allow companies to more easily send and receive money across borders. And in the developing world—where online banking and payments aren’t nearly as prevalent as they are here in the States—it gives people a power they wouldn’t otherwise have.\n\nChanging Markets\n\nArmstrong’s graph also reflects tools that are using the bitcoin blockchain—the vast digital ledger that underpins the digital currency—to handle all sorts of stuff beyond just money. Overstock, for instance, runs a new company called TØ that’s using the blockchain to handle stock trades, and in recent months, some of the big Wall Street players have followed Overstock’s lead. The Nasdaq is building a system that will use the blockchain to oversee stock trades in the private market (before companies go public). And the exchange believes the blockchain could be applied to the public market, too.\n\n“The blockchain could have some pretty fundamental and transformative effects on the capital markets,” says Terry Roche, a principal analyst with capital market research firm The TABB Group.\n\nThe current trope is that the blockchain will reinvent Wall Street, but that bitcoin as a currency will never quite get there. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said as much last week. When Armstrong hears such talk, his first thought that the bitcoin’s mindshare is expanding—and that’s a good thing. He very much believes that alternative uses for the blockchain are just a stepping stone to the adoption of bitcoin as a currency.\n\n“They’re making an iterative step,” Armstrong says of Wall Street. “They’ll do a few experiments. Maybe it’ll be a year or two. And they’ll realize that the blockchain is great, but that the biggest use of the blockchain is bitcoin. I still believe, 100 percent, that bitcoin is the future.”\n\nIt may or may not be. But as Van Valkenburgh points out, the steady rise in bitcoin activity may indicate that many others feel the same as Armstrong. Some are certainly in search of short-term gain, but the wider expansion of the bitcoin community may indicate that many others see it a good bet on the future. They may be speculating because they believe it will indeed become the Internet of money.\n\n“Bitcoin has been in the news a lot as of late, and it has been good news. People will see that and say, basically: ‘I want a cash option on the future of the technology,'” Van Valkenburgh says. “It’s like if you were able to buy a small piece of the Internet in 1994. Would you?”"", 'Visa Europe has announced it is working on a proof-of-concept for a blockchain-based remittance service.\n\nCreated through Visa Europe Collab, the trade organization’s innovation initiative, the proof-of-concept is being built in collaboration with Epiphyte, an enterprise blockchain services firm that recently graduated from San Mateo incubator Boost VC.\n\nThough details on the proof-of-concept were limited, the companies said they are working in a ""controlled test environment"" that is seeking to simulate real-world remittance transactions.\n\nA press release by Visa Europe Collab indicated the company initiated the project as it believes blockchain technology could have valuable applications in the payment services industry, solving traditional industry pain points as it matures.\n\nVisa Europe Collab innovation partner Jon Downing said in a statement:\n\n""There is a real opportunity to develop an improved remittance service for both the sender and receiver of payments in terms of fees, speed and ease of use.""\n\nThe news comes amid continued assertions by executives in the traditional remittance industry, such as MoneyGram and Western Union, that digital currencies and blockchain-based systems will not be able to solve problems in the sector.\n\nA membership association that oversees Visa-branded products in European market, Visa Europe was recently purchased by Visa for as much as $23.4bn in cash and stock.

Voloshinskiy is the founder of the NextBank Project, an attempt to create a truly bitcoin-based bank.\n\nThe team has raised $950,000 so far using personal money and angels, and they hope to attract more.\n\nWhat is a BTC bank? First, they’re looking to attract the bitcoin crowd.\n\n“We are a 100% online bank. There is emote account opening in majority cases and we are thinking about the bitcoin community. We are happy to welcome bitcoin companies, traders and forward-looking entrepreneurs. NextBank is the first bitcoin friendly bank,” Voloshinskiy said. They are building the company to work unlike any bank before it.\n\nThe company is also led by Celine Neves, a former CEO at a Vanuatu-registered bank. Vanuatu is an “Oceanian island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean” that offers a number of benefits to banking partners including “rational financial authorities,” as well as general worldwide acceptance. This places the organization outside of the traditional roadblocks put up against bitcoin businesses, a problem that strangles many crypto-fintech plays in the cradle.\n\n“It’s not black-listed as [an] offshore centre. According to our research in 40 jurisdictions, Vanuatu is ideal for the bank of tomorrow,” he said.\n\nThe company aims to make it easy to make accounts remotely, accept customers and work fully with international debit cards. It also will allow bitcoin businesses to work without the regulatory hurdles associated with current jurisdictions.\n\n“I hate banks as they are at the moment. I believe they [are] going to die soon,” said Voloshinskiy. He wants to support bitcoin-based fintech business and forward thinking bitcoin fans, a move that should make a lot of wallet-holders quite happy. Expect to see more out of the bank in 2016 when the team launches their first products.\n\nUPDATE – There is some concern that this is a scam. It very well may be and I’ll do more digging but consider this from Dinbits:\n\n?Given all of the above, and as much as I personally wanted this to be true, it’s not. This is a scam! In addition to the above evidence, Simon the PR guy doesn’t exist either, and the CEO (who we did find, and likely unaware of the appointment) who was reported as the former head of Vanuatu Private Bank, certainly sounds impressive … until you realize that this bank does not exist either. Even if this guy was for real and sincerely wanted to open this bank, it would not work the way that he has presented it and in some of the countries he wants to open up in it’s not even possible at all. This was a better presentation than most scams, it had some very convincing things in place and it struck a nerve being something many in the industry would like to see. This idea could certainly be done, but not by a someone with no experience in doing anything like this, not for 25 million, and at the moment, certainly not in Russia or China. Unfortunately this is a scam. Even if it wasn’t, it would be a piss-poor investment since it fails before it begins and will never exist. It is, however, a good way to make your money not exist.\n\nUPDATE – NextBank sent us their response on Reddit complete with legal threats.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'George Osborne, the UK\'s Chancellor of the Exchequer, has to resolve the problem of getting a bank account in the United Kingdom for Bitcoin-related companies. UK banks are currently refusing BTC businesses to open standard banking accounts. Thus, even if Bitcoin startups have FCA support and are licensed, they are still unable to operate without a traditional bank account. BTC market experts expect George Osborne to act after the announcement to support digital currencies-friendly regulations was made during the Bank of England\'s Open Forum on November 11.\n\nTough job\n\nGeorge Basiladze, the CEO of Bitcoin wallet and exchange service Cryptopay.me based in London since 2013, faced a bunch of problems related to Bitcoin regulation in the UK during that time. Here’s what he said to CoinTelegraph about the Osbourne’s initiative:\n\n“It’s very nice that Osbourne has mentioned bitcoins in his speech and we appreciate that. However, I do not think that this would result in any material change in current policy.""\n\nHowever, George Basiladze points out that the main problem in the UK is not government regulation, but the failure to get bank accounts:\n\n“You may have a favorable regulations and the FCA may support and license you. But if you cannot get a bank account (just a standard one) you cannot operate. This is easy. Not for BTC companies, though. If you say that you are doing anything connected to bitcoins and bitcoin exchange, you will not get a bank account in the UK. Banks do not like bitcoin companies as they make their compliance department’s head explode. Companies cannot provide truly innovative solutions with ~ zero fees, because they do not have the means to do that. No bank account is the way to additional fees, bad service and other issues.”\n\nSimon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com and Fund Manager of Bitcoin Capital, also shared his opinion about the problem:\n\n“It is nothing new to hear a government state that they want their country to be the capital for Bitcoin startups. Most governments want the thousands of jobs that will be created from this new sector. However the reality is that regulators are independent of governments and banks have more control than both regulators and governments.”\n\nMichael Terpin, head of BitAngels, who’s spend enough time in London to be familiar with what\'s going on, commented to Cointelegraph:\n\n“The issue is a power struggle between the politicians (who want to please the electorate and promise growth and prosperity) and the regulators (who want to maintain and build their fiefdoms by adding more regulation). In the middle are the banks, who are able to pressure both the regulators and politicians to protect their interests.”\n\nMichael Terpin gave an example of such a situation last year when the Isle of Man officials made a big deal about how friendly they were going to be to Bitcoin - a Crypto Isle of sorts - but then after holding a conference to bring in major Bitcoin investors and companies, the central bankers and regulators said they still had concerns and fell back on the promise of bringing new business to the Isle of Man.\n\n“It\'s no surprise that UBS and JP Morgan are sounding the alarm on Bitcoin (while at the same time trying to create their own private blockchains). Having a world power like the UK and one of the world\'s top financial hubs in London embrace it as an innovation greatly threatens their monopoly over the movement of money. It\'s like when Western Union said more than 100 years ago that the telephone was of no possible use to anyone,” says Michael Terpin.\n\nGeorge Osborne to support FinTech and cryptocurrencies\n\nGeorge Osborne announced yesterday that he wants to make London a world leader in FinTech and cryptocurrencies. Osborne is going to make some changes to the existing regulations in the industry. Thus, changing the rules will influence greater innovation among the London Bitcoin community.\n\nGeorge Osbourne is a well-known Bitcoin supporter. He realizes the meaning of cryptocurrencies for the development of the whole FinTech sector. That’s why he stays supportive of Bitcoin despite other European leaders expressing their skepticism towards it.\n\nIn fact, this skepticism could be useful for achieving Osbourne’s goal as he can take advantage of cryptocurrencies for the development of the UK’s FinTech industry, while leaving all other European competitors in the dust. However, he realizes that, to do this, there have to be some regulatory changes. And he promises to deliver those changes.\n\n“Osborne is also promising an innovation-friendly approach to the regulation of new technologies such as cryptocurrencies,” states Finextra.\n\nThe changes will surely have a great influence on FinTech and cryptocurrency, making them, perhaps, more convenient and customer-friendly.', 'The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions has issued a new warning to potential buyers of digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\nThe advisory, entitled ""Beware the Next Big Investment"", offers a warning about investing in digital currencies, marijuana-related businesses and binary options.\n\nIt reads:\n\n""Digital currency value fluctuates wildly because it is decentralized and often the subject of \'breaking\' news and rumors.""\n\nThe majority of the item focused on the risk of unrealistic investment pitches, including those that seek to intentionally misinform investors.\n\n""Since different countries and jurisdictions have little uniformity on how bitcoin and digital currency is regulated, scammers will take advantage of the confusion and contradictions to misinform potential investors,"" the notice says.\n\nThe advisory also points to the fluctuating market value of digital currencies, as well as the threat of theft for holders.\n\n""The bottom line: There are many investment opportunities among the above mentioned categories, but before making any decisions with your money, ask questions, and do your homework,"" the note concludes.\n\nThis warning follows the publication of similar advice last March, and comes amid a heightened period of volatility that has seen the digital currency fluctuate between $300 and $500 over the past few weeks.\n\nWarning image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""The person tweeting about content with 5,000 followers, there’s value there that hasn\'t been tapped.""\n\nIn turn, Hejazi said he believes that online advertisers will see value in the service as it will be able to target users based on their destination.\n\n“This allows advertisers to display information relevant to where you’re about to see, rather than where you [have] been [as in the existing models],” he added.\n\nAttracting users\n\nThat\'s not to say that Cred can exist without users. Now out of beta, Cred is promoting its product through targeted social media advertising and bitcoin community outreach.\n\nTo accommodate users at scale, the platform is also seeking to work around the issues that currently arise when sending micropayments over the bitcoin blockchain. For example, all Cred transactions are done ""off blockchain"" through bitcoin services firm Coinbase.\n\nThis means that smaller transactions can be sent without fees, but that both Cred advertisers and users will need to register for an account with Coinbase, though Hejazi said the option was the most convenient way for it to realize the user experience he wanted.\n\nSo far, Hejazi said the service has only attracted a few dozen users, though he is optimistic that social influencers will seek to be rewarded for practices they already engage in without incentive everyday.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""This space is ripe for some sort of innovation.""\n\nSocial media image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The trend fell in line with the overarching bearish momentum we have seen over the last 48 hours or so – which in turn comes as a wider market correction of the bull run we saw over the last few weeks. Action has now matured across the Asian session, and as we head into a fresh day of European trading, what are the levels we are keeping an eye on in today’s bitcoin price, and where are we looking to get in and out of the markets according to our intraday breakout strategy? Take a quick look at the chart to get an idea of what’s on.\n\nAs the chart illustrates, the levels that define today’s range in the bitcoin market are in term support to the downside at 314.70 and in term resistance to the upside at 335.14. We are currently trading just shy of resistance, so we will address the potential for an upside breakout first.\n\nSpecifically, if we see a break above, and a close above, in term resistance at 335.14 it will put is in a long entry towards a medium term target of 345 flat. On this one, a stop loss just the other side of our entry level – somewhere around 332 flat – will ensure we are taken out of the trade in the event of a bias reversal.\n\nLooking the other way, if we correct from current levels, we will look to enter short on an intrarange trade towards our standard intrarange downside target of in term support – in this instance, 314.70. Again a stop loss is required, and again a level just the other side of our entry should do the trick – somewhere around 337 will do nicely, perhaps a little higher for the more aggressive trader.\n\nCharts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

11/13/2015,"['Izabella Kaminska NOVEMBER 13, 2015 14 ‘I’m no crook,’ declares MMM scamster, while claiming credit for the bitcoin price spike FT Alphaville, November 9 That is absurd. Bitcoin’s price appreciated because it is an amazing technological invention not because some Russian scamster started a pyramid scheme. You sure about that? After soaring more than 100 per cent in 30 days to $500 per bitcoin last week, this week it was back near $300. It seems much more likely that the growing popularity of MMM Global, an investment outfit targeted at people in China that bears many of the hallmarks of a pyramid scheme and requires new members to purchase bitcoins, was behind the spike. You don’t understand. Bitcoin has fundamental value. Even those running bitcoin exchanges have warned about the destabilising effects of MMM Global. Bobby Lee, chief executive of Chinese bitcoin exchange BTCC, told the New York Times last week he had seen signs that Chinese investors were using bitcoin to move money into the scheme. Sergey Mavrodi himself, MMM’s architect, claims it is obvious that without MMM the price of bitcoin would fall. If anything, this suggests bitcoin is an efficient payment mechanism. Are pyramid schemes really the sort of clients you want to attract? Why not? Well, for one thing, they destroy value rather than create it. That means they simply transfer existing value around and consume it, rather than invest in it. That is a drag on any economy, especially a poor one. When the pyramid eventually goes bust — as economic fact dictates it must — it will be the poorest members of society and the last to enter the scheme who will be robbed of their savings. I don’t see the problem. Mavrodi, the former convicted felon behind MMM, calls the scheme a mutual-aid society. They are not doing anything bankers do not do already. Neither does bitcoin. The original MMM scheme which Mr Mavrodi launched in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s led to millions of roubles worth of losses for those who invested. According to Yury Chikhanchin, director of Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service, to this day defrauded investors are yet to get their money back. Now that the scheme is gaining exponential popularity in China, Mr Chikhanchin worries a similar fate will meet Chinese investors. What has that got to do with bitcoin? For as long as MMM schemes depended on conventional money transfers, banks had a chance to block or reverse suspicious transactions. Now that the latest MMM Global scheme runs exclusively on bitcoin, there are far fewer checks and balances in place, meaning if fraud is discovered there is not much anyone can do about it. This makes it easier for fraudsters to take advantage of the financially naive. But Mavrodi says his scheme is entirely legal? Nobody can stop you sending charity, that’s true. But do not kid yourself that this creates any value for society. Charity is only effective if it flows from the rich (or those who can afford it) to the poor. This is a scheme that preys on the vulnerable by convincing them that transferring their own money to other people just like themselves will lead to windfalls. In reality, the money only gets transferred up the chain to the scheme’s initial creators. When the pyramid goes bust the late entrants leave with nothing. This is not Robin Hood economics. It is Robin Hood using viral social media marketing, including financial incentives for those who post online testimonials, to steal from the poor. Perhaps. But that still does not mean bitcoin does not have fundamental value of its own. Actually, the fact that bitcoin’s price can be so easily affected by a pyramid scheme is telling. Bitcoin is more than a payment technology. People also buy bitcoin in the hope that it is a sound store of value and that their holdings will be worth something in future. But bitcoin is a store of value. That has been proven! Really? If it is a store of value, it’s a very odd one. Unlike gold, it is not a physical substance that people have coveted for millennia. Unlike a house or a container ship, no one will take it off your hands expecting that they can put it to some use. Unlike a unit trust, it is not tied to underlying investments that investors can keep track of. Unlike banknotes, it’s detached from the tax and spending accounts of the government. The trouble with bitcoin is that by being accountable to no one, it’s entirely unaccountable in value terms as well. izabella.kaminska@ft.com Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT', 'Simon Dixon, the CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com and Funding Manager of Bitcoin Capital was hosted in an interesting interview on Money Talk, a program broadcast by Radio Television Hong Kong. Simon explained bitcoin in a simple way to the listeners who might have never heard about bitcoin before and commented on the enormous computing power endorsing the blockchain.\n\nHere are a few interesting quotes from that interview:\n\nThere are 3 fundamental properties that are different when depositing your money at a bank rather than convert your money to bitcoin:\n\nWhen you deposit your money with a bank, the bank becomes the legal owner of your money, so in countries like Cyprus, they experienced what happened when banks reclaimed ownership of your money; you deposits vanish! With bitcoin, you actually own your own money, so it is much like storing cash or gold under a mattress!! It is on your smartphone; on your computer; on your hard drive, you own it and it can’t be taken from you. With banking, when you deposit your money at a bank, the bank spends this money and speculates on it and if the bank’s speculation go wrong, then your deposit is actually is at risk and it has to be guaranteed by the government. With bitcoin, you spend your money as you wish directly from person to person, there is no bank in the middle and no governmental intermediary; you just transfer value from one person to the other. The monetary policy. With banks, they create money when they issue loans and so, most money are created privately by a bank. With bitcoin, it is created in a very geeky, hard to understand way. Basically, hundreds of thousands of computers, all around the world, are connected to the blockchain network and they verify bitcoin transactions and every time a miner verifies a transaction, new bitcoins are created but it acts much like gold, where there is a fixed supply, so it is a “deflational currency” and the value tends to go up overall because the system can’t be manipulated and the supply of bitcoin never changes.\n\nSimon also believes that Bitcoin is backed up by the largest super computer in the world.\n\n“If you sum up the 500 largest computers known to mankind and you multiply their computing power by 5000, you get the size of bitcoin’s blockchain computing power, so it is an amazing thing”\n\nAfter listening to that amazing interview, I reached out for Simon Dixon and I asked him a couple of exclusive questions for NewsBTC:\n\nTamer: How do you secure your Bitcoins’ capital investment? Do you use cold storage? Do you use desktop wallets? or rely on online wallet providers as blockchain.info?\n\nWe use a cold storage multi signature wallet to store investors coins when they leave them with us.\n\nTamer: How can you evaluate Bitcoin ventures during 2015? Were they promising?\n\n“When investing in Bitcoin companies, we look for teams of dedicated entrepreneurs that have stuck with their business throughout the Bitcoin bear market. We look for those that have customers and products rather than those with ideas. We also see how popular they are with our 15k plus professional investor community on BnkToTheFuture.com. We have a lot of smart investors investing through our platform and we like to make sure other smart people are investing in the companies we invest in so we can increase the odds of success. I like companies that make banks less significant rather than the companies making it cheaper for banks to perform Business as usual using Blockchains.”\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn my opinion, I also agree with Simon that BTC is backed up by a hashing power that is endorsed by the world’s biggest computing power, which why I believe that bitcoin has way more value than Fiat money, which sometimes doesn’t even worth the cost of paper and ink used to print it!!', 'In case you weren’t aware, Bitcoiners hate authority. It is the central thing we want to avoid in finance, as well as any other industry that can be placed on the blockchain. We consider it inefficient, immoral, and just plain wrong.\n\nThis makes sense for an anarcho-libertarian movement, but even anarchists have people they listen to. Merriam-Webster defines authority as “the power to give orders or make decisions,” a vague description that doesn’t describe how such power is acquired or what the consequences are. If we’re going to rail against authority all the time, we should really do better.\n\nIn reality, there are many different types of authority, some more subtle than others. While Bitcoin does an admirable job of resisting control, even the blockchain and peer-to-peer technology cannot fully prevent corruption. Here I’ll explain who they are, how they work, and what influence they have over the Bitcoin network.\n\nViolent authority is that wielded by police officers, the essential basis of all government control. If you fail to submit to other disincentives such as fines, you have to deal with them–the enforcers of the ruling class. Disobeying such people gets you restrained, beaten or worse, and more than any other type of authority, you are forced to comply.\n\nYou could call violent authority the ultimate authority; if another authority comes in conflict with a violent authority, the non-violent authority typically loses, at least in the short term. Violent authority has no inherent concern for right or wrong, and is for this reason the most hated kind–the one Bitcoiners are generally talking about.\n\nGood news, though: this is the type of authority to which Bitcoin is most impervious. There is no central server to confiscate, so destroying the network would require them to take every node or miner in the world at the same time. Like the hydra of Greek lore, cutting off one head of the beast just causes another to grow in its place.\n\nIf development of such technology was simply banned, it would go underground. As Satoshi has proven, it’s possible to release a program without revealing one’s identity. Pseudonymity also makes it extremely expensive to target users, who can buy and sell bitcoins with cash to insure a continuous money supply. Violent authorities need to know who you are and where you live to be effective.\n\nThat’s why software piracy remains so ubiquitous: it’s in the nature of decentralized technology to proliferate. Violent authority will probably be less prevalent in the future, as new decentralized technologies come to obsolete and replace it. It will likely only be wielded as a last resort against others who try to use it, such as thieves, rapists and murderers.\n\nCoercive authority is the opposite of violent authority in its mechanism, but similar in the seriousness of its consequences. While a violent authority threatens to do something, a coercive authority threatens not do so something, i.e. take it away.\n\nThis authority is typically known as “your boss”: if you don’t do what he says, he’ll fire you. Phrased that way, many libertarians might disagree with the concept, as it doesn’t technically violate the non-aggression principle. Theoretically, you could just find a new job or start your own enterprise if you disagree.\n\nThat’s easy to believe if you are either young or wealthy, which many Bitcoiners are. But suppose you can’t line up another job in time and don’t have any savings. Then if you have medical expenses or a family to feed, quitting is not an option, and your boss commands the same respect as if he’d asked you with a gun in his hand.\n\nThis power has sinister applications that can negatively impact the greater good. When a lobbyist tells a politician he’ll lose campaign funding if he doesn’t enact certain legislation, the lobbyist is wielding coercive authority. This may translate directly into violent authority over third parties, as can bribing a judge or hiring a hitman.\n\nIn the Bitcoin system, such coercion can cause serious arguments amongst the developers. Gavin Andresen is beholden to MIT, which funds him and two other developers as part of their Digital Currency Initiative. Many of the remaining developers are working on the Lightning Network, which settles transactions off-chain thus giving them a financial interest in smaller block sizes.\n\nThe free market is capable of resolving such disputes, however. Development spats lead to “forks” in the network, and community backing will go to the fork that keeps their interests in mind. Bitcoin miners are financially compelled to ensure it functions normally by block rewards and deflation, and acquiring enough hashing power to out-muscle them could cost over $100 million at existing hardware prices, which would probably skyrocket.\n\nMoral authority is when you listen to someone not because you have to, but because you want to. It doesn’t sound like much, but it can be a very powerful force.\n\nMoral authority is how Gandhi overthrew the British, and how Martin Luther King ended segregation. It is exerted via rousing speeches and civil disobedience, inspiring people to act in accordance with their world views. If someone shows sufficient moral character, others will be driven to follow them.\n\nDisobeying a moral authority makes normal people feel guilty, which can cause extreme distress. Often times, they are compelled to make amends to alleviate the discomfort. This is because moral authorities know how to manipulate others’ feelings of empathy, which can literally make you feel another person’s pain. This effectively neutralizes your own authority.\n\nMorality is relative, however. Its wielders are also adept at instilling outrage, which can have more aggressive consequences. Adolph Hitler was using moral authority when he blamed the Jewish people for Germany’s problems, which led to one of the worst atrocities of all time. That’s why hate speech is a crime in most jurisdictions.\n\nEvery community has moral authorities. A good example in Bitcoin is Roger Ver, who ironically appeals to anarchist sentiments with anti-authoritarian language. If he convinced his followers that Bitcoin doesn’t promote liberty, or that governments are ethical, cryptocurrency would lose critical support and momentum.\n\nHe’s won’t argue that, of course, given his audience and political disposition. It’s a common debate in mainstream politics, however, which affects Bitcoin’s wider adoption: in order to truly compete with fiat, it needs to win the hearts and minds of the masses. Thankfully, people are growing more educated every day.\n\nIntellectual authority is when you listen to someone because you probably should. It’s implied when someone claims to know what’s best for you, and is perhaps authority’s most noble form. If you don’t listen to an intellectual authority on a subject, your decision about it is likely to be wrong.\n\nIntellectual authorities are often trusted advisers to governments and corporations, and thus can wield a lot of power. They can also appeal directly to the masses as bloggers, commentators and authors, indirectly impacting our behavior by molding our world views. Andreas Antonopoulos is a good example in the Bitcoin world.\n\nEven this has potential for abuse, however. Intellectual authorities can be wrong, too; sometimes, they are even wrong on purpose for personal gain. A trusted expert on the stock market, for instance, could use his authority to promote a worthless asset in his portfolio and then sell before the resulting bubble pops.\n\nWhether intentional or not, such false analyses have contributed to all of the worst market crashes in history. Take the wrong medical advice, and you could die. You can’t be an expert on every subject, so it’s of crucial importance to pick others that you can trust.\n\nThis is the type of authority to which Bitcoin is most vulnerable, as it questions the protocol itself. We’ve taken the core developers’ words for it that there is no undiscovered math trick that could cause you to lose your bitcoins; if everyone is wrong about how cryptocurrency works, then its resilience against other forms of authority could be a myth.\n\nThe open source community is mostly transparent, however, and constantly reviews itself for accuracy. The same market forces that would oust the developers for being bribed would do so for being incompetent, as well. We are essentially questioning the validity of science and mathematics, which are the foundation of human progress.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin is extremely resilient to the influences of authority, but not completely. Violent authorities lack the technological means to stop it; coercive methods are too expensive, and barring a declaration of abolition by major world religions, no moral authority of sufficient power will arise to challenge it, either.\n\nThe most powerful authorities in Bitcoin are intellectual authorities, whom we trust to teach us how the blockchain and P2P networks work. Our movement is founded on brilliant technological innovation, the failure of which would immediately render bitcoins worthless. Bitcoin’s strength is in how it works, and so is vulnerable to the threat of improper design.\n\nThat’s why it’s important for the Bitcoin elite to be diverse and accountable. If the core Bitcoin client fails, there are plenty of developers eager to replace the primary team or prop up an alternative cryptocurrency instead. We could even invent something to replace the blockchain paradigm, and continue essentially the same crusade under another name.\n\nThe only person with real power over Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto, who possesses all non-violent types of authority. Being its pseudonymous inventor makes his (or her) intellectual authority over the blockchain hard to question, and his visionary campaign against central banks makes him the community’s ultimate moral authority, as well. He also is likely to have a lot of bitcoins, which he could dump to crash the price, but–like most Bitcoiners–this author believes he won’t.\n\nBest Selling Celebrity Dresses\n\nWhat’s Popular', 'In a new statement, Taiwan\'s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) – its top banking, insurance and securities regulator – has indicated its stance on bitcoin remains neutral despite recent speculation it was moving toward more restrictive policies.\n\nEarlier this month, Taiwanese news service Central News Agency reported that the FSC had issued new statements on bitcoin and digital currencies, deeming them ""illegal"". The statements were attributed to FSC chief Tseng Ming-chung who, while not quoted directly, reportedly said during a legislative hearing that digital currencies were unlawful.\n\nCNA further reported that Tseng ""pledged that the FSC would work with the country\'s central bank and police to crack down any illegal act"", sparking speculation that financial regulators were looking to take action against those using digital currency.\n\nHowever, in new statements to CoinDesk, the agency has suggested more recent speculation was not accurate as reported.\n\nThe FSC\'s Banking Bureau told CoinDesk in an email:\n\n""At the end of 2013, the Central Bank of the Republic of China and the FSC has released a joint statement that defines Bitcoin as a \'virtual commodity\'. Considering the non-currency nature and risk of Bitcoin, the FSC has required banks in Taiwan not to receive or exchange Bitcoin. At present, the FSC’s position on this issue remains the same as before.""\n\nThe statement mirrors a similar statement issued when the FSC blocked bitcoin ATM operator Robocoin from installing machines in the country in January 2014.\n\nAt the time, the agency said that banks weren\'t allowed to touch bitcoin and that ""to install bitcoin ATMs would require approval from FSC, which will not be given"".\n\nThe agency did not outline whether it would seek to prohibit certain types of digital currency activity or ban it outright.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Some may say that the future is already here (here's to you, Hoverboards!). However, more changes to our everyday lives are coming. Just like email took over handwritten letters and downloadable tunes replaced the iconic Walkman, Bitcoin is the new worldwide currency.\n\nBitcoin is the answer we've been waiting for to our monetary problems, especially internationally. When purchasing, selling, or transferring money between countries, big fees always stand in the way. We're forced to stalk exchange rates to hopefully get the best deal. Hell, even when we keeping our money within the country, big banks always find a way to slap us with fees. They need to make money too, right?\n\nThat's where the beauty of Bitcoin shines. People aren't at the center of this ingenious structure; instead, a powerful network of computers and complicated algorithms run the entire system. Thus, there is no entity, like a bank or government, running the system. Bitcoin is run completely by its users. This will help us take back our control over the money we work hard for. We will be able to use our funds to our best capabilities, without paying the middleman.\n\nThe elimination of hefty fees alone is enough for businesses to want to get involved with Bitcoin. Less transaction fees and more availability for customers around the world only opens up windows for your business that other competitors may not have even thought about. For these reasons, my company, Restaurantware, accepts Bitcoin through PayPal, an easy and painless process for our Bitcoin-using customers and us. As entrepreneurs, staying on top of the latest technology and developments is vital for success -- and Bitcoin is the hottest trend right now. Adopting Bitcoin in your business is by far the smartest decision you can make today.\n\nI'm not the only one who is seeing the potential in Bitcoin. Celebrities, like actor Ashton Kutcher, former boxer Mike Tyson, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. Some politicians, like Senator Rand Paul, also embrace Bitcoin. Whether they are preparing for the digital future or enjoying the little-to-no processing fees, individuals and companies alike are taking advantage of Bitcoin right now.\n\nMany see Bitcoin's main downfall as its unpredictability, especially in its value converted to U.S. dollars. At the moment, it stands just over $350 for one Bitcoin, but it has fluctuated from $7 to over $1,000. Bitcoin is a risk, I won't deny that -- but, as an entrepreneur, I'm used to taking risks. I have to, just like every other investor. And once Bitcoin stabilizes, the rewards will be worth the ride.\n\nBitcoin is the economic future no matter how much speculation surrounds it now. The same way my grandmother was wrong when she thought email would never replace handwritten letters, Bitcoin will prove doubters wrong and dominate the marketing world. We will gain control over our currency once again, without having to pay big banks for handling our money. Bitcoin will revolutionize our transactions across the globe."", 'Smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has lauded the security benefits of decentralised monetary systems built using blockchain technology.\n\nSpeaking at Ethereum\'s DEVCON1 conference, held in London today, Szabo – often rumored to be the creator of bitcoin – gave an overview of the blockchain\'s history and highlighted the security inefficiencies of centralised systems typically used by traditional finance institutions.\n\nCentralisation is insecure, said Szabo, before noting mainstream finance\'s reliance on government and law enforcement officials for security:\n\n""This is one of the reasons why [traditional finance] is stuck and highly regulated.""\n\nSzabo also reflected on early decentralisation attempts and digital cash proposals commenting on how these had failed due to a lack of expertise and knowledge.\n\n""There are a bunch of digital cash startups which either failed or became centralised systems like PayPal,"" he added.\n\nDuring his session, Szabo urged the audience to think about security more broadly.

His stories, the journalist explained, promoted investors to purchase land certificates and £200,000 in Poyaisian sovereign bonds.\n\nUnfortunately, though, McCrum noted that Poyais did not actually exist.\n\nThe article then continues, perhaps controversially, to note that MMM – a ""social financial network"" – run by convicted fraudster Sergey Mavrodi and powered by YouTube and bitcoin was the most recent example of a pyramid scheme.\n\nHe said:\n\n""New members must purchase bitcoin to join MMM, and then receive a bonus for online testimonials describing their improbably profits. The fad helped to power an explosion in the bitcoin exchange rate, from less than $200 in September to more than $500 per bitcoin last week.""\n\n""Yet the question prompted by the recent movement in bitcoin is whether it marks a resurgence for the cryptocurrency, or merely highlights its turn in the endless parade of get rich quick schemes, which prompted Walter Bagehot, former editor of the Economist, to write \'one thing is certain, that at a particular time a great deal of stupid people have a great deal of stupid money,\'"" continued McCrum.\n\nThen, McCrum went on to list what he perceived as the digital currency\'s faults, criticising its decentralised nature.\n\n""Bitcoin also lacks another feature of currencies: the balance sheet of a central bank standing behind it. They might be intangible, but a balance sheet has two sides to it, lists of assets and liabilities.The bitcoin ledger, by comparison, is just a glorified list of liabilities, keeping track of where the bitcoins are located.""\n\nFurthermore, he said, although the number of bitcoin is limited, the number of times that the digital currency can be replicated – or mined – is not.\n\n""The inherent flaw of pyramid schemes is that they must always suck in new converts to avoid collapse, and the exponential growth in users is impossible to sustain. Bitcoin shares some of these features. It requires constant evangelism because its value derives from its use,"" he concluded.\n\nIndustry reaction\n\nUnsurprisingly, McCrum\'s piece did not go down well with various industry executives.\n\nBrian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO at Coinbase, took to Twitter to express his concerns with McCrum\'s opinion.\n\n.@FT normally outstanding journalism e.g. @muradahmed \'s reporting on Bitcoin, how\'d this opinion piece sneak in? https://t.co/R4c0NtaK2b — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) November 11, 2015\n\nArmstrong, however, was not the only pundit unhappy with the portrayal of bitcoin. Fred Ehrsam, co-founder at the San Francisco-based firm, was also quick to weigh in on the debate.\n\n1/ The @FT masterfully conflates bitcoin, a ponzi scheme, and every scary event into a single uninformative piece: https://t.co/nu7hfqAOJu — Fred Ehrsam (@FEhrsam) November 11, 2015\n\nBitcoin, it seemed was under attack as its viability as a digital currency was also brought into question by Bloomberg\'s Zeke Faux.\n\nFaux began:\n\n""This was looking like the year that bitcoin would finally move beyond its sketchy reputation as an anonymous way to buy drugs and stolen credit cards. Banks had started to study how they could use the six-year-old currency to update the world\'s outdated money transfer mechanisms; and its price swings were becoming less extreme, making it less risky for ordinary folks to use.""\n\nThen, the journalist added, came bitcoin\'s price spike, which saw it shoot past the $500 on some exchanges, before subsequently falling in value.\n\n""That\'s the kind of unruly fluctuation you might expect in a penny stock, not an invention that\'s been hyped as a trustworthy replacement for unreliable government-issued money,"" he said.\n\nNoting the difficulty of determining the real reasons behind bitcoin\'s most recent value spike, like others before him, Faux highlighted that it had taken place around the same time that a possible pyramid scheme was discovered.\n\nIn hindsight, Faux argued, bitcoin seems to have been intrinsically designed to encourage speculation, noting how the market has routinely seen wild fluctuations in value in connection to events such as the closures of online black market Silk Road and early bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.\n\nContinued defense\n\nDespite the criticism, however, The Financial Times kept up its work on the event, issuing a fourth article on the connection between MMM and the bitcoin price on 13th November.\n\nIn the piece, writer Izabella Kaminska continued to defend the media outlet\'s conclusion that MMM was behind the price spike. Yet again, there was no blockchain data given to better illustrate the connection between the two events, though statements from exchanges were again provided as evidence.\n\nKaminska nonetheless remained confident that MMM, and its increase in buy-side pressure in the market, boosted activity around the globe.\n\n""After soaring more than 100% in 30 days to $500 per bitcoin last week, this week it was back near $300. It seems much more likely that the growing popularity of MMM Global, an investment outfit targeted at people in China that bears many of the hallmarks of a pyramid scheme and requires new members to purchase bitcoins, was behind the spike,"" she wrote.\n\nKaminska\'s most glaring criticism, though, was to the drawbacks of the censorship-resistant nature of the bitcoin blockchain, long touted as its core use case.\n\nToward the end of her piece, she highlighed how the MMM scheme is representative of its drawbacks.\n\n""Now that the latest MMM Global scheme runs exclusively on bitcoin, there are far fewer checks and balances in place, meaning if fraud is discovered there is not much anyone can do about it,"" she wrote, adding:\n\n""This makes it easier for fraudsters to take advantage of the financially naive.""\n\nA Nobel for Satoshi\n\nPositive news came in the form of Satoshi Nakamoto\'s potential nomination for a Nobel Prize in economics, however, the validation will potentially be short-lived.\n\nSparked by UCLA finance professor Bhagwan Chowdhry who detailed his plans to nominate the creator or creators of bitcoin to the prize, commentators soon questioned whether the academic had violated the nomination rules by publicly disclosing his intention to support Nakamoto. The prize committee responsible for that award is now set to weigh the issue.\n\nIn a piece for Quartz, Ian Kar wrote:\n\n""On paper, Nakamoto might be an odd fit with past winners such as Robert Shiller, a Yale professor known for his work on housing prices, or 2015 winner Angus Deaton of Princeton University, whose understanding of consumption patterns has great significance to global development. And compared to conventional payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, bitcoin is still much smaller in terms of transaction volume. But Chowdry argues that bitcoin and the potential it unlocked is \'revolutionary\'.""\n\nStill, the event was widely covered both in the US and internationally, with most of the coverage highlighting the benefits of blockchain technologies as touted by investors and enthusiasts.\n\n""Not only are transactions involving the digital currency faster and more secure than those made with fiat currencies, but the technology behind it, called the blockchain, could change the way we deal with financial contracts and keep information, as well as assets, secure,"" he concluded.\n\nPete Rizzo contributed reporting.\n\nPyramid image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Today you will learn how to find sponsors for your journey and actually travel for free.\n\nPreparation\n\nThe easiest way to find money for your trip is to create a media-project. A media-project is an advertising campaign for any kind of organization. In affect, you offer to help a business generate PR, and in return they give you the money for your travel. A large number of YouTube vloggers find sponsors for their channels and if you already have a decent social media following you can use it to your advantage. But if you don’t have a large following, don’t worry, you still can find a sponsor.\n\nFirst, you need to give your project a name. I called my media-project ""CP!PTO Travel."" Also, it is best if the name of your project has its own social networking accounts so your initiative is more recognizable.\n\nSecond, you should prepare two things: an email and a presentation. Never send a presentation without an introductory email.\n\nYour presentation should be colorful and contain basic information for sponsors:\n\nYour resume with experience and technical skills;\n\nA list of group members and their profiles (if applicable);\n\nThe list of services that you can provide in exchange for sponsorship and how it will be possible to evaluate the results;\n\nThe route of your trip and how much money you need\n\nYou can offer your sponsor anything you wish in return for their support. As an example, you can offer your sponsor a parachute jump wearing their company’s logo. It doesn’t really matter. The main thing is that your proposal must be interesting. As for me, I wrote 60 mini-articles for Facebook. For my sponsor it was the equivalent of hiring a content manager for two months.\n\nSend your proposals to potential sponsors\n\nMany Bitcoin conferences and cryptocurrency events are held worldwide throughout the year. And each event has its own sponsors. Just find them and send your proposal. You have to think about who might also be interested in the PR of traveling solely on bitcoin.\n\nDraw up a contract\n\nIf you managed to find a sponsor for your Bitcoin trip – congratulations! Now you need to sign a contract with the company.\n\nThe contract must have the following conditions:\n\nWho is involved in this deal;\n\nTerms of cooperation;\n\nYour signature and the signature of the governing person in the company\n\nThese are the basic steps in creating a media-project to receive money, but understand that results may vary. Your success depends on your patience and perseverance.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinding bitcoins for travel is not difficult. The main task is searching for sponsors. Do not give up if you do not receive responses to your proposals immediately. Stay flexible and adjust your presentation as needed. The Bitcoin community is open to unconventional solutions. Good luck!', 'Music was once scarce. Before the days of MP3 and P2P file sharing, you didn’t have the ability to hear songs whenever you wished unless you bought them.\n\nToday one does not even need to download songs, as platforms such as VEVO and YouTube host many of the most popular songs of yesterday and today.\n\nThe industry was faced with a definitive problem in an age of liberal copy and distribution technology: finding new ways to monetize digital music files that lacked scarcity.\n\nA gang of computer programmers – united by the Bitcoin technology – are trying to revolutionize an industry after 15 years of disruption which began with Napster and was cemented by BitTorrent.\n\nBitcoin’s blockchain – a decentralized system powered by a network of computers – serves as the transparent backbone of the Bitcoin network. The blockchain, which functions as a public ledger, maintains the accounting of the Bitcoin network, timestamping each transaction and assigning a unique ID.\n\nNumerous individuals and companies are excited about the future of the blockchain and the music industry. Three companies, PeerTracks, Bittunes and Ujo Music, each claim their business model will liberate musicians from being under the thumbs of overbearing music labels and streaming services.\n\nPeertracks, strives to use the blockchain technology to develop an artist equity trading system. Bittunes, strives to create an independent music market. Ujo Music, seeks to design a system to fix global royalty distribution and licensing problems faced by the industry.\n\nThese entrepreneurs believe that in the future when an artist creates a song it will be stored on the blockchain with its own unique ID, just like bitcoin is today.\n\nThe music industry has attempted to solve some of these problems before. But projects such as the Global Repertoire Database (GRD) never came to be. Still, the music industry has needed a new revenue and business model in the wake of Napster and peer-to-peer file sharing.\n\nPeertracks strives to become the perfect music streaming and retail platform that propels peer-to-peer discovery. Peertracks depends on the creation of “artist tokens,” a sort of Bitcoin alternative, the value of which depends on the popularity of the artist who created the coin. As in basic economics, the higher the demand, the higher the worth of the artist token. The less demand, the lower the worth.\n\n“Our goal is to enable new ways of monetizing music and not be forced to rely so much on royalties coming from the sales of nonscarce digital files,” Peertracks CEO, Cedric Cobban, tells Bitcoin Magazine .\n\nPeertracks introduced MUSE at the Fair Music Public Forum, held by Berklee’s Rethink Music on October 2 in Boston. The MUSE blockchain purports to be an open, global ledger, specifically engineered and tailored for the music industry. MUSE seeks to not only manage copyrights but also the payment mechanism itself.\n\n“No need for legacy banking to pay out royalties earned from music streams/sales,” Cobban says. The system revolves around Muse_USD, “a cryptocurrency that tracks the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar.”\n\nMUSE will also allow artists to create their own “Notes” – a limited edition, cryptographic token that acts like a VIP pass into the artist’s career. Notes initially allow artists to crowdfund and know who their most engaged fans are.\n\n“For the artist, there is great value in knowing who exactly is supporting him financially and enabling him to continue making a living from music,” Cobban said.\n\nMUSE isn’t the only such project. Bittunes seeks to use peer-to-peer file-sharing technology with the latest technology in digital payment systems “to radically change the way the technology has been applied so that ordinary people actually earn money by becoming the new distribution channel for digital music,” Bittunes managing director Simon Edhouse told Bitcoin Magazine .\n\n“In this way, Bittunes deals directly with the music piracy problem, with a carrot not a stick, rewarding artists fairly, and allowing users to potentially earn 5-to-10-times profits on song purchases,” Edhouse said. “To achieve this will not be easy, but the end result could be nothing short of revolutionary.”\n\nThen there is Ujo, a proposed new shared infrastructure for the creative industries that aims to return more value to content creators and their customers. Built in collaboration with the Grammy-winning artist Imogen Heap, Ujo was released last month, and is headed by Phil Barry, who led a team advising Thom Yorke on his BitTorrent strategy for his solo album, Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. Barry also advised Radiohead on its digital strategy for the band’s ninth studio album.\n\nUjo’s model is different, focusing on creating an open-source rights database and payment infrastructure. Ujo, like Peertracks, wants to revolutionize how money is distributed to artists and rights holders.\n\n“Our open platform uses blockchain technology to create a transparent and decentralised database of rights and rights owners, and automates royalty payments using smart contracts and cryptocurrency,” said Phil Barry, founding partner at Edmund Hart, which oversees Ujo. “We hope that it will be the foundation upon which a new more transparent, more efficient and more profitable music ecosystem can be built.”\n\nFor Barry, the heart of the music industry is the content creators.\n\n“The most important participants in the music industry are artists and writers,” Barry says. “They create the raw material upon which everybody else is dependent.” He acknowledges the music industry is 15 years into a major transformation and disruption.\n\n“The pattern that I see emerging is that the purpose of a record company is becoming increasingly focused,” Barry said. “Major music companies no longer add value through ownership of chains of record stores or manufacturing plants, but they still finance and market the majority of hit records.”\n\nBarry believes this will change over time.\n\n“I think we will see a big reduction in the share of revenue record labels command as compared with artists and writers,” Barry said. “Handing over copyrights will become increasingly rare.”\n\nWhat’s more, he believes the industry is watching the changes.\n\n“Many companies and performing rights organizations share a really quite bold vision of what the future might look like if blockchain is widely adopted,” he said. “I think everybody can see that sooner or later blockchain is going to bring about change in not just music but all creative industries.”\n\nTherefore, players in the creative industries have a duty to understand the technology.\n\n“Nobody wants to repeat the mistakes of the Napster era,” he said.', 'Roger Ver stars prominently in a new documentary by Dutch TV station VPRO. He opens the show by demonstrating to people in the Netherlands how a Bitcoin transaction works, using his home entertainment system and his smart phone.\n\nSomeone watching the show on the first broadcast would have had the opportunity to claim 100 Euros in Bitcoin as a result of Ver’s demonstration. Ver is identified in the film as a “Bitcoin evangelist,” and for most purposes, that has been his largest role in Bitcoin. However, the man has also backed a number of Bitcoin companies. He says in the video that he made his first purchase for over 20,000 Bitcoin when they were worth around $1 a piece. That initial purchase is now worth more than $6 million. He also says that he continued to invest in Bitcoin at this early stage.\n\nHowever, there are some who feel that Ver is not the best face for Bitcoin. He vouched for Mt. Gox during its worst turmoil and turned out to be wrong, for one thing, and then there is the looming issue of his checkered history with the US Government. After getting in trouble for essentially selling firecrackers on eBay many years ago, the entrepreneur eventually renounced his citizenship and currently lives in Japan.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Super-Investor Roger Ver: Bitcoin Exchange OKCoin May Be Insolvent\n\nVer tells the audience, regarding Bitcoin adoption:\n\nThinking it’s too late to get involved with Bitcoin is like thinking it’s too late to get involved with the Internet, or to get involved with using a cell phone. It’s not too late to get involved in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going to make your life easier in so many ways and the price of Bitcoin is only like $200 right now. If Bitcoin gets really popular all over the world, the price is going to have to be at least tens of thousands of dollars per Bitcoin if not hundreds of thousands of dollars per Bitcoin.\n\nSome would prefer a less controversial face, like Andreas Antonopolous, the frequent speaker and author of the O’Reilly book on the subject, to be considered the Bitcoin Jesus. Later in the film, Ver gives even more bitcoins away at a presentation. But the savior Roger Ver is not the only figure who is highlighted in the video.\n\nMarshall Long, an early miner, was also covered. He says it took him about 3 weeks to figure out how mining worked and also gave an anecdote about his wife made him move his mining operation out of the house, which started his business, FinalHash.\n\nFinancial Times writer Izabella Kaminska ways in, sporting a Bloomberg terminal, discussing a “price over politics” view of Bitcoin that can be less popular in some parts of the community. She also says that she believes a stable price is best for Bitcoin, in that it makes adoption more approachable for many. However, it should be noted that wild volatility attracts investors more than stable prices ever will.\n\nWhat I think people have projected on his paper as saying is this world where we are all our own bank. We don’t have to depend on any intermediary and banks are gone. In the current economy, because of the way our money is structured, if I decide to horde my dollars then I’m usually hording them in an institution that is using them as a means of capital and they will be lending them out. So that money, even though I am saving, is going into an investment somewhere else. […] But in Bitcoin, there isn’t that opportunity. So a horded Bitcoin is a horded Bitcoin. It’s totally idle. It has no interest, it has no yield. It is simply sitting there and yet the person who is holding onto it thinks they have a right to future income flow, as if they have been investing.\n\nShe ended her segment with a note on how the Bitcoin economy is “unequal.” Then Brett Scott, author of Hacking the Future of Money, a book about financial regulatory reform, came on to talk about the same property of Bitcoin. He, however, tempered his statements with acknowledgement that Bitcoin acts as an important alternative to traditional banking. He said there would be “massive inequality” issues in an economy entirely backed by Bitcoin, but that there are also huge problems with banking as we know it today.\n\nThere was also the inevitable part of the documentary, where they talked to someone who is accepting Bitcoin in commerce. They covered parts of Arnhem, Netherlands, which has a “Bitcoin Boulevard” section for Bitcoin tourists.\n\nIn all, the film was well-rounded, having its share of critics and proponents.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
11/14/2015,"['Investment in financial technology companies trebled last year, providing a hint of the scale of digital disruption banks face. According to research from Accenture, the total amount invested in the global fintech sector rose from just over $4bn, in 2013, to more than $12bn last year, as record amounts were poured into companies developing technologies that promise to turn the financial sector on its head.\n\nInvestments into blockchain tech companies has already exceeded the 2014 total, and many of the world\'s biggest banks have publicly stated an interest in exploring the use of blockchain technology. R3 CEV has put together a consortium of at least 22 different megabanks, that intend to explore distributed ledger technologies, while Blythe Master\'s Digital Asset Holdings is exploring private blockchain solutions.\n\n- Matthew Roszak, Tally Capital Founding Partner\n\nAccenture expects banks to take advantage of permissioned distributed ledgers for almost instantaneous settlement of currency, equity, and fixed income trades, which will drive efficiency and potentially create new asset classes.\n\nThe sentiment is mirrored in a HSBC Corporate Insights report, produced in partnership with a leading research and advisory firm specialising in the Financial Services industry, Celent.\n\n- Gareth Lodge, Celent Senior Analyst\n\nSeveral factors, not least technology, are driving this dramatic shift, explains the report\'s Author, Gareth Lodge. Thirty years ago, banks were at the leading edge. Networks such as SWIFT pushed the boundaries of what was possible. In the last decade, however, banks’ IT has remained static, whilst customers have accelerated away. “In effect, there has been a technological seesaw.”\n\n- Lodge\n\nStartup advisor and OB1 board member William Mougayar apears to agree with this statement, but points out that, “reengineering their business processes will be a bigger challenge than figuring out the technology.”\n\n- William Mougayar, OB1 Board Member\n\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is an American post-trade financial services company, providing clearing and settlement services to the financial markets. With roots that go back to the 70’s, and the “paper work” crisis brought on by a sharp increase in securities trading, the DTCC settles the vast majority of securities transactions in the United States, and close to $1.7 quadrillion in value during 2011.\n\n""Those processes that came after the paperwork crisis were better, but there is a need now for a more elegant and better solution,"" said Hans Morris, a former president of Visa who runs a financial technology investment firm Nyca Partners. Nyca recently agreed to make an investment in a blockchain company called Clearmatics Technologies Ltd. in the U.K.\n\nThe Clearmatics investment is one of many this year. Visa recently participated in a US$30m funding round for Chain, which is among a handful of startups vying to dominate the new field of blockchain technology for Wall Street. Other investors included Citi Ventures, Capital One Financial and Nasdaq.\n\nNasdaq, the second-largest exchange in the world by market capitalization, has shown its interest in using the blockchain for proxy voting, and reducing financial trade settlement time, which is commonly a 3 day (T-3) process.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, the company\'s CEO Bob Greifeld stated, “I am a big believer in the ability of blockchain technology to effect fundamental change in the infrastructure of the financial services industry.”\n\n- Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq CEO\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin Foundation\'s founding director, Jon Matonis, is quick to point out that disruption will affect other entrenched legacy systems. “The current SWIFT system will be replaced but it won\'t be replaced with private blockchains in another SWIFT-like cartel nor will it be replaced with a SWIFT-administered blockchain.”\n\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) provides a network that enables financial institutions send and receive information about financial transactions. The Society also has roots in the 70’s, and linked more than 9,000 financial institutions in 209 countries and territories in 2010, who were exchanging an average of over 15 million messages per day.\n\n- Jon Matonis, Bitcoin Foundation Founding Director\n\nMatonis, has a background in banking and worked for Visa and VeriSign before discovering cryptocurrencies. “The major constraint for banks is that they will still be operating in a fully-permissioned (and censored) environment which does nothing to improve the credential and authentication efficiency challenges existing today,” he states.\n\n- Matonis\n\nSocial Network CEO, economist, bitcoin speaker and publisher Jeffrey Tucker points out that leveraging blockchain technology may well be beyond the capabilities of many financial institutions. ""[Banks] face a serious problem in trying to recreate an open source technology in a proprietary space,” he states.\n\n- Jeffrey Tucker, CLO Liberty.me and Laissez-Faire Books Executive Editor\n\nWhile Mougayar and Tucker highlight the difficulties faced by banks, Tally Capital\'s Roszak offers a completely different opinion on why banks would state an interest in the technology at all. ""There’s lots of pressure for these firms to cut costs, while operating in a technologically inefficient and highly regulated space, coupled with disruption on the horizon with the unbundling of financial services already in motion (Lending Tree, PayPal, Wealthfront, etc.) — however banks exploring blockchain today has its PR benefits, and in many ways is similar to the early adopter merchants accepting BTC about 2 years ago — makes them look tech savvy and smart.”\n\n- Roszak\n\nThe defining difference between “private” and “permissioned” blockchains, and a public blockchain like Bitcoin’s, is that they have access points. This means an entity, or group, controls who can access the services, which is a situation that regulators and banking compliance officers are compelled to favour.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers is a multinational professional services network. It’s the largest professional services firm in the world, and is one of the Big Four auditors, along with Deloitte, EY and KPMG. The firm recommends that firms operating on a global basis need to demonstrate a robust compliance framework ensuring that each territory has sufficient oversight, and that Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer regulatory requirements are being adhered to at both a local and global level.\n\n- PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nRegardless of the reasons for adoption, many in the bitcoin community wonder what will happen if banks move on to using a public blockchain. Accenture expects investment banks to initially run private Blockchain solutions, until “capital markets players are confident in the types of services they can offer on a public (permissionless) Blockchain.”\n\nKYC regulation may well restrict the types of services that institutions can offer on a public blockchain. The restricting access to customers is directly opposed to the basic premise of bitcoin public blockchain. ”A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,” states the protocols white paper.\n\n- Mougayar\n\nMatonis reiterates this point, regulation is a “major weakness” for banks. “The problem with banks is not that they lack a type of blockchain technology; the problem with banks is that operate in a highly-regulated cartel environment with massive government-managed barriers to entry and privileged status.”\n\n- Matonis\n\nIn Celent\'s report, Lodge touches on market share and the landscape of competition that retail banks face. “Previously banks competed with other banks who pretty much offered the same palette of products and services. Competition was relatively stable, incremental and predictable. Technology has allowed non-banks to enter the market, and they change the game.”\n\nMatonis offered two examples of companies that embody this change, Epiphyte and Abra Global. Epiphyte works in the wholesale space, whereas Abra sticks to the retail space. Both use bitcoins to move value between legacy financial institutions, but they let companies like Coinbase or Bitpay deal with the volatility risk for them.\n\nUsing private blockchains means staying far away from this model, but demonstrates the difficulties that banks face. “I don\'t see the banks using Bitcoin as a money service due to regulatory constraints, but the other places are good starting points of experimentation,” said Mougayar. Matonis concurred that banks are “not focused on the currency aspect, but rather on the applications side.”\n\nA video released by Fortune shows the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, stating this point emphatically, “you are wasting your time with Bitcoin.” In his personal view, the US Government, and specifically the Department of Justice, would stop an emerging market based on bitcoin, should it be declared illegal. “There will be no real non-controlled currency in the world,” he states.\n\n- Jamie Dimon\n\nFor the time being, it seems like a given that banks will continue their search for ways to improve their current systems using private blockchains. For Mougayar, “it will be all a blur” in 10 years time, “with Bitcoin having permeated the currency space, and the Blockchain having permeated the applications space.”\n\nLodge states a similar outcome, “in one scenario, banks suffer death by a thousand cuts, and find that the most profitable pieces of their franchise are gradually eroded, leaving them with the burden of regulation and the cost of the commoditized pieces that are left. In another scenario, banks use this opportunity to re-imagine themselves, and focus on the pieces of the value chain that they are best suited for and generate the most value for them (and their customers).”\n\nMeanwhile, Matonis thinks that central bank fiat money will exist side-by-side with bitcoin in the intermediate term. “This will tend to keep central bank issuers honest and over time bitcoin may be held in parallel alongside gold as a significant reserve asset.” While this doesn\'t negate the need for a bank, there is an even bigger target that Matonis sees in Bitcoin\'s crosshairs. “ultimately, however, it is central banks, not commercial banks, that have the most to fear from decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin because it renders them obsolete.”', 'Scandinavian countries are looking forward to the development of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. Jaakko Hynynen, CEO of the Startup Sauna Accelerator, told CoinTelegraph at the Slush conference that Nordic countries are ready to adopt Bitcoin and blockchain. However, there is a lack of market research which is causing the technology to develop slower. Nevertheless, Viking descendants realize the disruptive potential of Satoshi’s invention, which could change many aspects of life beyond currency.\n\nJaakko Hynynen expressed that Bitcoin and blockchain technologies have a great potential for integration into many spheres of business, beside cryptocurrency. And insurance is just one example.\n\n“I believe the future of the blockchain lies not only in the sphere of digital currency. The system can be used in the field of insurance and other fields. The technology can be integrated by big Scandinavian banks and insurance companies. People who work in those establishments are really technically aware so they are ready to adopt this innovation,” said Hynynen.\n\nHowever, the path of cryptocurrency to Scandinavian markets wasn’t easy. Only recently was Bitcoin accepted as a currency with 25% VAT tax for converting local currencies to bitcoin removed. History shows that people still treat Bitcoin suspiciously, especially in Norway. Nevertheless, Sweden and Finland are accepting it much more readily than their neighbor.\n\nIt is worth mentioning XBT’s BTO bitcoin-based asset, which can be traded through NASDAQ. It is the first time a digital asset could be traded through a traditional, regulated stock exchange.\n\nAnother breakthrough came from Finland with Kryptoradio, a live blockchain TV which allows the broadcasting of the Bitcoin blockchain via a national television network. The project was launched in late 2014, thanks to the partnership of Koodilehto, FIMKrypto and Finnish national television broadcaster Digita.\n\nDespite all this, Bitcoin and blockchain development is slower than it could be. Jaakko Hynynen thinks this is due to a lack of market research. He also advises developers to explore consumer needs more thoroughly to provide exactly the products they would need:\n\n“Blockchain and Bitcoin are technically difficult. So people who create products and technologies around Bitcoin and blockchain are technically savvy. What usually happens is that they create great products but they don’t think about what’s the use case, who are potential customers and what’s the right market for that. So the developers should always bear the customer’s needs in mind. They should do the legwork and go talk to potential customers and figure out if their product is actually something that people or companies would need.”\n\nStartup Sauna, founded in September 2012, has received wide national support. The startup was created to build a strong ecosystem of companies in the Nordic region, Eastern Europe and Russia. The Startup Sauna Accelerator operates on the basis of helping companies to develop. In addition, the startup holds a Slush conference for Europe’s leading startups and investors.', 'Key Highlights\n\nThe Bitcoin price recently corrected higher after declining close to the ¥1800 level.\n\nIt looks like the price has completed the correction phase and may start trading lower once again.\n\nThere was a major support trend line formed on the hourly chart (price feed from BTCChina), which was broken to ignite a downside move.\n\nBitcoin price rebound from the ¥1811 low is likely completed and it may start to move lower if sellers gain momentum.\n\nRetest of ¥2000 Likely?\n\nThe Bitcoin price managed to gain bids near the ¥1800 support area and managed to recover some ground. However, it looks like the recovery is now over and the price may start to move lower once again. The price recently tested a monster confluence resistance area of ¥2200 where the 100 hourly simple moving average (MA) along with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the ¥2550 high to ¥1811 low prevented the upside. There was a bullish trend line formed on the hourly chart, which was breached recently to encourage sellers to take the price lower.\n\nThere is contracting triangle pattern forming as well (price feed from Huobi), which might act as a catalyst for the next move. If sellers gain control and manage to take the price below the triangle, then a downside move towards ¥2000 is possible.\n\nLooking at the indicators:\n\nMACD – The hourly MACD is mostly flat is it looks like setting up for the next move that may be a bear leg.\n\nRSI (Relative Strength Index) – The hourly RSI below the 50 level, which is a sign that buyers are losing grip.\n\nOn the upside a break and close above the 100 MA is needed if the price has to trade higher.\n\nIntraday Support Level – ¥2000\n\nIntraday Resistance Level – ¥2200\n\nOverall, a break and close below the highlighted triangle may be a signal for a sell in the short term.\n\nCharts from BTCChina and Huobi; hosted by Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Having Roma be the first exception to that, having her identity registered first in the blockchain [rather] than anywhere else, is a powerful statement that declares her a citizen of Earth rather than an arbitrary piece of territory controlled by central power.""\n\n""This was her first birth certificate and as such it\'s a simple piece of data that can always be proven anywhere in the world with an Internet connection. Politically speaking, that\'s incredibly powerful if you think about it. While states rely on closed bureaucracies to support their institutional belief system, the world has the Internet and the blockchain,"" he added.\n\nRegistering the birth\n\nSiri\'s family, perhaps unsurprised by the entrepreneur\'s ongoing fascination with technology, welcomed the idea to register Roma\'s arrival on the blockchain.\n\n""Those close to me already know how passionate I am about blockchain and civic technologies in general. My family probably thinks that I am a bit crazy, but when I consulted Pia to do this she gave me her full support,"" said Siri, adding:\n\n""She\'s also a firm believer in the revolutionary implications this new wave of the Internet can have for generations to come.""\n\nTo register the birth, Siri first filmed a video, stating the baby\'s full name, date and location of birth and hashed it on the blockchain using blockchain verification service Proof of Existence. In so doing, the entrepreneur ensured that the file was notarised and validated by bitcoin\'s mining network, a global network of computers contributing to the ledger.\n\nTo validate the process further, Siri also added his testimony and included that of Roma\'s mother and her two grandmothers.\n\nAdditional proof was provided in the form of the hospital birth certificate, although in the video Siri purposely noted that the birth had taken place in San Francisco and refrained from mentioning a nation state or a specific geographical location or jurisdiction.\n\nHe also showed a screenshot which displayed the last mined block on the blockchain.\n\n""No one can challenge that [the] file was shot before Sunday, 8th November or modify its content without altering the proof, making this file a valid certificate of the events it describes,"" he added.\n\nLove at first sight\n\nSiri also used his interview to speak about his interest in the technology, which began in 2011, and how it could grow to impact the world his daughter grows up in.\n\n""It was love at first sight, specially for someone living in a country like Argentina with high inflation and inability to acquire foreign currency,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nThese technologies, he said, have an intrinsic emancipating force which help users become independent agents:\n\n""[Bitcoin and blockchain] do not require permission and it immediately connects anyone to a financial system that\'s not controlled by governments or banks. And in my view, what the web has done for media and culture, the blockchain will do for institutions and human organisations.""\n\nSiri speaks from experience, noting how he\'s seen the extent to which this nascent technology has proved for activists in his native South America.\n\nSimilarly to his contemporaries, the entrepreneur explained that he believes blockchain\'s and bitcoin\'s biggest potential lies in developing countries where there is an urgent need for alternative systems to transform the status quo.\n\nSiri said he is close to the blockchain and decentralised community in the San Francisco area, but cautioned that there is still a long way to go before this technology fulfills its potential.\n\n""Developing these kind of applications is not trivial, it still feels like [only] a few [are] working on this extremely innovative piece of technology and certainly we are at the early days of the revolution,"" he concluded.\n\nIdentity on the blockchain\n\nThe blockchain\'s potential for identity registration has been highlighted in the past, with various companies in the space working specifically on this use case.\n\nShoCard – which recently raised $1.5m in funding– is seeking to leverage blockchain technology for identity management.\n\nOpen-source identity protocol provider OneName, which received seed funding from investors including Barry Silbert and San Francisco-based investment firm SV Angel, is also working to disrupt the way in which identity is managed online.\n\nFurther afield, the possibility of using a decentralised ledger to register identity has also caught the attention of celebrities such as Lucy Liu, who was revealed as a surprising advocate during the private Block Chain Summit held at Richard Branson\'s private island earlier this year.\n\nImage via Santiago Siri\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

So instead of user accounts being stored in one concentrated location that that aggregates all the valuable data and is a huge incentive to attack, the data is stored in small encrypted files and the value is much harder to find, said Airbitz.\n\nDecentralised value requires more resources to hack since more devices need to be attacked to find this value and the payoff is nowhere near as high as hacking a traditional enterprise server, reasons Airbitz.

It seems the state employee where reefer is legalized doesn’t see the incredible amounts of capital injection happening all around the world from these businesses. In fact, it’s interesting he and other U.S. officials have not seen the level of wealth being poured into the state provided by cannabis companies.\n\nAlso read: How Bitcoin will Make GoPro Awards Even Better\n\nGiving an advisory on behalf of Colorado states CSC, Rome believes three emerging investments are very risky right now. The ventures mentioned are some of the fastest growing sectors in our global economy right now which include, cannabis, binary options, and digital currency. These newly conceived business services look to being doing well in Rome’s eyes yet they can be dangerous to those who think it’s the “next big thing” The securities commissioner feels there is plenty of opportunity within these environments however if you reside in CO should probably contact your division of securities for investment advice. Gerald Rome says in his report:\n\n“At first glance, marijuana, binary options and digital currency appear to have no real connection to each other. But what they all have in common is their recent emergence as three investments both sellers and buyers hope it will become the ‘Next Big Thing.’ Before you consider investing, make sure you understand what these products are, their benefits, and their risks” — Gerald Rome, Colorado Securities Commissioner\n\nAccording to ArcView Market Research, “The legal cannabis business is the fastest growing new industry around.” Rome in his warning report reveals due to lack of regulation and semi-legitimate status the sector is filled with volatility. Binary Options is another concern for Rome as he views the investment as an online gambling tactic rather than a traditional security. Finally, Bitcoin is a digital currency that to him “fluctuates wildly” and users should proceed with caution and follow up with regulatory advice. He says the virtual money is filled with news rumors, and the digital realm is filled with malicious hackers. The commissioner believes in his advisory that many precautions should be taken with these three operations and it is most important to rely on state-issued findings for warning signs. The Colorado state official is not the only one concerned with these three investments as the Department of Financial Institutions is also giving the same warning. With Bitcoin investing the DFI says:\n\n“Different countries and jurisdictions have little uniformity” on regulations, thus leading scammers to “take advantage of the confusion and contradictions to misinform potential investors.” Digital currency, difficult to trace, is also vulnerable to cyberattacks.” — Washington, Department of Financial Institutions\n\nOn the flipside of these arguments, these three sectors are some of the largest growing areas of business globally. All of them have added exponential amounts of startups and venture capital into the world economy. The Huffington Post agrees with the ArcView analysis saying that Cannabis is the fastest growing industry right now and seems to be gaining more steam daily. The iFXEXPO industry review reveals that binary options are a sizzling product in the market as well, and its growth has seen record levels. Brokers working in the industry are not concerned with the correlation to gambling as they focus on optimal trading.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology has seen renewed interest this year in 2015. The year was celebrated as the industry had a record 1 Billion in venture capital investments. The value of the digital asset had also climbed from 2014’s slump and the price gained considerably during the beginning of the fall months. Mainstream media has been positive towards the currency and its technology giving added trust to newcomers joining the network.\n\nThe three investments the U.S. officials are concerned with happen to be the top industries in our economy that have little-centralized control. It is to be expected that they are concerned with the amount of wealth that is not funneling through their regulatory committees. When revenue increases for the bureaucrats pockets most likely, the opinions will change as it seems most of these officials just want their cut.\n\nWhat do you think of the Cannabis economy, Binary Options, and Bitcoin? Are they dangerous? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nImages courtesy of Redmemes and Shutterstock\n\nOriginally posted on: U.S. Officials Warn Against Cannabis and Bitcoin Investment', 'The Bank of Canada has stated they are starting an initiative to look into changing their monetary policies. The central bank’s second in command Carolyn Wilkins had some encouraging words to say about Bitcoin. Tired of the results of quantitative easing and manipulated interest rates they have begun looking at alternative tools to stave off the financial crisis and a stagnate economy.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Business: Smart Contracts\n\n“One important challenge that central banks now face, many of them, is that conventional monetary policy is stretched to its limits in many countries, where policy interest rates are at, or below, zero.”\n\nCanada has always been an innovator when it comes to technology. Wilkins said, “Canada has a history of being a monetary-policy innovator.” and the financial sectors there attest to this statement. The region is home to seven of Deloitte’s Canadian Technology Fast 50 FinTech companies, and the financial tech industry is growing fast. On February 11, 2014, Parliament passed the first official national law towards cryptocurrency and many saw this as a sign of a country attempting to regulate it. Close to a million people are employed by the FinTech industry in Canada, and disruptive startups are seen everywhere. At a speech in Toronto, CIBC CEO Victor Dodig said:\n\n“These days nimble organizations, both large and small, have begun to disrupt the Canadian financial landscape.”\n\nCarolyn Wilkins believes there are excellent examples of innovation within the Canadian economy like Uber and PayPal. The Bank of Canada representative believes there needs to be a radical change in thought concerning traditional finance and emerging technology. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are on the rise to becoming financial disruptors as well. Wilkins feels Canada will always invest more into bolstering economic reform so they can make better decisions and avoid certain financial turbulence in the future. Wilkins and fellow constituents believe some kind of e-money could break the chains of inflation and bogged interest rates throughout the land. On the Vancouver Sun, Wilkins states:\n\n“We have to envisage a world in which people mostly use e-money, perhaps even one that’s not denominated in the national currency, like Bitcoin,”\n\nThe second in command at the Bank of Canada says these kinds of new dynamics in global monetary order would be a change from the current ways the central banks handle things. Wilkins says, “central banks, quite frankly, struggle to implement monetary policy.” Wilkins stresses that Canada will curb the global crisis in their region by being open to new technologies. Canadians are taking the FinTech industry by storm with the region’s popular publication The Globe And Mail stating: The country is becoming a hotbed for these “fintech” firms, threatening a dramatic shift in the financial services sector, driven by technology and a set of savvy entrepreneurs.\n\nThe countryside is also home to some very fine cryptocurrency startups like CryptoCapital and Blockstream. Innovator and venture capitalist Anthony Di lorio resides in Toronto spreading the ideas of decentralized technologies with his projects Decentral, Kryptokit and the Ethereum Project. Kraken has opened an exchange in the country, and Coinbase now does service there as well. Canada has an array of choices when it comes to financial technology and digital currency solutions. Just recently Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) CEO Dave McKay praised distributed ledger technology calling it “quantum innovation.” RBC is one of the largest lending institutions based out of Canada and looking into a hybrid version of Bitcoin as the currency itself is not up to their expectations. The country has a vast and cooperative relationship with disruptive technologies and seems to recognize old methods like quantitative easing are not working.\n\nWhat do you think of the Bank of Canada siding with Bitcoin?

11/15/2015,"['Long-running arbitration reality TV show Judge Judy featured a case earlier this week involving a bitcoin trader and allegations of payment fraud.\n\nThe episode, dated 12th November, concerns a man named Dan Haahr who claimed to have been defrauded while trying to purchase a truck over eBay.\n\nHaahr, who sought $2,000 in damages, alleged Marlon Koland of being part of a scheme to steal his money – a charge Koland, a bitcoin trader from Oregon, denied.\n\nHaahr claimed that those behind the scam created a fictitious eBay front through which a bank account number tied to Koland was provided. He said he confirmed that the seller he spoke with was a fraud after speaking with a legitimate eBay representative.\n\nKoland said that he was innocent. He claimed that had been scammed by someone who claimed to want to buy bitcoins from him. The bank account information that he provided, he said, was later used to solicit funds from Haahr. As a result, it appeared on paper that his bank account was tied to the fraud that targeted Haahr.\n\nAdjudicator Judith ""Judy"" Sheindlin, a former New York prosecutor and Manhattan family courts judge, ultimately sided with Haahr. During the episode, she conceded that she doesn’t understand bitcoin, declaring:\n\n“Mr. Koland says that he, too, was a victim. He was trying to deal with something called bitcoin, which I don\'t’ understand. If you tried to explain it to me from today to tomorrow I still wouldn’t get it.”\n\nSheindlin drew contention with the fact that Koland had no proof to back his claim that his bank account – which he conceded had been open for about a month – was closed due to fraud problems. In the end, she awarded Haahr the $2,000 in damages.\n\nIt’s important to note that Judge Judy isn’t a real court of law. The hearings constitute a binding arbitration and any penalties assessed are paid for by the show rather than those on the losing end.\n\nYet the episode does, perhaps, shine a light on how judges with little understanding of bitcoin oversee personal cases involving the digital currency.\n\nThe fully Haahr vs. Koland segment can be viewed below:\n\nHat tip: Reddit\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Hsien Long emphasized the banking industry’s importance to his nation’s economy.\n\nHe began his talk by reviewing the history of UOB, one of the country’s first banks. In 1935, during the Great Depression, a group of Chinese businessmen pooled their resources to set up the bank now known as UOB. It had a single branch in rented premises, and it engaged in short-term loans. It has much to celebrate, Hsien Long said. It now has 76 branches in Singapore and 520 offices in 19 countries. It holds $300 billion USD in assets, making it one of the world’s top banks in terms of assets.\n\nOne reason the banking industry has been successful in Singapore is that the country has a vibrant economy and is a nation that has a sound regulatory regime governed by the rule of law.\n\nIn 1997, the government took measures to strengthen the financial sector. The industry was not as efficient and responsive to the market as it could have been.\n\nThe government opened up the banking sector to foreign players, a move that forced domestic banks to consolidate and to innovate.\n\nLocal banks held their own against tough competition and have grown, Hsien Long said. They are now among the strongest and safest financial institutions in the world.\n\nBanks Face Big Challenges\n\nLooking ahead, banking is entering a challenging phase. “Global growth is lackluster,” he said. There is a chance of a regional economic slowdown. Interest rates have been low for a long period, crimping investment.\n\n“Banks are facing tighter regulations, post (banking) crisis,” he said. “There are higher capital and liquidity requirements.”\n\nOn top of that, “technology is moving very fast, with new business models disrupting traditional banking.” People are doing all sorts of financial transactions on smartphones.\n\n“Payment modes are changing,” he said, noting the rapid growth of Alibaba in China, the world’s e-commerce leader. In one day recently, Alibaba shoppers racked up more than $14 billion USD in sales.\n\nBanking operations are also changing. Companies are finding new ways to assess customer loan worthiness. They are using data other than credit bureau reports, such as phone use data, information from social networks and consumers’ living habits to assess creditworthiness.\n\nThe insurance industry also is finding new ways to assess risks.\n\nBitcoin And The Block Chain Affect Business Activity\n\nThat’s just on the consumer side of financial services, Hsien Long said. On the business side, there are new technologies like the block chain that is used for bitcoin but have other uses such as real time settlements and trade finance verification.\n\nBanks and regulators must keep up to date with these developments. Banks have to keep upgrading technology, services and business models.\n\nThere are banks in other parts of the world using technology better than in Singapore, Hsien Long said. Banks in Australia and America have outstanding digital banking models that offer a wide range of products and services. They have clear and simple interfaces and help customers tackle financial decisions.\n\nInstitutions in the U.S. and China are making pervasive use of technology for credit assessments.\n\nSingapore’s institutions must face the balance of risk taking and caution, and there are positive signs this is happening. “I’m happy that several leading banks and insurance companies have set up innovation labs to test services for Singaporean and global customers,” he said.\n\nAlso read: Block chain will revolutionize capital markets beginning in 2016\n\nA Time For New Leadership\n\n“The bank must continue to move forward and a new generation must build and expand,” he said, noting a challenge that UOB faces.\n\nBanks, like governments, must plan for their leadership succession. At UOB, a new team in the last two years has built on its past achievements. “UOB can scale new heights and continue to succeed for many years to come.”\n\nHe thanked UOB for its $2 million donation to the Peoples Action Party Community Foundation, which aims to give children a good head start with preschool education and child care.\n\nImages from Shutterstock & UOB.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'There have been multiple mentions of bitcoin ending up in a deflationary spiral on the long run. At a bird’s eye view for a layman, it sounds true. However, if one takes some time to study bitcoin and understand it in details, it will become obvious that the digital currency is quite different from conventional fiat currencies, and the deflationary spiral that seems perfectly applicable to fiat currency at certain circumstances doesn’t apply to its digital counterpart.\n\nFor those who do not know about deflationary spiral, it is an economic concept which states that continued deflationary trend will lead to reduced prices, increased production and increased value of the currency with respect to the purchasing power. The increasing value of currency, combined with reduced prices will lead to a fall in the circulation of currency and ultimately its demise.\n\nTheoretically, those who argue that bitcoin will go down the deflationary spiral, believe that with the number of bitcoins already fixed, its value over a period of time will be proportional to its demand within the same timeframe. With everyone believing it, they will end up hoarding bitcoin expecting the value to rise in the future. Mass hoarding will take bitcoin out of circulation leading to its collapse.\n\nHowever, the rules that apply to fiat currency do not apply to bitcoin as it is fundamentally an asset compared to traditional currency which is based on debt. Bitcoin is a highly divisible currency and with an increase in the value of a bitcoin increases, the amount of bitcoin needed for transactions will reduce proportionally. At the same time, strengthening economy leads to stronger bitcoin in the midst of deflation, which is also good for it. The progressively increasing difficulty in bitcoin mining and reduction in rewards are designed to counter sudden deflationary effects.\n\nOnly 21 million bitcoins are ever going to be mined and this knowledge among the bitcoin users leads to controlled deflation without causing the deflationary spiral.', 'Now that bitcoin is once again trading over 300 many feel there is good reason to hang onto a long position in the currency. But if you have bitcoins, wouldn’t it be great if you could hold onto them while simultaneously using them to pull in even more profit? First Global Credit, a digital economy investment company is hosting a trading competition on their platform to allow new traders to experience their services and capture the profit opportunities available in the worldwide stock markets using the value stored in their bitcoins. Traders interested in pitting their skills against other traders can sign up now for a free demonstration account to familiarize themselves with the platform so they will be ready for THE 100 BITCOIN TRADING COMPETITION, which begins on November 23, 2015.\n\nCOMPETITION DETAILS\n\nThe competition, runs on First Global Credit’s paper trading platform. The platform simulates both stock market trading as well as trading bitcoins against fiat currencies.\n\nEach player is given a competition account loaded with 100 practice bitcoins and has free rein to choose from over 200 stocks and 4 fiat currencies to trade over a period of four weeks. To spice up the competition, those 100 bitcoins can be leveraged up to 5 times their value on the Stock Trading Platform and twice their value on the Currency Switch Platform leaving room for big wins and big reversals too. Competition profits are returned to the contestants account in bitcoins and at the end of the competition the three traders with the most profits will win a live fully funded trading account and entry into First Global’s Star Trading Program. Each live prize account will give the winner the ability to trade the value of up to 10 bitcoins worth of stock and currencies. But as time goes on, members of the Star Trading Program make more money while their ability to trade more stock increases and they receive more profit.\n\nThe first winner of the victorious three will be the trader who makes the most profit from stock trading on the competition platform. The second winner will be the person who makes the most profit from trading bitcoins against fiat currency. The final prize winner will be talented trader who has the largest bitcoin profit from trading both stocks and currencies. And that is one of the unique points of the First Global Credit platform. While deposited bitcoins are used as margin to finance stock trading, they can simultaneously be traded against fiat currency without closing stock positions.\n\nThe paper trading platform mirrors the live platform using real time market prices and the same fees, so the competition emulates a real trading environment. Marcie Terman, Communications Director commented “There’s another reason First Global Credit is interested in finding the best and brightest bitcoin traders. Competition winners will join winners from previous competitions in our Star Trader Group.” She continued, “Post competition, as Star Traders amass profits over time and there will be additional benefits that we will bring on line in 2016.”\n\nPREVIOUS BITCOIN COMPETITION WINNERS\n\nAaron Welton, a winner from August 2015, is a consultant from the United Kingdom who had no prior experience in trading stocks and currencies. This was Aaron’s second competition with First Global Credit. At the end of the four week competition, Aaron had grown his original portfolio investment to a profit of approximately 624 bitcoins. “The prize was an incentive both times I entered.” Aaron said in an interview following the August competition. “I was disappointed with my performance in the first competition so upon entering the second time I wanted to be prepared. I understood trading Altcoins, I wanted to have the same level of knowledge about stocks and stock trading.” Read more…\n\nAlso declared a winner in the August competition was Barry Goers, a professional hockey player from the United States. Barry posted a profit of approximately 140 bitcoins during the four week period. Barry is extremely positive about the future of bitcoins and sees the potential of using them to generate a return. He says, “It is very important that bitcoin has all of the capabilities of other currencies. Now, people can actually invest with their bitcoin, and really use it to grow their money instead of simply hiding it in a cold wallet or something.” Read more…\n\nVisit the First Global Credit Facebook page or follow them on Twitter to keep tabs on the best players and post your comments about how your trading strategy is going.\n\nFull details of the competition rules are available on the First Global Credit website (add URL).

NewsBTC is not responsible for the accuracy of any of the information supplied in Sponsored Stories/Press Releases such as this one.', 'Bitcoin has been “unbanned” in Taiwan. Well, that’s not exactly accurate. Sources are claiming that the digital currency was never banned in Taiwan in the first place, despite Central News Agency’s — one of Taiwan’s largest media outlets — recent report that the country’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) labeled bitcoin and digital currencies “illegal.” The words are attributed to Tseng Ming-Chung, an FSC officer who during a legislative hearing, allegedly referred to digital currencies as “unlawful.”\n\nAlso read: Shenzhen’s First Bitcoin Meetup Takes Place November 21\n\nTseng also pledged that the “FSC would work with the country’s central bank and police to crack down any illegal act,” suggesting that regulators in Taiwan’s financial sector were looking to instill penalties against those entertaining the idea of delving into cryptocurrency.\n\nThe FSC is Taiwan’s top banking and insurance regulator. Recently, the organization released a new statement regarding bitcoin that suggests its stance on the subject to be more neutral than originally thought.\n\nFSC told media:\n\n“At the end of 2013, the Central Bank of the Republic of China and the FSC has released a joint statement that defines Bitcoin as a ‘virtual commodity.’ Considering the non-currency nature and risk of Bitcoin, the FSC has required banks in Taiwan not to receive or exchange Bitcoin. At present, the FSC’s position on this issue remains the same as before.”\n\nOddly enough, Taiwan is one of the few countries where, if they were to fully ban bitcoin, we’d probably understand. In recent news, the country suffered a major scare when one of its most prominent businessmen, Pearl Oriental Oil chairman Wong Yul-Kwan, was kidnapped by Triad members and held for ransom that exceeded $9 million. Adding fuel to the fire, Yul-Kwan’s captors demanded the ransom be paid in bitcoin.\n\nThe business mogul, now being treated and examined in a local hospital, had been missing since late September. During that time, he was held in an abandoned house, blindfolded and handcuffed to a bed and subjected to cigarette burns and other forms of physical abuse on a regular basis. His captors also repeatedly sent messages to his family threatening more physical violence towards Yul-Kwan if the bitcoin ransom went unpaid.\n\nBitcoin’s reputation has not always been staggering, nor has bitcoin always managed to retain its popularity and its events like these that take away from the good it can do. Those who hear these stories likely tend to focus on the negative, at least for a while. However, despite the story and similar occurrences, Taiwan has moved away from the tactics instilled by Russia and Ecuador and avoided a full-on ban, meaning that there is still hope for bitcoin in the region as long as people can remain open-minded.\n\nDelving a bit deeper, Taiwan is likely taking after its neighbor China who, despite bitcoin Ponzi schemes and several debates regarding a potential ban, eventually performed a 180-degree turn and showed renewed interest in the cryptocurrency. This interest is considered by many to be the primary reason for bitcoin’s recent (if short-lived) spike in value.\n\nDespite a rocky relationship with bitcoin, Taiwan doesn’t appear to be shutting the door altogether. If anything, the move shows us that Bitcoin is still able to plow through the hurdles and barricades that plague its progress, and will someday bring financial stability to any country open to accepting it.\n\nDoes Bitcoin have a strong future in Asia? Post your comments below!\n\nImages courtesy of go2taiwan.net and pfhub.com\n\nOriginally posted on: Taiwan: There is no Bitcoin Ban', 'With Bitcoin fast approaching its seventh anniversary and the idea of cryptocurrencies steadily gaining traction it has nevertheless yet to find mass-market adoption or a ‘killer app’. But what technology disrupts, it can also stich together and things could be about to change. That said, many might say we’ve heard this all before in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nNow a new initiative from Danish crypto currency exchange CCEDK and the Beyond Bitcoin Show, the voice of the people of the Beyond Bitcoin community, aims to open the benefits of cryptocurrency to ""mass-market solutions"" - including social media users and content creators - through ShareBits.io, a platform for open software solutions developed by a team at Freebie.\n\nThink of ShareBits.io as opening blockchain technology for ‘average’ Joe applications with a Social tipping dimension. It can tip and top up accounts worldwide via social media platforms. For its part, Freebie delivers highly scalable and rapid-fire software solutions for businesses and professionals working in the crypto-sphere.\n\nMarket Penetration Issues\n\nThe problem of cryptocurrency market penetration is one that ShareBits.io is hoping to address through targeting mass-market customers including those across the social media spectrum, making it fast, cheap and easy for organizations to distribute ‘crypto’ tokens to large numbers of their users. And, soon even the crowd funding fraternity could be getting in on the act using it to make real-time donations.\n\nThe company has built its application on the BitShares platform OpenLedger, which has been designed for the rigours of the modern consumer marketplace. This is in contrast with the trailblazing but relatively slow blockchain of Bitcoin from a latency and execution point of view. But it should be noted here that the matter of scaling and blocksize is one of bitter debate among the cryptocurrency community.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin has experienced 10-minute blocktimes and a low transaction volume, BitShares, a decentralized financial platform with Nasdaq-like speeds, offers an impressive 100,000 transactions per second, confirmations that take a matter of seconds, and touts costs as low as a quarter of Bitcoin’s fees.', 'India has joined a global cast of countries expressing monumental support for Paris following the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks that have killed nearly 130 people and left hundreds more injured. The Chhatrapati Shivaji train station in Mumbai, which was the site of its own deadly attacks in 2008, was illuminated with the tri-colors of the French flag, as the Washington Post noted.\n\nThe gesture is more than an act of solidarity. The Mumbai attacks marked the beginning of a new kind of terror that shifted away from large-scale massacres to smaller, harder-to-stop missions that would nonetheless prove psychologically damaging to their targets:', 'Digital Currency Weekly Recap 11-15-2015\n\nApple Approves Cryptocurrency Game Apps.\n\nAfter approving Saru Tobi and Game of Birds earlier this year, Apple’s App Store has now approved another Bitcoin-using game app, called Wheel of Bitcoins. Like those earlier games, Wheel will provide users with real Bitcoins, earned in-game and delivered to the player’s wallet. This time, the game involves a roulette wheel that is spun to offer players a chance to win prizes. When Bitcoins are awarded, they are sent to the player’s email through Xapo.\n\nAccording to reports, Apple has expressed its approval for these Bitcoin-paying games’ presence in their store. That is good news to app developers seeking to use their games to increase awareness of cryptocurrency and help it gain greater mainstream approval. To date, the most serious complaints have come from users who are dissatisfied with the identification process used by Xapo - since its user verification methods are nearly as in-depth as those used for many financial institutions.\n\n\n\nCEX.IO Partners with Trading View for Real-Time Charting.\n\nCEX.IO, the UK-based Bitcoin exchange recently declared that it has partnered with charting platform TradingView, in a move that will see its exchange added to the latter’s listing. This will provide CEX.IO’s users with the ability to view the company’s trading information on TradingView’s browser-based platform. The partnership should give exchange customers increased access to advanced trading analysis tools to facilitate more in-depth data access and research for trading and investment purposes.\n\n\n\nJustice Department Crypto Summit Facilitates Improved Dialogue.\n\nA recent summit hosted by the U.S. Department of Justice saw more than 170 different participants from government and the private sector come together to discuss issues related to digital currency and the blockchain. The meeting occurred in San Francisco, and involved personnel from both state and federal regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies, blockchain and cryptocurrency companies and advocacy groups, and representatives from the worlds of finance and technology.\n\nThe summit was put together by the head of the multi-agency Digital Currency Task Force, Kathryn Haun. The assembled attendees discussed regulatory concerns and a host of other issues in what has been described as a much more relaxed environment than the last meeting almost a year ago. Unlike that February meeting, the most recent gathering was conducted in a friendly atmosphere, and the parties reportedly enjoyed a much more constructive dialogue.\n\n\n\nDiffering Opinions on Future of Cryptocurrency.\n\nThis week continued the trend of various personalities and government officials offering their own personal perspectives on the future of cryptocurrency. For instance, Jamie Dimon continued his habitual dismissal of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, while continuing to praise the blockchain. In his latest prophesy of crypto doom and gloom, the JPMorgan CEO went so far as to declare that governments will simply not allow these uncontrolled currencies to exist.\n\nUSB’s chairman Axel Weber got into the prognostication game as well, as he predicted that “private currencies” would never really get off the ground due to the lack of a lender of last resort. Pointing to how central banks are able to manipulate fiat money during any currency crisis by serving as that lender of last resort, he contrasted that with the lack of such liquidity in cryptocurrency markets. Like Dimon, Weber also lauded the blockchain’s potential.\n\nAnd then there’s the UK’s George Osborne. The Chancellor of the Exchequer continued to maintain his more optimistic outlook on digital currency in recent remarks at a London conference. Like Treasury’s Harriet Baldwin, Osborne noted that these currencies could very well have a vital role to play in the UK’s future. It is also worth noting that the United Kingdom was the recipient of more than forty percent of all FinTech investment in 2014, and officials like the Chancellor are consistently extending a welcoming hand to not only digital currency, but its underlying technology as well.\n\nTime will tell, but it would seem that Dimon’s opinion about government reaction to digital currency is not currently shared by at least one government in the world.\n\n\n\nIn case You Missed Them…\n\nSince we hate the thought of anyone missing out on thoughtful commentaries, a couple of recent articles from contributor Nick Marinoff deserve a mention. Earlier this week, he offered his thoughts on the importance of getting more women involved in the digital currency revolution in Why Women Must Become More Involved in Cryptocurrency. Later in the week, he advocated for introducing children to cryptocurrency at an early age in Children and Cryptocurrency: Why They Need to Learn Now.

The Swiss bank wants to move 40 traders and 60 support staff to Ireland as part of a cost-cutting drive, sources familiar with the plans said. That will create one of the biggest trading floors in Dublin, a city which has long attracted support functions of some of the world’s biggest banks. News of the Dublin plan comes weeks after Credit Suisse’s new chief executive Tidjane Thiam unveiled a wide-ranging plan to restructure the bank, cut costs and raise SFr6.05bn. The plan also includes moving up to 1,800 jobs from London to cheaper cost centres. Credit Suisse’s talks with the Central Bank of Ireland predate the restructuring announcement, but are part of the same drive to cut costs, a source familiar with the situation said. He would not comment on how many other jobs could go to Dublin. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the new Dublin trading floor as did the IDA, Ireland’s inward investment agency. The Central Bank of Ireland would not comment on the status of Credit Suisse’s licence application, which was filed more than six months ago. Sources familiar with the situation said Credit Suisse has already begun sounding out London-based trading staff about moving to Dublin. They will join a trading community in Dublin that is a world apart from the Canary Wharf hub where they now sit a stone’s throw from thousands of their peers. Some other international banks have small trading operations in Dublin but the only two large ones are Bank of Ireland’s, which has about 175 traders, and AIB’s, which has about 115. However the Irish capital is the European headquarters for Virtu Financial and Susquehanna Investment Group, two US high-frequency traders that are among the biggest participants on global markets. Hibernia Networks, a privately owned technology group, has also upgraded its superfast fibre optic subsea cables that connect New Jersey, Dublin and London in recent weeks, the industry’s first new transatlantic system in more than a decade. Financial sources said other banks were also looking at moving various operations to Dublin — both for costs reasons, and as a hedge to ensure continued access to the EU market if Britain votes to leave the common market. A source familiar with Credit Suisse’s thinking said “Brexit” was not a factor in the bank’s Dublin plan. As well as offering lower property prices and wage costs than London, Ireland also has a 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate, well below the 20 per cent companies in the UK are charged. Citi, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street already have large operations in Dublin. Cost cuts have become particularly pressing for banks after a wave of post-crisis regulations that forced them to hold dramatically more equity. The extra capital means banks have to make more profits if they want to keep their return on equity at the levels shareholders demand.']"
11/16/2015,"['Online retail giant Amazon is now shipping 21 Bitcoin Computers, the first product from the industry’s best-funded startup 21 Inc.\n\n21 began accepting orders on 21st September, when it revealed the offering along with its broader vision for how it believes the 21 Bitcoin Computer will be used to further development in the field of machine-to-machine payments.\n\nUnlike past products aimed at the bitcoin mining market, 21 reiterated in a new blog post it does not intend for its units, which contribute to transaction processing on the bitcoin blockchain, to be optimized for the speculative mining of bitcoins. Rather, the units will aim to provide users a ""stream of bitcoins”, a move that aims to emphasize that bitcoins, while a scarce and valuable resource, are effectively the data that runs the distributed bitcoin database.\n\nSo far, the product has perhaps struggled to communicate its nuances even to its target consumers in the development community. Confusion over the value of the product as well as its high price point can be seen in comments on social media sites and on Amazon.\n\nIn the post, 21 CEO Balaji Srinivasan aimed to reiterate the product\'s value, adding:\n\n""It’s an integrated hardware/software device that is built to connect to other devices of its kind, to be updated in sync, and to integrate with an online developer community. It provides a stream of bitcoin to buy digital goods and services, the ability to set up simple micropayment servers to sell these goods, and a set of demonstration apps along with the libraries to build your own.""\n\nProducts were expected to begin shipment on 16th November, according to Amazon’s official product page, and soon after, Reddit users began reporting that they had received confirmation emails from the e-commerce company. 21 later confirmed shipment had begun via Twitter.\n\nAn informal poll conducted on Twitter by CoinDesk indicated that not all purchasers had received confirmation emails. At press time, only 30% of the poll’s 27 respondents had indicated they had received notice their product had shipped.\n\nThe shipping deadline may have added importance for 21 Inc and its reputation given the long-standing issues industry startups have had delivering consumer mining products. In the past, Butterfly Labs, KnCMiner, HashFast and a litany of other mining firms have suffered from shipping delays, poor customer feedback, and ultimately, lawsuits and bankruptcy filings.\n\nAt press time, 21 Inc did not respond to requests for further clarity on its shipping timelines.\n\nImage via Amazon\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It offered evidence from September, in which the group believed it had uncovered a single address worth $3 million in bitcoins (which would have appreciated significantly here recently.)\n\nThe group had a lot more to say during an interview with a competing outlet, NewsBTC, who beat CCN to the scoop.\n\nThe Islamic State does use cryptocurrencies as a form of income to fund their ongoing operations and we have managed to uncover several Bitcoin addresses used by them.\n\nNevertheless, the interview was compelling evidence that cryptocurrencies are perhaps better suited than anything to provide some degree of security, finality, and integrity to digital transactions. Most importantly, it belies the current murmurs that Bitcoin could potentially become just another tool of financial censorship.\n\nThis is not to forgive the funding of terrorism by any means, but to point out that one of the important functions of cryptocurrency is that it cannot be censored by the whims of various figureheads. One never knows what might be next on the agenda. Animal rights activists? Environmentalists? Labor organizers? The list of groups whose finances, in the eyes of the state, might need to be seized or shut off, goes on. As with any liberating technology, Bitcoin helps both objectively benign and objectively horrific agendas along. It is one of several technologies ISIS’ digital arm have utilized to aid their friends in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere. The Internet itself is a tool of terrorism.\n\nAll hope is not lost. In chaotic situations, honorable folks still stand out from the huddled, fearful masses. In this case, as regards ISIS/ISIL, it appears we have GhostSec, who in some ways have done more to disable to the neo-Caliphate organization than has the US Government or will the French with their bombs and guns. Getting to the heart of any militant organization’s financing is absolutely the best way to slow them down.\n\nMost of the Bitcoin funding sites utilized by the Islamic State are on the deep web and we have managed to uncover several and successfully shut them down in order to limit the funding extremists receive through the use of cryptocurrencies.\n\nGhostSec should be lauded for their efforts. They even have a site set up where netizens can report ISIL activities for the group to deal with. We live in an interesting time, when citizens feel compelled to stand up and do things the government has passed laws against (except if the government wants to do it) in order to fight truly violent men who appear hell-bent on destabilizing as much of the world as possible.\n\nWhile most people passively wait for the governments to resolve the crisis, GhostSec has identified the greater of two evils, and actively works to disrupt them.

Rootstock hopes to give banks the means to issue loans from smart contracts.\n\nRootstock combines the capabilities of Ethereum with the bitcoin network’s transparency and security by using sidechain technology. Bitcoin serves as the fuel that runs the smart contract. Nick Szabo, an expert on smart contracts, has said Rootstock joins the best of bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nRootstock’s official launch is scheduled for Dec. 4 and 5, 2015 at LaBitconf in Mexico City .\n\nRootstock Focus: Microlending\n\nBecause bitcoin has matured as a technology, it has allowed Rootstock to focus on use cases like microlending, according to Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, Rootstock co-founder. He said Rootstock wants to target Latin American needs and launch Rootstock with real use cases with companies seeking to execute smart contracts.\n\nRootstock has been speaking with The World Bank, Banco Ciudad de Buenos Aires and other banks such as the Brazilian development bank, BNDES, he noted. There is also a group called SystemaD within the Latin American Bitcoin NGO that is working on financial inclusion. This group is testing the technology in Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires slums.\n\nZaldivar said Rootstock is designing tools to operate micro lending programs for the unbanked with a higher level of transparency. He said a smart contract platform that is neutral and secure enough to run such a platform are key components.\n\nDeveloping the platform with NGOs so that anyone with a smart phone can use it will take between two and three years, he said. The project is not strictly a technological solution as there is a cultural aspect involved. It is necessary to explain at a bank how to run a loan from a smart contract. In addition, it is necessary to be able to exchange crypto tokens for each country’s actual currency.\n\nThe concept is to join an Ethereum-compatible virtual machine that relays on the bitcoin network to secure operations using sidechain technology and merged mining. The project has evolved from earlier projects by Sergio Lerner, Rootstock co-founder, such as NimbleCoin and QixDoin, the Turing complete currency released in 2013.\n\nEconomic Incentives For Miners\n\nWhat is new about Rootstock is that it creates economic incentives in addition to the way it leverages the bitcoin security model.\n\nZaldivar said the block chain is secured using merged mining and a federation, which he called a hybrid model. Previously, security models used a federation, a mining network or a proof of stake.\n\nThis is the first time federated and proof of work security models have merged.\n\nMerged mining refers to miners using the hashing power used to secure the block chain to create blocks in a different block chain. By using the same calculations to secure both block chains simultaneously, it is not necessary to have added power and the same hardware can be used. It is necessary to convince miners to merge mining the different block chain as well as bitcoin’s.\n\nImprovements have been made to the software to prevent any loss in profitability for miners when they merge mine Rootstock, Zaldivar said. Previously, coins like Namecoin fell from merged mining since they had a negative impact on bitcoin miners’ profitability.\n\nBitcoins locked in a bitcoin address turned into “rootcoins,” the currency in the Rootstock block chain, fuel Rootstock’s smart contract execution, Zaldivar said.\n\nHe noted the sidechain is a two-way mechanism. When miners receive the rootcoins as payment for executing a contract, they can convert them into bitcoins immediately. There is a one-to-one conversion rate.\n\nThe bitcoins in the Rootstock block chain are called rootcoins to indicate they exist in the Rootstock block chain and not in bitcoin’s.\n\nThe federation is needed in the beginning since trustless, two-way sidechains have not been fully implemented in bitcoin yet, he said. The pegging mechanism going from bitcoin to rootcoins will be trustless and automated on the Rootstock side. The federation will manage the process that returns to bitcoin.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum enters last phase of development process\n\nSidechain Must Be Secure\n\nEthereum’s development team examined the technical feasibility of placing Ethereum as a sidechain and reached the same conclusion based on the Blockstream white paper. Gavin Wood, Ethereum’s chief technical officer, said it was not going to be possible to sufficiently secure the sidechain.\n\nUnless the bitcoin miners are persuaded to merge mine, it would not be possible to incentivize enough miners on the sidechain to prevent an attack in which someone gives an invalid block that releases bitcoin on the main chain and mine it themselves with sufficient mining power to outmine the remainder of the network that is attempting to say it is invalid, Wood said in an interview.\n\nRootstock’s federation will form from exchanges and wallets, while merged mining gives the miners a chance to profit from the execution of smart contracts with the new infrastructure they already have, Zaldivar said.\n\nHe said the effect will be to make bitcoin more valuable.\n\nThe Rootstock server connects directly to the pool software and can deploy in any mining operation, he said.\n\nRootstock will set up some servers at the start to ensure there are sufficient nodes servicing the queries.\n\nTo add Rootstock to a mining operation will require marginal cost, he said, and the profits might surpass that which miners receive from transaction fees currently. He said Rootstock can surpass this in one or two years with the execution of smart contracts.\n\nComparisons To Counterparty\n\nSome have compared Rootstock to Counterparty, which uses the bitcoin network and a native token called XCP to perform smart contacts.\n\nAdam Krellenstein, who co-founded Counterparty with Robby Dermody and Evan Wagner, said in an email to International Business Times that while the Ethereum project is interesting, its codebase is “a long way” from being ready for production. He added that merged mining’s economic incentives are such that miners of the parent chain can freely attack the sidechain.\n\nZaldivar said Rootstock has advantages over Counterparty. He said its Virtual machine offers just-in-time compiling with up to 100 times improved contract execution. It also has Web3 support to allow easy integration with Distributed Apps that possess rich user interfaces and higher user interaction rate since blocks validate every 20 seconds as opposed to the standard 10 minutes that Counterparty requires.\n\nAsked what he thinks of private block chains that banks are backing, Zaldivar said he calls it “Legacy 2.0.” A permission-based block chain has an internal database, a shared database among many entities that loses transparency to the outside world.\n\nThere is better transparency within a group of organizations branding the private block chain, he said. However, it does not carry the neutrality and security of a proof of work network, an open network, which bitcoin has.\n\nZaldivar said Ethereum is a great project, but Rootstock is offering an alternative in its security model and economic incentives. He noted that Ethereum remains in its infancy in developing a network that secures the coin and creates a network effect around its own token.\n\nIt took six years to get bitcoin to its present maturity level, he said, noting that if things go faster with Ethereum, its network will need two to three years to stabilize and be as reliable as bitcoin. He said he values everything Ethereum does and wants it to thrive.\n\nZaldivar said Rootcoin met with Szabo last year in Palo Alto and discussed the need to bring real use cases with transparency. He said the conversation with Szabo continued, along with Sergio Lerner, on providing an alternate smart contracts solution that would run on top of bitcoin and leverage based on its network effect.\n\nRootstock’s white paper will become public with Rootstock’s official launch at LaBitconf in Mexico City on Dec. 4 and 5, 2015.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In a talk given at the United Overseas Bank 80th anniversary dinner held on Thursday, Singapore’s Prime Minister Hsien Loong advised the country’s banks and regulators to explore the advantages and unique applications of emerging technologies such as Bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain.\n\nLoong proposed an extensive examination and research of the Bitcoin network’s ability to handle real-time settlements and automated verification of transactions and payments. He further emphasized the significance of financial technologies like the Bitcoin network in building strong regional and international presence for the country’s banks and financial institutions.\n\n“Blockchain, which is used for bitcoin can also be used for many other applications like real-time gross settlement and trade finance verification,” said Loong.\n\n“So our banks and regulators must keep up-to-date with these developments. The banks are in a strong position. We are in the heart of rising Asia. The banks have strong balance sheets, and with a strong regional presence they can take advantage of many opportunities around them.”\n\nIn April 2015, the Singaporean government announced its ambitious plans to become Asia’s leading blockchain and financial technology hub through the development of friendly regulatory environment for fintech and blockchain-focused startups.\n\nSince then, various government agencies including national-level coordinating agency Smart Nations Global Initiative have continued to maintain close relationships with startups aiming to develop unique financial applications and platforms which could potentially optimize and enhance existing banking systems.\n\nUnder the leadership of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cabinet Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, the Smart Nations Initiative participated in various fintech and blockchain-focused startup conferences, to help startups communicate and work with established financial institutions in the country.\n\n“My interest in bitcoin is the concept of a distributed ledger which does not depend on a central authority,” Balakrishnan stated at a startup conference hosted by Singaporean startup incubator JTC LaunchPad.\n\nBalakrishnan explained that most of Singapore’s current financial problems could be solved through the development and implementation of peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction networks and secure transaction verification and facilitation systems.\n\n“In this concept where we can have a decentralized ledger where there can be peer-to-peer transactions, which can be facilitated and authorized, I think there is something going on here. Bitcoin is not just money. It goes far beyond money,” he added.\n\nLoong further explicated the “financial problems” which Balakrishnan mentioned during his speech, and stated that international banks and financial institutions are far better than those in Singapore, in terms of technologies, business models and consumer feedback.\n\nLoong believes that the banks of Singapore should capitalize on the limitations of international financial institutions by adopting to more advanced and efficient payment and transaction systems, such as Bitcoin.\n\n“Banks must know this is a very competitive business which continues to evolve rapidly. So, they have to keep on upgrading their technologies, services and business models. While our banks are very good overall, other international banks are better than us in almost every specific area.,” said Loong.', 'Clara Guibourg\n\nBitcoin’s wild surge and fall has had people flocking around the cryptocurrency. Now fresh data reveals that more people are interested in finding out how bitcoin is doing than the Chinese yuan, or renminbi.\n\nGoogle search data shows that more people have been searching for the digital currency than the renminbi over the past month, with interest in bitcoin peaking at the height of its price surge on 5 November.\n\nBitcoin has even begun outstripping interest in the Japanese yen. At the height of its surge it rocketed far ahead of the yen in Google searches, and even now that prices have fallen back dramatically the bitcoin and the yen remain at about the same level.\n\n\n\nAfter a relatively stable year, bitcoin went on a wild tear in October, soaring up 110 per cent in a month to break $500 - a new high for 2015.\n\nIt wasn’t to last, however, and less than two weeks on from this record high, the cryptocurrency is trading at $320.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin will become sixth largest global reserve currency by 2030\n\nCharles Hayter from CryptoCompare said to City A.M. that the surge was partly an effect of the EU granting bitcoin VAT exemption in October, and China tightening capital controls, “alongside a general shift in positive sentiment that has been building over the past few weeks that is linked to the growing interest in blockchain technology applications”.\n\nOf course, once other world currencies are added into the equation, interest in bitcoin lags far behind.\n\nSearches for the British pound outnumber bitcoin by a factor of four.

Namely, whether the Nobel Committee could award the prize to someone who might not even exist.\n\nIt looks like the answer is no.\n\n“The prize, as in this instance, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Science in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is never awarded anonymously nor posthumously.”\n\nThat’s Nobel press officer The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Hans Reuterskiöld responding to our question about whether he could be nominated for the prize in economics.\n\nThere you have it.

11/17/2015,"['Blockchain payments startup Align Commerce has raised $12.5m in Series A funding led by storied Silicon Valley investment firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB).\n\nRounding out the all-star cast of investors were first-time and repeat firms including Digital Currency Group, FS Venture Capital, Pantera Capital, Recruit Ventures Partners and SVB Ventures, the investment arm of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nFounded by Marwan Forzley, a former Western Union general manager, Align Commerce is seeking to disrupt the small business (SMB) cross-border payments market, one it believes is characterized by high costs and poor customer experience. Prior to joining Western Union, Forzley was the founder of eBillme, a payments startup acquired by the remittance giant.\n\nForzley told CoinDesk:\n\n”We believe cross-border payments are broken, and using new technology to help reduce some of that friction, that’s where we use the blockchain, that’s where we get the benefits of a global payments rail.”\n\nWith this focus, Forzley asserts the product improves over traditional wire transfers for cross-border transactions as it reduces forms and fees with its solution, alongside other benefits.\n\n""We simplify a painful experience by allowing SMBs to enter their bank account and email address and send the money to the receiver,"" Forzley said. ""The whole experience is fundamentally different than wire, it’s designed to dumb down the whole cycle.""\n\nThe new funding, which follows an undisclosed seed round in April, will be used to expand Align\'s service beyond the 60 countries it serves today. Forzley declined to provide details such as the current volume transacted by the company, but suggested the funding round is proof of its success in building its business.\n\nThe funding round comes amid an overall downturn in industry investments that began in Q3 but has so far extended into Q4. At $12.5m, the Series A is the largest observed since September when Abra and Chain raised $12m and $30m, respectively.\n\nAs part of the deal, KPCB general partner Randy Komisar, a founding director of TiVo and former senior counsel for Apple will join the company’s board of directors.\n\nEarly blockchain believers\n\nThough one of a number of firms focused on applications for bitcoin and the blockchain in payments, Align is perhaps unique in its early emphasis on the blockchain, using the language as part of its public messaging as far back as January 2015.\n\nAs noted at the time, Align’s product allows SMBs to send US dollars and for a receiver to receive euros, for example. Both end users still use traditional bank accounts, however, Align converts the sender’s funds into bitcoin, selling the digital currency at an exchange for the desired currency of the recipient.\n\nForzley stated that the blockchain allows Align to facilitate this process with little exposure to bitcoin\'s price volatility due to its number of exchange partners.\n\nIn addition, he said the blockchain allows Align to offer merchant customers other benefits, such as timely information about their money transfer.\n\n“You can track your shipment online, but you can’t track your payment on wire. The blockchain has an elegant tracking mechanism to figure out where the payment is,” he said, adding:\n\n“Is this new tech different from existing options? Yes, it’s cheaper, faster and more trackable.”\n\nDisrupting correspondent banking\n\nMore specifically, Align Commerce uses its technology to replace correspondent banks in the cross-border process, which it argues results in a cheaper transaction for merchant clients.\n\nThe market positioning is similar to that of distributed payment protocol provider Ripple, which recently announced a new emphasis on the cross-border payments in October, a transition that coincided with two product launches aimed at this use case.\n\nForzley, however, suggested the two startups are not competing for the same customer base, despite similarities in their approach to the technology.\n\n""Ripple is going after the banks, we’re going after the small business market,"" Forzley explained.\n\nHe went on to state another difference was Align Commerce’s current use of the bitcoin blockchain, though he said the firm’s technology is designed to be blockchain agnostic and could use Ripple distributed ledger if required.\n\n""We\'re an application layer,"" he continued. ""We\'re designed so there\'s an API on multiple cryptos. We can swap in and out of any cryptocurrency.""\n\nBitcoin exchange dependency\n\nWhile Align is using the bitcoin blockchain today due to its scale and liquidity, Forzley said that the startup needs to help the bitcoin ecosystem grow to supports its ambitions.\n\nTo offer its services in a certain jurisdiction, Align Commerce must be able to offload the bitcoin it sells for local currency, meaning it benefits from the availability of local bitcoin exchanges.\n\nForzely declined to state any specific partners, but said the bank now maintains its own bank accounts for bitcoin trading in areas with no exchange coverage.\n\nThe goal, while laudable for the ecosystem may be challenging given the current difficult climate for bitcoin exchanges, which have suffered due to the digital currency\'s long periods of price stability, increased competition and a pressure to lower fees in 2015.\n\nStill, Forzley was optimistic about the coming effort. ""We\'ll be spending more time and more effort to expand exchanges,"" he said, concluding:\n\n""We think that\'s an important development that needs to happen in the market.""\n\nWorld currencies image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Singapore is an important financial center in Asia. And this statement from Loong suggests a bright future for the decentralized technology within the country.\n\nSingapore banks must keep up to date with blockchain development\n\nLong’s ten minute speech was concluded with words of support towards blockchain applications within the banking industry:\n\n“The operation environment has become more challenging, and on top of that, technology is moving very fast, with new business models disrupting traditional banking. For example, more and more people are making payments through their smartphones, they can pay for taxes, buy movie tickets, shop online, transfer money, pay for goods at restaurants and shops, all on their smartphones. [...] And that’s just on the consumer side of the financial services. There are other technologies, like blockchain, which is used for Bitcoin, but can also be used for many other applications. […] And our banks must keep up to date with these developments.”\n\nSingapore government slightly changed its stance towards cryptocurrencies\n\nPreviously, the Singaporean government never recognized cryptocurrencies as something of value. On 21 February 2014 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) released an answer to a parliamentary question about the matter, and cautioned individuals about the use of virtual currencies:\n\n“MAS currently does not regulate bitcoins. They are not legal tender like the notes and coins issued by MAS. They are also not considered securities under the Securities and Futures Act,” said Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister in charge of MAS.\n\nHe added, “But bitcoins are not without risk. MAS has published a consumer alert to warn Singaporeans about these risks. Unlike legal tender such as the Singapore Dollar, which is issued and backed by the government, there is no legal obligation for individuals or businesses to accept virtual currencies. Virtual currencies like bitcoin are typically not backed by an identifiable organisation. As a result, should the virtual currency cease to be accepted or the scheme cease to operate, users may not be able obtain a refund of their monies.”\n\nEven though bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are not yet recognized as legal tender, the position of the Singaporean government clearly changed in favor of blockchain technology in only ten months.', 'UK-based digital currency startup Plutus.it has built a contactless payment application that is powered by the Blockchain. The app allows users to pay at any NFC payment enabled point of sale (POS) terminals or stores using bitcoin. CoinTelegraph conducted a convoy of leading entrepreneurs in the Bitcoin industry to get their perspectives of the project.\n\nOne Step Closer to Mainstream Adoption\n\nBnkToTheFuture and Bitcoin Capital Fund manager, Simon Dixon, expressed his optimism toward the potential of the application.\n\n""I have been waiting for something like this for a long time,” said Dixon.\n\n“I currently use a bitcoin debit card for transactions like this and would love to throw away my plastic. This allows me to use bitcoin the same way I can use Apple Pay, but without the bank integration. My preference would be to spend bitcoin direct, but this is a great solution when you can\'t spend your bitcoins with the merchant. I would want to know how expensive this is compared to a card payment where the merchant covers the fee and also if the bitcoins are converted at point of sale, or if it is simply adding converted bitcoins to a fiat enabled phone wallet,” he added.\n\nBTCGreece founder, Thallos Marinos further emphasized the significance of a payment application like Plutus, especially in Greece, where there is a small number of bitcoin accepting merchants and businesses. Marinos explained that such an application could lead to the mainstream adoption of bitcoin in the country.\n\n“I like the idea and the name is a Greek god, so I have to like it,” Marinos told CoinTelegraph.\n\n“The only problem I see is why the end user will have to buy bitcoin in order to use it to buy something in fiat when he already holds fiat. I understand, it can make sense for miners or people who hold bitcoin and want to pay fiat.”\n\nLimitation\n\nHowever, its competitors such as Cryptopay criticized the app’s limitation to NFC enabled terminals and the amount of resources it requires for the issuers and merchants.\n\n“The idea of Plutus is nice, but not new,” Cryptopay founder George Basiladze told CoinTelegraph.\n\n“The idea is cool but requires enormous amount of development and resources. Additionally, you would need a lot of capital and reserves on different exchanges to make the settlement. In their case only the execution will show whether their product is fine or not,” continued Basiladze.\n\nVision of the Plutus Project\n\nThe core software is currently in alpha stage. However, users are already able to simply deposit bitcoin into a virtual debit card with local currency of their choice and spend it at any of the millions of NFC point of sale machines in the world.\n\n“Plutus makes it easy to buy a cup of coffee, gas or groceries with bitcoin. The store doesn’t even need to be aware of this. The app will provide you with the bitcoin address of a trader willing to buy your coins, and your deposit will automatically be exchanged to the merchant’s local currency for payment. In the end, it feels the same using any contactless card or NFC enabled device such as Apple or Android Pay,” Plutus Chief Communications Officer Filip Martinka told CoinTelegraph in an exclusive interview.\n\nPlutus is targeting the multi-billion dollar contactless payment sector, which is predicted to surpass US$26.9 billion in the UK alone. By allowing the masses to use digital currencies while transacting in normal NFC terminals, the team aims to bring bitcoin one step closer to the mainstream.\n\n“The volume of contactless transactions has grown exponentially in recent years, and is predicted to hit £17.7 billion next year in the UK alone. Our goal is to become part of this accelerated innovation, as Plutus is one of the first apps to truly merge decentralized exchange, bitcoin technology, and contactless payments,” added Martinka.\n\nPlutus also implemented a decentralized exchange network, to eliminate any intermediaries or third-party exchange. The announcement comes after a series of large DDoS which targeted countless number of traders and investors in leading bitcoin exchanges such as Kraken.\n\nFurthermore, the application adopted the support for smart contracts, enabling the issuance of a contract upon the initiation of a trade.\n\n“Our app uses smart contracts to link you directly with traders on our decentralized exchange network. Traders then purchase your bitcoin in return for your local currency, and their deposit is immediately charged to your virtual debit card. However, the real innovation here is that Plutus avoids the need to store your funds as an intermediate or plug into a third-party exchange. This makes the process cheaper, faster, and more decentralized,” explained Martinka.', 'Blockchain technology is at the heart of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Most people have heard of Bitcoin and some are excited by the prospect it raises of a decentralised, stateless currency/payment system. But this is not the most interesting thing about Bitcoin. It is the blockchain technology itself that is the real breakthrough. It not only provides the foundation for a currency and payment system; it also provides the foundation for new ways of organising and managing basic social relationships. This includes legal relationships such as those involved in contractual exchange and proprietary ownership. The most prominent expression of this potential comes in the shape of Ethereum, an open source platform that allows developers to use blockchains for whatever purpose they see fit.\n\nThis might sound a little abstract and confusing. Blockchain technology is exciting, but many people are put off by the technical and abstruse concepts underpinning it. Proponents of the technology talk about strange things like cryptographic hash functions and public key encryption. They also refer to obscure mathematical puzzles like the Byzantine Generals problem in order to explain how it works. This is daunting. Many wonder whether they have to master this obscure conceptual vocabulary in order to understand what all the fuss is about.\n\n\n\nIf they want to engage with the technology at the deepest levels, they do. But to gain a high level understanding of how it works, and to share some of the excitement of its proponents, they don’t. My goal in this post is to provide that high-level understanding, and to explain how the technology could provide an underpinning for things like smart contracts and smart property. With luck, this will enable people to see the potential for this technology and will pique their interest in its political, legal and ethical implications.\n\n\n\nI appreciate that there are many other articles out there that try to do the same thing. I am merely adding one more to the pile. I do so in the hope that it may prove useful to some, but also in the hope that it helps me to better understand the phenomenon. After all, most writing is an exercise in self-explanation. It is through communication that we truly begin to understand.\n\n\n\nThe remainder of this post is divided into three main sections. The first talks about the ‘Trust Problem’ that motivates the creation of the blockchain. The second tries to provide a detailed but non-mathematical description of how the blockchain works to solve the trust problem. The third explains how the technology could support a system of smart contracts and smart property.\n\n\n\n1. The Trust Problem and the Motivation for the Blockchain\n\nAll human societies have a trust problem. In order to survive and make a living, we must coordinate and cooperate with others. In doing so, there is potential for these others to mislead, deceive and disappoint. To ensure successful ongoing cooperation, we need to be able to trust each other. Many societies have invented elaborate rituals, laws and governance systems to address this trust problem. At its most fundamental level, blockchain technology tries to do the same.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate, let’s use the example of a currency and payment system. This seems appropriate given the origins of blockchain technology in the development of such systems. I’m going to use the example of a real-world currency system: the currency used (historically) on the Island of Yap. Some people will be familiar with this example as it is beloved by economists. The only problem is that example has become heavily mythologised and abstracted from the actual historical reality. I’m not an expert on that history, so what I am about to describe is also likely to be highly mythologised and simplified. I hope that’s okay: the goal here is to explain the rationale behind blockchain technology, not to write an accurate monetary history of the Island of Yap.\n\n\n\nAnyway, with that caveat in mind, the Islanders of Yap had an unusual monetary system. They did not use coins as money. Instead, they used stone discs of varying sizes. These discs were mined from another island, several hundred miles away. This ensured the discs that had been mined and brought back to the island retained their value over time. The picture below provides an example and illustrates just how large these discs could get. People would exchange these large discs in important transactions. But obviously the islanders could not just hand the discs to one another to finalise the transaction. The discs remain fixed in place. In order to know who-owned-what, the islanders needed to keep some kind of ledger, which recorded transactional data and allowed them to figure out which stone disc belongs to which islander.\n\nOne way to do this would have been to use a trusted third party ledger. In other words, to find some respected tribal elder or chief and make it a requirement that all transactions be logged with him/her. That way, whenever a dispute arose, the islanders could go to the elder and he/she could resolve the dispute. The elder could confirm that Islander A really does own the disc and is entitled to exchange it with Islander B, or vice versa. This is illustrated in the diagram below.\n\nWe make use of such trusted third party systems everyday. Indeed, modern political, legal and monetary systems are almost entirely founded upon them. When you make a payment via credit or debit card, that transaction must first be logged with a bank or credit card company, who will verify that you have the necessary funds and that the payment came from you, before the payment is finally confirmed. The same goes for disputes over legal rights. Courts function as trusted third parties who resolve disputes (ultimately via the threat of violence) about contractual rights and property rights (to give just two examples).\n\n\n\nBut that is not the only way to solve the trust problem. Another way would be to use adistributed consensus ledger. In other words, instead of logging transactional data with a trusted third party, you could require all the islanders to keep an ongoing, updated, record of transactions. Then, when a dispute arises, you go with either the majority or unanimous view of this network of ledger-keepers. As far as I am aware (and this is where my caveat about historical accuracy needs to be borne in mind) this is what the Islanders of Yap seem to have done. Each islander kept a mental record of who owned what, and this distributed mental record could be used to resolve transactional disputes.\n\nBlockchain technology follows this distributed consensus method. It tries to create a computer-based protocol for resolving the trust problem through a distributed and publicly verifiable ledger. This is known as the blockchain. We can define it in the following way (from Wright and De Filippi, 2015):\n\nBlockchain = A distributed, shared, encrypted database which serves as an irreversible and incorruptible public repository of information.\n\n2. How the Blockchain is Built\n\nBut how exactly does the technology build the ledger? This is where things can get quite technical. In essence, the blockchain works by leveraging the networking capabilities of modern computers and by using a variety of cryptographic tools for verifying transactional data.\n\n\n\nA network is established consisting of many different computers located in many different places. Each computer is a node in the network. You could have one node in South Africa, one in England, one in France, one in the USA, one in Yemen, one in Australia and so on. The network can, in theory, be distributed across the entire world. This network is then used for logging, recording and verifying transactional information. Every computer on the network keeps a record of all transactions taking place on the network. This record is known as the blockchain. It is comprehensive, permanent, public and distributed across all nodes in the network. The network can thus function as a decentralised authority for managing and maintaining records of transactions.\n\n\n\nIt is easy enough to see how this works in the case of two people exchanging money. Suppose Person A wants to transfer 100 bitcoin (or whatever) to Person B. Person A has a digital ‘wallet’ which contains a record of how much bitcoin they currently own. They sign into this and agree to transfer a certain sum to Person B. They do this by broadcasting to the network that they wish to transfer the money to Person B’s digital wallet. Details of this proposed transaction are then added to a ‘block’ of transactional data that is stored across the network. The ‘block’ is like a temporary record that is in the process of being added to the permanent record (the blockchain). The ‘block’ represents all the transactions that took place on the network during a particular interval of time. In the case of bitcoin, the block includes information about all the transactions taking place in a ten minute interval.\n\n\n\nAt this stage, the transaction between A and B has not been verified and does not form part of the permanent distributed ledger. What happens next is that once all the data has been collected for a given interval of time, the network works on verifying the details in those transactions (i.e. does A really have that amount of money to send to B? Did A really initiate the transaction? etc). Each computer on the network participates in a competition to verify the transactional data. The winner of this competition gets to add the ‘block’ to the ‘blockchain’ (i.e. they get to update the ledger). When they do so, they broadcast their ‘proof of work’ to the rest of the network. This shows the network how the winning computer verified the transactional data. The other computers on the network then check that proof of work and confirm that the record is correct. This is where the ‘distributed consensus’ comes in. It is only if the winning ‘solution’ is confirmed by the majority that it becomes a permanent part of the blockchain.\n\n\n\nThis verification process is technically tricky. I have a given a simple descriptive account. For the full picture, you would need to engage with the cryptographic concepts underpinning it.\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of interesting things about this, over and above its ‘distributed consensus’ nature. The first has to do with the role of trust. Some people refer to the blockchain as a ‘trustless’ system. I think people say this because it is the computer protocol and its combination of cryptographic verification methods that underpin the ledger. Thus, when you are using the system, you do not have to trust or place faith in another human being. This makes it seem very different from, say, the situation faced by the islanders of Yap, who really do have to trust one another when using their distributed ledger. But clearly there is trust of a kind involved in the process. You have to trust the technology, and the theory underpinning it. Maybe that trust is justified, but it still seems to be there. Also, since most people lack the technical know-how to fully understand the system, there is a stronger sense of trust involved for most users: they have to trust the technical experts who establish and maintain the network.\n\n\n\nThe other interesting thing has to do with the incentive to maintain the network. You may wonder why people would be willing to give up their computing resources to maintain such an elaborate system. The technologically-inclined might do so initially out of curiosity, or maybe some sense of idealism, but to have a widespread network you probably need something more enticing. The solution used by most blockchain systems is to reward members of the network with some digital token that can be used to conduct exchanges on the network. In the case of bitcoin, the winner of the verification competition receives newly minted bitcoin for their troubles. This makes it attractive for people to join and maintain the network. Bitcoin adopts a particular economic philosophy in its reward system: the winner takes all the newly-minted bitcoin. This doesn’t have to be the case. You could adopt a more egalitarian or socialist system in which all members of the network share whatever token of value is being used.', 'On October 22, 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that Bitcoin is a means of payment and its exchange is exempt from VAT in a landmark ruling. But a few people understand the implications of this decision. That’s why CoinTelegraph decided to ask for comment an experienced bitcoin lawyer. Our expert is Stefano Capaccioli.\n\nStefano Capaccioli is CPA, Auditor, Tax litigator, Tax Advisor, Business Consultant, Specialized in Law & Tax on Gold, Precious Metals and Cryptocurrencies gives a professional Comment to Court Of Justice Judgement C-264/14 on bitcoin VAT exemption.\n\nA Comment to Court Of Justice Judgment C-264/14 on bitcoin VAT exemption\n\nThe European Court of Justice gave Judgment C-264/14 on the VAT treatment of bitcoin and virtual currencies, interpreting Article 135 (1) of Directive 112/2006/EC, and in particular the letters d), e) and f). The Judgment C-264/14 declared that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are VAT exempt as currency, although not legal tender.\n\nThis Judgment constitutes an authentic interpretation of the VAT Directive 2006/112/EC and it is applicable in all 28 Member States, harmonizing the VAT treatment of bitcoin and constitutes the first official legal document in the European Union.\n\nThe Decision is of historic importance: it clarifies all doubts and removes the confusion on the applicability of consumption taxes to bitcoin, considering cryptocurrencies as a simple means of payment and, under a VAT perspective, similar to a foreign currency.\n\nSome of the European Union Member States’ Tax Authorities issued their own ruling: the resulting situation was quite confusing because of the dissimilar interpretations, and in particular:\n\nSweden: the promoter of the preliminary ruling (Case No. 7101-13), had their Tax Authority indicate that bitcoin was exempt as other currencies under Article 135 (1) letter e).\n\nUnited Kingdom: the Tax Agency of the United Kingdom (Her Majesty\'s Revenue & Customs), published on March 3, 2014 the Revenue & Customs Brief 09/14 stating that bitcoin was VAT exempt as ""other negotiable instruments"" (Article 135, paragraph 1, letter d).\n\nEstonia: the Estonian Tax Authority (Maksu- Tolliamet) published in March 2014 an interpretation of the taxation of bitcoin, ruling that bitcoin was subject to VAT (also supported by the Court of Justice).\n\nPoland: the directors of the local tax units of the Polish Tax Authority made various interpretations on bitcoin and concluded it was a taxable service.\n\nGermany: the German Ministry of Finance, in response to the questions of the deputy Frank Shaffler (no. 409, July 2013 and no. 226, September 2013), ruled that bitcoin is ""private money"" denying the exemption (also supported by the Court of Justice).\n\nBelgium: the Tax Administration of Belgium with a ruling (GTVA20141533 / TL / MP of 05/09/2014) considered bitcoin as a ""virtual payment system"" and that it was VAT exempt as “other effects"", (Article 135, paragraph 1, letter d).\n\nFrance: The Commission of the French Senate presented a Report indicating that France will support VAT exemption to avoid a repeat of the VAT frauds in emissions trading system (carbon credits).\n\nFinland: the Keskusverolautakunnan (LKT) - Central Committee of the taxes - issued a Ruling on VAT on commissions earned by the intermediary of virtual currency, considering bitcoin similar to a means of payment under VAT Directive and consequently VAT exempt (Article 135, paragraph 1, letter d).\n\nSpain: the Direccion General De Tributos (DGT) - Secretaria de Estado de Hacienda, ruled on March 30, 2015 with Consulta Vinculante n. V1029-15 that bitcoin is ""other negotiable"" and VAT exempt in accordance with art. 135.1 d).\n\nThe opinion of Advocate General Kokott, delivered on July 16 2015, stressed:\n\n“currencies currently used as legal tender (...) have no other practical use than as a means of payment. Their function in a transaction is simply to facilitate trade in goods in an economy; as such, however, they are not consumed or used as goods”.\n\nTherefore, for VAT purposes, the pure means of payment perform the same function as legal tender and as such must, in accordance with the principle of fiscal neutrality in the form of the principle of equal treatment, be treated the same way.\n\nThe Court of Justice adheres to this innovative principle and, considering applicable the principles of the First National Bank of Chicago (Judgment C-172/96), declares certain types of transactions VAT exempt under Article 135 (1) letter e). This ECJ never interpreted this letter.\n\nThe Judgment considered irrelevant the presence of ""legal tender"" for currencies, if the means of payment has no other purpose other than a means of payment, although on a contractual or voluntary basis.\n\nThe Member States VAT laws must take into consideration this interpretation and particularly paragraph 51 of the Judgment:\n\n“It therefore follows from the context and the aims of Article 135(1)(e) that to interpret that provision as including only transactions involving traditional currencies would deprive it of part of its effect.”\n\nSo possible reference to legal tender or to traditional value shall not be compliant with VAT directive.\n\nThis Judgment will certainly have a significant impact on the cryptocurrencies ecosystem geopolitical scenario, as it is the first step in creating a stable and reliable legal framework, at least on VAT.\n\nIn the European Union consumers will buy bitcoins without any taxation and will be treated as means of payment until they cannot be used for other purposes. Other countries have different approaches because of existing rules: they run the risk to depress innovation (in Norway, Singapore and Australia the purchase of bitcoin is subject to indirect taxes).\n\nThe Judgment is the practical demonstration that bitcoin needs no specific regulation, but only the interpretation of existing legislation because bitcoin does not fall in any legal vacuum.\n\nThis position could also have an impact on future technological developments such as smart contracts (computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that obviate the need for a contractual clause), blockchain technology-based systems, integration with banking, insurance systems, and the Internet-of-Things.\n\nMany of these protocols will be based on units of account (tokens) similar to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The Judgment will allow VAT exempt movement of units of account for the payment of goods and/or services or for Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected devices. In any case, the products/services provided will follow the normal VAT rules. These scenarios are subject to growing challenges for the interpreter in an interconnected world where regulatory barriers and borders are becoming ever so thinner. However it is great for bitcoin and its future that the EU is taking a stance on VAT, this should at least allow for other countries and regions to have a precedent to consider when making their own interpretations and conclusions.\n\nStefano Capaccioli is CPA, Auditor, Tax litigator, Tax Advisor, Business Consultant, Specialized in Law & Tax on Gold, Precious Metals (aurumlex.it) and Cryptocurrencies (www.coinlex.it).

PPP essentially means that, over time, currency exchange rates should equalize such that identical goods cost roughly the same in any two countries. It is used to measure the value of currencies in that if more of a currency is required in one country than another to get the same thing, the local currency is undervalued by a certain percentage.\n\n\n\nThe Big Mac Index uses a McDonald’s Big Mac as its measuring stick. It currently allows for the user to select between the world’s major currencies – US dollars, British pounds sterling, Euros, the Japanese Yen and the Chinese Yuan. However, Bitcoin loan market maker BitBond saw a missing currency – the other contender in the race to be the dominant reserve currency, Bitcoin. Thus, they have launched BitcoinPPI.com, which stands for Bitcoin Purchasing Power Index.\n\nAt time of writing, a Bitcoin would buy you about 70 Big Macs in the United States, but 100 globally, making Bitcoin theoretically undervalued by up to 30% in the United States.\n\nCEO & Founder of Bitbond Radoslav Albrecht said of the move:\n\nThe use-cases for bitcoinppi.com are manifold and showcase Bitbond’s desire to bring further value to the Bitcoin ecosystem. By launching this site, we aim to bring a lighthearted yet highly usable index signifying the products that one Bitcoin buys you.\n\nThe data is also available via a handy application programming interface, meaning that alternative cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Dash could, for instance, take their current exchange rate versus Bitcoin and quantify their PPI. Additionally to that end, the code of the site is available on Github.\n\nJust like the fiat Big Mac Index, BitBond’s version allows the user to compare the rates to local goods and services. This is useful for more than just travel.\n\nTraders may find the data helpful in deciding which exchanges and countries to attempt to source from and sell Bitcoins to. If one country has a high Bitcoin purchasing power and another has a lower one, there may be arbitrage opportunities not previously evident.\n\nAlso read: A Bitcoin Alternative to Banks and Venture Capital: BitBond\n\nBig Macs were perhaps a more popular food choice in 1986, and so CCN asked BitBond associate Chris Grundy if his group was considering applying the idea to other items, such as a gallon of gasoline.

The Big Mac hamburger, as used by The Economist, is perfect for our purposes because it offers a universally uniform and accessible product that can therefore show the local value of bitcoin in a bank agnostic way. Thus, Bic Mac hamburgers were the obvious choice, but we may well add other measures such as a basket full of goods and commodities that fit the specifications equally well. Gold, for example, would be in such as basket.\n\nBy all rights, young Bitcoin is a true contender for the status of the world’s preferred reserve currency.

The complex architecture underpinning them was designed to prevent financial transactions from being manipulated, making it extremely difficult for fraud to happen.\n\nThe creation of Imperial’s Centre comes at an important juncture for the further development of distributed ledgers as governments and companies around the world are exploring the potential of adapting them for wider applications. The multi-disciplinary team at the Centre will carry out the underpinning policy, technology, design and social research with governments and industry to enable its smooth transition into the wider economy.\n\nDr Catherine Mulligan, Assistant Director of the Centre from Imperial College Business School, added: “Cryptocurrencies have shown us that we do not need a third party – a middleman – to successfully process transactions between users. It can all be done digitally by a distributed computer network secured by cryptography, which makes transactions much more resistant to fraud.\n\n“Many financial institutions are focusing on how they could use distributed ledgers to improve banking, but we feel the potential applications are much broader and far-reaching. It could spawn completely new modes of doing business. The opportunities are limitless and work at the Centre aims to make the adoption of distributed ledger technology by society as smooth as possible.”\n\nThe team say a successful rollout could help countries, industries and individuals reap a range of benefits. For example, for traders in precious commodities, distributed ledgers could enable them to authenticate the origin of precious stones such as diamonds. In the finance industry, reconciliation exercises between banks – which is where they compare records of transactions to determine discrepancies - could happen more rapidly and securely using a distributed ledger.\n\nIn the longer term, the Imperial team predict that distributed ledgers may enable the exchange of value by devices connected to the Internet of Things. This is where physical objects such as fridges and televisions will be embedded with electronics, sensors and wireless technology to collect and exchange data. For instance, distributed ledger technology could in theory enable a home, connected to the internet of things, to automatically predict the electricity consumption of its householders. It could then electronically set up short-term contracts to purchase energy from electricity suppliers, or even nearby houses producing their own surplus off-grid sources, ensuring the home’s electricity needs are managed in a cost-effective and sustainable way.\n\nResearch at the Centre is already underway and has appointed its first full-time researcher, Iain Stewart. Some of the technical themes that the Centre is exploring include making distributed ledgers more robust and scalable. Currently, the most popular cryptocurrency system, Bitcoin, carries out around two hundred thousand transactions per day, but for wider adoption the system needs to be able to cope with many millions.\n\nThe Centre is also exploring ways of using distributed ledgers within local and national government. For example, the technology could enable government agencies and departments to share data more effectively, reducing costs. It could also enable local authorities to improve transparency for citizens and open up new channels for interaction.\n\nThe Centre has received seed funding from Imperial’s Faculty of Engineering and Department of Computing. It also hosts a research grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.', ""On January 3, 2009, the Genesis block, or the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain, was created. In the coinbase parameter, there was a simple message: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” From that one block, Bitcoin was born.\n\nBitcoin has come a long way from that initial statement by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. The technology is growing up and changing from its early days as a project adopted by impassioned technologists and libertarians to a technology widely researched and used by financial institutions worldwide.\n\nBitcoin had a rough road ahead of it, as did many early technologies including the Internet. It dealt with newspaper headlines lambasting Bitcoin because of its connection to Silk Road and drugs. Early adopters suffered millions of dollars in losses when early exchange Mt.Gox imploded. “Bitcoin is Dead,” many prophesied.\n\nAnd yet, as Bitcoin approaches its seventh birthday, we see things changing. It is turning into that curious, wide-eyed technology with ideas as widespread as any normal 7-year-old. Cross-border payments, machine-to-machine transactions, smart contracts, microtransactions, and stock settlements all have been discussed and developed. Nothing is off limits; no question goes unasked.\n\nFrom the early days of mining using a laptop computer, now bitcoin miners are setting up industrial-sized data centers with hundreds of thousands of high-powered, specialized machines. In January 2014, the Bitcoin network hashrate was only 10 million GH/s. Now it is 504 million GH/s. And as new mining machines are built and sold, the hashrate has continued to increase. During same time frame, there were around 50,000 bitcoin transactions daily. That measure of network utility has increased to about 170,000 bitcoin transactions daily.\n\nA big part of this growth in transactions is linked to the growth in bitcoin-accepting merchants. In mid-2014, there were approximately 65,000 merchants who accepted bitcoin. By mid-year 2015, there were 100,000, which is a 50 percent increase. TigerDirect, a publicly-traded online electronics retailer, has seen incredible results. Of all the buyers that used bitcoin, 46 percent of them were brand new to TigerDirect. Further, orders placed with bitcoin were 30 percent bigger. In August 2015, BitPay, a bitcoin payment processor, recorded an all-time high of 70,000 bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin as a tool of transaction is growing.\n\nBitcoin as an asset class is also maturing. For the majority of 2015, the price has stayed relatively nonvolatile and constant, with the price fluctuating from $200 to $300. It’s only the past few weeks where the price has experienced such a significant increase, reminiscent of the early years. From January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2014, the price went from $13.41 to $808.05, going as high as $1,147.25 on December 4. Just one month earlier, on November 4, 2013, the price was $225.20. Even the “bubbles” in bitcoin are maturing. On the other hand, the market cap of bitcoin is down from an all-time high of nearly $14 billion to around $5 billion at time of writing.\n\nVenture capital funding, however, continues to pour into the space. In 2013, bitcoin companies raised only $93.8 million. In 2014, firms raised $314.7 million. With another two months remaining in the current year, bitcoin and blockchain companies have raised more than $1 billion.\n\nRegulations are also changing. Before, there were politicians decrying bitcoin because of its use on the underground marketplace Silk Road. Now, organizations such as Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce work to help these politicians and regulators draft rules that will ensure Bitcoin can continue to grow worldwide. New York has led the regulatory charge with its recent BitLicense. The European Union also recently ruled that Bitcoin was not subject to VAT, giving significant clarity for those participating in the ecosystem.\n\nFinally, the next stage of blockchain companies continues to grow. Augur, a decentralized prediction market, announced that it had raised $5.1 million in a crowdsale. Ethereum, the smart contract and publishing platform, raised $18.4 million in its own crowdsale. It is expected that OpenBazaar, the completely decentralized peer-to-peer ecommerce site will launch in the coming months.\n\nIn the graphic below, many of the top Bitcoin leaders talk about the growth of bitcoin and where it is going. Bitcoin is not just in the fringes anymore; it is everywhere. Whether it's miners or payment processors, wallets or developer tools, the reality is simple: Bitcoin is growing up. And its ambitions are as vast as the many great technologies that came before it.\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

In recent weeks, similarly positive reports have been published by firms such as Tabb Group and GreySpark Partners.\n\nImage via Capgemini\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, in light of the recent developments regarding use of Bitcoin in trading illicit products, Interpol officials seem to be discussing to employ a broader policing system to counter such practices.\n\nBesides the use of Bitcoin in illegal asset trades around the world, it is being widely used in cybercrime situations. For example, hacking groups have reportedly sold Home Depot’s customer credit card details via Bitcoin last year. Furthermore, security experts are increasingly worried about the role of Bitcoin in the post Paris attack world, where several activist groups claimed that ISIS financed the attack by using Bitcoin.\n\nThe Global Focal Point Conference is jointly organized by Interpol and an organization called the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, which was established in 2009 by a collaboration between The World Bank and The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Interpol has taken a leading role in fighting cybercrime that uses Bitcoin to facilitate financing.\n\nIn April, CoinDesk reported that Interpol has created a cryptocurrency of its own in order to study the use of block chain technology in cybercrime. The demo currency was used by Interpol in order to train its officials about the technology and equip them with the knowledge to act against illicit trade of assets.', 'A few days ago a $400 charge hit my credit card and Amazon notified me that my 21.co bitcoin computer was on its way.\n\nEssentially a Raspberry Pi connected with a custom bitcoin-mining ASIC and a heatsink, the computer is one of the most interesting MVPs in modern memory. While you could easily recreate it yourself, the fact that 21 is building and selling these for a few hundred dollars is a testament to the future widespread adoption of BTC systems.\n\nIs it worth it? First, I doubt this 50 Gigahash per second machine will ever earn back the cost associated with buying and running it. Second, it’s very cool but I suspect that this isn’t quite the bitcoin droid we’re all looking for. That said, I would argue that it’s a fascinating proof of concept.\n\nThe 21 computer is essentially a version of previously-built Raspberry Pi miners. I’ve run something similar to it under my desk for about two years now and it’s been a fun if impoverishing experience. Heck, you can buy this monstrosity for $60 and heat your bedroom while you mine pennies a week. But you don’t mine bitcoins to for the riches, people say. You mine it to support the network.\n\nUltimately the 21’s goal is to put something like this bitcoin system into every phone and computer. This move would change the way the blockchain is processed in a very real way and could result in some interesting changes in the entire ecosystem. As it stands, however, this computer is akin to Baby’s First Bitcoin miner, a plug and play device that is accessible and understandable and a great way to get into mining without going crazy.\n\nWhat this device is really designed to do is offer a test bed for bitcoin-based activity like sale of signed digital goods, the ability to rent out system time for bitcoin, and accept bitcoin on a commerce site. The core app is called 21 and it runs from the command line. Typing ’21 mine’ activates the bitcoin miner while other commands activate various features. You can also launch a server to perform basic bitcoin functions. For example, 21 offers a bitcoin via SMS system that uses Twilio to send payments. You can also sell digital files via bitcoin using this server.\n\nSo why run this other than a testbed? In the words of one Reddit user, Tequila13, “There’s vision of a future where every phone will have a mining chip, and people out the goodness of their heart will pay for the mining chip and will mine at a loss for the greater good. A future where millions of people will buy the phone with the lower battery life, because they believe in bitcoin.” While this is a bit Utopian, it’s true: if millions of these mini miners powered the bitcoin network it would be a far more interesting world: bitcoin would move more quickly and with more surety, the rates would ideally stabilize, and the blockchain would be a force to be reckoned with in finance. In short, this is the Internet for money and, like early Internet servers, it seems quite limited right now – until, suddenly, someone builds the financial equivalent of Google Docs in the browser.\n\nThe 21 bitcoin computer is a platform for experimentation. It is a clever hack, a nice MVP for the company, and a great way to get started in Bitcoin. You could quite easily recreate it on your own but without the specific software and server stack that they’ve made available I doubt you’d have the same out-of-the-box satisfaction. When I built my first miner it took a few days to figure out the pieces and software. To run this miner I simply typed “21 mine” and I was off and running into the cryptocurrency future. That, alone, might be worth $400.', ""Bitcoin is not anonymous, but, rather, pseudo-anonymous. By now, most Bitcoin veterans know this. It’s less obvious to many, however, why Bitcoin is not really anonymous by default, and what can be done to de-anonymize Bitcoin users – and what Bitcoin users can do to reclaim their privacy.\n\nBelow is an advanced beginners guide to get a better understanding of the nuances of Bitcoin and anonymity.\n\nHow do Bitcoin transactions work?\n\nTo better understand Bitcoin’s anonymity, it's necessary to first understand how Bitcoin works on a basic level.\n\nMost importantly, the Bitcoin protocol effectively consist of a series of transactions. These transactions are basically a package of different kinds of data, among which are transaction inputs and transaction outputs. Inputs refer to Bitcoin addresses used to send bitcoin from, and can only be spent using the private key associated to that address. Outputs effectively refer to addresses used to send bitcoin to. Each Bitcoin transaction transfers bitcoin from one or several inputs to one or several outputs (therefore, transferring bitcoin from one or several addresses to one or several addresses).\n\nIt's possible for a transaction to simply have one input and one output. But that is rare, as it would require that the amount of bitcoin to be sent (the output) precisely equal the amount of an earlier amount received (the input).\n\nInstead, it's quite common that a transaction consists of multiple smaller inputs in order to make for one larger transaction. If someone, for instance, controls three different inputs of one bitcoin each, and needs to send 2.5 bitcoin to an online store, the software will merge all three inputs into a single transaction.\n\nAnd it's even more common that a transaction consists of multiple outputs. This is because Bitcoin uses change addresses. Change addresses allow users to create a transaction that returns the excess amount of bitcoin from one or several inputs back to the original sender. So in the example above, the software will typically create two outputs. One output attributes 2.5 bitcoin to the address belonging to the online store, while another output will attribute .5 bitcoin back to the newly generated (change) address controlled by the sender.\n\nWhat makes bitcoin 'anonymous'?\n\nThere are generally three reasons why bitcoin is sometimes regarded as anonymous.\n\nFirst, unlike bank accounts and most other payment systems, Bitcoin addresses are not tied to the identity of users on a protocol level. Anyone can create a new and completely random Bitcoin address (and the associated private key) at any time, without the need to submit any personal information to anyone.\n\nSecond, transactions are not tied to the identity of users either. As such, (and as long as a miner includes the transaction in a block) anyone can effectively transfer bitcoin from any address to which it controls the (private) keys, to any other address, with no need to reveal any personal information at all. Like physical cash, not even the receiver needs to know the identity of the sender.\n\nAnd third, Bitcoin transaction data is transmitted and forwarded by nodes to a random set of nodes on the peer-to-peer network. While Bitcoin nodes do connect to each other using IP-addresses, it's not necessarily clear for nodes whether the transaction data they received was created by the node they connect to, or if that node merely forwarded that data.\n\nHow is anonymity defeated?\n\nThere are basically three ways to de-anonymize Bitcoin users.\n\nFirst of all, even though Bitcoin transactions are randomly transmitted over the peer-to-peer network, this system is not airtight. If an attacker, for instance, has the means to connect multiple nodes to the Bitcoin network, the combined data collected from these different nodes might be enough to determine where a transaction originated.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin addresses can be linked to real identities if these real identities are used in combination with the Bitcoin addresses in some way. This includes addresses used to deposit or withdraw money to or from a (regulated) exchange or wallet service, publicly exposed donation addresses, or addresses simply used to send bitcoin to someone (including the online store) when using a real identity.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, all transactions over the Bitcoin network are completely transparent and traceable by anyone. It's typically this complete transparency that allows multiple Bitcoin addresses to be clustered together, and be tied to the same user. Therefore, if just one of these clustered addresses is linked to a real-world identity through one or several of the other de-anonymizing methods, all clustered addresses can be.\n\nWhat is clustering?\n\nLet’s take a closer look at clustering.\n\nA very basic clustering method is the analysis of transactions networks. In its most basic form, this refers to the several inputs combined into a single transaction. While these inputs could have originated from different addresses, the fact that they were combined into a single transaction suggests that all these inputs – and therefore all related addresses – are controlled by the same user.\n\nSimilarly, there are various methods to identify change addresses as being change addresses, which links them to the sender of the transaction. This is fairly straightforward when receiving bitcoin; the output that is not attributed to you is typically (though not always) attributed to the change address controlled by the sender. In addition, some Bitcoin software, reveals the change address to attentive onlookers, too. It does so, for instance, by always creating a change address as the last output of a transaction. The use of multisig-addresses can be a giveaway as well.\n\nAnother clustering method is taint analysis. Taint analysis is fairly straightforward, too, and is even offered by several freely accessible block explorers. Basically, taint analysis calculates what percentage of bitcoin on a specific address originated from another specific address, whether the addresses are one transaction separated from each other – or more.\n\nAnd then there's amount analysis and timing analysis. Amount analysis, as the name suggests, doesn't track specific transactions, but rather specific amounts. Similarly, timing analysis tracks specific times. If, for example, one input is exactly 2.6539924 bitcoin, and an unrelated output is exactly 2.6539924 (minus fee) one block later, it suggests that the sending and receiving addresses belong to someone using some kind of mixer (see below).\n\nWhat can be done to reclaim privacy?\n\nBitcoin privacy is still very much an arms race. While progress is being made to improve Bitcoin anonymity on one hand, possible methods to de-anonymize users are often established on the other. And while it is beyond the scope of this article to explore all potential future possibilities to improve anonymity, there are some basic methods to increase privacy on the Bitcoin network available right now.\n\nOne such a straightforward solution is using TOR or other methods to hide IP addresses. If Bitcoin transactions are transmitted over TOR, there is no way to determine where they originated from (granted that TOR itself does as promised, of course).\n\nAnother basic solution to increase privacy is creating a new address for each transaction. Creating a new address for each transaction makes it harder to link addresses to real identities, as it would at the very least require more clustering to do so. An increasing number of Bitcoin wallets do this automatically using hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet software.\n\nA slightly more advanced method to gain privacy is the use of mixers. Mixers exist in multiple shapes and forms, but they basically enable that everyone using the mixer receives each others' bitcoin. If done well, mixing counters the analysis of transaction networks as well as taint analysis. And for improved results, mixing can be repeated.\n\nOne example of such a mixing strategy is CoinJoin, which merges inputs from and outputs to several users into one transaction – breaking the assumption that all inputs belong to the same user. CoinJoin does not, however, remove all taint from a Bitcoin address, since the inputs and outputs are still connected to some degree.\n\nAlternatively, some mixers can remove all taint, as they return unrelated bitcoin from completely different addresses belonging to the mixer. However, these mixers are typically centralized, and as such will know the sending and receiving Bitcoin addresses belonging to users.\n\nAdditionally, to counter amount analysis, mixers can require all users to submit the same amount into the mix. Alternatively, mixing services can charge a random fee, making it harder for an outsider to link the amount of bitcoin sent to the amount returned. Furthermore, it's possible to break up the amount mixed, further obfuscating the coins, while smaller amounts are easier lost in “the crowd” of transactions.\n\nTo counter timing analysis, moreover, mixers can wait some random time before they send coins back; the longer this range, the harder it becomes to link transactions. Furthermore, extending the mixing time increases the likelihood of transactions to be obfuscated with normal transactions.\n\nBut in the end, Bitcoin privacy is still a sliding scale – not a binary problem. Rather than being either completely anonymous or not at all, Bitcoin users enjoy a certain level of privacy, depending on how much of their identity they reveal, which of the anonymizing techniques they apply, how many, and how often.\n\nN.b.: For specific examples of mixing techniques, see the research paper cited below.\n\nThe article is largely based on 'Research on Anonymization and De-anonymization in the Bitcoin System ', an ATR Defense Science & Technology Lab. paper by QingChun ShenTu and JianPing Yu from Bitbank Research Labs, published by Shenzhen University.

The new group has a wider cache of members and isn’t a commercial venture, the source noted. R3 on the other hand is being backed by the likes of JPMorgan, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Citibank Group among several other massive banks and corporations.\n\nThere is a significant increase in Blockchain initiatives and endeavors for financial applications lately. Nasdaq recently launched Linq, a private blockchain trading platform for private companies. Computing giant Microsoft also announced a blockchain platform powered by Ethereum last week that will specifically help financial institutions with tools to experiment with blockchain technology in an inexpensive way.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Digital currencies were deemed a ""low"" risk for money laundering and terrorism financing in a report published last month by the UK government.\n\nIn a National Risk Assessment released 15th October by HM Treasury, the government said that digital currencies present the lowest risk rating among money laundering vehicles, a list that also includes cash, banks and accountancy services.\n\n""The money laundering risk associated with digital currencies is low, though if the use of digital currencies was to become more prevalent in the UK this risk could rise,"" the report states.

In 2014, a blog associated with ISIS wrote how a “global jihad” could be funded by Bitcoin, and indeed that now seems to be the group’s digital money of choice.\n\nAn anonymous member of Ghost Security Group confirmed to Bitcoin News Service NewsBTC that the group has been tracking funds on the deep web and working to shut them down.\n\nIn an email exchange the member writes:\n\n“The Islamic State does use cryptocurrencies as a form of income to fund their ongoing operations and we have managed to uncover several Bitcoin addresses used by them. One of the accounts we analyzed was found to contain 3 million U.S. dollars worth of Bitcoins.”\n\nCryptocurrency isn’t without its drawbacks. Its value is unpredictable, as it grows increasingly common so will methods to track it. Like any currency, there’s a threat of it being stolen, and it can be difficult to convert to a sovereign currency. But its benefits — global reach, speed, anonymity, and ease of use, among others — are highly attractive to terrorist groups.

Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes, until each node receives all the latest transactions and blocks. This works quite well, as the distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.\n\nBut there are other, more centralized alternatives for transmitting transaction data, too. The best known of these is “the” relay network, introduced in 2014 and maintained by Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo: “It's centralizing, but, hopefully, democratizing.”\n\nOn propagation\n\nCorallo's relay network serves two distinct purposes. First, it adds diversity to Bitcoin. Rather than just needing to rely on the peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin users can opt to receive transaction data and blocks through an alternative channel. This makes it harder to successfully attack the Bitcoin network; the relay network functions as a fallback. But the second, and more important reason, is a potential decrease of network latency.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Corallo explained:\n\nThe peer-to-peer code in Bitcoin Core is pretty gnarly. It's stable and it works, but it's not very efficient, and it's not very fast. The resulting network latency is a problem, especially for miners. It can sometimes take 10, 15 seconds before they receive newly mined blocks. If you're a miner, 10 seconds is like 1.5 percent loss in revenue. That is potentially a big deal. You don't want that.”\n\nSome of the bigger miners (typically mining pools) have therefore come up with an alternative solution. Rather than using the peer-to-peer network to transmit new blocks, they have created an alternative – private – network. If one of these miners finds a new block, that miner immediately sends it over to the other miners on their private network, meaning all these miners can start mining on the new block immediately.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that this disadvantages all miners not using this private network. When a select group of miners starts mining on a new block faster than other miners this select group gets a head start every time one of them finds a block. This is especially worrisome because it is typically the bigger miners who have the time and resources to set up private networks. Smaller miners might, therefore, become less profitable and eventually drop off the network entirely, which centralizes mining even further.\n\nA Leg Up\n\nCorallo's relay network is essentially a hub-and-spoke network, which consists of servers set up in eight well-connected Internet traffic hubs: New York, Seattle, Amsterdam, Beijing, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and Novosibirsk (located in central Russia). Additionally, the relay network uses a fairly basic compression algorithm. Any Bitcoin node can connect to the nearest hub on Corallo's relay network, and send and receive transactions and blocks to and from other connected nodes.\n\nBut unlike Bitcoin's original peer-to-peer network, Corallo's relay network is centrally controlled: by Corallo. This means that users of the network need to rely on Corallo, most importantly for maintenance. (Though this doesn't stop the peer-to-peer network from propagating transactions and blocks in the mean time, of course.)\n\nThe relay network is not the most reliable thing,” Corallo acknowledged. “There is no service-level agreement ... once in a while servers go down and I don't fix it right away... sometimes I'm sleeping, or drunk.”\n\nBut absent better alternatives, the relay network can still save small miners on cost, meaning they can increase their profit, and remain competitive, Corallo hopes."", 'Cryptocurrency exchange CCEDK has officially launched Obits, a new currency, that aims to reward holders with a share of its revenues from transactions, referrals plus income from new bourse initiatives.

This gives a better idea of the actual worth of currency than a mere exchange rate. However, it is restricted to a few major fiat currencies, and so Bitcoin loan maker BitBond has launched its own version, BitcoinPPI.com to show the worth of Bitcoin in actual purchasing power in relation to other currencies.\n\nEconomic theory says that currency exchange rates should equalize over time, meaning that a specific item will cost around the same in any two countries, and the Purchasing Power Parity index indicates how much more currency is required than another for a given purchase. The Economist has used the ‘Big Mac Index’ for this for years, as a Big Mac is somewhat ubiquitous around the world and easily recognisable, making it a good choice of product.\n\nIt works in a simple way, by comparing how much currency is needed to buy a Big Mac, you can compare how much purchasing power each currency has in real terms, which gives a better indication of value than exchange rates, which can vary significantly, sometimes for unrelated reasons.\n\nHowever, the Big Mac Index only covers the major fiat currencies, the US Dollar, British Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Chinese Yuan. This excludes quite a few other fiat currencies, but significantly all digital currency of any kind. The bitcoin loan maker BitBond have however launched a new website, BitcoinPPI.com, to remedy this.\n\nBitcoinPPI.com, which stands for Bitcoin Purchasing Power Index aims to offer the same comparison ability for Bitcoin, it allows you to compare the global ‘Big Mac’ value of bitcoin with local exchange rates to see if Bitcoin is under or overvalued where you are.\n\nAs we write, the global rate shows a single bitcoin will buy around 100 Big Macs, while in the US, that falls to 70 Big Macs. What does this mean? It suggests that in the United States, bitcoin is undervalued by around 30% compared to its theoretical value, although this does not mean that extra value would ever be realised.\n\nAs a tool it is useful not just for bitcoin users, but it does perhaps offer a useful tool for traders who are looking to exploit arbitrage opportunities between nations or regions. The open structure of the tool means that other digital currencies could be added too. Additionally, while currently it deals in ‘Big Macs’ for equivalence as with the existing Economist version, other commodities could be added later, including commodities such as Gold.\n\nAs another move in promoting Bitcoin as a genuine candidate for a reserve currency, this is another small step along the way that could prove more significant as time goes by.']"
11/20/2015,"['Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of industry media coverage and its impact.\n\nDue to their status as both an emerging payment method and payments technology, global authorities have long sought to ensure safeguards are in place to prevent digital currencies from being abused by cybercriminals and terrorists seeking to take advantage of their cash-like features.\n\nThis narrative was given new prominence this week following the terrorist attacks in Paris last Friday, which left more than 100 people dead and that have found law enforcement agencies and politicians seeking to take aggressive measures to bolster security in their wake.\n\nOf note is that global authorities including FinCEN, Europol, FATF, G7 and Interpol have long been concerned about the state of regulation on digital currencies due to what they consider to be the potential for the new technology to be leveraged by groups seeking to finance terrorists or by terrorists directly.\n\nSuch nuance was often lost in new reports that highlighted how digital currencies were once again part of the conversation in the wake of the Paris attacks, as the European Council of the European Union and G7 convened for meetings aimed at assessing potential areas of concern in the global financial system.\n\nComplicating reports by global media outlets was confusion related to past research into whether Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), or Daesh, has been confirmed to have actually used digital currency to fund its operations.\n\nThis arguably confusing state of reporting was even highlighted by FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery in a speech where she stated directly that her agency does not believe digital currencies to represent a ""higher risk"" when compared to more established payment methods.\n\nAccording to American Banker, Calvery said:\n\n""There has been public reporting of connections of ISIL promoting the use of bitcoin and virtual currencies as a means of moving and raising funds, but I think we are also very focused on the traditional means of moving funds so I think we need to keep our focus on both areas.""\n\nSuch nuanced commentary, however, was often reduced in headline form, with American Banker running the headline, ""ISIL May Be Using Bitcoin, FinCEN\'s Calvery Says"".\n\nIn response, industry thought leaders sought to put forth a more moderate take on the technology\'s role in global financial crime, with some circulating a report from the UK treasury, released in October, that found that digital currencies were the least likely payment method to be used for money laundering.\n\nThe report, however, suggested that, as global law enforcement agencies have advocated, activities in the industry should be monitored due to the potential for such systems to be more widely used for both legitimate and criminal purposes.\n\nDubious connections\n\nIssues began last weekend when cryptocurrency-specific industry news outlets sought to determine whether the technology may have played a role in funding the Paris attacks.\n\nIn the wake of the news, industry blog NewsBTC published an interview with a member of Ghost Security Group, an organization formerly affiliated with Anonymous that works in conjunction with the US government, which discussed whether IS was using bitcoin as a means to fund operations.\n\nThe member of Ghost Security Group said that IS used cryptocurrencies as a form of income to fund their activities, and that the group had uncovered various bitcoin addresses used by those affiliated with IS, though they did not specify whether any of these funds had been used in the planning of the recent attacks in Paris.\n\nHowever, the media outlet published the interview under the headline ""ISIL Militants Linked To France Terrorist attacks Had A Bitcoin Address with 3 Million Dollars"".\n\nThe headline sparked a wave of coverage from other outlets, including NetworkWorld and PaymentWeek, which ran similar coverage.\n\nA representative for Ghost Security told CoinDesk that the accounts it claimed it discovered ""are in no way connected to the Paris attack"", contradicting numerous headlines that attested otherwise.\n\nFurther, the representative said that it was not currently in possession of the bitcoin addresses it claimed it were connected to ISIL, adding:\n\n""We no longer have the full addresses and they were handed off to the US government for verification and investigation.""\n\nSome observers, including an anti-ISIL group called GhostSec that is associated with online hacktivist collective Anonymous, have disputed Ghost Security Group\'s claims in light of a lack of verifiable bitcoin address or transactions.\n\nGhost Security Group provided CoinDesk with a purported image from a now-defunct Islamic State site, though the bitcoin address listed on it was not legible. The group later said it no longer possessed that information.\n\nThe language included on the page is identical to that on a Pastebin from May, though the bitcoin address listed has not received or sent any transactions.\n\nPast precedent\n\nAlso circulating as media outlets attempted to understand the issue were older reports that had sought to connect IS and digital currencies.\n\nOften cited, for example, was a September article by Deutsche Welle that explored the alleged connection between IS and the digital currency.\n\nIt began:\n\n""Between bitcoin and gold, the \'Islamic State\' is experimenting with currency, marking a new step in its state-crafting ambitions ... its apparent use of the decentralised technology bitcoin has come at nearly the same time as IS minted and released its own currency, the \'gold dinar\'. The group\'s use of the two currencies, however, will likely serve different purposes.""\n\nThe article cited the EU Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) junior analyst Beatrice Berton, who said:\n\n""Sadaqa (private donations) constitute one of ISIL\'s main sources of revenue, and its supporters around the world have allegedly used digital currencies such as bitcoin to transfer money quickly to accounts held by ISIL militants while minimising the risk of detection.""\n\nThousands of dollars worth of bitcoin have been sent to accounts purportedly affiliated with IS, said the article, with the one of the accounts registering its first transaction as far back as 2012.\n\nSpeculation as to the veracity of the article in light of new attention eventually reached a fever pitch, with author Lewis Sanders IV taking to Twitter to stick by his coverage.\n\nA point of contention, however, was an apparent error in Sanders\' report, in which it was originally claimed that an address with $20m in bitcoin had been tied to ISIL. Sanders later said that it was an error added after he had filed the report.\n\nSanders IV went so far as to denounce how his reporting was being used by other journalists, writing:\n\n""I do not support - and instead condemn - #Bitcoin news (sic) sites extrapolating erroneous information from it.""\n\nEU \'crackdown\' on bitcoin\n\nSoon after this wave of reporting, Reuters jumpstarted a second life for the narrative when it reported European countries were planning to ""clamp down"" on digital currencies and ""anonymous online payments"" in an attempt to curb the financing of terrorism activities in the aftermath of the Paris attacks.\n\nAccording to a draft document seen by Reuters, EU interior and justice minister were due to gather in Brussels today for a crisis meeting.\n\n""They will urge the European Commission, the EU executive arm, to propose measures to \'strengthen controls of non-banking payment methods such as electronic/anonymous payments and virtual currencies and transfers of gold, precious metals, by pre-paid cards,"" Reuters said, citing the draft conclusions from the meeting.\n\nIt was not long until other mainstream media outlets began to cover the news. City AM\'s Clara Guibourg, picked up on Reuters\' original report which outlined the plan to curb terrorism financing by targeting digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\nThe author sought to position the news as part of a new event that was perhaps a ""setback"" for the digital currency, in what would become a common theme for reporters despite the long-standing investigation of global governments into the connection.She wrote:\n\n""This comes as a setback for bitcoin, which has been charging forward in recent months, with the EU recently accepting it as a currency by granting it VAT exemption.The cryptocurrency surged in price, charging up 110 per cent over October to hit a 2015 high of $500 before tumbling back down just as quickly to trade around $330 today.""\n\nDespite the coverage, the meeting conclusions from today\'s meeting in Brussels did not specifically mention bitcoin or any other digital currencies. CoinDesk reached out to the European Commission for more details on the meeting, but at press time did not receive any new details.\n\nThe EU news was accompanied by a separate report that members of the G7 nations were seeking to ""get tough"" on digital currencies, which Reuters positioned as a response to the Paris attacks.\n\nReuters wrote:\n\n""The software-based financial services that FinTechs offer, including digital or \'virtual\' currencies such as bitcoin, often operate across borders and beyond the reach of security officials.""\n\nThe story was originally published by Der Spiegel on Wednesday, with both outlets noting that this intention extended to the wider FinTech industry, yet neither positioning their headlines toward this angle.\n\nOld criticisms revived\n\nElsewhere, news outlets used this background as a kickstarter for conversations about the perceived benefits and drawbacks of digital currencies.\n\nBloomberg View writer Leonid Bershidsky noted the EU\'s perceived plan to crack down on virtual currencies using it as a platform to call for cash to be abolished.\n\n""The problem is that terrorists aren\'t really using [digital currencies], anyway,"" he said, adding:\n\n""They\'re using good old cash, though its circulation is already severely limited in countries such as France – the scene of the most recent Islamic State terror attacks. Instead of taking their anger out on virtual currencies, now is the time for governments to think seriously about the abolition of cash."" ""Despite the Islamic State\'s well-known dislike of the US, its financial accounts seem to be kept in US dollars. The terror group\'s revenue comes in greenbacks, whether from old-school oil smuggling, \'taxes\' on subjugated populations or the trade in stolen artefacts,"" he continued. He went on to suggest that bitcoin\'s price volatility against other currencies would make the system ""risky"" for terrorist groups. ""Groups like Islamic State and their contractors don\'t want a means of payment that can lose half of its value in a day,"" he concluded. Bershidsky\'s report, while a minority opinion, nonetheless succeeded at highlighting a discrepancy in the media\'s reporting that had been widely voiced on social media by the bitcoin industry, that reports on the use of newer payment methods in terrorist funding obscure that much of this illicit activity takes place among established forms of payment.

That\'s good news for this decidedly democratic money system, a system controlled not by big governments and big banks and big credit card companies but by a vast network of computers set up by users around the world. The more people who use bitcoin, the more useful it becomes—the closer we get to a place where we can send money across the Internet as easily as we send texts or emails.\n\nThe rub is that relatively few people and businesses are using bitcoin to actually buy and sell stuff—or send money to friends and family or transfer money across international borders or handle any of the other financial tasks that bitcoin promises to streamline in the years to come. Most people are just speculating in bitcoin, buying the digital currency in the hopes that its rather volatile price will go up—and they can turn a profit.\n\nAccording to Coinbase, the Silicon Valley startup that operates digital bitcoin wallets for over 2.8 million people across the globe, about 20 percent of the transactions on its network involve payments or other tasks where bitcoin is used as a currency. The other 80 percent of those transactions are mere speculation, where bitcoin is traded as a commodity in search of a profit.\n\nThat 20 percent figure is actually much higher than in previous years, but Coinbase hopes to push it higher still. This morning, in an effort to nudge bitcoin toward the mainstream, the company unveiled the country\'s first bitcoin debit card. It\'s called the Shift Card, and it lets you spend bitcoin at any merchant—both online and off—that accepts an ordinary VISA card. Imagine buying a burrito at your local Mexican joint with bitcoin card, or a television from Amazon.com.\n\n""At the end of the day, what we\'re trying to do is make bitcoin easy to use,"" says Coinbase vice president of business development and strategy Adam White. ""We want to make it easy to buy and sell bitcoin, and we want to make it easy to spend. A mainstream debit card based on bitcoin is a key element.""\n\nFinding Acceptance\n\nAccording to Coinbase, the card has been approved for use by anyone living in one of 25 US states, including Texas, Washington, and New Jersey. It\'s available in California, but only as part of a ""beta"" launch that will top out at 1,000 users.\n\nFor bitcoin companies like Coinbase, regulatory approval is often a complicated undertaking. ""You have to get licenses from each state,"" says Jeffrey Steiner, counsel with the international law firm Gibson Dunn, referring to money transmitter licenses and other types of approval. Some bitcoin operations have failed to secure such licenses before launching new services, but Coinbase says it has shunned the shortcuts that have caused trouble for other services in the past. According to White, the company has notified all 25 states that it planned to offer the card.\n\nThe new debit card is available to anyone with a Coinbase account. To sign up, you must verify your identity and pay a $10 insurance fee. After that, when buying from merchants based in the US, you can pay for goods in bitcoin without any additional fees (as with other debit cards and credit cards, the fees are paid by the merchants). If you use the card overseas, however, you\'ll have to pay an international exchange fee. You can also use the card to get money out of an ATM—the funds will come out of your online Coinbase bitcoin balance, not a bank account—but this will require a fee as well.\n\nInside Job\n\nFor Coinbase, the hope is that its existing customers will start spending more of their bitcoin, rather than just speculating—and that new customers will be attracted to the digital currency because they can more easily spend it. ""It only helps bitcoin adoption,"" Gibson Dunn lawyer Steiner says of the card. Other companies, including the startup Xapo, have explored bitcoin debit cards, but these have only been available overseas.\n\nThe knock-on effect is potentially even more powerful. If more and more people start spending bitcoin, then merchants both online and off have more reason to accept direct payments in the digital currency. Ultimately, they\'ll have even more incentive to make the switch to bitcoin than consumers. If they switch, they won\'t have to pay those steep processing fees to the likes of VISA and Mastercard.\n\nSo, this VISA card is a way of undermining VISA itself. It might seem odd that VISA would allow for such as thing, but the company is not directly involved in the new card. Coinbase is offering the card through a company called Shift, and it\'s Shift that has the relationship with VISA. Could VISA shut the card down? VISA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Buy Shift spokesperson Meg Nakamura says that VISA backs the project. ""VISA\'s relationship to the project is such that they are aware of the program and supportive of Shift\'s efforts,"" she says. ""VISA can always shut whatever it wants down. But I have assurance from the VISA teams that they are supportive of what we\'re doing and the product we\'re launching.""\n\nIf the card thrives, it could potentially solve one of bitcoin\'s biggest problems. As it stands, relatively few consumers have adopted bitcoin because few merchants accept it. And few merchants accept it because relatively few consumers have adopted it. ""As a consumer mechanism,"" says John Collison, co-founder of Stripe, a company that sits are the heart of the digital payments world, ""bitcoin suffers from the chicken-and-egg problem."" But if large numbers of people start using the new Coinbase credit card, that conundrum is broken.\n\nAs Steiner says: ""What this does is cut merchant adoption from the technology.""\n\nMaking Money Easier\n\nStill, why would new users adopt this bitcoin card rather than just stick with standard debit and credit cards? Well, it lets you pay for stuff even if you don\'t have a bank account. That may seem like a small and unlikely way to use it, but as bitcoin matures, this could become increasing viable and important as bitcoin matures. If companies start paying employees in bitcoin, for instance, the options really open up. ""It\'s now possible to live on bitcoin alone through a combination of an employer paying the user in bitcoin and the user spending bitcoin for everyday items via their debit card,"" White says.\n\nFor most people, that\'s still a ways away. But in using the card, you can help push bitcoin closer to that new world order. ""Users of bitcoin are philosophically aligned with bringing the gap from Finance 1.0—the existing financial system—to Finance 2.0, which is what bitcoin represents,"" White says.\n\nUltimately, if bitcoin is widely used, it helps the consumer in other ways as well. For one, it moves us towards micro-payments, where we can pay for digital goods with tiny amounts of money. Paying for something with a fraction of a cent is difficult, paying with a fraction of a bitcoin less so. Plus, bitcoin provides a far easier means of moving money across borders, from one country to another.\n\nSome fear that bitcoin makes the movement of money too easy—especially because people can move the digital currency anonymously. This week, according to Reuters, the EU is looking to crack down on organizations using bitcoin to anonymously fund terrorism. Bitcoin and other digital currencies can certainly be used in this way. But this hardly characterizes the movement as a whole.\n\nThe new Coinbase card alleviates the concern over anonymity. Like any other debit or credit card, you must verify your identity to use it. Like many others, Coinbase hopes to bring bitcoin into a new place: the mainstream. And especially at this time of year, what could be more mainstream than a piece of plastic? White says that if you spend $1000 via your card before the New Year, Coinbase will refund your $10 insurance fee.\n\nUpdate: This story originally stated that Coinbase said it has received explicitly approval from 25 states to offer its bitcoin debit card. The company now says it is more accurate to say that it notified 25 states that it planned to offer the card, and the story has been updated to reflect this.\n\nUpdate: Coinbase also says it has now rescinded its offer to refund insurance feeds.', 'Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada recently warned banks about the effect that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can bring to the monetary policy. According to the speech “Innovation, Central-Bank Style” Canada’s banks should manage the risks and benefits that could arise from the broader adoption of e-money.\n\nAccording to Carolyn Wilkins:\n\n“As we think about alternative futures, we have to envision a world in which people mostly use e-money, perhaps even one that’s not denominated in a national currency, such as Bitcoin. This would create a new dynamic in the global monetary order, one in which central banks would struggle to implement monetary policy. And, central banks couldn’t act as lenders of last resort as they do for their own currencies.”\n\nThe senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada stated that according to the corporate plan the bank will explore modern financial and technology trends over the course of three years. The bank will focus on studies of modern economic statistics and behavioural economics.\n\nWe have reached out to a number of experts in Canada to learn what they think about emerging financial policy, Blockchain technology rise and latest Carolyn Wilkins speech.\n\nAnthony Di Iorio, CEO at Decentral Consulting Services commented to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Carolyn Wilkins’ remarks about the value of an innovation-friendly culture are very encouraging, and it is great that the Bank of Canada is adopting a positive attitude to innovations such as the blockchain. We are also sensitive to her worries about the blockchain’s disruptive potential - how effective monetary policy can be conducted, and whether it will remain possible to for the BoC to act as ‘lender of last’ resort.”\n\nReasons of concern\n\nFinTech and Blockchain technology saw a tremendous growth throughout the recent years. Carolyn Wilkins has pointed out once again that banks are worried of having difficulties to implement monetary policy while emerging technologies gain traction and popularity.\n\n“My personal opinion is Bitcoin and crypto infrastructure will replace the need for current policies, with more people switching to e-money, price volatility will be resolved,” said Alexander Alexandrov, CEO and Founder at CoinPayments to CoinTelegraph.\n\nHe continued:\n\n“By design Bitcoin will overall increase in value so worrying about losses is only an issue during the adoption cycle. This just speaks of their lack of full understanding of what is really happening and them trying to save their failing business model. Similar to using blockchain and avoiding bitcoin as suggested by other firms. Overall this is a shift in the right direction but a clear indication of lack of understanding on what transparent and decentralized systems want.”\n\nManie Eagar, Co-founder and Chairman of the DiGiFIn Institute Director and founder of GriffenVentures commented:\n\n“The key concern that Wilkins raises, and justifiably so, is: Innovation may be difficult, however, if cryptocurrencies gain real traction and usurp national currencies, is because ""this would create a new dynamic in the global monetary order, one in which central banks would struggle to implement monetary policy."" Seen that alternative currencies or digital currencies will make the world of value exchange more frictionless, it is time to revisit disparate regulation and standards for the internet, money, exchange, global settlement practices, security, etc.”\n\nManie Eagar believes that Carolyn Wilkins concern focuses on the risk of a free floating alternative currency and its potential for radical fluctuation in value with the potential losses that merchants and consumers alike might incur:\n\n“The industry has already proved quite innovative in this regard as many exchanges and payment processors already provide instant settlement or underwrite a \'lock-in\' of the value of a trade and the ruling price at the instant of transaction. This seems quite sustainable and practical in the real world to support merchant and consumer adoption.”\n\nBanks trying to jump on the train\n\nWorld banks have expressed their concerns about the impact of booming FinTech solutions for years. While they do feel being a bit behind on the latest advances some major world banks joined R3 consortiums to explore Blockchain technology and how to apply it in traditional financial system.\n\nAccording to Alexander Alexandrov:\n\n“They were ignoring [Bitcoin Blockchain technology], fighting it, laughing at it now they are trying to join. Mainly they have a real issue working in an economy where they don\'t get to issue ""fake"" money and have to really manage what goes in and out. They are now researching ways to adapt and, in my opinion, the best thing they can do is invest in the startups instead of asking their current guys to figure it out. This all seems to me like an indicator they are no longer laughing at us.”\n\nMoreover, some banks have already tried to make their own digital currencies. The Royal Canadian Mint has even announced the MintChip digital currency project and run an employee trial in 2014. It seems that banks might start using new technologies in this direction too.\n\nManie Eagar said:\n\n“From monitoring emerging trends two scenarios are quite likely - central banks will issue their own digital currencies pegged to their fiat for trading and exchange purposes; while in a hybrid model, co-exist with complementary currencies whose value could be pegged to the currency of a certain jurisdiction or allowed to \'float\' in the free market as bitcoin does, for example.”\n\nEmerging technologies can change the financial industry\n\nDigital currency gives an alternative vision to the future development of the financial sector. The fact that some banking institution are moving to explore, analyze and adopt some of this cutting-edge opportunities shows the major impact that this technology brings to the world.\n\n“Financial regulators and compliance efforts will focus on the bridging capabilities of these new technologies across platforms, jurisdictions, commercial and social applications,” continued Manie Eagar.\n\nPaul Szczesny, co-founder of Bitcoiniacs stated:\n\n“It is encouraging to see the BoC grappling with important issues surrounding innovation, Bitcoin, and blockchain technology. These technologies are fueling a revitalization in the financial industry and present enormous opportunities for the Canadian and worldwide economy. The deputy governor is correct regarding the potential of these innovations to decentralize monetary control and reduce the influence of central banks. My hope is that the BoC takes its innovative corporate culture seriously and is open to new paradigms for financial regulation. We need to consider that non-centralized alternatives to financial regulation are not only possible, but have the potential to create a more equitable, inclusive, and transparent financial system than has ever been considered before.”\n\nAccording to Anthony Di Iorio:\n\n“Although the blockchain undoubtedly presents new challenges, it also presents phenomenal opportunities - for example, the development of a financial system that manages and distributes risk more effectively, and that gives firms greater access to liquidity via channels such as P2P lending. The attitude of the Bank of Canada indicates that we have an exciting opportunity position ourselves as the leader in this field, and the big challenge we face is to create the regulatory environment to ensure that this happens.”\n\nManie Eagar concluded:', 'Although the big banks have changed their tune on Bitcoin’s blockchain technology over the past year, it still seems clear that nearly none of them want anything to do with bitcoin (the currency). Whether it’s due to the perceived connection to criminal activity or the desire to have complete control over any newly-implemented ledger system, some of the largest financial institutions in the world seem hesitant to embrace Bitcoin as an open platform for transferring value.\n\nThe topic of why banks may be dismissive of Bitcoin was discussed at a recent BitPanel Meetup featuring Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce, Yang Ventures Founder Terrence Yang, and Coinsilium’s Pierre Wolff.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin vs Blockchain: Barry Silbert Weighs-in at Inside Bitcoins NYC\n\nWhy Choose Bitcoin Over Permissioned Ledgers?\n\nDuring the discussion in which Bitcoin’s decentralized ledger was compared with private, permissioned blockchains, the panel was asked what the reason would be to use Bitcoin in the first place. Brock Pierce noted that use of the Bitcoin blockchain makes the most sense in situations where one’s counterparty is not trusted, which may be why banks have a low level of interest in the technology:\n\n“The reason why [the Bitcoin blockchain] is used — it’s where you don’t have to trust your counterparty is the primary reason. In the case of the large financial institutions, they know their counterparties well enough — in most instances can trust them well enough — that a lot of them are going to use permissioned ledgers [or] private blockchains, and that’s because it’s a closed network.”\n\nThe one benefit of using Bitcoin for banks pointed out by Pierce after his initial comments was that it could make sense for these financial institutions to essentially outsource the work required to develop a new ledger system to the Bitcoin development community. He added, “It’s crowdsourcing your infrastructure.”\n\nFinancial Institutions Don’t Get Special Privileges\n\nPierre Wolff also shared his thoughts on the usefulness of the Bitcoin blockchain for banks, and he pointed out one issue banks may see with a decentralized, permissionless ledger is that they don’t have any special rights or privileges in such a system:\n\n“Dont forget that when Bitcoin was invented . . . it never had this thing that said, ‘Oh, and financial institutions have this special role. You know? In Bitcoin world, financial institutions are just a node on the network, just like everybody else. They’re not accustomed to working that way.”\n\nIt should be noted that there are still plenty of useful services that financial institutions can provide while operating as “just another node” on the Bitcoin network. Coinbase, Circle, and many of the Bitcoin exchanges are perfect examples of this sort of activity.\n\nUncertainties Remain with Bitcoin\n\nThere are a variety of uncertainties associated with Bitcoin that banks are not ready to deal with at this time. According to Wolff, one possible issue is that banks have to trust a new group to handle settlement, bitcoin miners:\n\n“You can’t tell a financial institution that, ‘Hey. You can outsource your validation and settlement to this world of nodes of people that may or may not put your transaction in a block this time.’ These are uncertainties that I think financial institutions are very nervous about — entrusting others to make sure settlement takes place.”\n\nTechnically, a miner could be a pseudonymous individual or entity who does not wish to make their true identity public, which could be an issue in the eyes of financial institutions. The large number of scandals in the Bitcoin industry have also been a problem, which is the main reason some people only talk about the blockchain — even when they plan to use Bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin’s Scandals Won’t Matter If It Has Killer Apps\n\nFeatured image taken from Bitnodes.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

He went on to state that there is little evidence crimes in the country are being committed with digital currencies, though he reportedly pointed to the use of bitcoin ATMs as a possible money laundering risk.\n\nCentral bank representative Anselmo Pereira Araujo Neto said (according to Google Translate) during the hearing that, while international examples are important, any regulatory frameworks that are developed must be rooted specifically to Brazil.\n\n""We will not copy international rules that are not adapted to our reality,” he said.

It has since diversified into almost every segment of bitcoin ecosystem - mining, payment processing, consumer wallets, and blockchain engraving.\n\nThe company said in a statement that BlockPriority provides expedited confirmations of bitcoin transactions sent through BTCC\'s services even when the bitcoin network is under stress or undergoing spam attacks.\n\nSamson Mow, BTCC\'s chief operating officer, said: ""BlockPriority is a unique and innovative service available exclusively to BTCC users. It\'s also a means of mitigating potential impact to our customers from the lack of progress on blocksize increases.""\n\nThe service works by submitting bitcoin transactions sent to or from any BTCC wallet address directly to BTCC\'s mining pool for rapid confirmation. BTCC\'s mining pool accounts for approximately 13% of the global bitcoin network\'s hashing power.\n\nBlockPriority prioritises all BTCC\'s customers\' transactions, including those who pay zero transaction fees. Customers who pay lower transaction fees on other exchanges or wallet services may have to wait before the bitcoin network confirms their transactions, said BTCC.\n\nBy prioritising all bitcoin transactions to and from BTCC accounts regardless of transaction-fee level, BlockPriority also reduces the risk of double-spend attacks on BTCC accounts, which happens when someone attempts to use bitcoin for two or more payments by taking advantage of the lag between when a bitcoin transaction happens and when the bitcoin network confirms it.\n\nBTCC\'s chief technology officer Mikael Wang, added: ""BlockPriority is the latest addition to our proprietary blockchain technology services, following the Forever blockchain engraving service that we launched in June. BlockPriority demonstrates our commitment to providing our customers and the wider bitcoin community with the best and most convenient experience possible.""', 'Within weeks of Nasreen Mohsin moving to Vancouver in September to start a master’s of engineering at Simon Fraser University, one of her friends back home in India had an emergency. Mohsin won’t divulge the specifics, but her friend needed 6,000 rupees, or about $120—and fast.\n\nOne option was to use a traditional money-transfer service, like Western Union, but her friend recommended they make the transfer via Bitcoin. Not only would it be fast, but the fees would be next to nothing.\n\nBitcoin is a global currency that only exists digitally. Who prints it? Nobody. What’s the central authority or bank that controls it? There isn’t one. For the layperson, Bitcoin is useful as a way to transfer money from point A to point B—so long as both places have access to the Internet—with no need to go through a bank and, therefore, incurring virtually no transaction fees.\n\nFortunately for Mohsin, getting her hands on the digital currency was extremely convenient. “The nearest [Bitcoin] ATM was at SFU,” Mohsin says.\n\nIn May, Simon Fraser became the first Canadian post-secondary institution to install automated Bitcoin vending machines (known as AVMs) at bookstores campus-wide. “A student could use a Bitcoin to buy a book,” says Mark McLaughlin, the university’s executive director of ancillary services. “The plan is to eventually roll it out to our dining hall.”\n\nMohsin doesn’t plan to use Bitcoin to buy books, but she’s grateful it was there to help her friend back home. Mohsin deposited $120 into the AVM machine, scanned the QR code on her cellphone and received about one-third of a Bitcoin in her virtual wallet. (The exchange rate fluctuates—one Bitcoin is now worth about $355.) She transferred the Bitcoin to her friend’s virtual wallet, a process that’s as easy as sending an email. Within about 20 seconds, the transaction was done, and her friend converted the Bitcoin to 6,000 rupees.\n\nThe university wouldn’t say how many digital transactions have come through the machines or how much Bitcoin has been bought. “It’s a small percentage of the student population [that’s using it], but at least some people are,” McLaughlin says.\n\nFor most students, using Bitcoin to buy books is a novelty. But there’s incentive for the school.\n\n“Essentially, SFU is not paying any transaction fees when they accept Bitcoin,” says Mike Yeung, founder of the SFU Bitcoin Club. Visa and MasterCard, for example, charge retailers up to 1.5 per cent of the value of each sale. With about 30,000 students at SFU and an average semester’s worth of books and supplies for an undergraduate costing $1,020, according to university figures, “that can add up to be pretty substantial over time,” Yeung adds.\n\nMcLaughlin says the school didn’t adopt Bitcoin because of financial incentives. Rather, there were two objectives in accepting the digital currency at bookstores at each of the three campuses in Vancouver, Burnaby and Surrey. First, it started a dialogue on campus about disruptive technologies. Second, students could learn about Bitcoin (as could staff, for that matter). The project also inspired some entrepreneurial philanthropy, such as when the SFU Bitcoin Club lobbied the university to accept donations via Bitcoin in August 2014. Yeung and SFU alum Scott Nelson donated 10 Bitcoins, equivalent to nearly $6,000 at the time.\n\nWhy not donate using Canadian dollars? “Bitcoin is what I have,” says Nelson, an information technologist and a believer in cryptocurrency since he started using Bitcoin in tech startups about four years ago. “I want to promote the idea of philanthropy using Bitcoin. You want this stuff to circulate.”\n\nThe donation went toward a co-op project that sent two students to India to help women and girls victimized by human trafficking. Each student was given one Bitcoin, while the remaining eight Bitcoins were converted to Canadian dollars to help fund the trip. After all, not every restaurant, taxi and airline accepts Bitcoin—though many might soon, considering the currency is expanding to campuses across Canada.\n\nFor example, the McGill Cryptocurrency Club launched paper airplanes with QR codes that could be used to receive $5, $10 or $20 worth of Bitcoin during this year’s frosh week in Montreal. Which raises the question: where can students use Bitcoin to buy a beer?', 'The Bitcoin Foundation launched in mid 2012, with the mission to ""standardize, protect and promote the use of Bitcoin,” explained Jon Matonis, Founding Board Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, in an article he wrote for Forbes.\n\nAt the time, Peter Vessenes was the Foundation’s Executive Director, and was quoted by Matonis as saying the Bitcoin Foundation “will be the organization that focuses and unlocks all of your energy and talents towards promoting Bitcoins, protecting them, and increasing their legitimacy through standardization.”\n\n- Peter Vessenes, Former Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director\n\nIn 2013, the Foundation announced its International Affiliation Program. “We are experiencing rapid adoption worldwide and are excited to welcome Bitcoin Association of Australia and Bitcoin Foundation Canada as our first two affiliate chapters. In addition, we are engaged in talks with India and Argentina and have received strong interest for collaboration from countries like China, Germany and the Netherlands,” said Matonis in a press release.\n\n- Jon Matonis, Bitcoin Foundation Founding Director\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation set up an office in London, a “turnkey operation” and “organizational toolbelt.” Affiliates from different countries would be able to use this support system to establish the necessary infrastructure, credibility, and presence to lead localized educational, media, and outreach efforts regarding bitcoin.\n\nThe collaborative relationships with the foundation were meant to benefit new affiliates with shared resources, connections and support. Each affiliate was to be self-governed by a local board of directors and team.\n\nThe Israeli Bitcoin Association, the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and many others rejected the terms proposed by the Foundation, and decided to go it alone. According to the Bitcoin Association of Australia (BAA), they were also initially opposed.\n\nAdam Poulton, President of the BAA explained that the Foundation approached them about becoming a regional representative directly. After months of discussion, terms were settled on between the two nonprofit organizations. “We felt that by partnering with the Bitcoin Foundation we could leverage their brand and direct their effort down to the national and local level within Australia,” he said.\n\nThe BAA was formed in late 2013, with goals and ambitions that closely aligned with the Bitcoin Foundation. “It was in this sense of partnership that we both discussed a joint agreement,” the BAA stated at the time.\n\n- Bitcoin Association of Australia\n\nAround the same time, Vessenes was taking action against one of the founding members of the Foundation, Mark Karpeles, the former CEO of Mt Gox. This business relationship was seen to be inappropriate, and a conflict of interest.\n\nKarpeles was a board member, and eventually stepped down the following year, as his exchange fell under scrutiny, and later collapsed. He has since been arrested in Japan for the embezzlement of US$2.6m, while 650,000 of the exchange customers bitcoins still remain missing.\n\nA second founding member, Charlie Shrem, is the former CEO of BitInstant. Shrem was arrested for ""operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, money laundering conspiracy and willfully failing to file suspicious activity reports with banking authorities."" stated the formal complaint outlining the allegations.\n\nThe Foundation attempted to restore some faith by holding elections to replace the two disgraced founders. However, the controversial placement of Brock Pierce resulted in a wave of paying members walking away from the Foundation. Forums erupted with chatter due to Pierce’s past, which included allegations in 2000 from three previous employees at Digital Entertainment Network, who accused him of providing minors with narcotics and pressuring them for sex. He was not found guilty.\n\nPierce refused to step down, explaining in a letter to the Foundation that ""it would set a bad precedent for the Foundation, rewarding those who make scurrilous accusations and engage in character assassination, often anonymously.”\n\n- Brock Pierce\n\nEarlier this year, Jim Harper and Olivier Janssens were voted on to the Bitcoin Foundation\'s Board. At the beginning of his term, Janssens made a public announcement he called “The Truth About The Bitcoin Foundation.” In the document he outlined a funding shortage, and highlighted a lack of transparency around how close the foundation was to bankruptcy. The lack of cash flow resulted in 90 percent of its employees being fired.\n\nBruce Fenton, a lifetime member of the foundation, was also voted in this year, taking over from Patrick Murck as Executive Director. In line with Janssens, Fenton has been very outspoken regarding fiscal reform, and a need for transparency.\n\n- The Bitcoin Foundation’s first announcement after Fenton’s election\n\nDespite a board which is now 100 percent voted for, and a new direction, the Bitcoin Association of Australia recently announced a unanimous decision to terminate their international affiliate agreement. “After many months of inaction on several fronts from the Bitcoin Foundation we no longer feel that there is any benefit to our organisation or to our members of being a part of the Bitcoin Foundation,” stated the BAA president, Adam Poulton.\n\nPoulton explained that the topic has been casually discussed for several months. “The trigger for our decision was the fact that the membership portal has had several outages over the last 6 months. Unfortunately this has cost us important corporate memberships. As a result of this, we have implemented our own membership portal and have started accepting members directly.”\n\n- Bitcoin Association of Australia\n\nAll donations and fees were previously handled by the Bitcoin Foundation. The Israeli Bitcoin Foundation were also approached to become an international affiliate, Co-Founder Ron Gross explained the structure to Bitcoin Magazine. “Basically, they proposed a sort of a revenue sharing model, where they will collect all of the member fees and the donations and within a certain period, maybe one month, they will transfer a half of that – a half of the member fees and a half of the donations – to us. And we won’t have any option of accepting either of these on our own.”\n\nIn addition to accepting member fees and donations directly, Poulton states that the Bitcoin Association of Australia can now start to build its own brand, and forge its own direction. “Although this will not change anything in the day to day operations of our organisation, we feel that our efforts are better directed at local campaigns, projects and events,” he said\n\nThe Bitcoin Association of Australia has a busy 2016 in store, focusing heavily on education, adoption and problems faced by the Bitcoin community there. “There is the ongoing issue with bitcoin businesses having reliable access to banking facilities at Australian banks. We are in the early stages of organising a high level meeting of banking representatives, regulators and government officials to see if there is any way forward for bitcoin businesses within the existing banking framework,” said Poulton.', 'Bitcoin has been touted as a revolution in money and finance for a few years now, but overall adoption by consumers and major corporations is still essentially zero. There are certain types of individuals and businesses who have already found out ways to benefit from using Bitcoin’s blockchain for payments or other applications, but a killer app that brings millions of new users to the digital currency has yet to emerge.\n\nRead More: Where are Bitcoin’s Killer Apps?\n\nMainstream adoption of Bitcoin applications was a main topic of conversation at a recent BitPanel Meetup, and Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce was able to point out at least one Bitcoin startup that has serious potential for adoption by small and large businesses in the form of Align Commerce.\n\nPractical Bitcoin Startups are Attracting VC Funding\n\nA key theme during the entire BitPanel Meetup was the need for startups to find specific use cases of the Bitcoin blockchain that people will actually want to use. There are plenty of Bitcoin companies that are able to attract investors, but many of them are having difficulties with luring customers away from other options and earning revenue. Coinsilium’s Pierre Wolff noted that at least two companies in the Bitcoin space, Abra and Align Commerce, have been able to attract big investors because they’re providing something that provides value to their users:\n\n“You’ve got three portfolio companies today and certainly two of them in the remittance space that are actually getting the big VCs in them. So, they’ve now reached that next level where they are getting the fuel on the fire because the remittance [use case has potential]. When we talk about Bitcoin, we shouldn’t talk generically about all of this; there’s actually market sectors, and in remittance, we’re beginning to see evidence that something is happening.”\n\nWolff went on to explain that Abra and Align Commerce are targeting two different markets with their respective offerings:\n\n“Those two companies — one is going to the very high end, so they’re not going to the third world [use case] and getting money from immigrant to family at home. They’re dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars of large, corporate transactions taking place and moving money — in the case of Align [Commerce]. In the case of Abra, you’ve got kind of the lower-end remittance play. Both of those are getting the right attention from the right people because they’re doing the right things.”\n\nCompanies Want to Save Money, With or WIthout Bitcoin\n\nIt was at this point in the conversation that Brock Pierce went into more detail about Align Commerce and how it should be easy for a company like that to pitch their product to a CFO. Pierce explained that the Bitcoin-powered application will be able to save some companies large sums of cash:\n\n“In the case of Align Commerce, they’re going after not remittance really. They’re going after the wire transfer business; it’s wires. This is bank to bank, large dollar volume where you’re paying 20, 30, [or] 40 bucks for the wire plus a 2 to 3 percent FX fee that’s buried in that. And when you’re a company sending, you know, $50 million from here to Europe and you can save a million dollars per year, it’s not a hard sell to get a CFO to play with you.”\n\nInstead of promoting themselves as a Bitcoin company, Align Commerce has chosen to keep nearly all mentions of the blockchain off of their website. After all, their customers are not interested in Bitcoin; they simply want to use something cheaper than what is currently offered by the legacy financial system.\n\nRead More: Brock Pierce: Consumers Don’t Care About Bitcoin, They Care About Faster and Better\n\nSelling Bitcoin to Consumers is More Difficult\n\nAlthough it is easy to sell a product like Align Commerce to a CFO at a company, getting consumers to use Bitcoin has proven to be a bit of a challenge up to this point. Pierce hit this point during the recent BitPanel Meetup:\n\n“The hard part is convincing consumers to do this. Convincing CFOs is a much easier one because you’re going to get his attention when you tell him you can save him a half a million dollars per year.”\n\nHaving said that, it’s possible that Abra could be the application that finally gets more of the general public on the blockchain. Much like Align Commerce, Abra does not brag about their use of the Bitcoin blockchain in their marketing material. Instead, they are usually referred to as the Uber of money transfers, which is a concept that more people will understand. As long as Abra can offer a cheaper alternative to the current options in international remittances, no one is going to care if Bitcoin is used as the plumbing underneath the whole system.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.', '\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin has only been relevant on a large scale for a few years, and already there has been an active debate over how it should be classified as a unit of value. And this fall, that debate has reached its conclusion, at least for the time being, in two of the most influential financial markets in the world.\n\nRecently, news broke that the European Union ruled that Bitcoin is a currency, not a commodity, which was significant mostly for tax purposes. Basically, the EU’s Court of Justice had to make a decision as to whether or not cash-to-Bitcoin transactions should be taxed. And they ultimately decided against such a tax because of existing rules prohibiting taxes on “transfers of currency, bank notes, and coins used as legal tender.” Thus, the ruling can be taken as official clarification that Bitcoin is viewed by the EU’s legal authorities as falling under that same umbrella—something “used as legal tender.”\n\nThe U.S., however, appears to have made the exact opposite decision regarding the classification of Bitcoin. In September, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission determined that Bitcoin would be classed as a commodity, putting it in line with resources such as gold and oil, rather than on a fast track to becoming a recognized, official currency. This was not an exact parallel to the court ruling by the EU, but it nevertheless demonstrates just how uncertain both the public and government officials are as to what we should make of the cryptocurrency.\n\nFor Americans, the determination by the CFTC sends a fairly clear message: Bitcoin should be treated like a resource in which you can invest, rather than a currency that you should collect and use. To be clear, this is not meant as specific advice regarding your own handling of Bitcoin. Despite a lack of government regulations, Bitcoin is already accepted by a wide array of online businesses in the States, and it is also increasingly accepted in physical retail stores. You can stock up on Bitcoin as you would any ordinary currency and use it at any number of places to purchase goods and services.\n\nBut at the very least, the CFTC’s classification appears to be a nudge toward investing, rather than collecting to spend. But what exactly does it mean to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nAs mentioned, it’s somewhat like delving into the gold or oil market. But for purposes of trading, Bitcoin may actually be closest to the forex market. In that market, traders buy and sell various world currencies against one another in the hopes of holding one currency as its value goes up and then selling it back for more of a different currency than it was initially worth. Because Bitcoin is measured directly against currencies, it can be looked at somewhat similarly from an investment standpoint. The idea is to buy a given amount of Bitcoin with your usual currency with the hopes of selling the Bitcoin back in the future for a higher value of your original currency.\n\nAs to whether or not such an investment is strategic, it depends a great deal on your view toward the future of Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general. There’s still a great deal of debate as to where the currency (or commodity, perhaps) is going from here, though most projections appear to be trending up. We’ve seen Bitcoin’s value spike and crash in recent years, and in 2015 it’s experienced a fairly steady rise, and even hovered at a value close to $400 for some time. But investing in Bitcoin requires the same careful scrutiny and projection that any ordinary stock or commodity demands. Specifically, you would want to look at which companies or industries may soon be accepting the cryptocurrency, where the currency might expand, and whether or not the economic conditions in major financial markets appear ready to facilitate a rise in value over time.\n\nWhat it means to invest in Bitcoin is to put your financial backing behind a technological resource with potential for growth. Some would argue that putting a little stock in Bitcoin before it becomes prohibitively expensive is a no-brainer. But the counterargument is that limited utility could also keep Bitcoin from reaching any sort of lucrative price point in the future. The decision of which viewpoint to trust has to be a personal one for each investor.']"
11/21/2015,"['Bitcoin is a digital currency that is quite well-known already, mainly due to various reasons. Upon introduction, bitcoin gained prominence due to its unique features. Bitcoin was believed to be anonymous, mainly due to its decentralized protocol and high standards of encryption. Except for a sequence of characters, the bitcoin network doesn’t have any other unique features that render the user readily identifiable. These special properties made bitcoin popular amongst the deep web users.\n\nThe extensive use of bitcoin across the deep web users, followed by the emergence and fall of Silk Road, helped bitcoin gain more prominence. While most of us understand bitcoin and how it “ticks”, there have been other digital currencies with their own set of features. Some of them were introduced way before bitcoin and there are few that emerged following bitcoin’s birth. However, not many could withstand the test of time and there are few that still exist in a form different from the original.\n\nComparison between bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nThe list of digital currencies that have come and gone is extensive. The ones listed above have had significant number of users and had to extensively be reported upon. They are different from each other in their own ways and they have had their share of controversies.\n\nSimilarities\n\nAll these have one thing in common. Unlike fiat currencies, they are all digital currencies and they are community driven. Each of them, except for Linden Dollar has/had certain degrees of anonymity associated with it. However, some of them didn’t last long, in spite of widespread adoption due to technical, legal and regulatory complications.\n\nAnonymity\n\nBitcoin is considered to be completely anonymous. But in reality, it is pseudonymous, meaning it offers partial anonymity. with enough determination and resources, transactions on Bitcoin network can be tracked. The same holds good for other currencies as well.\n\nSome of the other digital currencies that promised anonymity includes Liberty Reserve which allowed users to sign up with just name, email id and birth date. The absence of cross verification procedure offered a certain degree of anonymity to its users. Liberty Reserve was forced to shut down for facilitating money laundering and operating without proper licensing.\n\nMoneyPak reloadable debit cards turned out to be a failed adoption of conventional payment solution. While MoneyPak was intended to make electronic payments easier, the company did not think about its potential misuse. People could easily buy a preloaded MoneyPak debit card from shops by paying cash without furnishing any identification. These cards could then be used anywhere and it was virtually impossible to track the transactions. The loophole was exploited by many people, leading to rise in reports of MoneyPak frauds and scams. Green dot Corporation was forced to withdraw MoneyPak cards from shops earlier this year.\n\nE-gold was a digital gold currency platform that allowed its users to convert their funds to gold and use it to transfer the value instead of paying with fiat currency. User funds on e-gold platform were backed by equivalent value in gold deposit. Users could assume any name to operate an E-gold account, offering a certain degree of anonymity to the users. However, the transaction records could still be used to track back the users. Like bitcoin, E-gold was pseudonymous at the best. E-gold was widely adopted across the United States before the government cracked down on the company, forcing it to shut down amid rising instances of frauds and scams.\n\nPerfect Money is another P2P and P2B money transfer platform which initially filled the vacuum left behind by E-gold. The platform initially allowed users to anonymously register and transfer money. Initially, the people behind Perfect Money were unknown and the anonymity it offered was widely appreciated by many. However, it was later established that one Andrew Draper was behind Perfect Money. The company which was said to be registered in Panama now has Kowloon, Hong Kong as its address. It has also gone ahead and cleaned up its act by blocking access through Tor proxy.\n\nMonero uses modified CryptoNote protocol based on ring signatures and stealth addresses for enhanced privacy. Monero’s opaque blockchain offers better privacy and more control over access to transactional data in comparison to bitcoin’s transparent blockchain. Monero claims to be a truly anonymous cryptocurrency. However, it has its own drawbacks when it comes to multi-signature protection and mining capabilities. Monero doesn’t have significant traction yet, and whether it can survive the regulatory regimen is still unknown.\n\nThere are other digital currencies like Dash, CloakCoin and AnonCoin which promises complete anonymity. However, their market capitalization and user adoption is far from desirable to attract attention at the moment.\n\nReferences:', 'Delta Business Management, a London based investment company, is developing its own blockchain for timestamping, named Delta ID Coin. Douglas Millard, from Delta Business Management, told CoinTelegraph in a personal conversation on November 21st, that the addition will allow the company to register its users issuing a coin on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTimestamping On The Blockchain\n\nTimestamping on the blockchain is not new in the cryptocurrency world, but for the ones that are entering this ecosystem late, a little explanation is due: the blockchain, the backbone of most cryptocurrency, is essentially a public ledger where transactions are written.\n\nBut apart from the actual Bitcoin (or altcoin) transactions, the ledger also allows a certain amount of extra data to be recorded into each block. This creates the conditions to store proof that something happened at that exact time. Would it be a land property transfer, the publication of a book, the fact that you have given a present to your girlfriend or even just a bet between friends. Anything you can think of, essentially, can be stamped with a time precision of less than half an hour on the blockchain.\n\nThis registration method has two advantages: first it’s economic, because with a simple, inexpensive Bitcoin transaction anything can be stored, second nobody can tamper with the registered data, ever, thanks to blockchain technology being distributed and unmodifiable.\n\nHowever, the amount of data that can be added to any Bitcoin transaction is limited, so to get around the issue other solutions, often described as “sidechains”, are used to alleviate Bitcoin blockchain bloat.\n\nNot Another ALT Coin\n\nFrom the little information available, it seems that Delta ID Coin will represent Delta Business’ clients and allow them to have a proof by storing their coins (a single one) in a personal Bitcoin address.\n\nOne of the first applications of Delta ID Coin will be the registration of car parking spaces at Gatwick Airport, making this a solution to a real world use case.\n\nDouglas Millard, from Delta Coin Business, explains that:\n\n“Delta ID coin is a token that Delta Business Management is considering creating using Omnilayer which sits on top of the Bitcoin blockchain similarly to Counterparty. The Bitcoin blockchain will be used for time stamping we are not an altcoin competitor. The plan is to use Bitcoin addresses as markers which store Delta ID Coin, no personal information will be contained within the ID token which will be issued to customers. Clients will first have to provide KYC information to DBM before ID coins will be sent to a Bitcoin address of their choice, they will then be able to receive any returns generated from asset investments.”\n\nOmnilayer has been already adopted by several projects in different countries and is a reliable, consolidated platform.\n\nAt the time of writing, Delta Business has yet to announce an official release date.', 'Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price after declining close to ¥1800 found support and currently setting up for the next move.\n\nLooking at the 4-hours char (price feed from BTCChina), there is a consolidation pattern formed.\n\nA positive sign for buyers is emerging on the lower timeframe, as the price broke a bearish trend line on the hourly chart (price feed from Huobi).\n\nBitcoin price started to show some bullish signs, and looks set for an upside move if buyers step in and overcome selling pressure.\n\n¥2160-70 as a Resistance\n\nI highlighted in the previous week’s analysis that Bitcoin price managed to settle around the ¥1800 support area. The price is currently consolidating in a range, as the Bollinger bands contracted on the 4-hours chart (price feed from BTCChina). An initial resistance for the upside move can be around the Upper Bollinger Band, coinciding with the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the ¥3350 high to ¥1807 low at ¥2169.\n\nBTCCNY recently fell close to ¥2000 where it found buyers and traded back higher. There was a bearish trend line formed on the hourly chart (price feed from Huobi), which was broken to ignite an upside move. Moreover, the 50 Fib retracement level of the last move from the ¥2150 high to ¥2000 low was also cleared. The price is currently struggling to clear the 100 hourly simple moving average (MA) confluence area.\n\nIt looks like the price may break the shackles and trade towards ¥2160 that can be seen as an initial resistance where sellers might take a stand.\n\nLooking at the indicators:\n\nHourly MACD – The MACD is in the bullish zone and favoring more gains.\n\nRSI (Relative Strength Index) – The hourly RSI around the overbought levels, suggesting a possibility of a minor correction.\n\nOn the downside, the broken trend line could act as a support if the price corrects lower from the current levels.\n\nIntraday Support Level – ¥2080\n\nIntraday Resistance Level – ¥2160\n\nCharts from BTCChina and Huobi; hosted by Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Linq is the first platform from an established financial services firm to demonstrate how asset trading could be managed digitally through the use of blockchain-based platforms. It\'s a management tool for shares in private companies, and it\'s part of Nasdaq Private Market, the exchange\'s suite of services for entrepreneurs and venture investors.\n\nIndeed, Fredrik Voss, Nasdaq\'s head of blockchain strategy, believes that the efficiencies provided by blockchain technology could give Linq the edge that finally encourages increased use of private-market trading platforms.\n\nIn a new interview, Voss and global software development director Alex Zinder emphasized the blockchain’s ability to remove the need for pen-and-paper or spreadsheet-based record-keeping as the tech\'s biggest benefit for the private shares trading market.\n\nZinder told CoinDesk:\n\n""There hasn’t been a huge amount of adoption [among startups] of moving away from paper and we want to make sure [blockchain] tech can help us move forward. Right now, the process is highly manual and it leaves a lot of room for human error.""\n\nNasdaq communications specialist William Briganti called the technology’s potential to remove this pain point a “key driver” of the initiative due to its ability to provide immutable recordkeeping and a chain of custody for users.\n\n“We polled a number of startup executives, and the overwhelming majority were using spreadsheets at every fundraising round,” he said. “We’re trying to apply our standards on transparency and auditability.”\n\nNasdaq Private Markets was launched in 2014, and it\'s the latest in a long line of attempts by the stock exchange to enter the secondary market for pre-IPO share trading, following efforts that date as far back as 1990. But today, more companies are choosing to stay private longer, and that means there\'s renewed attention on pre-IPO trading as investors seek liquidity events that may ease management pressures on early-stage firms.\n\nUnder the hood\n\nA closer look at Linq reveals a sleek product with an intuitive user experience for both investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nLinq share issuers log in to find a cap-table management dashboard complete with valuation, the price of shares issued in each investment round and the percentage of available stock options.\n\nDigital representations of shares are visualized as colored blocks representing unspent outputs on the Linq blockchain. Nasdaq calls the presentation of this data its \'Equity Timeline View\', which illustrates who owns the shares on a flowchart.\n\nTransactions that are spent appear as ""void"" on the timeline, and turn gray. Users can also see arrows that illustrate how such shares were transferred and divided.\n\nZinder and Voss explained:\n\n""What we’ve done is we’ve superimposed different corporate events on a time horizon. Every single bubble here is a representative of a live certificate. The color represents a specific asset type, and asset types are defined by the issuer, class of share and the round.""\n\nThe color-coded approach serves to underscore visually how blockchain technology is used underneath to create unique assets with corresponding terms and conditions through use of the Open Assets protocol.\n\n""We’re able to visually represent that and it’s readily available as it would be on the blockchain itself,"" Zinder said, adding:\n\n""The Equity Timeline is the most valuable thing we show, it’s able to visualize this information, and have clear representation of transactions and provenance.""\n\nWealth of details\n\nLinq also seeks to enable entrepreneurs to more easily gain insight to their business through an analysis of data related to their cap table that may otherwise be buried in spreadsheets.\n\nFor example, entrepreneurs can click on the interactive Equity Timeline to display an individual share certificate issued to an investor. Valid certificates and cancelled certificates both have a different visual display, the former showing information such as the asset’s ID, value per share and price.\n\nStartups using the platform can also view certificates by date of issuance, viewing the most or least recent new certificates, and by overall ownership, drilling down into which investors hold the most shares in the company with a single click.\n\nElsewhere, startups can evaluate a single investor’s ownership stake in the company. Investor-facing details like transaction IDs, in turn, provide transparency to those who want to track a startup’s progression while also serving to underscore the new technology on which the certificates are built.\n\n“We wanted something that was presentable that we could explain the functionality under the covers to some of our customers,” Zinder said.\n\nControlled experience\n\nIn interview, Zinder and Voss further hinted at some of the non-technical work that has so far gone into the creation of Nasdaq Linq, noting that the end product is more than design.\n\nRight now, Linq is being trialled with six startups and their investors. The limited number of participating firms is a reflection of the need for companies to be able to legally electronically represent the ownership of their shares and what Nasdaq described as the complex equity profiles of some startups that can make migrations lengthy.\n\nNasdaq said the legal process requires startups in some states to communicate with shareholders that they will proceed with issuing “uncertificated shares”, meaning shares with no physical certificate of ownership.\n\nAs for more wide-scale testing by current users, liquidity events remain at the discretion of the startups, who have the right – but not the obligation – to initiate a liquidity event for investors, which they could now do through Linq.\n\n""If you wanted to sell your shares, the issuer would have to have selected the liquidity program with us,"" Zinder explained. ""Once they have chosen to do so and defined it to us, we create the program, [investors] would log into a portal and [they] would be able to sell a certain percentage of those holding.""\n\nThe goal, according to Zinder and Voss, is to make this process easier so that such events, as well as the technology that can facilitate the activity, are more widely used.\n\n""We’re in the business of creating structured liquidity, and the less friction we can bring to this process, the customer has more liquidity events,"" he said.\n\nHowever, Zinder hinted that Nasdaq Linq could one day evolve into a product that more closely mirrors its public stock exchanges, concluding:\n\n”It’s not a 24/7 market, there’s no peer-to-peer transactions right now.”\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'On November 18, the first public information appeared about bitcoin exchange solution provider ANX International offering a full suite of blockchain solutions to make the use of bitcoin and blockchain easier. These solutions could promote bitcoin among companies within the traditional financial sector as they work in a similar way. Besides, companies are able to combine ANX’s solutions in a way that fits their business needs.\n\nWhat is most interesting about ANX’s suite of services is that it is completely modular. That means each company is able to choose only those services they really need without having to pay for all of them. It’s actually convenient as each company is able to adjust the suite to its own budget. Companies can choose between separate services or combine them into modules however they like. This could really come in handy.\n\nKen Lo, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of ANX INTERNATIONAL said:\n\n“There is a growing demand for Blockchain solutions from all types of firms from listed companies requiring their own blockchain-based loyalty programs, to companies wanting to manage their own digital assets exchange, without the burden of hiring a large team to maintain their operations.”\n\nThe suite of services includes Digital Assets Debit Card Solutions, Digital Assets White Label Solutions, Advisory Services and Foreign Exchange and Remittance services. Furthermore, ANX can run some core operation services on behalf of the customer, including customer service, payment processing, KYC compliance, AML monitoring, wallet management and more.\n\nANX provides solutions that make working with Blockchain similar to working with traditional financial assets. This could actually attract some traditional market players to embrace this innovative technology as its use becomes familiar to them. However, some experts weren’t too enthusiastic about ANX’s new suite of solutions. Larry Pantlin, the owner of Capstone Digital Mining, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“That is an interesting platform, it should do well. But I am already involved with an exchanger and I will not look to really change.”\n\nANX International is known for various innovations in the FinTech space. The company was first to offer a debit card for digital assets and a Vault mobile application for digital currencies. They also were the first to offer a multi-currency online digital assets exchange platforms, ANXBTC and ANXPro. That’s why ANX International was awarded the “Hong Kong’s Most Valuable Companies Award” earlier in the year.\n\nCoinTelegraph tried to reach out to the management of ANX International, but didn’t receive any comments at the time of publication.', 'Cartoonist Steve Streza posted a tweet claiming that an extortionist would release his “tax id, tax forms, SSN, [and] DOB” if he did not pay one bitcoin to a certain bitcoin wallet. The extortion is quite ham-handed – there’s no way to confirm payment, for example and it’s not clear how much of the data was actually leaked in a recent Patreon.\n\nA Patreon representative said that the authorities have been notified and that this is a “scam email.”\n\nEveryone whose data got leaked when @patreon got hacked is getting extortion emails for Bitcoin this morning. pic.twitter.com/xaww1GmZpw — Steve Streza (@SteveStreza) November 21, 2015\n\nThe emails went out this morning – I received one at 2am – and appears to marked as spam for most users. The email appears to have been sent through an AOL mail relay from the IP address 172.29.108.145. The return address is on a closed server with the domain name actaz.com.\n\nThe wallet, 1QAQTyhCzAfvp8uLpneBNamWTNRR1hx9Cp, is not at all unique and contains no bitcoins. While the danger of your “SSN” leaking is often quite real, it seems this is more an empty threat than a true attack.', 'As Bitcoin continues to gain credibility and traction, the one hurdle it hasn’t yet overcome is ease of use in the real world. In the rare event the merchant you’re doing business with accepts the virtual currency, there’s still the hassle of processing the payment (which doesn’t always go according to plan).\n\nFortunately, there’s now an alternative that makes the process as easy as swiping a debit card… because that’s exactly what you’ll be doing.\n\nThe Shift Card from Shift Financial is the first US-issued Bitcoin debit card. It links directly with your Coinbase or Dwolla account and because it’s backed by VISA, the card can be used to pay for goods and services online and in the real world at more than 38 million merchants around the globe. It also carries the same consumer protections as a standard VISA-based card and can be used at ATMs to withdrawal cash (albeit for a small fee).\n\nNaturally, there are a few limitations you’ll want to be aware of. At this time, it’s only being offered to residents of the following 24 states and territories: Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe daily spending / withdrawal limit is set at $1,000. If you’re looking to pull cash out of an ATM, the daily limit is set at $500 for Dwolla users and $200 for Coinbase-funded accounts.\n\nAs of now, Coinbase and Dwolla aren’t charging a transaction fee although Swift says both companies reserve the right to do so in the future. You’ll pay $10 up front for the plastic debit card and $10 to replace it should it become lost, stolen or damaged. There’s also a $2.50 domestic ATM transaction fee and a $3.50 fee internationally. Additionally, when shopping with the card internationally, you’ll be subject to a three percent transaction fee.\n\nShift said it plans to connect banks, airline miles and other alternative currency to the card in the future.', ""Decentralized exchanges have paralleled projects such as Colored Coins that allow for individual claims of ownership via the blockchain. But they've always edged more towards crypto enthusiasts or experts in terms of access because they only exist on 2.0 platforms such as Counterparty, NXT, and Bitshares. But Koji Higashi and his team at IndieSquare have produced a wallet capable of a native solution for these issues.\n\nThe Indie Approach\n\nTaking the initiative to combine the native features of a mobile crypto wallet and the Counterparty system is an accomplishment in itself, but IndieSquare has managed to go one step further by natively supporting Shapeshift.io features within the wallet app, or as Koji himself put it:\n\n“For a lot of users getting XCP is a big hurdle. That's one of the reasons we added support for ShapeShift so beginners can start experiencing Counterparty and the decentralized exchange more casually. Now we have integrated ShapeShift in our wallet, if you have some btc, you can purchase XCP, a native Counterparty token, easily and can issue your original token or start trading for other Counterparty tokens through XCP all within IndieSquare Wallet. So yes in a way, you can consider our wallet a bitcoin wallet with Counterparty features.”\n\nWhen asked why his team chose Counterparty over any other 2.0 platform, Koji gave this response:\n\n“I see. A very good question. So the big part about choosing Counterparty over say... Colored Coins, for example, is Counterparty already has a functional decentralized exchange where you can trade your own tokens with other people in a decentralized way. When we started working on the project, we have looked into BiShares, NXT, and others too as they have their own decentralized exchanges. Some of the drawbacks we saw were of course they are using their own blockchains and the stability of the chain was where we had some concerns about.”\n\nBitcoin or Broke\n\nWhile this enhanced functionality is certainly good promotion for Counterparty and mobile wallet devs, is it possible that the addition of shapeshift.io could open up vulnerabilities to the wallet app, thus hindering the extra security gained from the Bitcoin Blockchain? To get an expert view we contacted Ethereum Co-Founder and Founder of Kryptokit, Anthony Di Iorio for his input on the matter:\n\n“It shouldn't offer potential for breach of security if done properly. I'm not a fan of exchanges due to the complexities typically associated with setting up accounts and dealing with bid and ask orders. Alternatively, products such as ShapeShift that remove friction and simplify processes are beneficial to the cryptocurrency community and will appeal to new users.”\n\nShifting back to IndieSquare, Koji says they plan on releasing an update next week featuring an enhanced GUI to improve user friendliness and enhance the stability of the IndieSquare wallet app."", 'Si bien solo ha pasado poco más de un año desde que Brian Amstrong, CEO de Coinbase, equiparase la situación de Bitcoin con la del Internet del año 2001, parece que la evolución de este dinero, así como su popularización gracias, entre otros, a iniciativas como la de la alcaldesa de Barcelona –para llevarla a los comercios de la ciudad-, la instalación de cajeros específicos, etcétera; han sentado unas bases suficientes para que el crecimiento de este mercado siga adelante.\n\nEn este contexto, y a pesar de la falsa de consenso acerca de su consideración –como moneda o mercancía- y no obstante la misteriosa identidad de su creador (nominado al Nobel de Economía recientemente), la citada entidad, Coinbase, ha decidido lanzar la primera tarjeta de débito que permitirá a los usuarios pagar con la criptomoneda en cualquier lugar que acepte VISA. Eso sí, inicialmente solo estará disponible en algunos estados –un total de 24- de los EEUU.\n\nLas posibilidades de la tarjeta\n\nPara conseguirlo, la citada entidad (Coinbase) se ha aliado con la compañía de pagos Shift, una startup respaldada por Y Combinator que lleva probando este tipo de “dinero de plástico” desde hace más de un año en San Francisco. Un experimento que por fin se plasma de manera definitiva (más allá de la fase beta) en el alumbramiento que hoy protagoniza este artículo y que ha sido posible gracias a otra asociación: la de esta última firma con Visa.\n\n¿El resultado? La posibilidad de realizar transacciones con Bitcoin en 38 millones de establecimientos distintos –tanto físicos como digitales- dispersados a lo largo y ancho de la geografía norteamericana. Para obtenerla, los futuros compradores (usuarios de Coinbase) tan solo necesitarán conectase a su cuenta, añadir una dirección para recibirla (si es que anteriormente no lo habían hecho), y abonar 10 euros en concepto de gastos de emisión.\n\nLos titulares también estarán sujetos a algunas restricciones como la limitación de los gastos diarios a mil dólares, una cifra que cae hasta los 200 para la cantidad máxima que será posible retirar de un cajero. Esta acción llevará implícita una carga de entre 2,50 y 3 dólares; y la comisión alcanza el 3% para las transacciones internacionales.\n\nEn definitiva un paso importante que podría brindar nuevas oportunidades y agilizar el uso de esta moneda entre sus propietarios, cambiando las reglas del juego pues, hasta ahora y aunque su número crece continuadamente, tan solo empresas de la talla de PayPal, Microsoft, Reddit, Amazon y similares, aceptan pagos con esta moneda.

11/22/2015,"['Some of the most high-profile and well-funded startups looking at bitcoin are now pivoting their businesses and distancing themselves from the digital currency, less than two years after the hype around bitcoin blew up.\n\nCircle, BitPay, and Bitreserve — who between them have raised over $130 million — have all shifted away from bitcoin in one way or another in recent months.\n\nThat\'s after people failed to adopt it in the way entrepreneurs and venture capitalists had hoped.\n\nCircle — which makes a mobile bitcoin wallet and is backed by Goldman Sachs — recently began accepting US dollars and when I met the founders in London recently they told me that bitcoin was just the first use-case of their technology.\n\nThe future, according to CEO Jeremy Allaire, lies in using the technology that underpins technology, called the blockchain, to make sending any form of money as easy as sending an email. He didn\'t want to talk about bitcoin.\n\nAllaire says it\'s always been Circle\'s aim to go beyond bitcoin but that hasn\'t always been obvious to outsiders.\n\nMeanwhile Bitreserve, which began life as a bitcoin wallet and exchange, is even more explicit in its disowning of the digital currency. It recently re-branded and re-launched as Uphold, a more general online money service that, like Circle, is using blockchain technology to offer free currency transfers.\n\nUphold CEO Anthony Watson told me at the time of the relaunch: ""When we say bit, we don’t mean bitcoin, we never did. We meant bit as is bits and bytes and reserve is obviously holding the value. But people are confused, they think we’re just a bitcoin company and it makes sense as our first use case was bitcoin.""\n\nHe added: ""I don’t think bitcoin is going to be anywhere near as important as people say it is today. That’s a personal view. The blockchain is very transformative.""\n\nFinally BitPay has also moved away from its original business model of providing software to let businesses accept bitcoin payments and, like the others, is falling back on the blockchain to try and find another way to make it work.\n\nBitPay is building enterprise applications that use the blockchain, such as payroll software. The company recently laid off staff in a bid to ""reduce costs"" and ""better align with the pace of growth"" in the industry.\n\nAll three companies are struggling with the fact that bitcoin is not breaking into the mainstream in the way many had hoped. BitPay CEO Stephen Pair told me back in June: ""We keep adding merchants — we\'re up to over 60,000 now — but they\'re selling to the same pool of Bitcoin early adopters.""\n\nDespite recent spikes in price, using bitcoin to actually pay for things — and even just holding it as a speculative asset — remains a relatively niche activity.\n\n\'You\'re up against the adoption curve\'\n\n""You have to look at the broader picture: like with every new technology, whether it\'s the advent of the internet or email, there\'s an adoption curve,"" Jan Hammer told me. Hammer is a venture capitalist at Index Ventures and an investor in BitPay.\n\nHe says: ""I guess contrary to public expectation around bitcoin, and more broadly around the blockchain space, adoption has been slower [than expected].""\n\nHammer says BitPay is ""not in difficulty"" despite the layoffs and says the company has enough cash in the bank to survive for several years at least.\n\nWhile consumers have failed to pile into bitcoin as companies and investors hoped, there has been an explosion of interest among banks and other financial institutions in blockchain technology.\n\nA recent Economist cover story on blockchain technology declared: ""Bitcoin itself may never be more than a curiosity. However blockchains have a host of other uses because they meet the need for a trustworthy record, something vital for transactions of every sort.""\n\nThe blockchain uses a network of computers to verify each transaction, removing the need for a ""trusted middleman"" like a bank or clearing house to sit in between transactions.\n\nInstead, the blockchain uses the wisdom of the crowd to regulate the system. A certain percentage of users on the whole network have to sign off on any given transaction — which with the blockchain is actually cheaper, quicker, and easier than traditional transaction systems.\n\nHammer says: ""That\'s where it gets even more interesting. BitPay have created a set of products for payroll, settlement, intercompany transfer. BitPay is essentially not just a payment acceptance company — Stripe for bitcoin — it\'s a broader open source software company for bitcoin applications.\n\n""But, again, you\'re up against the adoption curve. All of the large banks have various innovation units and are either making small investments or experiments. But, it takes time. And it takes capital. Really the situation BitPay is in is a market adoption situation, which is applicable to the whole sector. You\'re waiting for a tipping point.""\n\n\'It\'s kind of like the tech equity bubble in the run up to 2001\'\n\nOne of the few high-profile and well-funded bitcoin businesses that is still fully behind the cryptocurrency is Coinbase, the San Francisco-based bitcoin wallet and exchange business. The company is still committed to its original business model and seeing between 2,000 and 5,000 new account openings a day, according to co-founder Fred Ehrsam.\n\nEhrsam told me: ""We\'ve had crazy periods where that will be 7,000 to 10,000 accounts a day. In terms of baseline growth in normal times, that\'s probably where it was at this time last year but it is growing. More people are dipping their toe in the water even if it\'s just in a small way.""\n\nEhrsam says Coinbase now has around 2.8 million accounts. On Friday the company launched the first ever bitcoin debit card in the US to let people easily use the digital currency to pay for things.\n\nHe says: ""If you look at the number of transactions on the bitcoin network a day, it\'s an up and to the right graph where it\'s roughly doubled in the last year. From that perspective bitcoin is doing pretty well, it\'s quite healthy.""\n\nBut even he admits bitcoin needs to become more than just a way to pay online for it to really become a breakout success.\n\n""At the end of the day, what\'s going to make bitcoin successful is more people making more interesting things, just like the beginning of the internet,"" he says.\n\n""I actually think the most convincing graph in bitcoin is if you go to GitHub and look at the number of repositories that reference bitcoin. It\'s a nice up and to the right graph.""\n\nAn example of an ""interesting thing"" Ehrsam hopes to see is a web browser linked to a bitcoin wallet. ""Let\'s say I go read Business Insider,"" he says, ""and I\'ve chosen to surf the premium internet, so every time I hit one of you pages I pay half a cent but I don\'t see any ads.""\n\nEhrsam puts at least part of the blame for company\'s being forced to pivot on overzealous investors, who piled into bitcoin too soon.\n\nHe says: ""If you invest in bitcoin thinking \'oh my god bitcoin is happening in the next 2 years and we should hire up and staff up really quick for that\' you\'re probably going to feel some pain. It\'s more of a linear growth over the next 5 years.""\n\n""If you look at investor interest in bitcoin, it\'s probably about as crazy as the price is. When it\'s hot it\'s hot, when it\'s not it\'s not. It\'s kind of like the tech equity bubble in the run up to 2001 — there\'s so much potential there and that\'s why investors get excited. But the highs can be really high and the lows can be really low.""\n\nBut he adds: ""I don\'t think just because a few companies haven\'t worked well, people are abandoning bitcoin. In fact I think the aggregated trends point the other way.""', ""Image: Battlecoin\n\nA developer on Bitcointalk has recreated the classic 2D multiplayer game Bomberman, but this time, with a twist: you can bet and play to win Bitcoin.\n\nBattlecoin pits you against other users in a multiplayer Bomberman clone. The idea behind Bomberman, which originally released in 1983, is simple: you're a man who plants bombs in a labyrinthine map, and your objective is to clear it of any enemies with those bombs by trapping them between walls, obstacles, and other environmental hazards.\n\nOn Battlecoin, players can choose rooms to duke it out, and up to four players can try to blow each other up at a time.

In 2013, fans released Bombermine, a game that played like a huge and frantic MMO-styled version of Bomberman, and it supported a huge, anarchic battlefield that could accommodate dozens of players.\n\nBattlecoin, on the other hand, is nothing like that: it makes sure players are on a level playing field, there's no progress system and only skill, not cheesing, will win you the magic internet money. Bomberman is already a classic, intense multiplayer game, but playing it for bitcoin must be a totally different kind of rush."", 'Simon Burns is the co-founder of Wealthcoin, a bitcoin investment services startup that recently graduated from California incubator Boost VC. Here, he shares insights from his ongoing journey to raise a seed round.\n\nOne of the most talked-about trends in the bitcoin ecosystem is that raising capital as an early-stage bitcoin startup is harder now than it was a year ago.\n\nSure, we\'re in the midst of bitcoin investment increasing dramatically year over year, but funding is down quarter over quarter, and there are other reasons VC dollars are hesitant to move into bitcoin startups.\n\nIn 2012, growth rates for the sector were still unclear, so it was considerably easier to ""sell the dream, not the data"". Now that data has come out around consumer wallet use and merchant adoption, some investors are shying away. It\'s been in this context that our team has set out to explore raising a seed round.\n\nI’ve been meeting with early-stage bitcoin founders in San Francisco and New York who\'ve accomplished what I\'m setting out to do. Founders ranged from enterprise bitcoin data-as-a-service providers with a few clients to consumer wallet companies with hundreds of thousands.\n\nDespite their differences, however, they offered much of the same advice. Here are the five things I’ve learned so far:\n\n1. Bitcoin VCs first, general VCs never\n\nThe most often repeated advice I’ve received from industry founders is this: Don’t talk to VCs who don\'t get bitcoin, ever.\n\nThis has come from enterprise- and consumer-focused founders alike, because almost every founder I spoke to had a story that goes something like this: They\'re asked to meet with a big partner at a name-brand VC fund. Next, the founder realizes they aren’t an investment target, they\'re just a guinea pig there to teach the investment team about bitcoin.\n\nThis is obviously less than ideal, and can become a major waste of time.\n\nWhile there\'s potential that a multibillion-dollar fund opens up to bitcoin just to invest in your startup, don’t count on it. Focus. The list of bitcoin VCs is public on Crunchbase, Mattermark and other sources.\n\nMy favorite list compiles all of these resources and is published by CoinDesk here.\n\n2. It will never be this easy, it will never be this hard\n\nThe founders I reached out to for advice span the spectrum, many have been in bitcoin for years and several others are new to the space.\n\nWhile the level of experience running a bitcoin startup varies, what doesn’t is the belief in a ""golden era"" that has past.\n\nI can\'t list off how many times I’ve heard ""but it was so much easier before X, you\'ll have a hard time now"". Replace X with ""Coinbase"", ""Mt Gox"" or ""bitcoin\'s price was $1,000"". There is always a moment in every space to look at when raising was easier, and there was always a time when it was harder.\n\nFew mention how difficult it was to raise at bitcoin\'s lows whether its price low or around the 2013 hard fork. Don’t let it distract you.\n\nMelanie Shapiro, CEO of Case Wallet, advised:\n\n""Have a simple message, we had \'We\'re the best hardware bitcoin wallet\'. Find yours.""\n\n3. East Coast loves private blockchains, West Coast loves consumer\n\nThis is a very wide generalization I admit, and I apologize to the outliers I’ve met who buck my assessment.\n\nThrough our first set of meetings with bitcoin VCs, it has become very clear that a divergence in venture investing focus is present along geographic lines. California-based VCs are thrilled by 21 Inc, the globalization of exchanges and the coming consumer revolution with hundreds of millions of wallets.\n\nBy comparison, East Coast VCs tend to be focused on Wall Street disintermediation through private blockchains and other enterprise uses of bitcoin as a distributed ledger.\n\nBoth are often taken to extremes and neither opinion is right.\n\nWhen on the East Coast, starting the conversation by covering bitcoin\'s use as an asset or currency is an appropriate move to judge the climate and make the foundational case on bitcoin. Do this before moving into a dialogue about how you\'re building your business around the technology.\n\n4. Be public early, consistently and never stop pitching\n\nThere are several benefits to being public about your product.\n\nWhat has become immediately clear during the fundraising process is that investors are much easier to pitch when the meetings open with ""I\'ve seen you on Twitter, people love the product and I can really see how this could scale"".\n\nMeetings typically start with 15 minutes of leveling the playing field and getting the VC on the same page in terms of how you see the world, your product’s wedge in the ecosystem and how you plan to grow.\n\nSaving that time and talking about more intricate details is better for the VC and better for you. The only way you can get to that point is by getting the product in people\'s hands and being public about what you’re building.\n\nMatt Schlicht, CEO of bitcoin social network Zapchain, said:\n\n""Get out there and never stop pitching. Don\'t ever pitch small, pitch the biggest vision of what you want to build.""\n\n5. Seek mentors\n\nFor fellow early-stage founders currently thinking about raising, take my advice, don’t jump in and talk to VCs.\n\nWhile I’m certainly no expert on raising a seed round, I’ve been thrilled to be able to work with some of the best founders in the bitcoin space to iterate on my pitch, get the right introductions and approach meetings as prepared as possible.\n\nTake the time to find three to five bitcoin company founders that you admire and send them thoughtful emails highlighting how much you appreciate what they’ve contributed to the ecosystem and how much you love their product.\n\nBuild your network through those founders.\n\nPracticing your pitch will be invaluable and the introductions to their investors will be worth 10 times what another introduction will be worth.\n\nSilhouette in tunnel image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Gox CEO Mark Karpeles in August, the government of Japan has been involved in various regulatory initiatives and investigations led by its law enforcement and national security agencies to restrict and limit the use of bitcoin and operations of cryptocurrency exchanges, startups and organizations in the country.\n\nInvolvement of the Financial Services Agency (FSA)\n\nRecently, the Financial Systems Council, a Japanese government organization responsible for overseeing banking, securities and exchange led a discussion joined by virtual currency exchange operators and bitcoin experts to consider their views and knowledge of bitcoin regulations and policies.\n\n“The FSA plans to introduce a regulatory mechanism as early as next year in response to the oversight vacuum exposed by the arrest of MtGox chief Mark Karpeles, who ran what was once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange.”\n\nTaro Aso, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance suggested the development of a regulatory bill for digital currencies including bitcoin, after the Japanese government completes its extensive research on Bitcoin, and Mt.

Moreover, the Japanese law enforcement and regulators plan to include a KYC policy in the document, which will require digital currency exchange operators and startups by law to record sensitive financial data and customer information.\n\nPotential of the Blockchain Technology\n\nAccording to a publication released by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the government recognizes the potential of Bitcoin’s blockchain technology, and its capability to transform and revolutionize existing traditional financial systems.\n\n“There was an opinion that blockchain will have enormous impact on the whole financial industry. It was said that blockchain technology is able to cut financial institutions’ cost to 1/10~1/100, and even fintech companies will be affected as a result,” read the report released by METI.\n\nThe Japanese government and regulators will consider the advantages of Bitcoin whilst drafting the regulatory bill for bitcoin exchanges and startups.\n\nReference\n\nMt.

Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Shachar Bar-On and Alexandra Poolos, producers.\n\nTech giants like Google, Facebook, and PayPal are all steadily rolling out new-fangled services to turn our smartphones into digital wallets -- replacing cash and checks. And it\'s been reported that Apple is working on a new payment option to let iPhone users send money directly to one another -- as easily as a text message.\n\nIf this all seems cutting edge, you may be surprised to learn there\'s one country that adopted mobile money years ago: Kenya. Here in the U.S., we can use smartphones to pay for things, but you typically need to be linked to a bank account or credit card. In Kenya, you don\'t need a bank account, you don\'t need a credit history, or very much money for that matter, making this country in East Africa a giant experimental laboratory defining the future of money.\n\nAt a bus station in Nairobi, buses were not only loaded with humans and cargo, but with cash. It used to be the only way for people working in the cities to get money to relatives back in their remote villages.\n\nBob Collymore: You give the cash to the bus driver, and then you say, ""When you get up to the village in Kakamega -- you will see someone at the crossroads. Give the money to him."" Guess what happens? The money evaporates.\n\nBob Collymore, the CEO of Kenya\'s largest cell phone provider, Safaricom, says his company sought to solve the problem. While a majority of Kenyans don\'t have a bank account, eight in 10 have access to a cell phone. So in 2007, Safaricom started offering a way to use that cell phone to send and receive cash. They call it M-PESA: m stands for ""mobile;"" ""pesa"" is money in Swahili.\n\nBob Collymore: It is often referred to as Kenya\'s alternative currency. But safer and more secure.\n\nLesley Stahl: You\'re texting money?\n\nBob Collymore: You are effectively texting money.\n\n""It is often referred to as Kenya\'s alternative currency. But safer and more secure.""\n\nLesley Stahl: How sophisticated is the phone that you use for M-PESA? Is it a smartphone?\n\nBob Collymore: No, it\'s the cheapest phone you can have. It was designed to work at the lowest level of technology.\n\nTo get this currency you go to an M-PESA kiosk. I give the agent 3,000 shillings -- about $30 in cash, and she converts it to virtual currency on my account.\n\nLesley Stahl: This is pretty easy. It\'s not like opening a bank account.\n\nThere are 85,000 agents like her across Kenya, creating a giant grid of human ATMs. For most this is a side business: so a pharmacy will sell M-PESA or a roadside spice shop; this barber will give you a shave and M-PESA. And, yes, you can even buy M-PESA here.\n\nBob Collymore: This is bankless banking.\n\nLesley Stahl: You don\'t need all those branches.\n\nBob Collymore: You don\'t need the branches.\n\nLesley Stahl: You don\'t need the ATMs, windows.\n\nBob Collymore: Absolutely not.\n\nScrolling down the options on the phone menu: you can send money, withdraw cash, pay a bill, or buy goods and services. And everyone uses a PIN number for security. But this is not like paying with your smartphone in the U.S., because our devices are linked to a bank account or credit card. Most Kenyans who use M-PESA don\'t have a bank account: the phone is it.\n\nLesley Stahl: That\'s it?\n\nBob Collymore: Now you can spend that 3,000 shillings on anything!\n\n[Daniel: I\'m Daniel. Welcome in.]\n\nShopping in the name of journalism - I like this.\n\nLesley Stahl: Can I pay you in M-PESA?\n\nDaniel: Yeah. Yeah. If you have it on the phone, just click the button and it goes.\n\nDaniel says Kenyans use it for everything from taxis to taxes.\n\nLesley Stahl: Is it safer for you and for me to use M-PESA?\n\nDaniel: Yeah, it\'s very safe.\n\nLesley Stahl: So do you use M-PESA to buy gas for the car?\n\nDaniel: Absolutely.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you pay all your bills with M-PESA?\n\nDaniel: Most of my bills. In fact, I rarely go to the bank nowadays.\n\nAt my destination, I tried using the phone money.\n\nLesley Stahl: So, Daniel, I\'ve never done this before. You\'re my very first M-PESA-\n\nDaniel: M-PESA customer--\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah.\n\nDaniel: OK. I\'ll assist where necessary.\n\nI typed in his mobile phone number, and the amount, the fare was 700 shillings, or $7.\n\nLesley Stahl: I\'m going to give you a thousand.\n\nDaniel: Oh, you\'re tipping with it. Thank you. God bless you, God bless you.\n\nLesley Stahl: I am. I am. Now, my PIN number.\n\nDaniel: Your PIN number, yeah yeah. You have that?\n\nLesley Stahl: I have that. I have.\n\nDaniel: Don\'t tell me that.\n\nLesley Stahl: No, I\'m not going to tell you.\n\nDaniel: That is for your...top secret.\n\nLesley Stahl: OK, so what do I do now?\n\nDaniel: Yeah. Now accept.\n\nLesley Stahl: Accept. OK.\n\nDaniel: Yeah, it just come. [Bing!]\n\nIt Worked!\n\nLesley Stahl: And now I\'m going to go spend some more money.\n\nAnji: Hello.\n\nLesley Stahl: Hello.\n\nAnji: How are you?\n\nLesley Stahl: I\'m great. I love these bags. How much is this one?\n\nNext, I buy a bag at Anji\'s curio shop with M-PESA.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you use it a lot in the store?\n\nAnji: Yeah. It\'s like having bank in your pocket.\n\nLesley Stahl: This is really easy. Now that\'s the second time I\'ve done it. I\'ve sent it.\n\nAnji: So wonderful!\n\nMy shopping ended with animals. No! I\'m not buying a giraffe, but you can use your phone to feed one.\n\nLesley Stahl: Am I giving you your dinner?\n\nWhile most transactions here are still in cash, M-PESA is used by over 19 million Kenyans or 90 percent of the adults -- from the well-heeled to the shoe shiner.\n\nThis technology was actually invented in England. But it is here in Kenya where innovation using M-PESA is taking off. We visited the iHub in Nairobi where local technology startups are inventing new ways to use mobile money.\n\nBob Collymore: And that mobile money system now acts as a terrific platform which a lot of other innovations has used as a springboard. And the new phrase around town is the Silicon Savannah.\n\nLesley Stahl: The Silicon Savannah?\n\nBob Collymore: Yeah, you have the Silicon Valley. And here it\'s the Silicon Savannah.\n\nToday with M-PESA, Kenyans can get their salaries sent directly to their cell phones and they can open a savings account and earn interest on their cell phones.\n\nWe met Mary Tonkei, a Maasai dairy farmer, who sells milk in M-PESA, pays her farmhands in M-PESA, and even got a loan to buy more cows in M-PESA.\n\nLesley Stahl: And just a couple of buttons and then you buy a new cow?\n\nMary Tonkei: Yes.\n\nActually, Mary was able to buy two new cows. And she got a much better rate than she would\'ve at a bank. Since the loan transaction was by phone, there was hardly any overhead.\n\nLesley Stahl: So it sounds like you\'re rapidly increasing your business.\n\nMary Tonkei: Yes, I\'m increasing my business.\n\nLesley Stahl: Business is good?\n\nMary Tonkei: Yes. It\'s good.\n\nWe were surprised at how much M-PESA has changed life for the poor. In a slum called Kanaani, south of Nairobi, we met a pig farmer, Stephen Wainaina Waweru. Before M-PESA, like most Kenyans, he had no electricity. He used to rely on a kerosene lamp for light:\n\nStephen Wainaina Waweru: It gives smokes here.\n\nIt emitted toxic fumes, could cause fires, and at $200 a year, kerosene wasn\'t cheap. But Stephen recently upgraded. He got solar power, and his first light bulb.\n\nLesley Stahl: Pretty good. It\'s lighting your room.\n\nStephen Wainaina Waweru: Yes. It lights the room all over.\n\nA company called M-KOPA Solar invented a way to provide inexpensive power to the slums using M-PESA.\n\nLesley Stahl: So where is the panel? Is it up here?\n\nStephen Wainaina Waweru: Yeah the panel is up there.\n\nLesley Stahl: Can you show it to me?\n\nStephen Wainaina Waweru: Yeah, I can. See, up. Lemme show you. Here it is!\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh my goodness, it\'s little.\n\nThe unit costs about $180 - less than kerosene but still out of Stephen\'s price range for a single purchase.\n\nBut he paid only $35 upfront and then 40 cents a day in M-PESA for a year. And he never has to leave the farm: all he does is click his phone, which activates a chip attached to the panel to turn it on.\n\nLesley Stahl: When you\'re finished paying it off--\n\nStephen Wainaina Waweru: It shall be mine. No more cost.\n\nThe solar panel has changed his life: he can tend to his pigs at night and his children can study indoors without breathing toxic kerosene fumes.\n\nPast efforts to introduce solar panels to the slums failed, in part, because they were stolen. This has been solved because the same chip that turns the panel on can also disable it.\n\nLesley Stahl: So if you don\'t pay up, they turn your lights off? They have the ability to turn ev-\n\nStephen Wainaina Waweru: These guys, they are excellent, Madame. Because once I don\'t pay, they don\'t have to come to me. The light just goes off!\n\nProviding drinking water is another way M-PESA is making a difference. Nearly a third of Kenyans do not have access to clean water, often relying on a river or water trucked in by donkey.\n\nBut the village of Njogu-ini got a new pump for its well. Villagers pay for clean water by texting M-PESA to this meter box -- which unlocks the pump. A villager can get a full month\'s worth of water for around $6.\n\nFor decades, development advocates implored banks to open branches in remote places, but it made little business sense: nearly half of Kenyans live on just $2 a day or less. Their financial transactions were just too small.\n\nBob Collymore: People don\'t buy a packet of cigarettes. They\'ll buy a cigarette. And so we need to be operating at that level. People don\'t buy a tube of toothpaste. If you go into the slums, you will see people buy a squeeze of toothpaste. And so you have to operate at that micro level.\n\nLesley Stahl: Now, how can that be viable for you as a company? It\'s like they have no money.\n\nBob Collymore: Because we believe that if we have now 19 million people transacting small amounts, making small amounts, it will add up. For each transaction, there is a small fee.\n\nLesley Stahl: How much money annually does Safaricom make from M-PESA in Kenya?\n\nBob Collymore: A quarter of a billion dollars.\n\nLesley Stahl: A quarter of a billion dollars?\n\nBob Collymore: Yeah. You don\'t have to be greedy to be successful.\n\nAnd you can be successful if you don\'t have to build thousands of branches, and pay thousands of tellers. Actually, when M-PESA started, Kenya\'s commercial banks implored the government to impose regulations to impede its development, but the government decided to take a hands-off approach, which is pretty unusual.\n\nBob Collymore: The most effective barrier for the success of mobile money around the world is the banking lobby. The banking lobby in most parts of the world is a very strong lobby. And banks have looked at what\'s happened in Kenya and have decided that they don\'t want to see that happening in their own countries.\n\nLesley Stahl: ""Not in my backyard,""\n\nBob Collymore: Exactly. The banking regulators have been persuaded that this is a threat to the banking industry.\n\nLesley Stahl: And it is, isn\'t it?\n\nBob Collymore: Well, you know, it\'s-- we live in a disruptive world. Uber came along and completely disrupted a number of things. Not just the taxi industry. Airbnb has come along and has disrupted. And so we are in a disruptive world. And we just need to--\n\nLesley Stahl: This is another one like that.\n\nBob Collymore: Yes, it is.\n\nLesley Stahl: It is.\n\nBob Collymore: It is.\n\nLesley Stahl: And so the banking industry isn\'t crazy.\n\nBob Collymore: No. No.\n\nM-PESA does have drawbacks: there\'re real concerns of criminal enterprises, scams and money laundering. And while it has been introduced in other countries like India, Egypt, Afghanistan and Romania - it has stubbornly refused to catch on as it has in Kenya. But the head of Safaricom thinks it\'s just a matter of time.\n\nBob Collymore: Because mobile phones are becoming so much more ubiquitous. Every adult in the world will have a mobile phone. And if you have that tool in your hands, imagine the things you can do.\n\nWe found among the Kenyans we met that M-PESA is igniting a real sense of patriotism. Just ask my cab driver Daniel.\n\nDaniel: It is one of the best things that has happened to our country. But that makes you feel proud! And now you feel you are Kenyan!\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, you think of Kenya you don\'t think of high-tech.\n\nDaniel: ""Innovation,"" you know?\n\nLesley Stahl: Yea.\n\nDaniel: That tells you now in the new world order anything is possible.', 'Bitcoin debit cards combine the best of both traditional and digital currency systems. The ease of swiping the card at a PoS, as it has been done for decades is now combined with the advanced digital currency of this generation. Bitcoin debit cards are one way of paying for goods and services at any place with a PoS machine irrespective of whether they accept digital currency or not. Coinbase now offers the same convenience to its customers with the newly launched Shift Card.\n\nThe new Shift bitcoin debit card was launched earlier on Friday by Coinbase, the leading bitcoin wallet and exchange service provider. Powered by Visa, the Shift bitcoin debit card is issued for US customers for a fee of $10. Once registered, the user will pay the required issuance fee with bitcoin and wait for the card to be delivered at their doorstep. Announcement of the latest product launch was reported by Coinbase on its official blog.\n\nAccording to the blogpost, Coinbase’s Shift Card is currently available for residents of 24 US States. Shift Card holders can use it just like any Visa debit card for both online and offline shopping. In addition, there won’t be any transaction charges on payments made using the new bitcoin debit card, which makes owning it even more exciting.\n\nCoinbase has launched Shift at the right time, during the holiday season. The company can expect a good response from those who would like to do their thanksgiving and holiday shopping directly with bitcoin instead of converting it into fiat currency over a bitcoin exchange or searching for outlets and websites that accept bitcoin.\n\nCoinbase is not the first company to introduce bitcoin debit cards, as there are many such instruments for bitcoin transaction already available . However, it will definitely be an added advantage for Coinbase customers.\n\nReference:\n\nIntroducing the Shift Card - Coinbase Blog', ""The examples are suddenly legion. Magic Leap, an augmented reality start-up, does not have a product on the market — but its lobbyists are promoting what the company may eventually do. Zenefits, an online benefits manager, is only two years old but is a member of two trade groups and has hired lobbyists and public relations strategists from the Obama administration. The chief executive of Handy, an on-demand household chores service, was recently in Washington on his third charm offensive with lawmakers.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is a sharp shift from past generations of tech companies, whose founders almost made it a point of pride to be distanced from, or above, politics and politicians. The antitrust troubles and headaches encountered by the older companies, including Microsoft and Google, play some role in the new thinking. The real change, though, came after Uber, the ride-hailing service, and Airbnb, the home-sharing site — two of the largest start-ups — started facing a barrage of questions about their operations.\n\n“For these new companies, the scale of innovation is so big and impactful they necessitate interacting with Washington writ large,” said Kenneth Baer, a former spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget who now advises Zenefits. “There are huge amounts of questions that society has to grapple with that didn’t exist before.”\n\nIt is difficult to say whether all the early lobbying is delivering results. So far, it has at least allowed Uber and Airbnb to continue growing. But the arrival of money from tech companies so early in their life cycles has definitely shaken up K Street, the capital’s thoroughfare for lobbyists.\n\nWhile total annual spending on lobbying has decreased slightly over the last five years, Internet companies have tripled their lobbying spending, to $47.5 million, during the same period. The industry now spends just a little less than the auto sector, according to the website OpenSecrets, which tracks lobbying and campaign finance.\n\nMuch of that money is still from the biggest tech companies; Google and Facebook, for example, spend millions each. But in a sign of how many new companies have come to town, one trade group, the Internet Association, has tripled its membership in the last three years. And a cottage industry has emerged of boutique Internet lobbying; crisis public relations; and niche trade associations for drones, digital health services and financial technology.\n\n“There are few industries like the Internet for which a rise in expenditures has been so dramatic,” said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org. “They are now engaged in a number of battles where they see opportunities to push legislation or fend against legislation.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe companies’ reach extends beyond Washington, too, with Uber and Airbnb placing lobbyists in hundreds of cities around the world. They are also putting their weight behind city and state lobbying efforts to overturn transportation, insurance and hospitality regulations that stand in their way.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor many start-ups, though, the immediate goal of lobbying is simply to create good will.\n\nCoinbase, a digital currency platform based in San Francisco, is one of a number of financial start-ups that have looked for help in Washington, knowing that finance is highly regulated. Last year, it hired John Collins, a former senior adviser to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, as employee No. 50.\n\nAs the head of government affairs for Coinbase, Mr. Collins regularly prepares talking points about the Bitcoin virtual wallet and meets with officials at the Treasury Department, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission and multiple congressional committees. Nearly every month, he escorts the company’s chief executive, Brian Armstrong, to meetings with government officials.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The underlying message is that any changes by regulators could cast painful ripples across the economy.\n\nThe Internet Association has taken that message straight to the congressional districts of key lawmakers. Last year, the group hosted Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a talking tour in downtown Kalamazoo to meet shop owners who had been primed to extol the virtues of the Internet.\n\nA jewelry store owner talked about her ability to connect inexpensively with suppliers online. Bridgett Blough, the owner of a food truck, talked about how she used the web to connect with customers, and warned that regulations would make it harder to run her business.\n\n“These businesses may not have been businesses without the Internet,” Mr. Upton said in a video on the trade group’s website. “We don’t need to regulate the Internet. It’s not a problem as long as it’s not regulated.”\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother selling tactic is welcoming government leaders to Silicon Valley, in the hope that whimsical office spaces and over-the-top employee perks will impress Washington bureaucrats. In just the last six months, Andreessen Horowitz, a leading investor in start-ups, has hosted Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, dozens of members of Congress, state attorneys general, and leaders from the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“For our start-ups, the advice we give is to get in early,” said Ted Ullyot, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, who is now at Andreessen Horowitz, “because the idea is not to stop regulation at a later date but to make sure they were aware and thoughtful about regulation early on.”\n\nPerhaps no issue has become more of a focal point than the working conditions at so-called on-demand companies — businesses like Uber and Alfred, which enable customers to request a service at the touch of a button.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, has been one of the more vocal lawmakers on the issue and has expressed concern that freelance workers lack benefits that ensure long-term economic stability. Senator Warner has said his main concern is about whether contract workers, some of whom work dozens of hours a week, will have basic protections without classic employment contracts.\n\nIn the last six months, his office in Washington has had a steady stream of visitors, including the chief executive of Airbnb, Brian Chesky; venture capitalists; and more than 100 lobbyists for start-ups.

At an annual summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Kuala Lumpur this weekend, China pledged to add another $10bn to its growing pool of infrastructure lending in Southeast Asia, while Japan vowed to halve the time it takes to approve infrastructure loans and take on more financial risk. China recently beat Japan to win a $5bn high-speed rail project in Indonesia on the back of no-strings financing that did not require the Indonesian government to act as guarantor. China and Japan are going head to head to secure other high-speed rail projects, including one linking Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, as well as bidding against each other for ports, power stations and other infrastructure deals across this fast-growing region. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, said in a speech that Japan’s official development assistance must keep pace with the speed of change in Asia. “We will drastically reduce the time needed for going through the procedures for ODA loans by as much as one and a half years compared with the current system,” he said, promising a significant reduction from the current average processing time of three years. “We will also revise the current practice of requiring without exception recipient governments’ payment guarantees.” A senior Japanese diplomat said that Tokyo had to become more “expeditious” in executing infrastructure projects in Asia, rather than simply highlighting that it has a better record than China in terms of quality, safety and social and environmental protection. Beijing also pledged to accelerate and deepen its economic co-operation in Southeast Asia with Premier Li Keqiang promising $10bn of new loans for infrastructure as well as an increase in grants to the region’s less developed nations. While China clashes at sea with Japan and some Southeast Asian nations including Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, Beijing and its rivals are competing to build alternative spheres of economic influence. Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan and the US were among 12 nations that recently signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact that excludes China and is designed to promote a rules-based trading and investment system in the region. Beijing has backed a rival trade deal with Southeast Asia, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, that has fewer requirements for economic liberalisation. But hopes to conclude RCEP by the end of the year received a blow on Sunday when Malaysia, which is chairing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said that negotiations would not be concluded until next year because of the “challenges faced”. Xi Jinping, China’s president, made an implicit criticism of the TPP on Wednesday when he warned at another regional forum in Manila that “with various new regional free trade frameworks cropping up, fragmentation is becoming a concern”. Despite Beijing’s concerns, since the TPP was agreed last month other Southeast Asian nations including Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand have said they are interested in joining. “With the TPP now finally coming to fruition, it increasingly seems like it is the best game in town in terms of driving economic development,” said a minister from one of the Southeast Asian nations keen to sign up. “But given the state of our economy and the fact that the existing TPP participants must ratify the deal first, it will take several years before we can join.” Barack Obama, US president, welcomed the new interest in the TPP from Southeast Asian nations, claiming that the pact would “write the rules for trade in the Asia Pacific for decades to come”, promoting the resolution of economic disputes through dialogue rather than “bullying or coercion”.', 'Robin Wigglesworth, US markets editor NOVEMBER 22, 2015 63 Hedge funds and asset managers are scrambling to poach talent from Silicon Valley and attract computer scientists fresh from college to capitalise on the investment industry’s hottest frontier. So-called quantitative financiers, or quants, have for years come up with innovative, complex ways to analyse and trade on company earnings or economic releases. But thanks to huge gains in computing power and algorithmic research, they are now pushing into “unstructured data” such as internet searches, social media, satellite images, earnings calls or weather patterns to find market signals and overlooked trading opportunities. To do so they need to deploy innovative, increasingly powerful quasi-artificial intelligence algorithms, ratcheting up demand for computer scientists to do coding that is beyond mathematicians and physicists. “Traders used to be first-class citizens of the financial world, but that’s not true any more. Technologists are the priority now,” says Jared Butler, a headhunter at Selby Jennings. “It’s easier to hire a computer scientist and teach them the financial world than the other way around.” Two Sigma, a $28bn hedge fund, and BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, earlier this year snapped up two former Google engineers, underscoring the mounting demand for computer scientists to help gain a digital edge in the cut-throat money management industry. Two Sigma is one of the hedge fund industry’s fastest-growing companies, and is led by computer scientist David Siegel and mathematician John Overdeck. They recently hired Alfred Spector, formerly vice-president of research and special initiatives at Google, as chief scientist. BlackRock hired Bill MacCartney, a former Google engineer, this year as a managing director in its “scientific-active equity” team, where he will bolster the asset manager’s efforts to mine data sets for lucrative investment opportunities. In late 2012, David Ferrucci, head of IBM’s Watson supercomputer, joined Bridgewater Associates to build the $168bn hedge fund’s artificial intelligence arm. “Quants have always been in demand, but the structure of the demand has changed over the past two years,” said Michael Karp, chief executive of Options Group, a recruiter. “The world is becoming more technologically demanding, and a lot of firms now need computer scientists that can code algorithms.” Traders used to be first class citizens of the financial world, but that’s not true any more. Technologists are the priority now Jared Butler at Selby Jennings The problem confronting quant money managers — and banks rushing to revamp and build their technological capabilities — is that the financial industry is less attractive than Silicon Valley’s biggest companies or hottest upstarts, especially in recent years. Dennis Ruhl, head of JPMorgan Asset Management’s quantitative behavioural finance unit, said: “We absolutely need more computer scientists, but it’s a challenge as the financial industry has suffered an image crisis in recent years.” Many asset managers are, as a result, establishing closer ties with universities so they can tap directly into the pipeline of talent, or setting up contests such as the Man AHL Coder Prize or the WorldQuant Challenge to unearth self-taught programming talent. Mr Butler at Selby Jennings concedes that attracting top tech talent is a big obstacle for the finance industry, but said the potential salary and intellectual challenges of a career at the more innovative trading firms or hedge funds is still an attraction to many computer scientists. “It’s a constant thorn in my side. Whenever I find a red hot programmer they’ll have a job offer from Google, Uber or somewhere else. But there is an allure in building a successful trading strategy as well.”']"
11/23/2015,"['In the aftermath of the Paris attack on November 13, the European Union (EU) is looking to crack down on bitcoin with the hope of preventing the financing of future attacks. Regulators and advocacy groups agree, though, that kneejerk regulation is not what is needed; rather, the need is thoughtful regulation and an increase in education.\n\n“There’s nothing wrong with Bitcoin, it just means it’s another part of our financial system,” said Dana Syracuse, managing director and a member in the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Regulatory Compliance Practice at K2 Intelligence, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nK2 Intelligence is an investigative, compliance, and cyber defense services firm. Prior to joining K2 Intelligence, he worked in the New York State Department of Financial Services and was the author of BitLicense.\n\n“As time goes on, Bitcoin’s place is going to grow,"" Syracuse said. ""One of the things that I talk about is, if you look at the story of bitcoin and the kind of enforcement and prosecutorial action, it shows the evolution and growth of the space.”\n\n“Bitcoin is not the problem, and further restrictions on it are not the solution. Criminals and terrorists are using all sorts of technology to try to hide their activities over the Internet, but those who turn to bitcoin as part of that effort are making a big mistake,” said Jason Weinstein, director of the Blockchain Alliance, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nJennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) explained at a Digital Currency Summit held by the Department of Justice that $4 million worth of bitcoin is circulated through regulated entities. Outside the regulated entities, $10 million worth of bitcoin is circulated. At the event, Calvery made clear that her agency didn’t regulate bitcoin; instead, it regulated the financial institutions.\n\nPerianne Boring, the founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, echoed those thoughts. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine , she said, “Virtual currency is already highly regulated, especially within the G7 nations. Despite the high degree of regulation, the majority of bitcoin transactions are taking place outside regulated entities, which are mostly outside the G7 nations.”\n\n“Increasing regulation within the G7 would only increase burdens on the companies that are working hard to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and related regulations and could potentially push more bitcoin into the unregulated entities,” Boring said.\n\n“What is needed is rolling out regulations in a rational, thoughtful, and constructive way,” said Syracuse. “When you regulate in the face of a crisis, there is often a temptation to overcorrect, which you want to guard against. We have to be careful on the back end of a travesty like this not to overregulate.”\n\nRegulation is not the problem; it is education\n\nFundamentally, it is education that is problem, not regulation. Once regulators have sufficient education, they tend to come to the same conclusion that many others do: Bitcoin is not the problem.\n\n“I’m a little skeptical of what new regulation would exist that would help,” said Vincent D’Agostino, associate managing director in the U.S. Cyber Investigations and Incident Response practice at K2 Intelligence, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nBefore joining K2 Intelligence, he was the FBI’s trial agent for Silk Road 1 and the case agent for Silk Road 2.\n\n“If more people on the counter-terrorism side took the time to educate themselves on blockchain technology, so when they did a raid and the first thing they did was take that seized data and identify the public keys so they could start to make links,"" he said. ""They could go, we didn’t know who this linked to, but now we know everything they’ve done. It attaches that person to those wallet files.""\n\n“Every financial innovation, every new form of value transfer brings with it its own unique challenges,"" Syracuse explained. ""Bitcoin is not unique in that. Terrorism is a major concern of major financial systems. The use of bitcoin in those kinds of activities is no different than what goes on in the traditional banking system. Education in this space is key, and that is what will lead to rational and productive regulation and communication between the regulators.”\n\nAccording to a report by the U.K. Treasury, “there is little evidence to indicate that the use of digital currencies has been adopted by criminals involved in terrorist financing, whether as a means by which to raise funds (crowd funding etc.), to pay for infrastructure (e.g. server rental), or to transfer funds.”\n\nThe report also explains, “The money laundering risk associated with digital currencies is low, though if the use of digital currencies was to become more prevalent in the U.K. this risk could rise.”\n\nThat is because bitcoin is actually an inefficient method for transferring value for illicit purposes since it is a completely public ledger.\n\n“It would be far easier to launder euros or dollars than it would be to launder a decentralized, blockchain-based currency like bitcoin,” said David Long, the principal and senior consultant at the Northern California Fraud Prevention Solutions, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine . “Though from an initial investigative standpoint, bitcoin might present more of a challenge due to the necessity of uncovering who is actually responsible for a given transaction or transactions. However, once the actor\'s identity is uncovered, the blockchain makes it possible to uncover most, if not all, of a person\'s transactions. This capability is without parallel when the subject is dealing in euros or dollars.”\n\nWeinstein further confirmed that point, saying, “Reports of bitcoin’s anonymity are greatly exaggerated. Criminals or terrorists who use bitcoin to facilitate their activities are foolish, because bitcoin is traceable in a way that other payment methods, including cash, are not.”\n\nBitcoin is pseudonymous in that all that is shown is on the public ledger is a public address. However, once a law enforcement officer is able to identify who owns that public address, he would then be able to track every transaction that went to and from that address. If the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) were to transfer bitcoin, and a law enforcement officer knew that it was their address, he could track each transaction and start building a case accordingly.\n\nCash, on the other hand, is completely anonymous. An individual in ISIL could take envelopes of cash across state borders and easily pay for the necessary assets for committing an act of terror. A law enforcement official would have no way of verifying how the funds were used. Long gave an example where a trade-based money-laundering scheme using dollars or euros conducted by professionals could be virtually undetectable.\n\nThe problem with this is that more people don’t realize it.\n\n“They [law enforcement] are not using existing bitcoin investigative techniques as much as they should,” D’Agostino said. “There is no doubt that when done correctly, using bitcoin can be extremely anonymous but as long as there are human beings involved in the transfer of bitcoin, the creation and maintenance of those wallets, and the movement of that digital currency, they are going to make a mistake at some point. Those mistakes are typically catastrophic from an anonymity perspective. If it’s a group of people within a terror network moving a high volume of bitcoin both directions, they’re going to make a mistake eventually. They’ll forget to encrypt their wallets or leave their abandoned keys on a piece of discarded or seized digital device. That’ll give you an opening, a crack in the door, to give law enforcement you a chance to exploit that information and connect the subject with a set of address and transactions. So what may have started as completely anonymous set of transactions now has ends up having the opposite desired affect”\n\nThe key is educating law enforcement and national security authorities about how the technology works, so they can enhance their ability to use it to follow the money and protect public safety, Weinstein said. ""We need more education, not more regulation.”\n\nJerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, explained in a recent blog post why more education is needed: “Overreaction by jittery policymakers in the wake of a crisis is always a concern, which is why education before such crises is so important. We’ve been engaged in just such education for over a year, and we’re hopeful policymakers understand that an overreaction would be counterproductive, whatever the headlines may say.""\n\nBrito echoed the point made clear by Boring and Weinstein: ""The fact is that regulators understand that digital currencies do not pose the greatest risk for terrorist financing, and to the extent digital currencies pose some risk, a \'crack down\' on their use would likely only serve to drive out legitimate players, which in turn would only serve to limit governments’ visibility into illicit uses.”\n\nBitcoin financial institutions already follow many of the same money transmitter laws that traditional institutions have to follow. Creating further regulation over them will not help prevent further acts of terrorism. Instead, educating law enforcement on the ways in which it can use the blockchain to seek and capture terrorists is one way to prevent future catastrophes.\n\nPhoto StockMonkeys.com / Flickr(CC)\n\nJacob Donnelly is a freelance journalist and a consultant in the bitcoin/blockchain space. He runs a weekly digital currency and blockchain newsletter called Crypto Brief.', 'Coinbase, one of the largest Bitcoin wallet providers, debuted a Visa-branded Bitcoin debit card Friday. The card will be the first widely-available Bitcoin debit card in the US, according to Wired. Users will be able to make fee-less Bitcoin payments at any US retailer that accepts Visa debit, and will only be charged fees if they use the card at an ATM or to make purchases internationally, according to Tech Crunch.\n\nCoinbase introduced the debit card with the ultimate goal of making Bitcoin more prevalent in the US.\n\nAmericans are becoming more aware of Bitcoin, but use isn\'t changing much. Coinbase has 2.8 million Bitcoin wallets — an all time high — but only 20% are used to make payments. The vast majority of these wallets are instead used for speculative trading, treating Bitcoin as a commodity. Even the majority of millennials, the generation most open to using new technology, haven\'t used the currency and don\'t intend to in the near future.\n\nThat puts Bitcoin in a bind. Because a relatively low number of users make payments with the cryptocurrency, very few established merchants accept it directly — the total global Bitcoin volume represented just 0.015% of US retail sales in 2014. And lack of merchant acceptance makes it more challenging for customers to develop habitual use.\n\nThat\'s where Coinbase believes its debit product can help. Because the card is accepted anywhere that takes Visa debit, consumers now have an easy way to pay with Bitcoin at almost any merchant in the country, which could lead to more widespread use. This might give consumers a reason to expect direct Bitcoin payment options from retailers, and give merchants a reason to add them.\n\nThis story was originally sent to professionals just like you in this morning\'s PAYMENTS INSIDER Newsletter by BI Intelligence, a subscription research service from Business Insider. Get 14 days risk free »\n\nIf the card is successful, it could be another technology for card networks to worry about. Bitcoin payments are currently verified on the blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, and carry no fee. Offering direct bitcoin payments might be appealing for merchants because it allows them to avoid paying card network interchange fees.\n\nInterested in getting in-depth analysis on this topic and others like it?

BTCC’s mining pool is one of the largest in the world, with approximately 13 percent of the global bitcoin network’s hashing power.\n\nBlockPriority prioritizes all BTCC’s customers’ transactions, including those who pay zero transaction fees. Customers who pay lower transaction fees on other exchanges or wallet services may have to wait before the bitcoin network confirms their transactions.\n\nBy prioritizing all bitcoin transactions to and from BTCC accounts regardless of transaction-fee level, Block Priority also reduces the risk of double-spend attacks on BTCC accounts. Double-spend attacks happen when someone attempts to use bitcoin for two or more payments by taking advantage of the lag between when a bitcoin transaction happens and when the bitcoin network confirms it.\n\n“BlockPriority is the latest addition to our proprietary blockchain technology services, following the Forever blockchain engraving service that we launched in June,” said BTCC’s chief technology officer Mikael Wang. “BlockPriority demonstrates our commitment to providing our customers and the wider bitcoin community with the best and most convenient experience possible.”\n\nAbout BTCC\n\nBTCC was originally founded as BTCChina in 2011. It is the longest-running and one of the largest bitcoin exchanges worldwide. BTCC plays a leading role in every segment of the bitcoin ecosystem, offering a digital currency exchange, a mining pool, payment processing, consumer wallets, and blockchain engraving. The diverse products and services BTCC offers allow its customers to engage in all aspects of the digital currency spectrum in one integrated platform.\n\nHeadquartered in Shanghai, BTCC serves a global customer base and has become an industry leader for security, risk mitigation, credibility, and technological innovation. BTCC’s mission is to provide the world with the most convenient and trustworthy digital currency services.

I want to assure everyone that the claims in this email are false, and we are already working with federal law enforcement.\n\n""Do not reply to the email—it is a scam. The tax forms we store are securely encrypted with RSA 2048-bit encryption, and we do not store full credit card numbers. If you receive this email I suggest you flag it as spam and ignore any further emails. Do not reply.""\n\nAdditionally, TechCrunch\'s John Biggs — a Patreon user himself — says he received the email. The bitcoin address that the scammer asks for ransoms to be paid for is apparently not unique (despite what the email claims), and has been sent almost nothing. As of press time, it had received just 0.0001312 bitcoin — around $0.04, or £0.03.\n\nAfter Patreon was hacked the data was leaked publicly online and subsequently verified by Troy Hunt, a security researcher who specializes in data breaches. As such, even if a user paid a ransom, there would be no guarantee that another, unconnected scammer didn\'t try to extort them again at a later data.\n\nSo who\'s behind this (failing) extortion attempt? According to CSO Online, it\'s the same people who attempted to extort the victims of the Ashley Madison hack. After the extra-marital affairs dating website was hacked earlier this year, customers received blackmail demands threatening to out them unless they paid a bitcoin bounty.\n\nCSO Online says a group calling themselves DD4BC was responsible for the Ashley Madison extortion emails, and that the same group is at it again now.', ""The revolution will not be televised.

But even with ISIS taking in supposed millions of dollars in Bitcoin, does it really amount to that much of its overall funding?\n\nGhost Security Group, an anti-terrorism hacker collective, says no. Tracking ISIS online since January’s attack on the Charlie Hebdo paper, the group says that while Bitcoin does amount for some of ISIS’ bankroll, the Islamic State is still raising most of its capital the old-fashioned way through “kidnapping, extortion, oil sales, and in some cases, organ harvesting.” We spoke to a Ghost Security Group member, who agreed to an email Q&A on the condition of anonymity, about how private hackers are tracking the new wave of terrorists online.\n\nHow long has Ghost Security Group been tracking ISIS Bitcoin accounts? Did the Paris attacks cause you to step up your engagement?\n\nThe ISIS Bitcoin address was found back in September, 2015, although we weren’t specially focusing on finding ISIS Bitcoin addresses. We are taking on ISIS online since the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and that address was found while we focused on tracking terrorism in the Deep Web.\n\nThe Paris attacks did of course deeply shock us as well as motivate us for the future. It has got all of us determined to continue the fight we’ve put up back in February.\n\nAnd we’d like to share our most sincere condolences with all friends and family members of the victims.\n\nHave you found ISIS Bitcoin accounts more via being tipped to them or by tracking online usage? If by tracking, can you give a general understanding of how to do that so a layman might understand?\n\nWe found that Bitcoin address by infiltrating and by closely following ISIS’ activity online in their communication networks. That includes infiltrators accounts, spying on them, large data analyst and handling. Basically, we act as an activist online to get as much data as possible.\n\nSince the report of the ISIS wallet with the $3 million in Bitcoin was released have you found any other large caches? Are these funds you can freeze yourself through coordinated efforts or do you turn them over to authorities?\n\nSince the report of the 3M$ address — which was found by us BUT analyzed and treated by Lewis Sanders IV from dw.com (they did all the work to identify, track, and investigate this address, and they found the 3 million in it) - we found yet another Bitcoin address regarding the “funding of the islamic struggle,” which was in fact a scam which led to silk roads and drugs activity. It was traced and exposed by us.\n\nThose informations are forwarded to U.S. government through Mr. Michael Smith\n\nHow long do you believe ISIS has been actively pursuing Bitcoin as a source of funding? Do they favor any other form of cryptocurrency?\n\nWe do believe that ISIS recently — when I mean recently, I mean in the three or four last months — started to use Deep Web and cryptocurrency as a tool for their funding, recruitment, and propaganda. We do not know if they are using any other for of it although we believe they won’t since Bitcoin is by far the “biggest” — or current — one. We will still call for other cryptocurrency data in the future.\n\nHas Ghost Security Group done this all alone or have you worked with any other groups like Anonymous?\n\nWe are working with many parters as The French “Katiba Des Narvalos,” a counter-terrorism made out of French volunteers (just as us), whose goal is to fight ISIS online by parody and counter-propaganda efforts. We also cooperate with the Peshmerga Cyber Terrorism Unit, but our main partner in this fight is Controlling Section, more than a partner it is our half, a team made of volunteer social networks experts more focused on countering ISIS’s presence on social networks, and analyzing threat and informational data about online and ground terrorism. That cooperation is now up for several months, and we put an important point on how this group shall get as much credit as we get.\n\nWe decided to separate from Anonymous multiple month ago, because we believe that collective isn’t made for counter terrorism as they can be counterproductive, suspending important Twitter accounts in terms of intelligence data. This hacktivist movement also generally represent illegal activities, and that’s why we’re separated from it. (More info in our press release.)\n\nWhat steps — assuming you can reveal them — do you take to ensure you are going after accounts legitimately connected to terrorist groups?\n\nWe are making sure to go after only accounts related with terrorist groups by analyzing their tweets, pictures, and connections. Everyday we are making sure we aren’t going after any innocent users by analyzing the targets, although they usually talk loud about their motivations and affiliations\n\nThe European Union wants to crack down on Bitcoin regulations in the wake of the Paris attacks. Are there any security measures you think would be wise to implement?\n\nWe’ve seen that cryptocurrency is only accountable for a very small percentage of their net income, in a lot of cases, EU is blowing out of proportions that “problem.” We are strong advocates of cryptocurrencies; however if the Islamic State is using cryptocurrencies to some degree, it is not fault of the Bitcoin community. ISIS also uses Toyota vehicles, American weapons, social media, and foreign currencies — none are to blame for their products and services they use as they rely heavily on friendly nation technology."", 'The European Union\'s top law enforcement agency, Europol, is seeking an intern with the skills to trace bitcoin transactions, according to a job posting on its website.\n\nThe posting seeks applicants for the \'Open Sources Collection and Analysis\' project which will support Europol\'s Cyber Intelligence Team.\n\nApplicants should have skills in analysing bitcoin transactions and an interest in blockchain technologies in general.

Larry Pantling, owner of Capstone Digital Mining, offered me an opportunity to buy a beginner package for mining onecoin, swiscoin or ilcoin. He also gave me some information about the so-called “promotion programs” to involve other people into mining. In other words, I was offered to join an MLM business.\n\nFrankly speaking, I’m not new at this; I know how MLM works. But in traditional schemes you at least get some goods in exchange for your money. But what about cryptocurrency MLM? I still don’t get all the mechanisms of crypto operations, but I really felt like I was asked to pay just for thin air. To tell the truth, I never had the idea to join any kind of crypto MLM, but I decided to conduct some research with the help of Nathan Wosnack, CEO of Ubitquity. And I’ve had some interesting results.\n\nI decided to get some information about the companies I’ve been offered to join – OneCoin, Swiscoin and Ilgamos. The first thing I found out about OneCoin was that it was exposed as a Ponzi scheme by CoinTelegraph earlier this year. In addition, I found further information concluding OneCoin is not trustworthy. For example, behindmlm.com stated:\n\n“There is no information on the OneCoin website indicating who owns or runs the business. The OneCoin website does have an “about” section, however no information about the company’s ownership structure is revealed”.\n\nAlso, the company does not operate in the USA. It would be turned down by the SEC in no time, failing to comply with regulations. OneCoin has no retailable products or services. Furthermore, onecoin is not on the list of all available cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. Having studied all information on OneCoin, Nathan Wosnack told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“OneCoin is an interesting one that has been floating around all year. I am personally surprised that it is still in the wild, as it were. As you reported in the past via William Suberg, there has been considerable evidence pointing to OneCoin's scheme”.\n\nBy the way, swiscoin and ilcoin are not on CoinMarketCap’s list either. In fact, all information about SwisCoin is even more vague and uncertain. Again, behindmlm.com states:\n\n“There is no information on the SwisCoin website indicating who owns or runs the business. The SwisCoin domain “swiscoin.com” was registered on the 15th of September 2015, with Kathrine Harbor listed as the owner. An address in Dublin, Ireland is also provided. Further research reveals this address belongs to Regus, who sells virtual office space. As such it would appear SwisCoin have no actual physical presence in Ireland. As for Kathrine Harbor, outside of the SwisCoin domain registration, her name doesn’t appear linked to SwisCoin. I’m flagging this as highly suspicious, with there being a big question mark as to whether or not Harbor actually exists.”\n\nThis doesn’t sound very good, does it? Nevertheless, Larry Pantling commented:\n\n“I have more than two hundred people signed under me in a month with swiscoin. It is a way to make money without buying the cloud and equipment.”\n\nSeems promising, at least for Larry. But what raised a red flag for me is that company management refused to speak to me. That is odd, isn’t it? I mean, if you have nothing to hide you would probably be willing to talk to press to promote your company or product. Then, maybe, they do have something to hide. Nathan Wosnack commented on Swiscoin, saying:""]"

This new option promises to simplify Bitcoin to fiat exchanges and withdrawals.\n\nWhile similar money transfers usually, take about 3 or even 14 days for international transfers Coinizy new option promises to deliver money to users PayPal e-wallet in 24 hours.\n\nYannick Losbar, Founder and CEO at Coinizy, explained in the official press release via email:\n\n""Up until now, 99% of the Bitcoin exchanges only offered the good old wire transfer, when one wanted to withdraw the funds he obtained by converting some bitcoins. This excludes de facto the 2.5bn unbanked people, as well as most of the teenagers, which is very unfortunate since this part of the population could represent the next potential wave of Bitcoin adopters.""\n\nBesides the new Bitcoin to PayPal exchange option Coinizy, Vancouver-based financial services platform, currently offers various withdrawal methods including cryptocurrency exchanges to Okpay e-wallet, Western Union cash delivery and SWIFT bank transfers. The platform also offers virtual and plastic prepaid Bitcoin debit cards.\n\nGilles Mendy, Business developer at Transactel Europe, who was in charge of the Coinizy cards program ordering process, commented to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Using bitcoin in our daily routine is a key stake for numerous companies, and we truly think that Coinizy has the right answer to make it possible. Contrary to the competition’s offers, Coinizy is focused on the exchange between dollars and bitcoin, we like this specialization and to think about consumer’s needs. We have good expertise in card management and this partnership with Coinizy was an interesting opportunity to associate our know-how.”\n\nCoinizy provides only fiat withdrawals, it don’t accept fiat as a deposit and doesn’t provide Bitcoin deposits – bitcoins are immediately sold during the deposit process and exchanged to fiat. All deposits are handled by Coinizy’s partner and bitcoin processor – Snapcard. Moreover, as PayPal is not very open to bitcoin activities, Coinizy doesn’t work directly with them but rely on a financial institution based in Hong Kong to process PayPal transactions on behalf of Coinzy\n\n“Virvow has been offering paypal deposits for years, as well as bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. The main difference with Coinizy being that they directly process all orders without intermediaries, but it definitely carries more risk exposure seen the very fragile stance PayPal has on this matter. I can recall, for example, the several times Virwox halted PayPal deposits and/or withdrawals,” explained Yannick Losbar. “There’s also an interesting alternative market for BTC to PayPal trades, as exposed during the internal market study we conducted a few months ago. Up to 30% of the exchanges made on the “Currency Exchange” section of the most popular bitcoin forum, bitcointalk.org, at the time of the study involved BTC to PayPal transactions.”\n\nYou can find out more at www.coinizy.com.', 'Coinbase has introduced the first U.S.-issued bitcoin debit card, the Shift Card, in partnership with Shift Payments. The Shift Card is a Visa debit card that currently allows Coinbase users in 24 states to spend bitcoin both online and at physical points of sale at more than 38 million merchants worldwide.\n\n“Merchant adoption has come a long way over the past few years, but it’s still difficult for people to make regular purchases with bitcoin,” notes the Coinbase announcement. “Buying gas at a local gas station or groceries at a neighborhood grocery store with bitcoin has not been possible in most cities in the U.S. Thanks to Shift Payments, it’s now possible to use bitcoin to buy gas, groceries, and much more. With the Shift Card, you can now spend bitcoin anywhere in the world that Visa is accepted.”\n\nCoinbase users living in the states where the service is available can order a Shift debit card for $10 and link it to a Coinbase wallet. When the Shift debit card is used to make a purchase, the equivalent value of bitcoin (based on the current spot price of bitcoin on Coinbase) is debited from the user’s Coinbase bitcoin wallet. For certain transactions, such as gas purchases and dinner bills, Shift will debit more than the purchase amount, and refund the remainder to the user when the final payment amount is settled.\n\nThere are no annual fees, no bitcoin-to-dollar conversion fees, and no domestic transaction fees. Coinbase says there are no domestic transaction fees “for a limited time,” which seems to indicate that domestic transaction fees could be added in the future. There is a $2.50 ATM fee and a 3 percent international transaction fee. The daily ATM withdrawal limit is $200, and the default daily spending limit is $1,000.\n\nThe card isn’t available to users in New York, Florida, and many other states. Coinbase and Shift Payments say that they are working through legal and regulatory matters in the states where the Shift Card is not yet available.\n\nShift Payments wants to integrate all payment options available to a user in one debit card. Users can connect a Shift Card to multiple accounts to seamlessly spend all supported payment means, including digital currencies, with the same card.\n\n“The Shift Card works like any debit card today,” notes the Shift website. “Connect your existing accounts and spend Coinbase or Dwolla, immediately and directly, everywhere Visa is accepted.”\n\nThe Shift card isn’t the first bitcoin debit card, but the availability of a Visa-branded bitcoin debit card from a major bitcoin exchange and wallet operator is likely to represent a quantum leap in the space.\n\n“At the end of the day, what we’re trying to do is make bitcoin easy to use,” Coinbase vice president of business development and strategy Adam White, told Wired. “We want to make it easy to buy and sell bitcoin, and we want to make it easy to spend. A mainstream debit card based on bitcoin is a key element.”\n\nOf course all U.S. bitcoin users already can spend their bitcoin by converting them to dollars and sending the dollars to their bank accounts, but the process is lengthy and probably overly complex for some users.\n\nTherefore, the Shift Card is likely to make Bitcoin much more useful in daily life.\n\nWired notes that existing Coinbase customers are now likely to start spending more of their bitcoin, rather than just speculating, and new customers will be attracted to the digital currency because they can more easily spend it. Then, merchants will be more motivated to start accepting bitcoin, which could start a runaway feedback loop that will boost the Bitcoin ecosystem.', 'The revolution will not be televised. It\'ll be sent to your inbox by us.\n\nWill Bitcoin Black Friday Help Legitimize the Digital Currency for the Mainstream? Historically, the cryptocurrency spikes on Friday before starting a long slide back down.\n\nBitcoin Black Friday: The fourth-annual event is projected to include more than 150 participating stores, and if history is any indication could affect the price of the digital currency.\n\nA retail event similar to traditional Black Friday, the Bitcoin version is for merchants offering deals exclusive to those paying with the so-called “tamagotchi of currency.” The event kicked off in 2012 with just a handful of sellers but has grown to include more than 150 retailers this year.\n\nA full list of participating retailers has yet to be announced but will be revealed Friday on Bitcoin Black Friday.\n\nHistorically, this causes a spike in Bitcoin pricing. About this time in 2014, Bitcoin prices were at roughly $350 before going to $380 on Bitcoin Black Friday, a jump that also happened the year before. One reason for this could be the media hyping the upcoming event and getting Bitcoin in the mind of the consumers, but another might be that people who spent Bitcoin on Black Friday deals tended to buy the coins right back, potentially driving the price up.\n\nBesides the economics of the market, Bitcoin value also benefited from the bump in consumer confidence that comes with seeing the coins associated with traditional, safely-executed purchases in the media — as opposed to stories about using the coin to buy MDMA on online drug-buying forum Silk Road, or a cryptocurrency exchange collapsing.\n\n“It’s just good press for Bitcoin,” says Jon Holmquist, the founder of Bitcoin Black Friday. “You see all these people shopping with it and you see transactions done safely and retailers accepting it and shows how much Bitcoin has become part of the landscape.”\n\nAt the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading on the downslope at $321.32.\n\nThe tricky part for investors is that in both 2013 and 2014 Bitcoin prices started to plummet following Black Friday. Such are the wiles of the anonymous, speculative money marketplace. At least one Bitcoin financial blog thinks that’ll be avoided this year because there are far more open marketplaces, so consumers could get better value for their money this time around. Caveat emptor.\n\nHello! You\'ve made it to the end of the article. Nice. Here\'s a related video you might like: ""Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg: We Should Explore Universal Basic Income""', 'As the bitcoin price has risen out of the $200’s over the past month, the price increase has driven another important event: more mining hardware is being brought online.\n\nMiners earn revenue two ways. The first is with the block reward, which is 25BTC approximately every 10 minutes. The other way is with transaction fees. The block reward also acts as the mechanism in which new supply of bitcoin is generated. Because mining tends to reward those that can do the most work, miners deploy increasing amounts of hardware to try to be the first to mine each block. To keep a steady block creation rate, Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto put in place a rule that updates the network difficulty every 2016 blocks, or approximately two weeks.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Wisdom, the difficulty increase that took place today rose by 10.44%. The last time the difficulty increased by more than 10 percent was on November 5, 2014, when the difficulty increased by 10.05 percent. Further, Bitcoin Wisdom is predicting that the next bitcoin difficulty increase in 2 weeks will be 10.25%. The last time there were two double digit percentage increases in difficulty was August 19, 2014 and August 31, 2014.\n\nBut the increase in difficulty makes sense.\n\nThe next generation of bitcoin miners have been released by three of the top companies in the space. In August, Bitmain announced the launch of the Antminer S7, which contains the BM1385 ASIC. Each S7 can generate upwards of 4,850 GH/s while only using 0.25 J/GH of power.\n\nIn October, the Chinese mining firm BW announced that it was releasing its next stage bitcoin miner, which would contain a 14nm chip. Virgilio Lizardo Jr., head of international at Bitbank, told Bitcoin Magazine that the first batch of servers released would be 48 petahash total. For context, the current network has a hash rate of 550.5 PH/s.\n\nFinally, the original creator of the ASIC miner, Avalon, announced that it was releasing its latest miner, the Avalon6, which would contain the new A3218 mining chip. Each miner would be able to generate 3.65 TH/s of hashing power. While these new miners have just hit the market, it is additional hardware that should come online over the coming weeks.\n\nThe reality is simple: As the price of bitcoin increases, the number of people who can make a profit mining increases. That encourages more participation in securing the network, which results in the need for a difficulty increase. As these next generation of bitcoin miners come online, it is expected that the difficulty will continue to counteract the additional hash rate in the network.\n\nJacob Donnelly is a freelance journalist and a consultant in the bitcoin/blockchain space. He runs a weekly digital currency and blockchain newsletter called Crypto Brief.', 'Established in 1930 by an intergovernmental agreement between many of the world’s most powerful nations of the time, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) was originally created to facilitate reparations imposed on Germany after WWI. Headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, the organization is often referred to as the banker’s bank, its membership is comprised of 60 central banks, from countries that make up about 95% of world GDP.\n\nToday the BIS released their own in-depth report on digital currencies, including bitcoin. Published by the internal Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), the 24-page PDF report is simply named “Digital Currencies,” and the majority of its pages are focused on the implications and impact of blockchain-based currencies on our global financial system.\n\n- Benoît Cœuré, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures Chairman\n\nThe content of the report demonstrates that bitcoin has now caught the attention of the world’s most senior banking institution, and the reaction to it could easily be called positive.\n\n- BIS Report\n\nIn a refreshing and welcome break from the normal pattern of banks referring to them as “virtual currencies,” the BIS has elected to call bitcoin and other blockchain-based currency by the proper term “Digital Currencies” within the report, something that few, if any, other banks have done to date. Their reasoning for doing so is surprisingly reasonable.\n\n- BIS Report\n\nThe role of regulation over digital currencies was a central theme of the report, including regulatory issues and approaches. Without mentioning any specific regulation, they weighed the banker and consumer risks while using digital currencies without any regulation yet.\n\nFactors influencing the development of digital currencies were heavily explored in the report, including both the supply-side and demand-side factors, covering every issue bitcoin faces from scalability, altcoin fragmentation, volatility, pseudonymity, to security and more. The writer(s) of this well-researched report, who are not named at any point, seem to have a thorough understanding of the technology and economics behind cryptocurrencies, and likely have spent considerable time researching the bitcoin community too.\n\n- BIS Report\n\nHowever, as bitcoin proponents have come to expect, the narrative of the report downplays the usefulness of the currency and embraces the unique properties of the blockchain. “The genuinely innovative element seems to be the distributed ledger,” it echoed, “especially in combination with digital currencies that are not tied to money denominated in any sovereign currency.”\n\n- BIS Report\n\nThe importance of network effects on digital currencies is confirmed and well addressed in the report, comparing their importance to those of retail payment systems and payment instruments. “A range of features and issues that are likely to influence the extent to which these network effects may be realised,” the report stated, chief among them was the advantage “that digital currency has a global reach by design.”\n\nSeveral other appreciative-sounding comments were made, such as how “there may be gaps in traditional payment services that are or might be addressed by digital currency schemes” and\n\neven perhaps a little jealousy in the department of cost savings: “Distributed ledgers may offer lower costs to end users compared with existing centralised arrangements for at least some types of transactions” the report admitted.\n\nHowever, it would be inappropriate to call the BIS a ‘fan’ of bitcoin. In case anyone reading the report had any doubts that the BIS could see bitcoin as a de facto competitor to their business model, this report removes all doubt towards the end.\n\n- BIS Report\n\nIf there was one single, overall conclusion, it was simply that “distributed ledger technology will continue to emerge and develop,” whether or not digital currencies catch on is still up in the air at the moment.\n\n- BIS Report\n\nThe takeaway advice offered to central banks was familiar, yet ominous. Addressing business models as “Financial Market Infrastructures,” (FMIs), the BIS report clearly suggests for its member banks to assimilate digital currencies, not fight them. “Central banks could consider – as a potential policy response to these developments – investigating the potential uses of distributed ledgers in payment systems or other types of FMIs.”\n\nSeveral central banks have already expressed similar views. The Bank of England was one of the first to show that they grasp the power of the blockchain.\n\n- Andrew Haldane, Bank of England, Chief Economist\n\nSingapore’s central bank said early on that they are watching intensely.\n\n- Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore\n\nGermany’s central bank has shown that they understand the underlying implications of the blockchain pretty well.\n\n- Dr Andreas Dombret, Deutsche Bundesbank, Member of the Executive Board\n\nIn South Africa, the central bank is aware that they need to be looking at more than just the currency aspect:\n\n- François Groepe, South African Reserve Bank Deputy Governor\n\nCanada’s top banking authorities agree and are already talking about further uses for blockchain technology that they can be involved with, such as peer to peer lending.\n\n- Carolyn Wilkins, Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor\n\nIf there is a single day in history that knowledge of bitcoin became propagated to all levels of the banking world, the emergence of today’s report would most likely mark it. So far the response to digital currencies has been more positive than negative, but if bitcoin were to ever grow the rest of the way into mainstream usage, we may find out if the BIS could change its tactics and central banks would be ready to pounce at that time.', 'The blockchain.\n\nMarc Andreesen calls it an invention as profound as ""computers in 1975"" and ""the Internet in 1993."" Fred Wilson thinks it\'s the future of social media. Kim Dotcom wants to build a new global network on it.\n\nAnd the team behind Qora wants to bring it directly to you—the open source way, of course.\n\nQora is one of many so-called ""second generation"" cryptocurrencies emerging in the wake of Bitcoin\'s unignorable popularity. But Qora is more than a currency. Simply put, it\'s a peer-to-peer transaction technology; it allows people to exchange digital assets without an intermediary (and in relative privacy).\n\nTo do this, it leverages the blockchain. Sure, the blockchain is the beating heart of Bitcoin, the world\'s most popular cryptocurrency. But Qora developers believe it can power so much more.\n\nFinancial transactions, experts suggest, are but one application of blockchain technology. A blockchain is a kind of ""public ledger,"" a transparent record of transactions between parties. No central authority owns or controls this record; it\'s distributed across entire networks of computers that monitor and maintain it. It allows parties to exchange digital goods without having to trust anyone, including one another. (Blockchain is actually a practical solution to a computer science problem called the ""Two Generals"" or ""Byzantine Generals"" problem, which addresses ways multiple parties can achieve consensus in a distributed fashion.) And every one of those transactions occurs with radical transparency—even as the identities of the transacting parties remain private.\n\nSome prognosticators claim the technology will transform not only financial transactions but also any transaction involving a contract. Qora\'s developers consider their project a critical component in next-generation voting systems, encrypted messaging, automated transactions—and, yes, social networking.\n\nIn this interview, one of Qora\'s core developers—identified simply by the handle ""Vrontis""—explains Qora\'s promise for a truly decentralized Web.\n\nTell me about Qora.\n\nQora was founded by qora dev, a user who initially built Qora\'s entire infrastructure from scratch. He publicly announced the project in March of 2014.\n\nQora\'s source code had remained closed from the start—until the founder delivered the whole project to a small team and ceased development. The Qora community took a poll and, along with the founder, authorized that team (of which I am a member) to continue development.\n\nIn early 2015 (when the founder went silent), the project was at the point where the integration of automated transactions was taking place on Qora\'s core. So we issued another poll and asked the community to authorize a small group of developers (again, our team) to proceed with the integration of automated transactions in the absence of qora dev. People voted in favor of this, and the founder delivered the full source code to the team. We took it from there and enhanced the whole network.\n\nWhat makes Qora a ""second generation"" cryptocurrency?\n\nQora\'s initial features included an asset exchange (with the ability to trade assets directly), a polling feature, arbitrary transactions, and a naming service. Arbitrary transactions are a type of transaction on Qora that allows users to store data on the blockchain—data like text, images, etc. At the moment, we allow a maximum of 100KB size of compressed data per a batch of bulk transactions.\n\nWe\'ve also integrated automated transactions and a Turing complete programming language, a smart contracts mechanism founded by CIYAM developers. Performing tasks programmatically on a network backed by blockchain technology represents a new era in computing. The ability to have such functionality available on Qora boosts the whole environment, increasing efficiency and usability.\n\nThis automated transactions technology powers Qora\'s smart contracts feature, which can automatically execute the terms of a contract. A simple example of a smart contract would be an auction, where a user wants to set a product to be sold in an auction that will last for a specific period of time. In May of 2015, we achieved the world\'s first Atomic cross-chain transfer between two blockchains by using a smart contract that has been created for that purpose. Thanks to smart contracts, Qora users can operate in a trustless environment without the need for a central authority to manage their activities. Payments can now be triggered automatically, businesses can be more efficient, and legal system can be more equitable. Everyone is able to deploy his or her own script, or use existing deployed programs—programs with a variety of purposes, such as funds management and digital rights management. Also, fully automated businesses built around managing valuable property can exist.\n\nWe\'ve continued development by implementing a decentralized web, a decentralized social network, file storage, a database management system, a revision control system, and an encrypted messaging service. Using arbitrary transactions and automated transactions expands the blockchain\'s capabilities. With Qora\'s decentralized web, we can use both on a single website to retrieve stored data along with the details of a smart contract. To be more specific, here\'s an example: We can visualize a crowdfunding campaign on a single decentralized website where the details of the project (story, images, comments) will be retrieved instantly along with the existing funded progress (the percentage of funds raised), expiration date, and the participants list.\n\nWe\'ve brought these implementations to life with Qora, and they\'ve all been generated by our beliefs. Qora was, from the very first moment, a really innovative project. It has introduced many new features on the blockchain—like polls, for example, where the online voting process is secured with the power of the blockchain. Such accomplishments, among others like the decentralized web, are made in order to secure users, ensure their personal data (no censorship, no third party interferences) and provide a transparent and trustless environment to negotiate and reconcile (hence, no fraud).\n\nExploring the power of the blockchain is a challenge and, as a team guided by common sense and community, we are hoping to serve users. The combination of features we\'ve devleoped brings us closer to an evolution of the Web, where each resource can be reused seamlessly across the whole network. Qora provides us with a really effective way to handle and solve real world problems in a decentralized manner: using the blockchain.\n\nYou say that you\'ve designed Qora ""from the ground up to solve Bitcoin\'s biggest problems."" What specific problems does it solve?\n\nAs a cryptocurrency written from scratch, Qora is independent from Bitcoin. It differs in many areas and has been enhanced with scalable features, making it a unique platform in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe biggest difference between Bitcoin and Qora is Qora\'s environment-friendly approach to block generation. Qora generates blocks using proof-of-stake, a consensus-seeking method that does not consume the amount of energy Bitcoin\'s proof-of-work method does. With less time between blocks (one to five minutes per block), Qora is faster than Bitcoin. (Qora has a block time of one to five minutes, while Bitcoin has a block time of ten minutes).\n\n""Proof of work"" and ""proof of stake"" are two different approaches to reaching a distributed consensus in a cryptocurrency network. Proof of work systems rely on miners, who use specialized hardware with high energy costs for securing the network by solving complex puzzles. Proof of stake systems distribute ""mining power"" (the probability of a right to generate a block) equally—to shares of holders of the coin. Another difference is that in proof of work systems (like Bitcoin), new coins are generated continually as a reward to miners, making the system inflationary. Proof of stake systems usually create all coins in a ""genesis block."" So proof of stake systems tend to be rather deflationary. Qora holders and those generating blocks are basically rewarded in the form of transaction fees included in a block, and now, thanks to automated transactions, also in the form of a fixed reward from a common fund.\n\nWhat makes blockchain technology so promising and exciting to you?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto introduced the blockchain when inventing Bitcoin. It\'s a public ledger that holds a record of all the transactions ever made on the network. This was exciting—the very first case of a peer-to-peer payments model, totally decentralized, with a form of a common agreement.\n\nThe technology underlying the blockchain can support more things than ordinary payments, and that\'s what we\'re trying to accomplish with Qora: proving that blockchain technology can provide more tools to the world.\n\nYou\'ve open sourced the Qora code. Bitcoin is also open source. Why are people keeping cryptocurrencies open?\n\nBy having such projects open source, you first achieve transparency, which is a problem that needs to be addressed before people start using a cryptocurrency. Clean code matters, especially where personal data are involved. This is how you gain people\'s confidence.\n\nAlso, open source code can be browsed and tested by more people, and in this way it gains more opinions, more solutions, and further growth, because it invites anyone to do their own research on—or apply fixes to—Qora.\n\nHow can people pitch in and help the project?\n\nEveryone can use Qora\'s wallet to start making blog posts, set up profiles, build websites, run businesses, or create applications on top of Qora (in addition to making payments and composing encrypted messages). That\'s how people can help Qora: by using it as a tool that extends their activities in a decentralized world—a network of users connected across the world with no borders.', ""Bitcoin requires decentralization of miners (or mining pools) and full nodes to achieve what some consider its core property: censorship resistance. As such, the block-size dispute represents a trade-off. Bigger blocks allow for more transactions on the Bitcoin network, but take more time to propagate, favoring larger miners and pools, while the increased data transmission disincentivizes users to run full nodes.\n\nFortunately, there are proposals to increase Bitcoin's efficiency that reduce the risk of bigger blocks. One of the most promising innovations in this regard, are Invertible Bloom Lookup Table, or IBLTs. First introduced by Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen, this idea was picked up and is currently worked on as a side-project by Linux veteran and Blockstream's Lightning Network developer Paul “Rusty” Russell.\n\n“If we can make this work, it means less bandwidth requirements and less block data, which should be good for network health all over,” says Russell.\n\nRedundancy\n\nSo what problem do IBLTs solve?\n\nTypically, all Bitcoin transactions are transmitted from node to node over the peer-to-peer network, to be stored by the mempools (the record of unconfirmed transactions) of individual nodes. When a miner finds a block, it includes (some of) these transactions in that block, and subsequently transmits this block over the same peer-to-peer network. Of course, this means that all transactions in the block are effectively sent over the network twice: once as a transaction, and once as part of a block.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Russell explained:\n\n“We've got redundancy in blocks. Most nodes already know some of the content in that block; they have already seen it. If we can optimize that, we can speed up block transmission. That decreases centralization pressure because miners can get their blocks out faster, while the network works better ... it's all good.”\n\nThe Magic of IBLTs\n\nThe main problem – the reason we need IBLTs to solve this problem (rather than a straightforward compression algorithm) – is that the set of transactions included in blocks is often not exactly identical as those stored by the mempools of all individual nodes; the biggest difference being the latest transactions transmitted over the network before the block was found. Moreover, the mempools of all individual nodes usually differ from each other a bit, too. This makes it hard to know which transactions a miner included in the new block, without seeing the whole block.\n\nThat’s where IBLTs come in. IBLTs combine several mathematical tricks to enable set reconciliation. As such, they basically allow for two slightly different mempools to be compared and harmonized, without actually needing both mempools in full.\n\nThis works as follows:\n\nAt first, all transactions included in a block are written into a table, where each transaction starts at a different spot in that table. However, there are many more transactions than there is room in the table, so the result is hopelessly overlapping. This makes the IBLT very compact, but also unreadable and undecipherable for anyone who doesn't have access to any transaction data himself.\n\nAnyone who does have transaction data, however, can compare the overlapping transaction data in the IBLT to his own transaction data by filling up an IBLT with his own transactions using similar logic. If both IBLTs end up looking exactly the same, it means all transactions match exactly.\n\nBut even if the IBLTs do not end up looking exactly the same, this can still be helpful, as long as the sets of transactions are fairly similar. In that case, the IBLTs can be compared in such a way that all identical transactions cancel each other out. The “leftovers” in the IBLT, then, can often be used to reconstruct the missing transactions.\n\nSo rather than needing to transmit full blocks over the peer-to-peer network, nodes can transmit the much smaller IBLTs instead. This requires less data to be sent around and is much faster.\n\nEfficiency\n\nAnd it gets better. In Russell's design, not even all of the transactions included in new blocks need to fit in the IBLTs. Instead, connected nodes on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network fine tune which transactions to send to peers. This could increase propagation time and decrease data usage even more.\n\n“Gavin's original idea was that the miner would produce the IBLT, and send every node on the network the same one,” Russell said. “But when we started playing with the concept, it turned out it's very fast to generate IBLTs. So why not have every node do it? Generate IBLTs per peer, because each node has a much better idea of how close its mempool has been to a peer; they're sending this stuff back and forth all the time.”\n\nMoreover, connected nodes can continually learn to understand each other's behavior. So once a node receives an IBLT from the network, and constructs a valid block out of it, it knows how many transactions it was missing. Additionally, it learned over time how many transactions his peer typically differers from him. That difference – the transactions it had to construct plus the usual difference between the two peers – is what the node will include in the IBLT and send to its peer.\n\nAs such, the IBLT system can improve over time, limiting the amount of data to transmit over the network to the bare minimum.\n\n“The IBLT must roughly be twice the data size of the transaction difference,” Russell explained. “So out of all the transactions one node didn't know were in a block, plus the transactions that node thought were in the block but weren't... basically double that, and that's how big the IBLT needs to be. So if the differences are small, it will work really well.\n\n“Ideally, if we can cram this thing into two IP packets,” he said. “We are lightning fast.”\n\nSpecific details of IBLTs and Bitcoin can be found on Russell's blog and Andresen’s GitHub contribution."", 'Recently, bitcoin has been drawing the attention of many companies around the world including Forex and CFD Brokers. The rise of bitcoin trading has created a multi-billion dollar industry that allows cryptocurrency enthusiasts to buy or sell digital currencies across various exchange platforms.\n\nNow, several brokers are introducing bitcoin as part of their trading services. Forex is the market with the biggest volume and liquidity all over the world. Forex markets are said to witness a daily volume of trillions of USD. For Bitcoin, it presents a whole new market with many trading opportunities.\n\n1Broker is a platform that allows Bitcoin users to invest in CFDs with their bitcoin. The platform allows Bitcoin users to participate in real-world markets directly by using their Bitcoins. 1Broker currently allows traders to invest on 44 selected commodities, stock, indices and Forex pairs. 1Broker has taken the digital currency approach to a whole new level and only allows deposits and withdrawals to be made via Bitcoin.\n\nThe underlying contracts that users trade on 1Broker are called CFDs. This type of derivative allows 1Broker to peg its markets directly to the underlying markets\\assets with top transparency and maximum simplicity for any type of trader.\n\nTo know more about 1Broker and the Forex-Crypto Market industry, NewsBTC was able to reach out to the company’s Media Division Manager and ask him some questions:\n\nNewsBTC – Can you tell us a bit about the company, and its goals and history?\n\n1Broker – 1Broker was launched in late 2012 after around 12 months of planning and development. From the beginning, our main focus was to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in global markets. Back then, we only offered trading on a few markets and had an extremely limited platform, but over the past few years we have continually improved our software and constantly added new features. Currently, there is still a lot of room for improvement and our focus for development is on a new, and innovative front-end, which is scheduled to be released in early 2016. Our long-term goal is to compete with our “traditional” competitors, which usually do not accept Bitcoin (yet).\n\nNewsBTC – Can you tell us a bit about the platform and how it works?\n\n1Broker – Before launching our platform we analyzed several business models of how we could implement our ideas. We decided to offer CFDs as our primary product for the several reasons:\n\nWe could offer high liquidity and fast order executions from the beginning.\n\nAll fees could be integrated transparently in the spreads.\n\nUnlike other products, positions do not expire.\n\nMarkets are pegged to their underlyings (unlike options for example), which leads to an extremely transparent and straightforward trading experience.\n\nA trade on our platform is basically a contract between us and the trader, where we agree to pay the “difference” specified by the profit/loss formula. In the background, there are a lot of other things going on, but we managed to completely abstract that away from the trader.\n\nNewsBTC – Why did you decide to make bitcoin the only deposit option on your platform?\n\n\n\n1Broker – 1Broker was solely created for Bitcoin holders. The main reason was, that there simply were no others platforms offering a similar service. We saw this as an opportunity to gain a first-to-market advantage.\n\nNewsBTC – I see you have integrated Crypto Markets on the platform. For now, you only have the BTC/USD pair. Will you be integrating more crypto pairs shortly?\n\n1Broker – Offering CFDs on illiquid and volatile markets is extremely difficult, and for that reason we currently have no plans to add other crypto pairs in the near future.\n\n\n\nNewsBTC – What is the source for your charts and price indicators?\n\n\n\n\n\n1Broker – It depends on the market. For BTC/USD, we use a non-volume-weighted average of Bitstamp, itBit and Coinbase. For our forex markets, we use several data streams redundantly. For more detailed information, people can contact us.\n\nNewsBTC – How do you see the influence of cryptocurrency on the Forex Broker industry?\n\n1Broker – It heavily depends on how the cryptocurrencies will develop, and the adoption rates to follow. Currently, it is still an extremely small market and mainly used by tech-savvy enthusiasts. However, in the last year we noticed a significant increase of traders who live in underdeveloped countries and have no access to a bank accounts or services, so they often use cryptocurrencies to circumvent this problem.\n\nNewsBTC – What’s your expectations for the crypto market?\n\n1Broker – I expect that the cryptocurrency markets will continue to see accelerated growth both in volume and transaction rates. However, I doubt that they will replace traditional currencies or banking systems in the foreseeable future. The influence and power of existing governments and institutions is simply too high, and they wouldn’t stand by while they were replaced. Which brings me to next point – If leading governments formally ban digital currencies, it could really have a negative impact. Fortunately, many countries that are beginning to regulate cryptocurrencies are taking an open-minded, and exploratory approach, which is more or less a good sign.\n\nNewsBTC – What’s your opinion on the current situation of bitcoin and digital currencies?\n\n\n\n\n\n1Broker – Bitcoin is slowly leaving its early stages of development and many powerful organisations and people are trying to influence the development of the protocol. (i.e. block size debate) It’s impossible to accurately predict what the long-term future will look like. There are so many possibilities that could unfold: From a new digital currency replacing Bitcoin, to consensus-based updates of the current rules.\n\nHowever, the ideas and technology of a distributed ledger and all its potential use cases are certainly here to stay, and in my opinion the proof-of-work based algorithms (which secure the Bitcoin network) are one of the most important inventions in applied computer science.\n\nImages: 1Broker', 'CoinSource, a bitcoin ATM (BTM) network, announced the first BTM in New York City’s Lower East Side at 61 Delancey Street.

11/25/2015,"[""Just days after the hacker group Anonymous pledged to hunt down Islamic State members and launch cyberattacks against their accounts, a separate group of techies claims it has identified a key funding avenue for the terror network – bitcoin accounts.\n\nGhost Security Group, a collective of computer “hacktivists,” says it has located several bitcoin accounts that ISIS uses to fund operations. One account contained $3 million worth of bitcoin, a GhostSec member told Michael S. Smith II, a co-founder of Kronos Advisory, a national security advisory firm.\n\nGhost Security Group “wants to make an impact in counterterrorism,” Smith said, adding that the GhostSec member reached out to him because government officials were not paying close attention to the allegations.\n\nRelated: Has Anonymous's war against ISIS been doing more harm than good?\n\nSmith said U.S. counterterrorism officials are concerned that ISIS is acquiring gold and using numerous financial tools, including bitcoin, to tap into markets. A Treasury Department spokesperson said the agency couldn’t comment on accounts allegedly linked to terrorists unless the department has taken public action.\n\nBut bitcoin – an unregulated form of online currency that circumvents the traditional banking system – is on the government’s radar, since it could serve as an ideal placeholder for terrorist assets and provide a way for terrorists to exchange money. The bitcoin website, bitcoin.org, describes the ease with which anyone can send and receive virtual funds:\n\n“Sending bitcoins across borders is as easy as sending them across the street. There are no banks to make you wait three business days, no extra fees for making an international transfer, and no special limitations on the minimum or maximum amount you can send.”\n\nBitcoin is considered the first worldwide, decentralized currency; it can be sent from person to person without the third-party involvement of a financial institution. Bitcoin accounts are set up with virtual money, but the digital funds can be cashed in for real money or goods.\n\nRelated: #BrusselsLockdown request for social media blackout prompts flood of cat pictures\n\nA Ghost Security Group member said ISIS’ virtual currency amounts to between 1 percent and 3 percent of its total income – between $4.7 million and $15.6 million. The Treasury Department estimates that ISIS generates between $468 million and $520 million annually. The terror group’s primary sources of revenue are robbery, extortion, oil sales, ransom payments and overseas donations, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nBut it doesn’t take a fortune to pull off a terror attack. Even large-scale attacks can be relatively inexpensive. The 9/11 Commission determined that it cost between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and carry out the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.\n\nGhost Security Group hackers insist the alleged ISIS bitcoin account was not linked to the Paris attacks, but they say it shows that terror networks have found a way to transfer assets without easy detection.\n\nRelated: Sony's PlayStation 4 could be terrorists' communication tool, experts warn\n\n“The bitcoin universe is decentralized by design,” according to Juniper Research, a firm that identifies online market trends. “They’re built by random players around the world. They’re transferred seamlessly via nameless digital wallets.”\n\nCybersecurity expert Morgan Wright, a senior fellow at the Center for Digital Government, a national research and advisory institute on information technology policies, says terrorists are increasingly utilizing 21st century technology to transfer assets and finance operations\n\n“Terrorists need anonymity,” Wright said. “Countries have gotten very good at tracking terror financing in the years since 9/11. Networks have looked for new ways to do it, and it appears they’ve found it in bitcoin.”\n\nRelated: Anonymous declares 'war' on ISIS, vows cyberattacks\n\nGovernment officials have become increasingly concerned about these unregulated financial systems, and the U.S. is starting to apply money laundering regulations to cyber currencies. Firms that issue or exchange bitcoin are required to maintain records and report transactions of more than $10,000.\n\nIndividual states, too, are passing laws designed to regulate bitcoin exchanges. New York recently enacted a regulatory framework, and California will start governing the exchanges next year. “The U.S. government is working with a broad coalition of governments around the world to disrupt ISIL’s financing and to sever its access to the international financial system,” a Treasury Department official told Fox News.\n\nRelated: Why darknets are murky recesses of the hidden Web\n\nBut few foreign nations, have specific regulations that govern bitcoin use. The European Commission is expected to release regulations by 2017 that would affect European Union nations.\n\nBitcoins, meanwhile, are increasingly becoming mainstream. Following requests from donors and financial advisers, Fidelity Investments announced last week that its charitable fund will permit bitcoin donations. Last year, the online retailer overstock.com started accepting payments in bitcoin. Dell, Microsoft, Expedia and DISH Network also allow bitcoin payments.\n\nThere were 1.3 million bitcoin users last year, according to Juniper Research. It estimates there will be 4.7 million users by the end of 2017."", 'Bitcoin has been left for dead… hundreds of times in the last 5 years.\n\nBut it’s still here between us, in better health than ever and there’s no sign it’s going to leave us anytime soon. The question is: why so many experts keep failing at declaring it dead ahead of time? We’ve invited Mr. Andreas Antonopoulos to share with us his view on the matter, and what he thinks about the solidity of the Bitcoin system itself at the current time.\n\nThe Death That Never Happened\n\nSince Bitcoin started to gain popularity around 2010, economists, politicians, bankers and financial experts, time after time asserted the death of Bitcoin, failing along for 5 years now.\n\nThe Wikipedia Bitcoin obituaries section only hosts some examples:\n\nForbes declared bitcoin ""dead"" in June 2011, followed by Gizmodo Australia in August 2011.\n\nWired wrote it had ""expired"" in December 2012, Ouishare Magazine declared: ""game over, bitcoin"" in May 2013, and New York Magazine stated bitcoin was ""on its path to grave"" in June 2013.\n\nReuters published an ""obituary"" for bitcoin in January 2014.\n\nStreet Insider declared bitcoin ""dead"" in February 2014, as did The Weekly Standard in March 2014, followed by Salon in March 2014, and Vice News in March 2014, then the Financial Times in September 2014.\n\nIn January 2015, USA Today states bitcoin was ""headed to the ash heap"", and The Telegraph declared ""the end of the bitcoin experiment"".”\n\nBut these are really only a drop in the sea.\n\nWebsite 99bitcoins.com also set up a collection of all the Bitcoin “early deaths” quotes they can find. The page lists 83 posts at the moment, and they only keep track of english news. This collection, of course, only represents a fraction of the whole.\n\nEven after the MtGox “scandal” in December 2013, which spawned countless death sentences, Bitcoin emerged victorious: it was priced around 130$ before the bubble, and after it exploded at its top of 1100$, the Bitcoin price only slowly declined, reaching 450$ after 6 months. It has never fallen below 200$ since.\n\nMtGox was a bad thing for many, but surely it wasn’t Bitcoin’s death. If anything, MtGox was for Bitcoin a huge advertising campaign (Bitcoin was cited together with MtGox on media everywhere) that pumped its value like nothing ever did before.\n\nOne of the last “expertises” I found was released just a couple of weeks ago from J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon who stated that:\n\n“Bitcoin is going to be stopped!”\n\nThus declaring a war from banks to cryptocurrencies (like nobody was expecting this).\n\nThe Point Of View Of Bitcoin Evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos\n\nAs time passes by, Bitcoin keeps penetrating the financial system and human society, and while it’s still not mainstream, its solidity grows day by day thanks to capital being invested, infrastructures built for its use and more people becoming aware of its existence and reliability as an ever growing, quick, economic method of payment.\n\nWe are giving you the point of view of Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos, a California-based information security expert, tech-entrepreneur, author of the book Mastering Bitcoin, and renowned speaker at important conventions, about the resilience of Bitcoin:\n\nCoinTelegraph: Hi Andreas, thank you very much for your time. I know you are very busy, so let’s start: why do you think so many experts in the field of finance, politicians and journalists keep giving Bitcoin for dead, month after month? Where do they fail at interpreting the system? Is it a problem of ignorance, of lack of technical competence or just plain fear of the new? Or is it a mix of these or something else?\n\nAndreas Antonopoulos: Bitcoin works despite breaking all the ""rules"" of orthodox currencies. For those steeped in an institutional understanding of finance, the idea of network-centric money can\'t possibly work.\n\nThe fact that it does work forces many to undergo uncomfortable cognitive dissonance. If this works then the dominant economic hypotheses must not be correct.\n\nCT: I love the fact that you cite cognitive dissonance, it’s a mechanism that often prevents people from accepting a reality that is too different from the vision they have already in their minds.\n\nLeaving apart the Blockchain technology, what do you think are the main factors of resilience of Bitcoin? Why even with such a small user base in relation to world population and, after all, big “hits” like criminality scandals, bans from countries like China and Russia, BTC value still holds well up and Bitcoin keeps spreading?\n\nI have identified three main points that are of good importance for why Bitcoin is holding up:\n\n(1) Almost 800 millions of dollars have been invested in it to build infrastructures for its use, and the trend seems to beat investments that were made on the Internet at its beginnings.\n\n(2) Bitcoin is not only kept as a medium of speculation, but it’s actually used because it gives advantages that nothing else gives.\n\n(3) As a consequence of (2), there will always be somebody that will want Bitcoin, for the simple reason that it works, because it brings an advantage to the user in respect to traditional methods of payment and it definitely has a value because it has a use.\n\nWhat do you think about these and what are other possibly important factors?\n\nAA: Bitcoin is useful. It has intrinsic utility. It does things no other currency or payment network can do. It\'s also architected as a dynamic, adaptable and de-centralized system which makes it “anti-fragile”. As long as bitcoin serves a need and can be used by simply installing an app, it will refuse to go away, no matter what the price or the legal environment. In the longer term, that very resilience will emerge as a basis of value.\n\nCT: Do you think Bitcoin has already reached a “point of no return” where only dramatic events could really kill it, or do you think there’s still a certain percent of chances that the system will just collapse and make it disappear?\n\nAA: Bitcoin is the proof-of-concept for decentralized network-centric money and finance. That concept is now established and shown it can scale and thrive. Whatever form it takes in the future, whether it is Bitcoin, something different called Bitcoin or something called something else, the concept of network-centric money happened. It will continue to disrupt the global financial system for decades. In the long run it cannot be stopped because it is an idea based on math that can\'t be uninvented.\n\nCT: Do you think that the fact that governments are taking measures against Bitcoin after the Paris attacks and following ones represents a menace?\n\nAA: No, these measures are misguided, ineffective and ultimately damaging only to the countries that take them. The currency of terrorism is oil and the biggest funding source is our ""ally"" Saudi Arabia. Every time there is an attack, the same cynical authoritarians roll out the same tired and ineffective measures and try to persuade us to give up more freedoms, hoping we ignore the fact that the last round of ""measures"" failed to stop attacks or even lead to more extremism. While they\'re busy blaming Snowden, encryption, civil rights, refugees and Bitcoin, we should all focus on the real causes - endless western wars in the Middle East, drones, state terrorism, funding of militias, coddling of dictators and alliances with brutal religious fanatics like Saudi.\n\nIf governments try to ban or suppress bitcoin, they are only feeding the development of far more stealthy systems.\n\nCT: By another point of view, some people talk about a “lack of adoption of Bitcoin”, that killed it (again) or companies that simply reconfigure their position about it. Do you find this right, or are these people expecting too much? After all, Bitcoin was introduced to the mainstream around 3-4 years ago, it’s a new monetary system, something never seen before, and it’s unnatural for many to accept that money can be different, and on top of this, the real point of power of Bitcoin: the fact that it’s not controlled by a central authority makes people think that it’s not reliable. But I wouldn’t call Bitcoin dead, when a single operator like Bitpay is making one million a day of traffic since 2014, and was founded in 2011, while eBay was founded in 1995 and is making 89 million a month now.\n\nAA: We\'re in the 6th year of this technology. It\'s like giving up on the Internet in 1992 because there were not enough users. It\'s ridiculous to expect a six years old radically disruptive technology to simply become an ""overnight success"". The secret of overnight success is 10-20 years of development. The important trends in Bitcoin are all showing fantastic results: innovation, tech development, investment, transaction volume etc. People need to have more realistic expectations and a bit of patience. The blockchain bandwagon is about as interesting as the development of corporate intranets in the late 90s. It doesn\'t lead anywhere revolutionary, it\'s just a distraction for banks trying to avoid disruption by taking half-measures.\n\nCT: I couldn’t have said it better, Bitcoin is still spreading, slowly maybe, but not shrinking. The fact that these companies struggle with it and widen their field of action probably only shows that there was a bit of market saturation.\n\nBut what do you think is the biggest danger for the Bitcoin ecosystem? What could really damage it so much to destroy its reputation and sink its value to zero? For example I was a bit scared by the recent block size debate that spawned a fork of the Blockchain. That seemed an internal fight that damaged the reputation of Bitcoin, to me.\n\nAA: I don\'t think anything can take the value to zero. As long as bitcoin works and is useful, it will survive. It\'s funny but we no longer wonder if the Internet can ""fail"", but in the early days that was a common fear. Now it\'s embedded everywhere. Bitcoin is following the same path. If its reputation suffers a catastrophic problem, we will invent a new name for it or move to a new currency on the same model. You will of course be able to buy this new currency... with Bitcoin. I don\'t see any scenario that creates a dead-end. Too many people invested in time, skills and money in it, it means that any problems will have plenty of motivated people trying to solve them. Centralized systems are much more prone to collapse. We should be worried about the Euro and USD…\n\nCT: Now give me a number: the chances you think Bitcoin has to disappear at current time, at current status of things. The real, effective risk percentage that Bitcoin will disappear before 2020.\n\nAA: 0%.\n\nCT: Ahah I kind of expected it!\n\nAA: That\'s just 4 years from now…\n\nCT: Yes that\'s only 4 years. But if it holds up these 4 years, it will become completely armored and invulnerable.\n\nAA: It already is. Bitcoin became inevitable and unstoppable once it went over $1.\n\nCT: Considering I’m a big supporter of Bitcoin and the whole technology, I still have some doubt, however small, about its invulnerability, I’m scared of banks and governments.\n\nAA: They are far more fragile and powerless than they want us to believe.\n\nCT: That’s much possible! Thank you for this chat, I’m sure our readers will have a cue to think about what really is going on with Bitcoin and possibly review their worries about its future.\n\nThis is all for now. However, CoinTelegraph will write another article interviewing an expert of the traditional financial/banking system that does not believe much in Bitcoin. This too could be a good cue to see Bitcoin from a different point of view.', 'An unknown malicious hacker has successfully breached a Sharjah, UAE-based bank of its customer statements and records. Over the past few days, the hacker has released the confidential data via social media after the bank refused to give in to the hacker’s extortion.\n\nA cybercriminal who goes by the alias ‘Hacker Buba’ (yes, really) has – for the past week – held a bank in Sharjah, UAE to ransom. The hacker blackmailed the bank to pay a ransom in Bitcoin and the failure to do so will lead to the public leak of the bank’s customers’ account statements. Customers include government entities, private companies and individuals. As it turned out, the bank refused to pay and the hacker kept his word to start doxing confidential bank statements via Twitter.\n\nAs reported by GulfNews, a prominent online publication in the Middle East, Hacker Buba’s Twitter account was finally suspended on November 23, five days after the hacker began revealing the bank’s customer statements. To nobody’s surprise, the hacker set up another account the following day to upload account 500 bank customers’ statements in a single tweet, according to GN.\n\nSpeaking to the publication, the bank’s chief financial and operating officer admitted to the hack and said:\n\nYes, there was a data breach and we have been contacted by Hacker Buba. He is asking for money but I cannot reveal how much. This is blackmail. We have reported the matter to [the] UAE Central Bank.\n\nHe added that there was no financial loss and that the bank “won’t give in to any extortion threat.”\n\nThe GulfNews report later revealed that Hacker Buba reached out to the journalist via a Direct Message on Twitter to claim that he was seeking $3 million as a ransom demand, approx. 9225 BTC in current rates.\n\nIn a twist, the hacker also offered a bribe to the journalist if the latter cooperated with the misdeeds.\n\n“I will give u [sic] 5% from [the] total I get. Have many banks from UAE, Qater [sic]…,” said Hacker Buba allegedly in a direct message to the journalist.\n\nIncidents of extortionists seeking ransom in Bitcoin, is seeing an upswing lately. Around a year ago in November 2014, the Dickson County Sheriff’s Office paid $500 in Bitcoin after being struck by ransomware. In May this year, cybercriminals launched a DDoS attack targeting the Bank of China for a Bitcoin ransom. A recent high-profile case of the kidnapping of a Hong Kong billionaire businessman had the criminal gang seek ransom in Bitcoin.\n\nA recent report claimed a staggering $325 million in Bitcoin was claimed by malware authors behind the infamous CryptoWall ransomware.\n\nEven CCN was the target of a recent DDoS attack wherein extortionists demanded 2 BTC in a blackmail threat that came in via email. If you’re a web-wizard with the skill to track down the extortionists, there’s a 5 BTC reward to be claimed for those that help in filing a successful police report.

Kahle is one of the internet\'s pioneers, co-developing WAIS, the internet\'s first publishing and distributed search system, in the late 1980s, and later co-founding Alexa Internet, the web statistics giant. The two startups would net him $15 million (cash) and $250 million (shares), respectively, when they were eventually sold to AOL and Amazon.\n\nIn 2008, Kahle began to think beyond the web. The banking industry had managed to plunge the globe into the Great Recession, for one thing, but, at the same time, he\'d begun to take note of the difficulty his employees were having in securing loans. In 2011, he formally moved to open a credit union, and the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union opened for business in 2012.\n\nNow, three years later, the dream is dead. As the New York Times reports, Kahle is giving up the credit union. It turns out that, even with a pile of internet money to burn, running a credit union is a full-time adventure in navigating bureaucracy. According to Kahle, this is mostly courtesy of the National Credit Union Administration, the agency responsible for regulating the US government-backed federal credit union system. Turns out the NCUA isn\'t big on shaking things up.\n\nImage: archive.org\n\nWhen the credit union opened, it was forbidden from offering basic consumer banking services like debit cards and online banking. It was, moreover, forbidden from offering loans of more than $5,000, leaving the Internet Archive\'s operation basically capable of only offering predatory payday loans, as Jordan Modell, the credit union\'s chief executive told the Times. It was also subject to routine audits and exams—by this past August, Modell and Kahle estimated that they\'d spent 187 hours dealing with regulators and 61 hours with customers.\n\nMuch of this occurred after the Internet Archive FCU took on three Bitcoin outfits as customers, with the NCUA\'s blessing. Soon enough, however, the agency rescinded its permission and forced the credit union to drop the Bitcoin customers. In a post at archive.org, Kahle notes that this resulted in one of the firms going into bankruptcy.\n\nThe IAFCU currently has only 100 members.\n\nKahle elaborates:\n\nWe wanted to help the under-served, but the restrictions made this too difficult. We tried to offer student loans, but we were limited to lending only $5,000. This was a particular problem when, for example, an under-documented local Rutgers student with a 700+ credit score and a part-time job needed $8,000 to stay in school but others would not help him. We sought an exception from the NCUA, but they said no. In another case, we worked with a migrant farm workers association to offer their members access to the credit union. We set up a system that allowed them to send money back home with much lower fees than organizations such as Western Union. We had set up services to help undocumented workers so they could pay their fair share of taxes and put them on a path to citizenship. But after ruling that we could accept members of this migrant farm workers as members then a lower level examiners reversed this decision and we had to move all of those members to non-members effectively killing our relationship with the migrant farm workers association. Also, our members wanted to send outgoing wire transfers but the NCUA would not allow it resulting in many members leaving. You probably get the idea, we certainly did.\n\nTo be clear, the NCUA has a pretty good reason to be an asshole about this stuff. Credit unions are sort of idealized banks: small, non-profit, cooperatively run, customer-owned. In terms of consumer banking stuff (like fees and car loans) the difference between a credit union and a bank can feel like night and day. It\'s a system worth protecting.\n\n""Part of the reason the regulators may act this way is how technically insecure the money system is,"" Kahle offers. ""As an engineer, when I looked at how the transaction systems work, I was shocked to see few technological safeguards. I imagine there is major fraud activity. Ironically, the bankers and regulators need exactly the technologists that they are pushing away.""\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, the number of credit unions has dropped by over 40 percent. Given the banking fiasco in the interim, that number should be going up, one would imagine. While the credit union system is worth protecting, it doesn\'t matter a whole lot if there aren\'t any credit unions left to protect.', 'Annabelle Williams\n\nBITCOIN by Dominic Frisby\n\nBitcoin is king of the digital currencies and, for all its naysayers, it is not going away. 2015 was a year when both bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain, inched further towards mainstream acceptance.\n\nFrisby explains the modern history of currencies and why bitcoin’s anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was moved to create his own – while going to extreme lengths to keep his identity secret. For that matter, Frisby has a good idea who Nakamoto really is, and readers are privy to the (likely) truth. A brilliant read.\n\nGOLD by Matthew Hart\n\nGold has bewitched and harassed humans for 6,000 years, and it’s not over yet. From a financial perspective, the price of physical gold is well below the record heights of $1,900 an ounce reached in the wake of the financial crisis. But gold bugs and bears remain on two sides of their loyal tribes.\n\nHart’s book takes the reader beyond the numbers, back to gold’s chequered history. He tells of South American civilisations, Mali deserts, places where people traded salt, slaves and gold. “Africa brims with gold. We emerged from Africa. Maybe the idea of gold came with us,” he says. Beautifully written.\n\nMONEY: MASTER THE GAME by Tony Robbins\n\nAmerica’s premier motivational coach can also help you get started with investment and make your money work for you. This book is a tome, weighing in at over 600 pages, but its content is good.\n\nIt starts with a chapter explaining why money mastery is within your reach, however cash-strapped and flailing you feel. It’s Robbins’s empathy which makes this book; he knows you have no savings, he knows finance is confusing – he has been there himself. But it’s that assumption which makes his \xadwork accessible.\n\nRobbins’s focus throughout is on revealing “wealth secrets” from interviews with professional investors looking after the assets of the ultra-wealthy. Big names include activist investor Carl Icahn and the chief executive of JP Morgan’s asset management division, Mary Callahan Erdoes. It’s worth noting this book is written for Americans – so a pension plan is a 401k, for example – and this also accounts for the saccharine tone.\n\nHEROES & VILLAINS OF FINANCE by A Baldwin\n\nFew industries are so alive with colourful characters as finance, since the pursuit of wealth has driven people to the very extremes of creativity and greed. This book profiles 50 of the greatest from year dot to the present day.\n\nWhere else would an Indian economist from the fourth century BC, Chanakya, be ranked alongside the Rothschild family and Ronald Reagan? Who knew that commodity derivatives began with Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus in 500 BC?\n\nHowever heroic or villainous, no-one has more than two pages, large type, devoted to their story. And Baldwin makes no judgements, merely laying out the history and interesting anecdotes of figures as diverse as Chinese statesman Deng Xiaoping to head of the world’s largest ponzi scheme, Bernard Madoff. It’s fascinating to dip into.', 'Argentina’s new president, Mauricio Macri, is good news for the legal status of Bitcoin in the country. He is the one behind the sponsorship of the First Bitcoin Forum in Buenos Aires, earlier in July 2015. The perceived stance of the leader of “Cambiemos” (Spanish for “Let’s change”) is a far cry from the official statement issued in 2014 by the Argentine Central Bank. The statement was clearly cautious towards Bitcoin, warning about its qualities and declaring that it didn’t have legal tender status.\n\nHowever, for Bitcoin all good news are bad news, as all who were interested in Argentina’s high inflation rates as benefits for Bitcoin may now have to look elsewhere. The International Credit Rating agency Moody’s has already raised their outlook on Argentina, since it is a widely held belief—and it was used against the new president by the opposition—that Macri will give a prompt resolution to the “holdout crisis” currently in effect.\n\nFurthermore, the future undoing of controversial measures such as the dollar “cepo” (Spanish for clamp), should normalize the exchange rate for dollars and eliminate the ongoing black market. One of the main uses of the cryptocurrency in Argentina is to acquire dollar IOUs from exchanges, an effective and hassle-free way of “dollarizing” savings portfolios. Much better than commuting to illegal “cuevas” (Spanish for caves) where dollars are exchanged for Argentine pesos in a relatively underground environment.\n\nThe prospect of Argentina becoming a normal country will drive irregularity-fueled demand for Bitcoin down. As the “cepo” will most probably be abolished in the near future it will affect Argentine Bitcoin companies. With the dollar market currently running under a crazy and unfair setting, it’s much more convenient to have a company process transactions for their clients with Bitcoin. That is very likely to change.', ""With Mike Hearn taking a step back from Bitcoin development to work for private blockchain startup R3, former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen indicated he might take over the lead of Bitcoin XT, the Bitcoin implementation programmed to increase the block-size limit through BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 101.\n\nAndresen, who shifted his efforts to Bitcoin XT earlier this year, told Bitcoin Magazine, reluctantly: “I might take over lead of XT, but I don't want to.”\n\nIt was announced last week that Hearn recently joined R3 as lead platform engineer, where the Google veteran and Bitcoin XT lead developer will work with some of the world's largest banks on distributed ledger-based protocols for global financial markets. Hearn confirmed to Bitcoin Magazine that he will do the minimum required to keep Bitcoin XT running, but won't actively develop or advocate the implementation any longer.\n\nHearn, a staunch advocate of a block-size increase in order to allow for more transactions on Bitcoin's network, implemented BIP 101 into Bitcoin XT this summer. With this patch, designed by Andresen, Bitcoin XT is set to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years.\n\nOn Reddit, Hearn detailed:\n\nThe implementation of BIP 101 in Bitcoin XT without industrywide consensus was considered controversial by many, in particular among the Bitcoin development community. Shortly after Hearn implemented the patch, however, several prominent Bitcoin companies stated their intent to upgrade their code to support BIP 101 by December of this year. As such, the timing of Hearn's departure could have been experienced as unfortunate by supporters of a rapid block-size increase. While the Bitcoin industry could still adopt Bitcoin XT, this seems unlikely with no active lead development.\n\nSuccess of Bitcoin XT might therefore depend on Andresen taking over as lead developer, Hearn acknowledged when asked by Bitcoin Magazine. This idea – which was previously advocated by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong – was not dismissed by Andresen, though he is not keen to take such a step. Andresen, who is currently on MIT's payroll, explained:\n\nI might take over lead of XT, but I don't want to. I stepped back from lead of Core because I got tired of the constant trivial decision-making needed to lead an active open source software project. I want to spend my time thinking about and working on bigger, longer-term issues; like: 'What are the benefits and risks of increasing the maximum block size?'”\n\nBIP 101 itself currently garners little support among the Bitcoin development community, and seems very unlikely to be implemented in Bitcoin Core. Regardless, Andresen does expect that BIP 101 might be adopted by the industry at large. Either through Bitcoin XT, or by miners, companies and other users implementing the patch in their own software.\n\nIt depends on what comes out of the big Hong Kong meeting,” Andresen explained. “If the other developers can't make up their minds and reach consensus on a solution, then we'll have a messy, chaotic couple of months where companies and big mining pools or miners pick sides until a solution emerges. Though, in that case, I do expect that the most likely solution will be BIP 101, since it is the only solution with well-tested code they can download and run.”\n\nPhoto Web Summit / Flickr(CC)"", 'Visa Europe became the latest enterprise financial institution to announce a blockchain proof-of-concept this month, when it revealed it was working to leverage the emerging technology for remittances.\n\nBut while many of its peers are seeking to pursue such projects on closed, proprietary ledgers, Visa Europe Collab innovation partner Jon Downing has clarified that the test project is being conducted on the live bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn interview, Downing and Edan Yago, CEO of blockchain services firm and project partner Epiphyte, discussed the initiative in new detail. Payments in the proof-of-concept, they explained, originate within a testing environment set up by Epiphyte and that funds are then sent cross-border over the bitcoin blockchain and received on Visa devices.\n\nDowning explained:\n\n""A payment that would go from fiat currency and be received in [Kenyan mobile money service] M-Pesa, but it would be facilitated through one of the blockchain providers that enables transfers of those funds.""\n\nDowning said it was the need to identify a ""human use case"" with potential global value that led the project to focus on the remittance industry.\n\nThe test is notable as the remittance sector has long been identified as one that could come to be disrupted by use cases for peer-to-peer payments on the blockchain.\n\nTo date, however, the idea that bitcoin could lower costs in remittances has received significant pushback from incumbents in the industry, such as MoneyGram and Western Union, which have sought to portray cash as a payment method unlikely to be displaced by any digital alternatives.\n\nSolving the last mile\n\nIn remarks, Yago took issue with the idea that the remittances challenges described by MoneyGram and Western Union were accurate, positioning them as the product of a lack of creative thinking by entrenched industry providers.\n\nYago argued that bitcoin offers a creative solution to the ""last-mile"" problem, in which it is argued the majority of remittance costs come in the form of physical kiosks that deliver hard currency.\n\n”The big change that really sets the [bitcoin] opportunity apart here, is that by using an open non-proprietary standard, you can have local players integrating with it and providing you with a wide range of network effects,"" Yago said.\n\nRather than investing in on- and off-ramps, Yago argued, a large payments player such as Visa could simply extend the reach of its network by leveraging the open bitcoin blockchain.\n\nCurrently, the project is more than halfway through its projected 100-day development timeline. The proof-of-concept is being used today for research purposes, with the goal Downing said of showcasing the results internally.\n\nShould the proof-of-concept prove successful, he suggested it could move to an “incubation phase” with use in a particular market and with particular financial services partners.\n\nChoosing bitcoin\n\nWhile other projects have used similar conclusions as reasons to back private blockchains, Visa Europe and Epiphyte have seemingly sought to use the open bitcoin blockchain in a manner best compared to Interledger, a protocol introduced by Ripple for uniting both bank-owned and distributed ledgers.\n\n""Visa has the most powerful payments network in the world and our ability to extend that functionality is very, very strong evidence we can then extend the functionality of any payments network,"" Yago said.\n\nThrough this lens, Yago described its proof-of-concept as a cross-network settlement engine that allows ""instant settlement"" on a distributed ledger but that ultimately sends transactions across “multiple proprietary payment systems”.\n\nBitcoin’s security and network effects, he asserted, make it the ideal blockchain for enterprise clients like Visa Europe that are seeking to extend their payment systems. For example, he suggested that if one bitcoin services provider went down, the open nature of the bitcoin platform would allow users to route payments through another provider.\n\n“You can transfer value dynamically on a per transaction basis because [bitcoin] is an open network,” he continued. “It’s not that we’re not bound to one provider, but even further, you don’t need to know in advance which providers you’re going to use.”\n\nYago used this strength as evidence of his belief in the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nProject genesis\n\nDowning was also keen to put the project within the context of the more wide-ranging efforts by Visa Europe Collab, the company\'s innovation arm, to create innovative new proofs-of-concept.\n\nWhile he noted that Visa Europe is also investigating the Internet of Things and new technologies in the retail environment, he called the blockchain a “very big point of focus.”\n\n“There’s a small group of people within Visa Europe Collab and our focus is to explore cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and what could be the opportunity for Visa Europe and the payments ecosystem,” Downing said.\n\nToday, he said the point of emphasis is for Visa Europe to determine if the blockchain can allow Visa to deliver services faster and with more expanded capabilities.\n\nStarted on 10th September, Downing said the proof-of-concept will conclude development on 7th December, at which point the partners will draft an exit report compiling the findings.\n\nHe said the next stage for the project prior to its conclusion will be to engage a test group of live users, to be based in the UK.\n\nImage credit: Johari Lemau / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This suggests that price is turning a corner and could be taking in more bullish momentum from here.\n\nThe 100 SMA is still below the 200 SMA, though, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the downside. However, an upward crossover could confirm that an uptrend is underway so keep close tabs for one. Further buying pressure could take bitcoin price to the top of the triangle at $340.\n\nThe average directional index is starting to pick up, edging close to the 40.0 level as of this writing. This suggests a potential return to trending market conditions after bitcoin price has been stuck in a tight range for weeks.\n\nA bit of a pullback might be in the cards since stochastic is already turning down from the overbought zone. This could bring some sellers back in the game, allowing bitcoin price to retreat to the broken triangle support around $320. Similarly, RSI is on the move down and suggesting that a correction might need to take place before the uptrend resumes.\n\nThe move may have been spurred by profit-taking activity among dollar pairs ahead of the Thanksgiving holidays in the US.

11/26/2015,"['When the internet burst into the public consciousness in the 1990s, the days of hard cash were said to be numbered. When the digital economy, e-commerce and PayPal became entrenched at the beginning of this century, coins and notes were teetering on the brink.\n\nSo now, a decade on, and just as paperless money is becoming a reality through contactless payments and Apple Pay, why is the global financial system still far from embracing digital currency?\n\nContactless payments are merely a way of selling phones\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nA new payment system of entirely digital money, Bitcoin – created as a response to the financial crisis, back in 2009, supposedly by a computer coder with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator\'s true identity continues to be a mystery) – is nevertheless mostly about swerving the banking system.\n\n""Bitcoin was originally designed to be democratised money in a crypto-libertarian sense,"" says Dave Hrycyszyn, Director of Strategy & Technology at London-based digital agency Head, who thinks its individualist tone makes it intrinsically Thatcherite. Autonomous software releases Bitcoins – which are actually commodities, not currency – and computers belonging to \'miners\' search for them.\n\nIn theory, it\'s all and only about decentralisation. However, Bitcoin is no longer the reserve of individuals acting alone. ""Bitcoin mining is now a capital-intensive arms race requiring both technical expertise and financial firepower,"" says Hrycyszyn about the dozen \'mining pools\' that now dominate the Bitcoin world.\n\nMining pools\n\n""The top two mining pools now have enough processing power at their disposal to do a deal which could subvert or destroy the currency,"" says Hrycyszyn. It\'s ended up extremely centralised; democratised digital money this is not.\n\n""Perhaps the reverse is true,"" says Steven Faulkner, Head of Global Network Management at foreign exchange and payments provider VFX Financial. ""Digital money like Bitcoin is concentrated in the hands of a relatively few individuals, unlike fiat currencies … venture capital firms and speculators own significant quantities of digital money such as Bitcoin.""\n\nThere\'s also a concern that cryptocurrencies are being used for black market trading in illicit goods. In short, there\'s a lack of trust in Bitcoin, which ultimately affects its value. The MtGox theft of Bitcoins in 2014 and the bursting of the \'Bitcoin bubble\' haven\'t helped, either – and nor is anyone exactly sure why it\'s surging massively right now. Extreme volatility is not going to win an emerging cryptocurrency any friends.\n\nBitcoin is more about politics than creating frictionless digital currency\n\nBetting on Bitcoin\n\nHowever, you get a completely different story from Nick Garner, the founder of a Bitcoin casino called Oshi!, who likens cryptocurrencies to \'bottom up\' innovations like open-source software. ""Once banks and governments aren\'t in the cycle, they have no power,"" he says, citing their control over interest rates and ability to deflate and inflate currencies, which can have profound effects.\n\nFor Garner, it\'s about ""individuals coming together [and] becoming more powerful than the corporates who try to control them.""

The website traditionally only remains open for one day. As from previous years, Bitcoin supporters are expected to take advantage of the offers, as well as spread the word about it for the good of Bitcoin reputation.\n\nThis year the list of merchants includes over 150 names, notable between them we can find REEDS Jewelers, a large chain of jewelers shops offering discounts on their products; Nestorgames, seller of board games of all shapes and sizes; Bitsoap with its particular soap molded in the shape of a Bitcoin (or what they think a Bitcoin looks like!); Mixedtees, with a range of T-shirts, hoodies and more; Namecheap, will offer discounts for its services such as domain name registration and web hosting.\n\nThe full list of sellers, deals and discounts will be published on the 27th at the opening of the website.\n\nWe’ve asked Jon, the founder, some questions about the site history and Bitcoin:\n\nCoinTelegraph: How did you come up with the idea for Bitcoin Black Friday?\n\nJon Holmquist: The first year, in 2012, I was working with a couple of bitcoin merchants, I was running a sale for them on Black Friday and I looked around the space and reached out to a couple other merchants I had worked with and asked if they would be interested in joining and making it a sort of event. The first year we actually held the event a couple weeks before Black Friday.\n\nCT: Have you seen a positive or negative trend in sellings over time? Or is it stable?\n\nJH: We've generally seen a bit of a bump on Black Friday, but generally I think the actual spending doesn't affect the price very much. There isn't a whole lot of consumer volume compared to the daily trade volume.\n\nBut I think the positive press and news ends up affecting the price.\n\nCT: Are you taking any actions on a personal basis (like introducing it to friends and relatives) to spread the adoption of Bitcoin?\n\nJH: Oh dear, sure! My friends and family know all about Bitcoin.\n\nI've been involved in crypto since 2011, I have something like 15 bitcoin/crypto T-shirts and hoodies (most of them from Mixedtees.com, love those guys), half of my computers are plastered with bitcoin stickers, the other half has bitcoin desktop pictures.

We warmly suggest you take your cold storage wallet and make a transfer to a live one, so to have some BTC ready!"", 'Once again, it’s been a wild ride in the bitcoin market on Thursday. Action has been particularly volatile over the last week or so, and while we generally expect to see some volatility throughout the Asian session based on Chinese volume, Europe has gone against the grain and given us plenty to trade as late. With this said, and as we head into this evening’s trading, and the end of today’s European session, what are we watching in the bitcoin price, and where will we be looking to get in and out of the markets according to our intraday strategy – be it intrarange or breakout? Take a quick look at the chart to get an idea of what we are looking at.\n\n\n\nAs the chart shows, Action today broke through the level we had pitches as in term resistance shortly after we published our first bitcoin price analysis. We quickly broke through our upside target, taking a nice profit, and have since corrected from highs just shy of 370 flat to trade within this morning’s predefined range. As such, tonight’s range remains firm, with in term support at 341.99 and resistance at 356.83. These are the two levels we are looking at as we head into Asia.\n\nIf we get a break above in term resistance, it will put us long towards a target of 370 flat. This is slightly wider than the target we pitched for this morning, but it comes in at the most recent swing high, meaning its valid as an entry goal. A stop loss on this one somewhere around 352 gives us plenty of room to avoid the chop out if we return to trade within range.\n\nLooking the other way, if the correction persists, a close below 341.99 will put us short for a circa $10 target of 331.45. On this one, a stop just shy of current levels (around 344.5) keeps things attractive from a risk management perspective.\n\nAs ever, charts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Bittunes has a simple approach to how the blockchain can transform the music industry.\n\nWhile other music oriented startups in the field remain very focused on technology driven solutions, Bittunes wants to initially focus on the problem: the way the music industry is today.\n\n“We have tried from the beginning to keep things as simple as possible,” Bittunes managing director Simon Edhouse tells CCN. “This has been for a number of reasons. Ultimately we believe the challenge for adoption of ‘new to market’ systems like this is not so much a technical one but rather, it is related to developing a trusted brand and providing a simple service, understandable anywhere across the planet, that does not confuse people.” Bittunes has a stripped-down philosophy.\n\n“Simple is best, simple wins,” Edhouse says. Unlike other technologies in the space, Bittunes uses Bitcoin.\n\n“We use Bitcoin as our native currency because it is clearly the most sought after and valued digital currency, and therefore, the safest and most reliable one for our users for the long term,” Edhouse says. “However, to keep things simple, we denominate all transactions in USD and Bitcoin, with the USD amount displayed floating up and down with fluctuations in the Bitcoin exchange rate.”\n\nBittunes has a two-tiered system with two price points, and costs 50c for all new tracks. For this, Bittunes takes nothing. Instead, the Artist earns 50% (25c) and buyers share the other 50% between a small group of up to five buyers per sale.\n\n“So, for the vast majority of songs in the system, a song sale represents a transaction between Artists and Fans only, with no intermediaries,” Edhouse explains. “No system can become flatter than this.”\n\nOnce a track enters the ‘Overall Top 100’ its price point changes to $1.00. This gives users incentives to buy low and early if you think a song will rise. As the track attracts enough attention, its price increases, “so it distributes higher returns.” Makes sense.\n\n“When a song reaches this point, the Artist get’s 40% (40c) the buyers share 40% between them,” Edhouse tells me through e-mail. At this point, Bittunes takes 20% (20c) per track traded.\n\nAlso read: Music Industry Receptive To Blockchain Technology\n\nBittunes differs from Ujo and PeerTracks, companies trying to solve a similar problem.\n\n“We were approached by Mastercoin to do something similar – pre-sales and crowd sales – but we felt that these type of systems lacked the core strengths of Bitcoin, so would be unfair to our users,” Edhouse explains.\n\n“My worry is that these systems don’t have Bitcoin’s inbuilt scarcity and demonstrable value, and also its already very wide global reach,” he said.\n\nBittunes believes the Bitcoin blockchain is the best block chain, but also supports double-pegged Sidechains by Blockstream. The team believes that Sidechains and Lightning Networks will help them move Bittunes data to the block chain.\n\n“Bittunes excludes all major label music,” Edhouse says. “By doing so, we have begun to create one global marketplace using one rights system, (creative commons) which uses only one global currency: Bitcoin.” Bittunes is confident in this choice.\n\n“To us it’s obvious,” he concludes. “This is the only way to go.”\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Lit up. Image: Flickr/dierk schafer\n\nThe price of a bitcoin is a fickle thing. Two years ago this week, Bitcoin reached its highest price ever: $1,242 for a single coin in US dollars, up from $12 at the beginning of 2013. Almost immediately after that peak, the price began to sink, and today the virtual currency still hasn\'t regained its former glory. The price of a bitcoin simply continues to bob up and down, from around $200 to just above $400 this year alone.\n\nEvery dip in price elicits a state of emergency from some corners of the community, and the slightest rally has people losing their ever-loving shit. But for all the volatility, a concise explanation for Bitcoin\'s price changes hasn\'t been found. Is it shadowy Chinese ponzi schemes? Investor-driven speculation? Intentional market manipulation? Maybe Bitcoin really is the future after all?\n\nThe answer, it turns out, could be in our heads, because for every change in Bitcoin price, there are neurons that light up like a Christmas tree in response.\n\n""It\'s all in the brain""\n\n\n\nResearchers have done plenty of work analyzing the effects of changes in the stock market on the human brain, and vice-versa. The stock market\'s behaviour is ultimately the result of the collective decision-making of many people, after all (less so today now that high-frequency trading algorithms are popular), and decisions are physiological things; they happen in the brain. And just like the price of a stock, Bitcoin price is largely a function of the decisions people make.\n\n""It\'s all in the brain, and looking at specific regions that we know are carrying information about risk and reward is kind of like eavesdropping,"" said Dr. Gregory Berns, a neuroeconomist and director of the Center for Neuropolicy at Emory University. ""If one area seems to be the one that collects all the information from other brain systems, if you will, and integrates it, then it represents an overall barometer for that person at that point in time as to what their expectation is. So, we can listen to that and tease out what they\'re likely to do next.""\n\nAccording to Berns, information and expectation are the key things to consider when teasing out how firing neurons direct the market. Information guides your expectations, and depending on what your expectation is—whether Bitcoin is about to skyrocket or crash, say—a region in the brain called the striatum will react differently. The striatum is closely associated with decision-making, and has the densest collection of dopamine receptors in the brain, Berns said.\n\nThis neuroscience might, at least in part, explain some of Bitcoin\'s notorious highs and lows. Bitcoin still maintains a relatively small community of human users, at least compared to real-world stock markets. And while automated trading bots for Bitcoin certainly do exist—and according to Andrew Barisser, a developer at Bitcoin company Assembly who made his own trading bot earlier this year, some exchanges are ""rife"" with them—their widespread use in Bitcoin is nowhere nearly as well-documented as in the stock market.\n\nWatch more from Motherboard: Life Inside a Chinese Bitcoin Mine\n\n\n\n""The smaller the market, and anything with a greater role for human decision-making, is where you\'d see greater benefit for understanding the physiology,"" Berns said.\n\n""With Bitcoin, information is more scarce, in that each little bit of information that comes out has a potentially big effect on people\'s valuation of that thing,"" Berns explained, ""because of its history, and its past swings, people gravitate toward and grab onto any information they can, true or not.""\n\nWith every bit of news about new investors in Bitcoin, or perhaps the latest potential market scam or hack, the striatum of a bitcoin trader lights up with activity, and if they\'re expecting something positive, dopamine is released. En masse, this big dopamine rush can look like a price rally.\n\nBut again, the key word here is expectation—positive or negative information can have paradoxical effects in the brain, based on the person. If something ostensibly bad happens in Bitcoin—the bottom falls out of the price, for example—then someone\'s brain may actually respond as if that were a positive thing. What goes down must come up, and all that. It doesn\'t make much sense, but then again, neither neither do people or their brains.\n\n""It\'s illogical,"" Berns said, ""but then again people aren\'t exactly logical when it comes to money.""\n\nOr Bitcoin.', 'The European Union (EU) is years away from implementing a consistent framework for cryptocurrency regulation, according to a new report by the SWIFT Institute.\n\nThe report notes the lack of convincing arguments to include virtual currencies under the EU\'s current legal frameworks, set by the revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2) and the fourth European anti-money laundering directive (AMLD4).\n\nThe PSD2, adopted in the EU in October this year, consists of a new set of consumer payment protection rules, which seek to promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments.\n\nMeanwhile, the AMLD4 has been produced in line with recommendations issued by Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) in 2012 to enhance the EU\'s AML (Anti Money Laundering) and CTF (Counter-Terrorist Financing) laws.\n\nThe report reads:\n\n"" ... recent legislative procedures – such as those for the AMLD4 and PSD2 – have not paid sufficient attention to this development, thus leaving virtual currencies largely untouched. While the AMLD4 could be construed to extend to virtual currencies, the precise degree to which will succeed in deterring their abuse for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes remains to be seen.""\n\n""Third, future legislation – such as the potential EMD3 – remains a development to be watched closely,"" notes the report, adding:\n\n""However, in order for a potential new legislative framework regarding e-money to extend to virtual currencies, a more fundamental reconfiguration of the very notion of e-money is needed.""\n\nWith multipurpose prepaid cards having lost the field and network-based money services coming closer and closer to being payment services, the original purposes of the e-money framework are quickly losing their relevance, it argues.\n\n""A reorientation toward virtual currencies could then bring new life to this notion, and extend the legal framework to include recent developments such as cryptocurrencies,"" says the report.\n\nThe SWIFT Institute, which was set up by SWIFT to fund independent research, has separately embarked on research campaigns aimed at bitcoin and blockchain technology, launching a grant in July of last year.\n\nThe new working paper aims to offer recommendations for financial practitioners and regulators, according to the organization.\n\nInternational approach\n\nThe report then looks at the way in which virtual currency regulation has been approached by stakeholders in the US.\n\n""[In the US], financial regulators have already undertaken efforts at bringing certain virtual currency service providers – mainly the virtual currency exchanges – under the existing legal frameworks regarding money services business,"" explains the report.\n\nAlthough these attempts first started at the federal level, the report notes, they are now finding their way to the state-level in New York – which introduced the BitLicense – and California.\n\nFurther, the report notes that there is an opportunity for international cooperation to regulate cryptocurrencies:\n\n""The regulatory approach followed in the US shows a number of clear similarities to the EU\'s own legal framework on payment services. It could therefore be envisioned that an overhaul of the e-money framework would eventually lead to a similar legal regime for virtual currencies as what is currently proposed in the US.""\n\n""This approach could also hold potential for other countries that are still struggling to grasp this matter, as can be seen in the Asian markets. Moreover, given then inherent international scope of virtual currencies, a more unified stance on this matter would serve to support international cooperation,"" it continues, concluding:\n\n""Stronger international cooperation can be held to be imperative in order to successfully impose and enforce AML and CFT [Counter Terrorism Financing] rules for virtual currencies.""\n\nFor more information, read the full report below:\n\nSIWP No 2015 001 AML Risks of the Third Party Payment Providers FINAL\n\nEU flag image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The stoppage came into effect on 12th November.\n\nAs a result, BitPesa and Lipisha are facing significant challenges to maintaining their business. A lawyer for the two firms told the Daily Nation that BitPesa is ""at risk of collapse"" because it\'s now unable to conduct its business.\n\nThe two firms sued Safaricom for infringing on their rights to acquire and own property, fair administration and economic interests.\n\nBitPesa uses Lipisha as a payment gateway to enable transfers and conversions of bitcoin into other currencies, including Kenyan shillings on Safaricom\'s mobile money platform M-Pesa.\n\nSafaricom argument at hearing\n\nDuring the hearing on Tuesday, Safaricom argued that the suspension of service to Lipisha was justified because of anti-money laundering rules.\n\nThe mobile money operator claimed that Bitpesa had failed to obtain authorisation for bitcoin transfers from Kenya\'s central bank. As a result, Bitpesa\'s transactions through Lipisha and its account at Safaricom contravened AML rules.\n\nBut a lawyer for the two firms said Safaricom had misunderstood the central bank\'s requirements.\n\n""[The central bank] told BitPesa that bitcoins are not regulated in Kenya but Safaricom insists that it produces a licence to that effect,"" the firms\' lawyer, Kiragu Kimani, said, according to the Daily Nation.\n\nThe court will rule on the case on 14th December, but the service suspension will remain in place in the meantime.\n\nElizabeth Rossiello, CEO and co-founder of BitPesa, said in a statement to CoinDesk:\n\n""I do not wish to comment much on a matter in court. BitPesa has been wronged, which is why we have referred the matter to court. I am deeply disappointed that the media continues to publish incorrect information that diverts from the evidence submitted to the court, but we will let the court determine the matter. We remain confident that even a small company like BitPesa will gain a fair trial and look forward to the court\'s decision.""\n\nRossiello did not immediately respond when asked to elaborate on what media reports with ""incorrect information"" she was referring to. Neither Kimani nor Safaricom responded to a request for comment from CoinDesk.\n\nA significant case\n\nA ruling favourable to BitPesa and Lipisha could trigger a spike in interest from international digital currency firms, said Michael Kimani, an independent payments analyst in Kenya.\n\n""This is a significant case. If the ruling seems favourable, you could see other businesses coming here. You would be able to do bitcoin to Airtel Money, to Orange Money. It\'s M-Pesa that seems to be the contentious one,"" he said.\n\nM-Pesa is the dominant mobile money player in Kenya, accounting for two-thirds of the market, according to the Competition Authority of Kenya. Its competitors are mobile money platforms from carriers Airtel and Orange.\n\nMobile money is a key channel in Kenya\'s payment landscape. Mobile money transaction volume was more than double that of payment cards in Kenya in 2013, according to the Kenyan central bank.\n\nBitPesa – which raised $1.1 million from Pantera Capital and others in February – offers bitcoin trading and money transfer services in four African countries.\n\nLipisha is a payments gateway launched in 2012 with funding from Growth Africa, Village Capital and Met Fund.\n\nFeatured image: Flickr / Whiteafrican\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'When it gets talked about at all outside of hard-core programming circles, the term “blockchain” is usually used in the context of Bitcoin, the virtual currency that some see as the future of money. But some independent musicians are hopeful that blockchain technology can do more than just create a new monetary or financial standard — they hope it can help them reinvent the music business.\n\nAlthough they are often used interchangeably, bitcoin and the blockchain are separate things. Bitcoin is the currency — a form of digital peer-to-peer money that doesn’t require a financial intermediary like a bank — and the blockchain is a way of storing information about Bitcoin transactions in a database.\n\nSince a blockchain database is both distributed (that is, identical and interconnected versions of it are hosted in multiple locations) and encrypted, transactions and other information are easy to track and hard to tamper with.\n\nSinger Imogen Heap and violinist Zoe Keating say using the blockchain \xad— along with Bitcoin or some other payment method — gives them an opportunity to go directly to their fans for support. Instead of having to use a record label or a platform like iTunes or Spotify, they can sell their work to individual users.\n\n“I thought, wouldn’t it be nice if I could decide what I wanted to do with my music?” Heap said at a recent Guardian Live event. “I might decide, today’s my birthday, I’m going to give all of my music to everyone for free today. At the moment, I can’t do that. Because it’s out there, and once it’s out there, I don’t really have a say in it any more.”\n\nHeap recently released a new song, Tiny Human, using blockchain technology and crypto-currency payments. And she has said she wants to build a similar distributed music database for artists that she calls Mycelia.\n\nThe idea, she says, would be to create a system of identifying everyone who was involved in a piece of music, along with how they would be compensated for the finished song — as well as rules around how and where and when the music could be used, either for free or in return for a fee.\n\nMORE: Now you can tip your favorite musician… in bitcoin\n\nKeating, a Canadian-born musician and composer, said that her ideas about what might be possible with Bitcoin and the blockchain were sparked in part by the recent Blockchain Summit, which billionaire Virgin founder Richard Branson held on Necker Island, his private getaway in the Caribbean.\n\n“I can imagine a ledger of all that information and an ecosystem of killer apps to visualize usage and relationships,” Keating told Forbes. “I can imagine a music exchange where the real value of a song could be calculated on the fly. I can imagine instant, frictionless micropayments and the ability to pay collaborators and investors in future earnings without it being an accounting nightmare.”\n\nHeap worked with Ethereum, which is building a blockchain-based file-sharing social network, to come up with her latest digital release. And she also worked with Ujo, a service that uses Ethereum’s blockchain platform to allow musicians and other artists to record and publish rules on how they want their music to be used.\n\nUsing this system, users can download Heap’s song and pay for it using Ethereum’s version of Bitcoin (called Ether), but other musicians can also download tracks of specific instruments and pay for the right to use them in their own music. Others exploring the use of blockchain and Bitcoin for music include Bittunes, which allows musicians and their fans to both get paid in Bitcoin for sharing music, and PeerTracks.\n\nHeap told the Guardian Live audience that she sees blockchain databases controlled by individual musicians and artists not just as a way to ensure they get paid, but a way of disrupting the entire outdated music industry.\n\n“It feels as if the music industry is a complete mess, a rusty, overstretched, tired machine,” she said. “Grappling with a lot of old crooked contracts that don’t reflect our times, music services that run on greed to please shareholders smothered in buy-buy-buy adverts, dated accounting setups favouring anyone but the artist thanks to gross inefficiencies, confusing royalty statements and delayed payments… plus patchy copyright databases. It is almost impossible to find out who REALLY gets what.”\n\nYou can follow Mathew Ingram on Twitter at @mathewi, and read all of his posts here or via his RSS feed.

More than 296,000 consumers rated over 400 online stores across 30 categories. Participants were asked to consider value for money, prices, discounts, assortment, delivery and customer service.\n\nWhile FonQ.nl is the first site in the group to accept bitcoin as a payment option, the site is a relatively small part of a much larger business.\n\nFonQ operates four online stores, fonQ.nl in the Netherlands, fonQ.be in Belgium, fonQ.fr in France, and fonQ.de in Germany. Customers can also buy fonQ products across europe, through local Amazon websites.\n\nIn winning the Webshop Award, the site beat Bol.com, Hema, IKEA and Wehkamp. The later is owned by the same parent company, RFS Holland Holding (RFS).\n\nRFS is the second largest Dutch e-commerce company, with three major online subsidiaries, all headquartered in the Netherlands; Wehkamp, fonQ, and Create2fit.\n\nThe Twinkle100, which lists the largest online retailers in the Netherlands, ranks RFS as the second largest online retailers in the country this year.\n\nAhold, which operates bol.com, the number one online retailer in the Netherlands, tops the chart with €910m in revenue. Amazon and eBay are minor players in the Dutch e-commerce market and did not make the list.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the RFS subsidiaries, Wehkamp is the best known, and generates the most revenue for the company. This e-retailer, which counts ~90% of all Dutch households as customers, offers more than 180,000 different products from more than 2,000 national and international brands. Create2fit, a separate subsidiary, operates eight specialized Internet shops.\n\nWehkamp’s revenue in the 2014/2015 financial year was €546 million, which accounted for approximately 77% of RFS’ total revenue - €711 million. FonQ generated just over €49 million in 2014.\n\nHowever, fonQ has consistently shown the highest sales growth rate of the group. In 2014, fonQ.nl’s sales grew 35 percent. For the first half of 2015, its sale increased 25 percent, which is much higher than Wehkamp’s 9 percent increase in the same period.\n\nAccording to CEO Patrick Kerssemakers, Patrick Kerssemakers more than half the sites traffic comes from tablets and smartphones.\n\n- Patrick Kerssemakers, fonQ.nl CEO\n\nAlongside the adoption of mobile technology, the Netherlands has also been quick to adopt bitcoin. Arnhem, a large city in the East, has been labelled as ""The world\'s most Bitcoin-friendly city,"" by a local group running the arnhembitcoinstad.nl website.\n\nThe “Bitcoincity” project was started in May 2014, by bitcoin enthusiasts who started out by giving lectures about the currency and technology. They soon wound up running their own Bitpay-like payment processing company, BitKassa.\n\nAfter being inspired by a similar project in Berlin’s suburb of Kreutzberg, the Arnhem team decided to canvas the neighborhood for local vendors who would accept bitcoin. They literally walked into every establishment on the busiest Arnhem streets, and asked store owners to start accepting bitcoin, teaching as much as they could along the way.\n\nWithin just a few months, Bitcoincity surpassed their German counterparts efforts, establishing a higher density of bitcoin accepting merchants. A year ago, they persuaded a local Spar franchisee to start accepting bitcoin too. The project has been growing ever since.\n\nToday, coinmap shows over 100 bitcoin vendors in Arnhem, all with a physical brick-and-mortar presence. This high concentration makes the city one of the most densely-packed for bitcoin adoption globally, even ahead of Aracaju, Brazil, where we’ve seen unusually effective bitcoin merchant adoption efforts.\n\nSince most of Arnhems vendors use the BitKassa platform, the Bitcoincity team is able to provide some statistics on bitcoin sales.\n\nWith over €3,000 in sales so far this month, it is becoming clear that Arnhem bitcoiners have an appetite for spending the digital currency, and aren\'t just holding it as an investment.\n\nOf course, Arnhem is just one city. Amsterdam has another 45 merchants, according to Coinmap, and there are even more spread across the countryside too.\n\nIt helps that there are often other bitcoin-related activities nearby. A year ago, an event called ""Bitcoin Congress,” sponsored by Dutch state-owned megabank ABN Amro, was held in Amsterdam.\n\nThe local University in Arnhem is also involved, claiming to have given 500 students two Euros worth of BTC each, last year. Although the effectiveness of a public ‘air drop’ like this one is still in question, it\'s clear that Arnhem’s next generation is going to find it easier to understand, acquire, and spend the digital currency.\n\nMeanwhile, RFS is undergoing some internal changes. In July, leading international private equity company Apax Partners reached an agreement with RFS\' shareholders to acquire the company. “The injection of capital from and expertise of Apax Partners will enable Wehkamp to implement innovations even faster with an emphasis on customer experience, a broader assortment and the best service,” states RFS press release.\n\nThe internal changes appear to have had a positive effect on the company\'s bottom line. RFS has seen a healthy profit of €46 million during the 2014/2015 financial year, although this includes pre-July figures.\n\nOver the past year, fonQ.nl has also been focused on improving its services, and boosting revenue. The site has introduced Sunday deliveries and has been promoting brand awareness through a national TV ad campaign. Now, fonQ seems to be trying to edge out the competition by offering bitcoin as a payment option.\n\nIf fonQ sees positive growth from offering bitcoin payment, it is conceivable that RFS would add bitcoin payment options to its other ecommerce stores, including wehkamp, providing 90% of Dutch households with further exposure to bitcoin.\n\nFor customers looking to find another Black Friday deal, FonQ.nl is offering a Black Friday discount of €10 off on a minimum purchase of €75, some brands excluded. With this new payment option, “Bitcoin users in Europe can start their Christmas shopping early,” tweeted Bitpay.', 'Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of industry media coverage and its impact.\n\nThe good news is that bitcoin\'s association with terrorism and Daesh played a somewhat smaller part in this week\'s coverage.\n\nAlthough some of the narrative spilled over from last week, and the news did travel far and wide, most mainstream outlets seemed to focus on the digital currency\'s price in light of the Black Friday shopping event.\n\nMore interestingly, however, was Motherboard\'s piece which united the digital currency and the human brain to ascertain the impact of its volatility on individuals.\n\nWho said what and where?

The price of a bitcoin simply continues to bob up and down, from around $200 to just above $400 this year alone.""\n\nEvery value decrease, the piece adds, elicits a ""state of emergency"" from some members of the bitcoin community and the slightest increase in value, has people ""losing their ever-loving shit.""\n\nDespite its volatility, however, the piece points out that there seems to be no explanation for its changing price. Could it have something to do with Chinese ponzi schemes, investor-driven speculation or international market manipulation? Perhaps, the reporter adds, bitcoin is the future after all, adding:\n\n""The answer, it turns out, could be in our heads, because for every change in Bitcoin price, there are neurons that light up like a Christmas tree in response.""\n\nNow, the real interesting stuff begins. Researchers have, the article notes, conducted a vast amount of work into analysing the effects of changes in the stock market on the human brain, and vice versa.\n\n""The stock market\'s behaviour is ultimately the result of the collective decision-making of many people, after all (less so today now that high-frequency trading algorithms are popular), and decisions are physiological things; they happen in the brain.

The striatum associated with decision-making, and has the densest collection of dopamine receptors in the brain,"" he said.\n\nNeuroscience, the author notes, may help to explain some of bitcoin\'s volatility but the digital currency only has a relatively small community of users, in comparison to the real-world stock markets.\n\nBerns added:\n\n“The smaller the market, and anything with a greater role for human decision-making, is where you’d see greater benefit for understanding the physiology. With bitcoin, information is more scarce, in that each little bit of information that comes out has a potentially big effect on people\'s valuation of that thing ... because of its history, and its past swings, people gravitate toward and grab onto any information they can, true or not.""\n\nHe continued: ""With every bit of news about new investors in bitcoin, or perhaps the latest potential market scam or hack, the striatum of a bitcoin trader lights up with activity, and if they\'re expecting something positive, dopamine is release. En masse, this big dopamine rush can look like a price rally.""\n\nAgain, Berns explained that expectation is key. Positive or negative information, he added, can have paradoxical effects on an individual\'s brain, noting:""If something ostensibly bad happens in bitcoin – the bottom falls out of the price, for example – then someone\'s brain may actually respond as if that were a positive thing.""\n\n""It\'s illogical,"" he continued. ""But then again people aren\'t exactly logical when it comes to money.""\n\n""Or Bitcoin,"" closes Pearson.\n\nBitcoin Black Friday\n\nThe digital currency\'s price also made a cameo appearance this week in light of Bitcoin Black Friday, a day of discounted online shopping for bitcoin paying customers.\n\nWriting for Inverse, Peter Rugg questioned whether the event could serve to throw the digital currency into the mainstream, whilst also impacting on its value.\n\nHe wrote: ""Bitcoin Black Friday: The fourth-annual event is projected to include more than 150 participating stores, and if history is any indication could affect the price of the digital currency.""\n\nHistorically, Rugg continued, the event has caused a spike in the cryptocurrency\'s value:\n\n""About this time in 2014, bitcoin prices were roughly at $350 before going to $380 on Bitcoin Black Friday, a jump that also happened the year before. One reason for this could be the media hyping the upcoming event and getting bitcoin into the mind of consumers, but another might be that people who spent bitcoin on Black Friday deals tended to buy the coins right back, potentially driving up the price.""\n\nAt the time of writing, bitcoin\'s price looked relatively stable, hovering at around the $360 mark, although it did surge by 12% yesterday, hitting a weekly high.\n\nHuman brain image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The two companies announced in October that Barclays would work with Chainalysis, a graduate of its New York-based FinTech accelerator, to allow its financial crimes division to better understand the technology.\n\nNow, there are signs that this partnership may be the start of a larger strategy that could be embraced by major banks. For example, Israel-based bitcoin compliance startup Polycoin was recently accepted into two incubators, one backed by financial services giant Citi and the other by Nordic banking conglomerate Nordea.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Polycoin CEO Alfred Shaffir indicated that he believes partnerships with compliance startups will be a necessary first step for any bank seeking to become more active in their work with the technology.\n\nShaffir told CoinDesk:\n\n“We feel that the moment [banks] start working with the blockchain, they will need a compliance tool.”\n\nPolycoin touts a full solution for blockchain compliance, with Shaffir noting that the firm wants to become the NICE Actimize for bitcoin, a nod to the digital financial crime prevention tool founded in the late 1990s.\n\nThe startup was selected to be one of 10 participants in the Nordea accelerator this October, and was chosen out of 170 applicants. The company is also simultaneously participating in the Citi innovation accelerator, its fourth in Israel.\n\nTimely pivot\n\nOriginally founded as a bitcoin payment processing startup in 2014, Polycoin pivoted this summer amidst the overall downturn in consumer bitcoin spending.\n\n“Bitcoin impacted our decision. We understand that there was a huge problem creating an economy around bitcoin,” Shaffir said.\n\nHowever, Shaffir was able to identify a potential use case for part of its existing payment processing product. In addition to a merchant tool similar to those offered by BitPay and Coinbase, Polycoin allowed compliance officers at retailers to learn more about where funds they received were originating.\n\n“We decided not to focus on the bitcoin itself but rather on the technology supporting it,” Shaffir explained. “So we took the core technology, now it’s not a merchant tool, but it's a tool for compliance officers within banks.”\n\nShaffir views Polycoin’s advantage over its competitors to be its focus on know-your-customer (KYC) compliance as opposed to strict anti-money laundering (AML), and its ability to deal with potential identity fraud.\n\nPolycoin said it expects to graduate from the Citi accelerator in December and exit the Nordea accelerator in February.\n\nAccelerator image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Many of the start-ups that find unique uses for the technology are located in Israel, according to Meni Rosenfeld, chairman of the Israel Bitcoin Association.\n\n“There’s no question that blockchain technology, which is one of the basic features of the bitcoin system, will have a major impact on the world economy,” Rosenfeld told The Times of Israel. “It’s at least as important as the concept of the bitcoin as an independent means of exchange.”\n\nGet The Start-Up Israel's Daily Start-Up by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nRosenfeld spoke on the sidelines of “Bitcoin and Beyond,” the biggest annual event on bitcoin and associated technology in Israel. “Actually, it was somewhat bigger last year,” Rosenfeld said of this year’s event, which attracted around 400 people. It’s not that people were scared off by some of the big bitcoin “scandals,” such as the alleged theft and eventual bankruptcy of the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, Rosenfeld added.\n\n“There was a bigger hype factor regarding bitcoin over the past few years, but now that people know what it is — and what its capabilities and limitations are — that’s calmed down a bit. That’s better for the industry, because the ones who remain in the business are serious about it,” he went on.\n\nThat seriousness showed itself in some of the start-ups that are using blockchain technology in innovative ways — far from its original purpose, as the security engine of bitcoin. “In a blockchain, all payments — or, in our case, documents — have to be approved by all parties involved, and any changes made along the way are detected immediately,” said Gadi Ruschin, CEO of Israeli start-up Wave, which is applying the technology to the shipping industry.\n\nUnlike an electronic version of a document, such as a PDF, which can be copied umpteen times, a blockchain-approved document is a single, one-of-a-kind product, because it needs the electronic “signature” of everyone involved.\n\nWave uses that blockchain concept to connect carriers, banks, forwarders, traders and other parties of the international trading supply chain via the bill of lading — the official document used throughout the supply chain. “Since everyone is approving it, everyone can trust it,” said Ruschin. “Thus we can send a bill of lading in this manner and satisfy all the security and data issues, and eliminate the long, drawn-out process of passing the bill around.”\n\nAnother company that uses the blockchain for a beyond-bitcoin application — or rather, numerous applications — is Colu, a company that has developed an engine based on blockchain technology that can be deployed as an API for use in many scenarios to create digital assets. Such assets could include tickets, money, car registration and ownership documents — or even music.\n\n“We work with a company called Revelator, which provides sales and marketing intelligence for the independent music business,” said David Ring, the cofounder & vice president of R&D at Colu, which is developing a rights management API for Revelator that provides secure issuance and distribution of digital assets, including listing and registration of musical works for clients.\n\n“When a songwriter or producer puts a digital copy of their work on their Revelator account, the firm secures it with our blockchain platform, which ensures that they are in control of their work. If anyone tries to access it without permission, their digital signature shows up on the work, so the creator knows who violated their rights,” explained Ring.\n\nColu is also using its platform to help actualize the ultimate bitcoin fantasy. Working with authorities in several small countries in the Caribbean and the online exchange Bitt, Colu is developing a platform for a bitcoin-style dollar that will be legal tender — as opposed to “funny money,” viewed suspiciously in other countries such as the US, where the greenback is the only instrument that can be termed money.\n\n‘“They are doing this to serve the many people in the region who have no bank accounts, but do have smartphones and cellphones — which means they can have digital wallets. Blockchain technology ensures secure transfer and storage of funds. The digital cash will be converted into bills at ATM machines and other outlets,” Ring went on.\n\nClearly, bitcoin and blockchain technology have a lot of unexplored potential. And to draw that potential out into the open, said Eden Shochat, the Aleph venture capital fund is offering $50,000 to companies that can help solve issues that are preventing bitcoin tech from making an impact as a possible means of exchange. Those problems, said Shochat, a founding partner at Aleph, will be suggested by contestants — as will the solution.\n\n“At Aleph, we invest in start-ups that bring change to industries that are still doing things the old way,” said Shochat. “We believe that bitcoin and blockchain tech can bring change to the financial industry, as well as to others. What we’re looking for is an idea that’s not just better, but different and better. If you want to really make an impact on the market, it’s not enough to develop a way to do the same thing better. You need an idea that’s really different, and that’s what we believe bitcoin and blockchain can provide.”"", 'Although bitcoin addresses are composed of randomly generated hexadecimal characters, which are unrelated to one’s id, anyone can see each and every transaction on the public ledger, so the flow of bitcoins from an address to another along the blockchain is visible to everyone. Solely, the hexadecimal characters of a given address can never be used to identify the person using it to send or receive bitcoins. However, a bitcoin address can be linked to a specific individual based on past transactions via blockchain analysis, Googling btc addresses, surveillance and hacking with extraction of addresses. Most professional bitcoiners use a new address for each incoming and outcoming transaction to minimize tracing and endorse the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nSo, how can you completely “anonymize” your bitcoin transactions and cover any traces that can link your bitcoin address to your real identity?\n\nEffacing Bitcoin Transactions:\n\nThe blockchain has been scripted in a manner that ensures that the history of all transactions is broadcast on the public ledger. Conjecturally, one can choose which coins to spend and generate new addresses to minimize the amount of leaked information that can be used to trace the spender. However, the current bitcoin-qt wallet doesn’t fully support this, yet top online wallets e.g. blockchain.info fully support such spending behavior.\n\nA bitcoin address is more vulnerable to be traced when it is posted online, or when the attacker spoofs identifying info via other means such as social engineering.\n\nThe following are the best ways you can use to airbrush your bitcoin transactions:\n\nProtect your IP from being phsihed using proxies, VPN or TOR browser; generate a new address for each ingoing and outgoing transaction and never post your bitcoin address publicly online. Send your coins to an online wallet, then create a new address(es) and withdraw your coins from your online wallet to it along 4-7 days. Buy altcoins with your bitcoins (look for less volatile altcoins to minimize losses e.g. litecoin) and then sell them for bitcoins in 2-3 days and send your bitcoins to a brand new address. Bitcoin mixing services. CoinJoin\n\nBitcoin Mixing Services:\n\nBitcoin mixers can be very handy in covering the tracks of your bitcoin transactions, yet you have to use them at your own discretion, because you may never see your coins again, if you pick a fraudulent bitcoin mixer!!\n\nYou register an account with the btc mixing service you choose and then deposit your coins to the address designated to your account. After your bitcoins are added to your account, schedule multiple withdrawals to your brand new bitcoin addresses. A bitcoin mixer splits your withdrawals randomly according to the amount of each withdrawal and the number of outgoing transactions. Moreover, the timings of your withdrawals will be randomized as well over your specified time window.\n\nCoinJoin\n\nCoinJoin is a strategy that compresses bitcoin transactions in order to endorse privacy via excluding unnecessary data. A coinjoin transaction takes place when multiple individuals have agreed to formulate a single bitcoin transaction, provided that some of the outgoing transactions share a similar value. Accordingly, observing of the transactions along the blockchain can never link any of the outgoing transactions to its corresponding sender. Coinjoin is a privacy solution that doesn’t involve any modification of the bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe below diagram illustrates a coinjoin transaction that was arranged to pay 0.8 bitcoin to two bitcoin addresses anonymously.\n\nCoinJoin Transaction (source Bitcoin Wiki)\n\nConclusion:\n\nBitcoin transactions are not completely anonymous, as they are thought to be, as blockchain analysis, google searches and social engineering can help identify the sender of a given amount of coins. Concealing your IP, using new addresses for each transaction, bitcoin mixers and coinjoin transactions are effective ways that can help anonymize your transactions.\n\nReferences:\n\n1- Bitcoin Wiki – CoinJoin\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin\n\n2- Bitcoin Wiki – Anonymity\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity', 'A plan to modernise the London Market – the major international insurance market based in the United Kingdom\'s capital – may include recommendations to use blockchain technology to improve data access and reduce costs associated with administrative paperwork.\n\nLloyd\'s, one of the London Market\'s key participants, held a seminar in London last week to highlight blockchains, among other technologies, to insurance market participants as part of their modernisation plan, called the Target Operating Model, or TOM.\n\nBlockchains could bring increased risk-recording abilities, transparency, accuracy and speed to the insurance markets, Lloyd\'s director of operations, Shirine Khoury-Haq told CoinDesk in a statement.\n\nKhoury-Haq elaborated on the insurance market\'s interest in blockchains:\n\n""Blockchain has the potential to improve the way insurers record risk, increasing the speed, accuracy and transparency of our processes. As part of the TOM consultation we will be interested to see how blockchain could help us resolve some of the challenges facing our industry.”\n\nThe two blockchain use-cases floated at the seminar were for blockchain-powered digital \'deal rooms\', where documents can be securely shared and logged, and a new token on a permissioned ledger for insurance markets. The ideas were presented by Michael Mainelli, an emeritus professor at Gresham College and executive chairman of Z/Yen, a think-tank and venture capital firm.\n\nBlockchain-powered deal-rooms\n\nMainelli said online digital deal-rooms could significantly change the way business is currently done in the London Market. While such technology already exists, few market participants make use of it.\n\nInstead, they rely on physical proximity to one another, personal relationships and paper documents to get deals done, he said.\n\n""Everyone [in the market] works within three minutes of Lloyds, but they also know they\'re dirt if they renege on a contract. Within hours everyone will freeze them out,"" Mainelli added.\n\nBut an online deal-room using a blockchain could make the London Market more attractive to international business, which could drive significant growth for Lloyd\'s and the London Market, he pointed out.\n\n""If we were sitting in Hong Kong right now and decided to create a global insurance market, we could build a quick deal-room and we would automate it from the start,"" added Mainelli.\n\nA blockchain-based deal-room would strip out the need to trust an intermediary while providing an accurate record of the documents shared by the deal\'s participants.\n\n""It gives you a database that\'s unalterable and nobody owns. It\'s a ledger of who sent what to whom, when, forever. That\'s an important part [of the insurance process],"" Mainelli said.\n\nMoving away from paper\n\nThe other technologies presented at the Lloyd\'s seminar included peer-to-peer lending and alternative cross-border payments. The seminar\'s goal was to debate the ""risks and rewards of technological disruption"" with a view to implementing some of those ideas in the modernisation plan.\n\nThe TOM is a five-year plan to ""support the ease of doing business"" in the London Market. It kicked off this year with a goal to develop a roadmap for the initiative. Next year, a governance structure will be set up to implement the recommendations over the next three years.\n\nThe end-result of TOM would be a ""one touch, unified and intelligent"" approach for the London Markets with a strong emphasis on updating the technologies in use by market participants.\n\nThe plan is driven by the London Market Group, an industry advocacy organisation that counts the market\'s major participants among its members.\n\nAlthough the LMG\'s modernisation plans are both ambitious and laudable, Mainelli cautions against putting too much stock in an outcome that will move the insurance markets away from its favoured technology: paper.\n\n""They always have these reform programmes. None of these have ever bitten. The quickest way to see that is to walk through Leadenhall Market and see all these guys carrying stacks of paper around,"" he concluded.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

11/28/2015,"['Though bitcoin regulation remains a divisive topic globally, there\'s perhaps no country that has kept the international bitcoin community guessing about the digital currency\'s future more than Russia.\n\nFor more than a year, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the nation\'s economic lawmaking body, has been repeatedly and staunchly against allowing its use as an alternative to government-issued money. Just last month, for example, deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev told CoinDesk that the Ministry was working on a draft law that would seek to punish those converting cryptocurrencies into the ruble with up to four years in prison.\n\nOutside of these statements, however, the agency\'s opinion on bitcoin as a financial technology has been less clear.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Moiseev said that his office was dealing with bitcoin and its underlying technology in different ways:\n\n""We feel that blockchain technology is very important in the development of various Internet-based services.""\n\nNonetheless, Moiseev remained vocal about the dangers of bitcoin as a means for facilitating payments, though his comments displayed a less aggressive stance than has been outwardly projected by his agency.\n\n""We appreciate the potential relevance of blockchain technology for the development of e-commerce and therefore we feel that it should be allowed and developed, but bitcoin themselves, in particular, the implementation of the bitcoin transactions into the real economy, in the real banking system can be very dangerous,"" he concluded.\n\nMoiseev also elaborated on the reasons the Ministry of Finance believes new rules are necessary, citing the digital currency\'s association with money laundering and terrorism financing. But while Russia may be looking to potentially criminalise bitcoin-to-fiat conversions, Moiseev said that he did not perceive bitcoin to be a threat to Russia\'s national currency.\n\nBitcoin and terrorism\n\nSince its emergence government regulators have struggled to determine how best to regulate digital currencies, and whether new laws need to be applied to businesses using the technology.\n\nNew York, for example, introduced unique state law governing its use, but despite its early movement on this issue, other US states have largely sought to update or apply past statutes to cover the technology.\n\nOf the government organizations that have issued comments on digital currency, many are concerned about that the payment method is being used by cybercriminals, the evidence of which has encouraged fears bitcoin could be leveraged by terrorists, a view that has been given new attention in the wake of last week\'s terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\nThe topic of terrorism is clearly on Moiseev\'s mind as well, as the deputy finance minister expressed concerns about bitcoin potentially making the country\'s financial system more vulnerable to exploitation:\n\n""We are very concerned about the potential developments there as we have built serious system of protection against money laundering and financing terrorism using conventional banking system. We are quite afraid of opening this window up by allowing a free convertibility of bitcoins into rubles and back.""\n\nHe then went one step further, noting that Russia was monitoring how bitcoin was being regulated by its contemporaries in both Europe and elsewhere.\n\n""We are looking at how bitcoins are being regulated, how they are being protected from potential abuse by money launderers and terrorists,"" he added.\n\nCrypto in Russia\n\nDespite adding clarity to the conversation, Moissev\'s comments don\'t successfully foretell how the technology will be regulated in Russia.\n\nRussia\'s central bank has indicated it is against measures that would outlaw its use, and the organization\'s view was supported by President Vladimir Putin when he discussed digital currencies for the first time in July this year.\n\nAt the time, Putin backed the Bank of Russia\'s advocacy for the technology but also implied that bitcoin is ""backed by nothing"", and thus might require special oversight.\n\nAlthough bitcoin\'s future remains uncertain in Russia, it is perhaps safe to say that crypto enthusiasts can remain at ease at least for now. The draft law – which would criminalise bitcoin conversions – pursued by the Ministry of Finance is being reviewed by the Cabinet, a process which is expected to take a few months, and will then have to be submitted to the country\'s Parliament for final approval.\n\nFor a more detailed look at bitcoin\'s history in Russia check out our interactive timeline.\n\nRussia flag image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Pero, ¿Qué es un Bitcoin y cómo funciona? ¿Es legal? Hoy te responderemos a todas las dudas que puedas tener sobre estas criptodivisas.\n\nEsta una moneda virtual e intangible fue creada en 2009 por Satoshi Nakamoto. El nombre es el pseudónimo de una persona o entidad que decidió crear un tipo de dinero digital que sirviera, única y exclusivamente, para poder realizar operaciones por Internet.\n\nTodo el proceso está sustentado en la red P2P, la misma que se usa para los famosos archivos torrent.\n\nSi un usuario quiere comenzar a usar Bitcoins, debe hacerse con una cartera virtual especial para este tipo de moneda, que es un software que instalas en un dispositivo. Esta billetera genera una dirección única y específica para el cliente, la misma que se utilizará para hacer transacciones. Cada una de estas carteras cuenta con una llave privada que se usa para hacer firmas digitales que verifican la identidad y evita que se produzcan alteraciones.\n\nTodas las transacciones de estas criptodivisas son verificadas usando un registro público compartido, llamado blockchain. Así se comprueba que un usuario tiene la cantidad de bitcoins que se quiere gastar.\n\nEsto se mantiene gracias a una red de ordenadores distribuidos alrededor del mundo. ¿Qué implica esto? Que es una moneda descentralizada y que no está controlada por ningún gobierno. Por consecuencia, es un tipo de dinero internacional y anónimo, que no necesita un banco como intermediario.\n\nAdemás, al tratarse de transacciones anónimas y cifradas entre dos usuarios, están libres de impuestos o comisiones.\n\nPor esa razón, las bitcoins se han convertido en un método de pago recurrente para transacciones de dudosa legalidad, como es el blanqueo de capitales. Eso no quiere decir que todos sus usos se encuentren al margen de la ley.\n\nEl valor de Bitcoin es muy volátil, ya que se basa en la oferta y la demanda, y se calcula mediante un algoritmo que mide la cantidad de movimientos y transacciones con este tipo de monedas en tiempo real.\n\nActualmente su valor se sitúa en torno a los 300 euros, aproximadamente.\n\nPero, ¿Cómo podemos obtener Bitcoins? Actualmente hay tres formas: la primera, y más sencilla, es comprarlos a través de webs, como Bitcoin.com, o cajeros automáticos que intercambien dinero real, como euros o dólares, por Bitcoins. Podemos encontrarnos con uno de estos cajeros en España o en Inglaterra.\n\nTambién tendremos la posibilidad de “minarlos”, que consiste en utilizar una parte de recursos de nuestro ordenador para la resolución de problemas matemáticos complejos a cambio de recoger este tipo de dinero virtual, pero no es rentable realizar el proceso con un ordenador doméstico, ya que las ganancias son mínimas.\n\nComo tercera y última opción, podremos intercambiarlos a cambio de objetos o trabajo.\n\nComo curiosidad, deciros que se emiten 25 bitcoins cada 10 minutos y solo en España se realizan más de 100.000 transacciones diarias.\n\nSi aún te quedan dudas sobre qué son las Bitcoins o cómo funcionan, echa un vistazo a nuestro vídeo.', 'Bitnation, the decentralised governance project which offers blockchain IDs and Bitcoin debit cards to refugees, has done a deal with Estonia to offer a Public Notary to e-Residents.\n\nStarting December 1 2015, the blockchain notary service will allow e-residents, regardless of where they live or do business, to notarise their marriages, birth certificates, business contracts and more, on the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain is a public ledger distributed across hundreds of thousands of computers around the world. The distributed and immutable nature of this public notary makes it more secure than any notary currently offered by traditional nation states.\n\nThe Estonian e-Residency programme is far and away the most advanced of its kind on the planet. This agreement takes that a step further into wholesale decentralisation.\n\nBitnation is doing for identity and statehood, what Bitcoin is doing for money. Bitnation CEO and founder Susanne Templehof has said, in reference to the current refugee crisis, that the project seeks to eradicate the most criminal part of our existing legacy systems – borders.\n\nShe told IBTimes in an email: ""We have made a deal with Estonia, and the ultimate goal is to gain recognition for Bitnation as a sovereign entity, thus creating a precedent for open source protocol to be considered as sovereign jurisdictions.""\n\nBitnation, as the world\'s first blockchain powered virtual nation, provides ""DIY governance services"", and has received international attention for providing refugee emergency response and world citizenship ID on the blockchain, as well as pioneering marriage, land titles, birth certificates etc.\n\nOn the subject of marriage, Templehof points out that in many countries gay marriage, for example, is illegal: ""Blockchain doesn\'t give a s**t about that,"" she said.\n\nEstonian e-Residency is an initiative that allows anyone around the world to take advantage of the secure authenticated online identity the Estonian government already offers its 1.3 million residents.\n\nKaspar Korjus Estonia\'s e-Residency program director, said: ""In Estonia we believe that people should be able to freely choose their digital/public services best fit to them, regardless of the geographical area where they were arbitrarily born. We\'re truly living in exciting times when nation states and virtual nations compete and collaborate with each other on an international market, to provide better governance services.""\n\nIf a couple get married on the Public Notary, it doesn\'t mean they get married in the jurisdiction of Estonia, or in any other nation state jurisdiction. Instead, they get married in the ""blockchain jurisdiction"".\n\nThe technology provides a worldwide legally binding proof of existence and integrity of contractual agreements for things like banking, incorporating companies quickly and cheaply, and generally empowering entrepreneurs and citizens around the world.\n\nTempelhof said she believes the Estonian government understands the dynamics of the globalisation era far better than any other government she can think of.\n\n""I\'m delighted to work with Estonia\'s e-Residency program to set a standard practice of competition of governance services on a global market, and to enable others to exercise self-determination and follow Bitnation\'s path to sovereignty"" she said.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Jonathan Johnson, the Chairman of the Board of Overstock.com—and gold and Bitcoin stockpiler—has a message for the people of Utah: Hire me as your CEO.\n\nOn Sept. 11 of this year, the chairman of the online shopping hub anted up $25,000 to speak at the GOP convention inside the South Towne Expo Center in Sandy, Utah. There, Johnson—a devout Mormon and California native—told 2,000 delegates about the worst-kept secret in Utah: that he intends to unseat the two-time incumbent, Gov. Gary Herbert.\n\n“I ask that you spend the next several months getting to know me,” Johnson said in the speech. “Put me through a rigorous interview process. I’m confident that you’ll see that my candidacy represents the difference between someone who leads and someone who merely manages.”\n\nThe Daily Beast spoke with the candidate about his road to Utah’s ballot box. It’s a path that started with his time at BYU, where the Japanese-language grad tacked on a JD; he then began clerking at the Utah Supreme Court before returning to his native Los Angeles to litigate for various white-shoe law firms.\n\nHe moved his family back to Utah in 1999 to take a general counsel gig at a startup called TenFold.\n\nThe software development company ended up in the crosshairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly hyping its stock price in 1999 and 2000 to “reap thousands and even millions in personal profits” and for supposedly not being truthful to investors about how they were “routinely missing contractual deadlines,” according to a 2002 SEC complaint. The SEC eventually dropped all charges.\n\nFor Johnson, TenFold tanked purely because the dotcom bubble was bursting. “We had a lot of legal issues we dealt with and the company contracted significantly,” he told The Daily Beast.\n\nAnd he walked away stronger. “The thing I learned most at TenFold is that during hard times there’s still problems to be solved,” he said. “And one can learn a lot that would be applicable to other business situations.”\n\nJohnson parlayed that knowledge into a meteoric rise at Overstock, starting in 2002, where he rose up the ranks from general legal counsel all the way to president and now chairman.\n\nIn September 2002, Johnson took a shining to Patrick Byrne, the Stanford philosophy Ph.D. and anti-Wall-Street wunderkind whose photographic memory is something to behold. At the time, Byrne was CEO of Overstock, and his bold brainstorm to use the Dutch Auction method for Overstock was an instant draw. “I thought it was a great idea,” Johnson said. The Dutch Auction—named after a famous method for selling tulips—dates back to the 1600s as an alternative way of selling securities to the public, relying on a bidding process to set the maximum price investors are willing to pay.\n\nJohnson was introduced to Byrne through a former TenFold colleague. “I spent quite a bit of time chatting with Patrick during the interview process and I was eager to join,” Johnson said.\n\nLong before Johnson announced his run for governor, the conservative executive and avid cyclist had already been pushing a political agenda through his Promote Liberty PAC, spearheading programs like fitting schoolteachers with school supply vouchers, giving terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs, and staunchly preserving “the historic role of churches.”\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

It came out guns blazing against Goldman Sachs, suing them for allegedly manipulating short sales of Overstock’s stock and thus causing its shares to fall. (A judge dismissed the suit in 2012.)\n\nThe company, headquartered in Salt Lake City, is also priming for another slugfest. “We’re going to trial in March of next year against Merrill Lynch for significant manipulation of our stock,” Johnson said. “And do our shareholders like that? I think they do.\n\n“Does Utah want a governor who stands up on principle? I don’t know but I hope they do.”\n\nAnd yet a spate of recent lawsuits have claimed that Overstock and its overlords may not be so clean when it comes to principles.\n\nIn 2008, when Johnson was president, the company fended off two SEC “informal investigations” scrutinizing Overstock’s accounting practices. A tipster informed the SEC that Overstock had allegedly overstated its income and understated its losses after underbilling its suppliers.\n\nRegarding those investigations, Johnson notes, Overstock was compliant and “very forthcoming” with the SEC. In both cases, he says, “we got a No Action Letter” exonerating the company. “I think that’s pretty clear evidence that the SEC saw what we were doing and while we had some things that caused restatements—there was certainly no malintent or bad action that they could take action on.”\n\nBut last year Overstock was ordered to fork over $6.8 million to the State of California after a prosecutor nailed the company for inflating prices “to make it appear consumers were getting a bigger discount” than they were actually receiving, according to a statement released by Santa Cruz County District Attorney’s office. Officials confirm Overstock has appealed the judgment, and therefore no money has yet changed hands.\n\nThe year before, the company’s director of communications, Judson Bagley, faced several felony charges for doctoring prescription meds, according to a police report and Utah County court documents. He pleaded to a lighter charge of having “altered prescriptions,” the papers say.\n\nJohnson acknowledged that Bagley, who remains Overstock’s director of communications, made “a mistake in his private life” but like many Overstock employees “deserves a second chance,” he said.\n\n“Is he still employed at Overstock? Yes. Do we believe in second chances? Yes,” Johnson said, noting later in our discussion that he was not aware of the matter until after Bagley was busted.\n\nThen there’s the Stormy Simon subterfuge. Simon, a onetime entry-level saleswoman who is now a board member and Overstock’s president, played a double-agent role to woo a hedge-fund manager named David Rocker, a New Jersey-based businessman whom Overstock brass accused of plotting to drive down the price of Overstock’s shares.\n\nAccording to a Fortune Magazine article, published in 2005, “perhaps nothing illuminates the growing strangeness surrounding Overstock better than an incident involving [then-senior vice president] Stormy Simon.” The article says Rocker reached out to Simon to see if she was unhappy at her job. She wasn’t interested in his offer, but Byrne encouraged her to take the meeting, to see if Rocker was paying people to leak info on Overstock. Rocker and Simon agreed to meet. “Simon told Rocker that she could ‘sink Byrne, I can sink his ship today,’” Fortune wrote. “(‘She showed him some thigh,’ Byrne says.) Rocker wasn’t sure whether to believe her. He told her that if she had valid concerns, she should get a lawyer and should take them to the SEC.”\n\nEven seven years later, Johnson still flashes anger and defiance about the legal skirmish with Rocker that Overstock launched in 2005, when the company filed a civil claim against Rocker and a forensic research firm called Gradient Analytics for allegedly orchestrating “a wide-scale predatory campaign of knowingly distributing false, and covertly biased, written reports about Overstock in order to disparage Overstock and enrich themselves.”\n\n“Did I know that Stormy was going back to New York to meet with David Rocker—yes,” Johnson says.\n\nHe defended the bare-knuckled tactics as “nothing illegal” and said they were called for because Overstock was battling a foe who, he argued, wasn’t playing fair.\n\nNo regulator or law enforcement agency ever went after Rocker or Gradient for short-selling conspiracies. In the end, the two sides were forced to duke it out in a California court, with Rocker publicly settling in 2009, one year after Gradient did the same.\n\nIn a victory lap, Byrne boasted in an official Overstock letter “the good guys won” and said Rocker had paid $5 million to Overstock. In the letter, Byrne also touted his pet website, DeepCapture.com, “where my opinions were expressed without filtering.”\n\nSimon was promoted to president after the Rocker stunt and according to the company’s own SEC filing back in 2007, even accepted a loan “up to $1.5 million” out-of-pocket from Byrne back in 2007. But Johnson promised that Overstock employees who behave inappropriately are duly dealt with.\n\n“I’m not going to open our HR files to you but have people been censured and appropriate action been taken? Yes. Every time,” he said.\n\nAnd then there’s the strange lawsuit involving DeepCapture.com, Patrick Byrne’s pet project.\n\nThe convoluted case involves multiple civil lawsuits filed back in 2011 by a 62-year-old Canadian businessman named Altaf Ali Nazerali. Nazerali demanded damages for allegedly defamatory statements made by Byrne and Deep Capture’s Illinois-based lead reporter, Mark Mitchell. The matter has since been tried in British Columbia’s Supreme Court in Vancouver and awaits a judge’s decision, which could come before the New Year.\n\nNazerali is suing over a series of articles, titled “The Miscreants’ Global Bustout,” which was published on Deep Capture in May 2011. The website, as described by Mark Mitchell in a blog post, is Byrne’s “crusade against market manipulators who seemed to threaten the stability of the financial system.”\n\nIn the Deep Capture series—which was taken down after a Oct. 19, 2011, injunction imposed by a Canadian Supreme Court judge—Mitchell described Nazerali as a man in cahoots with “Osama Bin Laden’s favorite financier,” and said that he worked with a variety of criminal outfits around the globe, including La Cosa Nostra, the Colombian drug cartel, the Russian mafia, and various “jihadi terrorist groups” including al Qaeda’s Golden Chain. According to court documents, Deep Capture also accused Nazerali of “delivering weapons to war zones in Africa and to the mujahedeen in Afghanistan,” of orchestrating “small-time ‘pump and dump’ scams… [and] bust-outs, death spiral finance and naked short selling,” and of carrying out dirty work for “a Pakistani ISIS asset” who “works for the Iranian regime.”\n\n“These were allegations offered up without any proof,” Nazerali’s lawyer, Daniel Burnett, told The Daily Beast. “They have him at a party with hookers smoking cigars with Russian gangsters. It’s bad fantasy and terrible, terrible writing.”\n\nDuring his years in finance, at companies such as First Commerce Securities and the Gulf Group, Nazerali “sold stocks in a legitimate way,” Burnett told The Daily Beast.\n\nAccording to the Deep Capture article, the Gulf Group was “intertwined with Pakistan’s intelligence services” and First Commerce Securities was a “subsidiary of the BCCI syndicate… the greatest criminal bank of all time, controlled by future financiers of al Qaeda”—a reference to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which went down for massive fraud back in the 1980s.\n\nThe 21-chapter Deep Capture series also mentioned a former business partner of Nazerali’s at First Commerce Securities, Irving Kott, who was charged by Dutch authorities for cheating investors out of millions. Kott denied wrongdoing, but ultimately settled. In 2006, Kott dodged jail time on a 48-count indictment against him for filing bogus SEC reports on his Beverly Hills-based brokerage firm JB Oxford. He died in 2009.\n\nAfter the Deep Capture series was published, Nazerali asked Mitchell to retract “outright falsehoods” in the article, according to an affidavit made on Oct. 7, 2011. The court documents say Mitchell wrote back the next day, on Sept. 7, 2011, to say that “nothing in the story is written in stone” and that he’d consider “rewriting it altogether” because he experienced a “radical transformation in my worldview” since publishing the series. He also offered to “remove all previous mentions of your name on Deep Capture” if Nazerali became a source. (It’s unclear if Byrne was privy to Mitchell’s pitch about altering the original article.)\n\n“Like I said, some facts are more interesting than others and I’d gladly take your name out of the story altogether in exchange for having you as a source. Let me know what you think,” Mitchell wrote, according to court documents.\n\nNazerali ignored the offer and instead sought an attorney who won an injunction on Deep Capture and filed lawsuits in the Canadian Supreme Court a month later.\n\nOn the Deep Capture website, Mitchell says the injunction was done without his or Byrne’s awareness. And Byrne told The Daily Beast that Deep Capture was down for three months as a result. “[It is] disgraceful that certain American [host] companies blacked us off the Internet on a foreign court order,” Byrne wrote in an email.\n\nIn addition to suing Deep Capture and Byrne, Nazerali and his lawyers named Overstock as a co-defendant on the libel suit. As the trial commenced, Overstock tried and failed to emancipate itself from the lawsuit.\n\nIn a Response to Civil Claim filed on July 2014, Overstock’s attorney Stephen Schachter asked the judge for relief, stating “that Deep Capture were separate and distinct from [Byrne’s] role as CEO of Overstock.”\n\nOn June 17 of this year the judge ordered that Overstock remain a co-defendant (PDF).\n\nWhen The Daily Beast asked Byrne about the suit, he replied by email that the case against Deep Capture had “disintegrated.”\n\nMeanwhile, Overstock CEO Jonathan Johnson told The Daily Beast that the lawsuit was “spurious” and claimed that Overstock was barely a part of it. “Overstock has not been involved or been deposed,” he said. He later added: “Deep Capture is not an Overstock company. It’s not controlled by its board of directors. It’s something that Patrick does.”\n\nYet during the Nazerali lawsuit, according to Stockwatch, the defendant’s lawyer claimed that Byrne used his Overstock email while contacting Mitchell and while posting about Nazerali online; that email exchange between Mitchell and Overstock employees indicated that Mitchell did not have to organize or finance the trips he took for Deep Capture reporting; and that Overstock had described Deep Capture as a “related company” in board meetings. (A lawyer for Overstock contested all these points during the trial.)\n\nWhat’s more, when registering the site DeepCapture.com with GoDaddy.com back in 2006, Byrne used Overstock email and initially Deep Capture’s blog ran on three Overstock servers.\n\n“[Deep Capture] remained an Overstock-hosted blog for a couple-few months until we decided to move it to some other entity in the Midwest so that no one could possibly confuse the two,” Byrne wrote to me in a separate email.\n\nByrne also wrote in the email that “Deepcapture.com was one of the many hundreds or thousands of Overstock-hosted blogs the public created on our site.”\n\nByrne denied that Overstock or its board approved any money to underwrite Deep Capture. “That is false,” Byrne wrote in a statement to The Daily Beast. “I would love to see some citation where I said that. I have bent over backward to keep the two separate.”\n\nBut during the Nazerali trial, Byrne had apparently stated that Overstock regularly approved payments to Deep Capture, according to Stockwatch.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitchell said in a phone interview with The Daily Beast that Patrick Byrne has been the sole supporter of Deep Capture. “Why would Overstock have a website that writes about criminals and the financial crisis?” he said.\n\nJohnson also denies Overstock and Deep Capture are linked in any way. “It had servers that were sold by Overstock or contributed by Overstock,” he said, referring to the 2006 registration. “But to call them Overstock servers makes it feel like they are ours today and they certainly are not.”\n\nBizarrely, the Nazerali lawsuit seems to bother the Overstock brass the most out of all the legal action taken against the company—just days before publishing this article, Deep Capture uploaded a screed claiming Nazerali had hoodwinked The Daily Beast and that this site is “serv[ing] the dark side” by trying to tie Johnson to the Canadian lawsuit. (As noted above, Overstock is indeed legally tied to the case.)\n\nNevertheless, in an interview with The Daily Beast, Johnson made it clear he backs Byrne’s crusade against alleged market manipulators. “Frankly I think what Patrick does to fight against crooks and to weed out regulators is a good thing for society,” he said. “Does he use the tactics that I would always use? No.\n\n“You should know as the general counsel and later as the person over legal that anytime anybody has done things that we think are inappropriate actions are taken against him,” Johnson said. “That includes having HR taken against Patrick. It’s not that anyone at the company is above sanction.”\n\nBut, Johnson said, “by and large I think what he’s doing is a service to society.”\n\nUpdate: Nov. 30, 2015, 2:00 p.m. — The headline of this article has been changed from CEO to reflect the fact that Johnson is the chairman of the company. According to Johnson’s communications director for his campaign, “he was the president of Overstock for five years and the acting-CEO for a short time.”\n\nUpdate: May 9, 2016 — A Canadian Supreme Court judge ruled Friday that Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne and his co-author Mark Mitchell must cough up $1.2 million for their 2011 scorched earth campaign against 62-year-old Vancouver-based businessman Altaf Ali Nazerali. Byrne and Mitchell published a 21-chapter series titled “The Miscreants’ Global Bustout” on their now moribund watchdog blog DeepCapture.com, in which they accused Nazerali of being an oily market manipulator who dealt with Osama Bin Laden’s “favorite financier,” was in cahoots with Italian and Russian mobsters, and sold arms to the Mujahideen. But British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Kenneth Affleck rejected the accusations almost outright and wrote that “wide dissemination was the intention” of Byrne and Mitchell. He went on to say that their “intention was to inflict as much damage on [Nazerali] as possible” and that they failed “to prove the truth of many of the defamatory words out of [Nazerali], not through documents, nor through other witnesses of which there were none.”\n\nNazerali told The Daily Beast he’s grateful to have been vindicated.”This was never about the money, it was about clearing my name,” he said. “I gave them numerous chances to correct, withdraw or settle for an apology. Their arrogance was their downfall.” Attempts to reach Patrick Byrne and Overstock chairman and Utah gubernatorial candidate Jonathan Johnson were not immediately returned. A rep for Overstock.com declined to comment other than to note that “Overstock.com was dismissed from the lawsuit in his ruling.” Mark Mitchell’s British Columbia-based attorney told us his client has 30 days to decide whether he will appeal the seven-figure censure."", 'Attracta Mooney NOVEMBER 28, 2015 0 Luxembourg has been accused of blocking the reform of Europe’s $700bn money market fund industry, with critics claiming the country is putting its own interests first. Luxembourg took over the EU presidency in July, but little progress has since been made on reforming money market funds, which are used by companies and investors to park cash. The reforms are being proposed to avoid investor runs in a crisis, but industry figures say the changes would be detrimental to Luxembourg’s money market fund sector. “The Luxembourgish presidency seems to be blocking the [money market fund] reform. Luxembourg does not want to move forward,” said Eva Joly, an MEP and financial affairs spokesperson for the Green party. Politicians and regulators globally have paid closer attention to money funds in the wake of the financial crisis, when some ran into difficulties and others had to be liquidated. Luxembourg, Ireland and the UK are home to the majority of Europe’s so-called constant NAV funds, a type of money market fund that has a fixed share cost. These funds are set to be most affected by the planned changes. “[Luxembourg is] not a neutral party [when it comes to money fund reform],” said Marina Cremonese, an analyst at Moody’s, the rating agency. It is understood Luxembourg, with support of some other member states, is arguing for watered-down reforms. A spokesperson for the grand duchy’s presidency said: “Luxembourg is certainly not blocking the reform, but is actively working with the other member states to find a solution.” Although not as stringent as the changes first tabled in 2013, the proposals put forward by the European Parliament include plans to create a new category of constant NAV funds. These low-volatility NAV funds face a “sunset clause”, which would probably mean they would cease to exist after five years. The European Fund and Asset Management Association, a trade body, has claimed that the clause would be “unworkable for fund managers”. Sources say Luxembourg wants the sunset clause removed, which would lead to a clash with other countries on the European Council, the body made up of the 28 EU member states. A spokesperson for the European Council said there is little sign the current deadlock between member states around money market fund reforms will be broken. “Very little progress has been made in recent months. It will be for the incoming Netherlands presidency to decide what the next move should be,” he added. A spokesperson for the Dutch presidency, which takes over from Luxembourg in January, said money market funds are not among its priorities for its time in charge. The US approved strict rules on money market funds in 2014. They are due to be introduced next year and will require funds to switch to a floating share price instead of a fixed price. Roberto Gualtieri, chairman of the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs committee, warned EU member states that they need to find a compromise on money fund reforms.', 'The Leadership Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in business contribute answers to timely questions about careers and leadership. Today’s answer to the question: What’s the best way to keep your company successful? is written by Tal Schwartz, CEO of ClickTale.\n\nIf there is one lesson my employees know that I love to drive home, it’s this: if you want to succeed, you first need to fail. Advising employees to fail before they succeed may sound counterintuitive, but I assure you it is anything but. If you want to run a good company, go ahead and tell those on your team to strive to do their best work. But if you want to run a great company, I dare you to push your staff even further. I dare you to allow them to break through their own boundaries — and the only way to do that is to encourage them to fail.\n\nThat’s because failure is what you encounter on the road to a truly original idea. It’s what history has proven, time and again, is the first step to creativity. Bill Gates knows it. Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton knew it. Van Gogh, Dickinson — even J.K. Rowling — knew that failure is essential to turn good ideas into truly fantastic ones.\n\nSo I don’t just encourage my employees to fail, I require that they do. Every employee at ClickTale knows in brainstorming sessions, company meetings, and strategy pow-wows, they can offer any idea that pops into their head. They can bring forth crazy, far-fetched scenarios for revolutionizing customer experience, and they know that if they are given the green light to put their plans into action, there will be no penalty if they end up falling on their face. That’s because I have faith in the ratio of 1:4. For every four wins, an employee who is truly pushing him or herself to think creatively will fail at least once. Otherwise, if they’re hitting so-called “homeruns” every time, then it’s imperative as a leader to take a closer look at their performance.\n\nSo how do you create an environment where your employees feel comfortable failing? Quite honestly, you can set the stage any way you like. At ClickTale, we prefer good, old-fashioned praise. Highlight a staffer’s failed venture at a company-wide meeting, focusing on the courage, creative thinking, and gumption that was required for them to offer the idea and attempt to see it through. Or you can go a more elementary route, and provide financial bonuses, sweet treats, or whatever sort of positive reinforcement that jives well with your company and its unique culture. The reward itself is unimportant. What matters is that you create the right environment to really get your staff pushing themselves further.\n\nIn today’s ever-crowded marketplace, true innovation is scarce. Employees, eager to please and worried about holding on their jobs, need the right kind of encouragement from their higher-ups to feel safe thinking out of the box. So if you want to really succeed, create that safety net yourself. Encourage failure and reward it. Because only when you make it safe to fail will you pull away from the pack and start to truly succeed.\n\nRead all answers to the Leadership Insider question:What’s the best way to keep your company successful?\n\nWhy Businesses Can’t Survive Without Social Media by William Craig, founder and president of WebpageFX.\n\nThe One Word Managers Need to Say More Often by Kevin Chou, cofounder and CEO of Kabam.\n\nThe biggest mistake a successful company can make by Rich Lesser, CEO of the Boston Consulting Group.', 'Attracta Mooney NOVEMBER 28, 2015 3 Boeing, General Electric and Procter & Gamble are among a number of large US companies that have been accused of failing to disclose the risks posed to their business by climate change. The lack of disclosure has raised concerns that investors cannot accurately assess issues that could harm returns. More than half of the 20 largest US-listed companies have disclosed no or limited information about the risks they face from climate change in their regulatory filings, according to a study by Influence Map, a research firm that analyses corporate impact on climate change policy. This is despite US regulation requiring listed businesses to provide details of the “most significant risks that apply” to a company. Ahead of the UN climate talks in Paris this week, Dylan Tanner, executive director of Influence Map, warned investors are not getting a full picture of how regulation aimed at tackling climate change would affect the performance of the companies they invest in. “A drastic acceleration in the pace of low-carbon regulations could radically change the dynamics of numerous markets whose products depend on fossil fuels, affecting companies like Boeing and GE,” he said. “Investors should be able to clearly understand corporate thinking on these risks through [regulatory] filings and other channels of disclosure.” Boeing, GE and P&G did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this year, around 60 institutional investors representing $1.9tn in assets, including UK fund houses Aviva Investors and Legal & General Investment Management, raised concerns with the US regulator over the level of corporate disclosure on climate risk. ExxonMobil is under investigation for misleading investors over how climate change risks might hurt the oil group. The company denies the allegations. Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, the non-profit sustainability group, and director of the $13tn Investor Network on Climate Risk, said: “Investors expect clear and complete reporting of all material risks, and companies have a responsibility to disclose their climate strategies.” The focus on disclosure comes as asset managers and institutional investors increasingly examine climate risks and the impact they could have on portfolios. Several asset managers have announced new initiatives around climate change ahead of the Paris talks. Last week, Erste Asset Management, the Austrian fund house, published the carbon footprint of its equity funds for the first time. UK asset manager Hermes Investment Management and French groups BNP Paribas Investment Partners and Caisse des Dépôts also joined the Portfolio Decarbonisation Coalition, a group aimed at encouraging institutional investors to “decarbonise their portfolios”.']"
11/29/2015,"['Bitcoin reputation startup Bonafide has elected to cease operations and commence liquidation less than one year after raising $850,000 from investors including Blockchain Capital and Quest Venture Partners.\n\nAccording to an email sent to shareholders and obtained by CoinDesk, Bonafide had been approached by a “leading” bitcoin company for possible acquisition, however, the sale was declined as it was deemed ""only beneficial to team members"", not investors.\n\nFounded in 2013, the startup offered an API that provided reputation data to bitcoin firms offering exchange, wallet and other consumer services.\n\nIn the email, co-founders Karthik Balasubramanian and Brian Moyer stated their belief that the movement of investor interest away from consumer-facing applications for the technology was also a factor.\n\nBalasubramanian and Moyer wrote:\n\n""While investment and activity continues to occur it is focused on private and alternate chains rather than bitcoin or other public chains where Bonafide operates.""\n\nAs a result, the co-founders said they saw ""little chance"" that they would be able to generate revenue, pivot their product or secure additional funding.\n\nMoyer told CoinDesk that continued declines in consumer bitcoin spending were a prevailing factor in the shut down, and why the founding team won’t be rushing to start another project.\n\n""We don’t want to be consultants. We got a lot of traction, but it hasn’t grown. There’s just no movement in the bitcoin space. Because of our backgrounds, we could probably raise money doing something different, but they’re all long plays,"" he said.\n\nMoyer indicated that the founding team had been working without salaries since as far back as April, and that it explored possibly pivoting to the bitcoin compliance sector as well.\n\nAs for what’s next for the team, Moyer was less clear, adding only:\n\n""We\'re still going to be watching [bitcoin] really close.""\n\nDoor lock image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'We humans have used all manner of things as currency.\n\nShiny metals, pretty seashells and smelly animal hides have all served as mediums of exchange. Heck, prison inmates use cigarettes as currency.\n\nSo I suppose it’s not that farfetched for someone to create a virtual currency. I first wrote about bitcoin, a digital currency, more than two years ago, and at the time I doubted it would evolve into a widely accepted currency. It hasn’t, at least not yet.\n\nBut its popularity continues to grow, as evidenced by a recent price spike. The value of one bitcoin, which was in the low-to-mid $200 range through most of this year, recently soared above $400 and has since settled around $350.\n\nSince its inception in 2009, bitcoin has bounced all over the place, topping out near $1,000 in November 2013, then retreating until recently. This mysterious cybercurrency was a dream come true for computer geeks, libertarians and big-government paranoids.\n\nBitcoin was developed by an anonymous group of computer programmers who apparently had grown skeptical of traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, yen and other currencies after the 2008 financial crisis. A computer programming genius supposedly named Satoshi Nakamoto wrote 31,000 lines of computer code that created bitcoin.\n\nHe set a limit on the amount of bitcoin that would eventually be available in the system. Only 21 million bitcoins will be created in the coming years, with about 14 million currently in virtual circulation, according to the Journal of Economic Perspectives.\n\nIt’s also estimated that there are now 109 million bitcoin accounts, with a daily transaction volume of about 200,000 bitcoins, or about $80 million at the current price, according to the Journal.\n\nThe compelling thing about all this is that there is no single server or clearinghouse that keeps track of bitcoin. Rather bitcoin transactions are validated in a digital ledger — called a blockchain — that is shared by a network of participating computers around the world.\n\n“Blockchain is a real innovation compared to the way electronic payments have worked in the past,” said Tyler Moore, assistant professor of cybersecurity at the University of Tulsa. “Blockchain created a way to send bitcoin or some other payment without having to go through the traditional financial system, which is run by the big banks.”\n\nIn fact, there seems to be more excitement building around blockchain than around the digital currency itself. Earlier this year, the Nasdaq said it would try using bitcoin’s global network — not for trading bitcoin but to keep track of pre-IPO trading among private companies. Nonpublic companies monitor sales of their private shares through an informal system, including records kept at lawyers’ offices.\n\nNasdaq’s interest in the bitcoin network certainly makes all this more mainstream and probably accounts for the recent price spike in the currency.\n\n“I think there is a chance that bitcoin could penetrate the mainstream, but there are a few problems that have to be overcome first,” Moore said.\n\nFirst of all, this is complicated stuff. Small investors have to first locate and feel comfortable with one of the dozens of so-called bitcoin exchanges in order to buy some bitcoin.\n\nFor example, I checked out the Coinbase Exchange, which is considered one of the more respectable exchanges. I intended to buy bitcoin, but I lost my nerve when I was asked to disclose my bank account number. At present I wouldn’t trust any of the exchanges with my bank account information, so acquiring bitcoin is problem No. 1.\n\n“They need to make it easier for people to get their hands on bitcoin,” Moore said.\n\nSecondly, Moore examined the track record of 40 bitcoin exchanges a couple of years ago and discovered that 18 of them had closed. Nine of the 40 exchanges he looked at had been hacked.\n\nThat’s problematic because there is no Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. standing behind these exchanges. It’s difficult to recover your bitcoin when exchanges close, as evidenced by the fact that five of the closed exchanges did not reimburse customers.\n\nThird, owners of bitcoin typically have an encrypted key — basically a string of digits that allows them to spend or transfer bitcoin. Well, guess what happens for those who lose their digital key? They lose their bitcoin.\n\n“If someone was able to steal your bitcoin, meaning the private key associated with your bitcoin, there is no recourse,” Moore said.\n\nAnd finally there is the currency risk. It is true that even stable currencies like the dollar and yen fluctuate in value, but not to the extremes of bitcoin. A customer might purchase something for 100 bitcoins today that could be worth 50 tomorrow. By the way, there are hundreds of merchants who now accept bitcoin.\n\nSo bitcoin is growing in respectability, but Moore offers this cautionary note: “I think bitcoin is very risky right now. I would strongly caution against someone just going out and buying bitcoin, because there are a lot of risks.”', 'Litecoin\n\nDecember promises to be rich in a variety of news that can affect the Litecoin price. Similarly next week on the cryptocurrency market promises to be very eventful and interesting. We have already seen the dynamics of the Litecoin price last week – its sharp move from $3 to $3.80, and its corrections from $3.80 to $3.50. It’s a beautiful picture for a trader as they can earn both on price growth and its correction. Can Litecoin can stay at $3.50? Not sure, probably it will go down to $3.20 or below. Bitcoin is now on a downward trend, so the connection LTC/BTC 0.01 is abandoned, and Litecoin continue to move down.\n\nHowever, there are chances for price growth. The crisis between Russia and Turkey is far from being over, therefore, possible incidents followed by gold market, as well as Bitcoin and cryptocurrency booms are possible.\n\nDASH\n\nOnly at the end of the week we saw a slight increase of DASH’s price. It jumped from the level 0.05 to 0.06. Next week we can carefully buy DASH as this position is opened only for a short time. Traders sell DASH for 0.06 and must wait for good orders to buy DASH at 0.05 and below.\n\nDogecoin\n\nDogecoin price progressed by the end of the week, showing an increase in both price and daily volume.\n\nToday on Cryptsy it increased by 2.63% with trading volume of 46.5 BTC, and yesterday there were only about 37 BTC. All of last week we saw a drop from 43 to 36 Satoshis. While Dogecoin is unable to consolidate above 40 Satoshi, this level should be targeted for traders next week.\n\nETH\n\nWhat we see in the two-week chart? Correction in the form of a small growth after a landslide downward movement or a new upward trend? The answer to this question is as difficult as to understand what is Ethereum. But ETH cryptocurrency is the first in the ranks on the Poloniex exchange, and we can’t ignore that. We rely on the purchase of 0.014-0.018.\n\nPeercoin\n\nIt’s time to add Peercoin in our analysis. Moreover, Peercoin daily trading volume is approximately $90,000 - not every cryptocurrency can boast such a volume. There has been a significant, over 10% increase of the price but it won’t last long, and once again moved from $0.44 to $0.40 and below. We try to find out whether the recent growth is associated with the release of an update, or we are talking about pure speculation.', 'Recently Kris Haamer started a Bitcoin crowdfunding campaign to fight domestic violence in Sao Tomé. He partnered with a Sao-Toméan rapper Pekagboom to raise people’s awareness about the problem of domestic violence which stands sharply in many countries of the world. Kris told CoinTelegraph that he and his team plan to start a far-reaching transmedia project that will help fight domestic violence not only in Sao Tomé, but also in other Portuguese speaking countries, as well as in other countries all over the world.\n\nThe idea of the project appeared two years ago when Kris Haamer met Pekagboom at the Sao Tome e Principe art biennale. After that they started gathering other people around the idea to create a strong team, “with members in Sao Tomé, Estonia, Portugal, Brazil and Taiwan”. This shows the problem they are to deal with is global indeed.\n\nThe team has created a musical video featuring a fictional character named Elsa Figueira and her tough story of overcoming domestic violence. This video is to demonstrate to all the abused women that there is actually a way out and that they shouldn’t suffer the violence silently.\n\n? Help us launch https://t.co/WbaN2jag7i ? Our goal: 10 Bitcoins: 3NrTjyCik9ssC3Wzb4qD8PkqBhhqjNnaMc - Please RT ?? pic.twitter.com/1k1QxTGHFB — Kris Haamer (@krishaamer) November 12, 2015\n\nNow the project is finished and the team is raising funds for its launch. Kris has chosen Bitcoin for the campaign as he thinks it “is a perfect fit for that”. He told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Bitcoin might not be really mainstream yet but I think it has the potential to make global collaboration possible. You can participate with your mobile device. No laptop is necessary. If you have Twitter and a Bitcoin wallet on your phone, you are in. So that’s kind of the idea behind it.”\n\nAnd this idea actually works. The campaign attracted some famous and important people in the Bitcoin and Blockchain industry. For example, a founder and CEO of Xapo, Wences Casares was the first to donate. He contributed 1 BTC for the project. There were other smaller donations as well.\n\nThe launch of the project is planned on December 10, on Human Rights Day. That is quite symbolic, because women all over the world have the right to be protected from domestic violence. On February 5th there will be a concert in Sao Tomé where Elsa will eventually speak to the public. After the concert Pekagboom plans to visit local schools to raise students’ awareness about domestic violence and abuse. He will also talk about it on local radio and television. Kris Haamer added:\n\n“We’ve created Elsa’s character so she could live on even after the release of the video. She could live on in a comic book, for example. There could be more stories about her. She’s not defined by the violence that was done to her. She’s so much more, with all her dreams and plans, with everything she wants to achieve. And that is the idea – to show all the abused women they can do much more than just suffer the violence.”\n\nApart from Sao Tomé, the team plans to promote their project to other Portuguese-speaking countries, such as Angola, Mozambique, Portugal, Brazil, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Cabo Verde, Macau and East Timor.\n\nBy the way, Kris Haamer has been engaged in promoting Sao Tomé already for several years. He started an organization called Galo Cantá together with Katya Aragão, the producer of the Elsa Figueira project. The organization holds the annual TEDxSãoTomé conference inviting international speakers to “spread sao-tomean ideas to the world.”', 'John Biggs is a New York-based writer. After spending years as a programmer, Biggs decided to become a full-time journalist. His work has appeared in publications such as the New York Times, Gizmodo and Men\'s Health. Biggs is currently an editor for TechCrunch and the CEO of bitcoin stealth startup Freemit.\n\nIn this piece he details why he thinks bitcoin will eventually succeed.\n\nA week ago I was in Belgrade watching a panel on ""blockchain.""\n\nThe makeup of the panel was typical: a young, plugged-in VC, an older banker guy and a crypto-anarchistic dude in a T-shirt. It was like watching a movie called ""Bitcoin is Good And Bad"" for the 50th time. I knew what was happening but I couldn\'t look away.\n\nThe panel started normally - VC guy said he liked the blockchain specifically but was iffy about those bitcoins, the older gentleman said bitcoin was bad, but then the anarchist dude was quiet. He let the banker talk. The banker said that bitcoin was untraceable. It was a fad. The crypto guy let him talk. bitcoin was a tulip bulb, said the old dude. It would never work, he clamored.\n\nAnd the anarchist stayed quiet. Then the old dude was done.\n\nThe anarchist calmly explained what the future of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies held. He made cogent points that he had practiced many times. While the banker chortled at his own jokes, the VC talked about the blockchain and the audience grunted.\n\nThe anarchist won the discussion through reasoned argument.\n\n\'Bitcoin in a suit\'\n\nThis is the face of bitcoin discourse in late 2015. It\'s a calm discussion where the craziest people in the room are the ones who are against bitcoin. We\'ve won.\n\nI asked the anarchist, Aaron Koenig, what he was thinking on stage. He said:\n\n""I\'ve been through this many times.""\n\nHe was used to that line of questioning. He knew how to handle it and how to ignore it. In fact, it\'s the folks who don\'t understand cryptocurrency and the folks who don\'t understand bitcoin that seem the craziest these days. It\'s a fascinating flip.\n\nWe\'re basically seeing the dawn of bitcoin in a suit.\n\nJust as Red Hat turned Linux into something an IT department could use to replace Microsoft, the new bitcoin users are turning crypto into something that a person can use to replace a bank.\n\nThe accretions of a dozen decades of banking tradition have convinced those inside the big institutions that their way is right and will be right forever. Those outside, the scrabbling sea monsters trying to figure out a new way to walk on land, know that isn\'t true.\n\nThere\'s an old quote I love, written by Wilhelm Stekel but made famous by Holden Caulfield in Catcher In The Rye.\n\n""The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause,"" Stekel said. ""While the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.""\n\nThe true bitcoin believer needs to take this to heart. We\'ve already won. We\'ve moved past the era of raving lunatics howling in the wilderness about digital gold and the end of governments.\n\nWe\'re in a position to make real, meaningful change in the world and to do that we need to listen more than we speak.\n\nMalaise among investors\n\nIn my time as a bitcoin entrepreneur, I\'ve seen a certain deep malaise rising in the investor class.\n\nThey\'ve met too many wide-eyed Jeremiahs fresh from the desert with a plan to put our DNA on the blockchain.\n\nThey\'ve seen investments crash quicker than HSBC after another scandal. They\'ve been burned by guys who write banking code in PHP and host it on public servers. Now they\'re doing technical diligence and they\'re offering objections to every claim.\n\nBut there\'s one thing to remember in every investment scenario: objections are a buying signal. Say what you want about short-sighted folks stuck in the past: investors know that something is brewing.\n\nIn 1995, you\'d have been hard-pressed to convince anyone that email was anything cooler than a way for scientists to tell each other where to point a giant telescope in Peru.\n\nThen came Hotmail and the utility of email became obvious. The same happens with any previously complex technology: the objections die when the technology becomes part of the white noise of commerce, communication or reproduction.\n\nEmbedded in banks\n\nSo let them howl. Let hem hoot. Let them say you\'re doing something wrong. None of their objections are real.\n\nThey\'re simply trying to raise your hackles, to get you to react, to get you to fight. But the fight is over. Bitcoin is nearly embedded in every bank (they call it ""blockchain research"" in the banks but it\'s really two bitcoin people sitting in cubicles sending each other news articles from CoinDesk) and there are investors who are ready to invest in actual product.\n\nThat\'s right: pie in the sky ideas aren\'t going to cut it. You have to build. But when you build, they will come.\n\nAs we move forward we\'re all going to find new problems to solve and new business to build. It\'s inevitable. Eighteen years ago I remember sitting in an airplane listening to a guy who needed millions of dollars for Sun Servers to launch a website for a movie theatre.\n\nNow, thanks to Linux and a bunch of work on the front end, that movie theatre can use Squarespace. It will get easier to use the Internet of Money just as it got easier to use the Internet itself.\n\nIt takes time and it takes quiet concentration.

Funders and future buyers of the device will own an alarm clock that will also display the price of bitcoin, owner’s account balances, time and local temperature.\n\nReal Coin Tickers (RCT) is a small team of Computer Engineer and Bitcoin enthusiast from Toronto that have invested some time into the realization of a “more complete” alarm clock for the Bitcoin enthusiast family and are soon going to open a crowdfunding campaign to enable mass production of their “physical” Bitcoin ticker.\n\nSo if you have ever awaken at 3 in the morning jumping on your bed because “oh my gosh what had happen to the Bitcoin price?” and struggled to find your mobile phone just to check it, this device is coming to help. Just by turning your head to the nightstand, you will read on flashing LEDs the Bitcoin price status and if your finances are still there, and, of course, what time did you wake on anxiety.\n\nThis, at least, in the beginning, because Tixie is not just an alarm clock with a couple of Bitcoin features added, Tixie will be connected to your WiFi, and, as stated by its creators, the software will be updated continuously following users’ requests:\n\n“Our aim with Tixie is to make the use of digital currency more engaging and enjoyable. Tixie is a physical bitcoin ticker that can be used at home or at the office. It currently has four main modes which tick various information for the user in the real world. At its core, Tixie is a price ticker, and is designed to give the user a heads up on how bitcoin’s price is trending with just a glance. Tixie will also tick the balances of two included bitcoin accounts (like checking and savings) that comes bundled with a mobile app. The app is used to set up Tixie and control all the customizations. Since Tixie uses WiFi, we will continually update it with features the community demands. Tixie can also tick the time and display the local outside temperature of desired location. Tixie uses three touch buttons located at the top that will be used to navigate to different modes, ambient light colors and currency units. As a bonus feature, we included two USB ports to charge phones and most tablets. There are many more features of Tixie and we are creating a FAQs page on our website to address the finer details.”\n\nTixie also works coupled with a smartphone app, and there are big plans of expansion on it as well:\n\n“We plan to partner with an exchange to allow the purchase of bitcoins directly from Tixie’s app using a credit card, with the hopes of making bitcoin more accessible. We are currently partnered with Bitconnect at bitconnect.info, a free service to help people understand and connect to everything Bitcoin. We plan to raise funds in order to mass produce Tixie and to continue making unique real world blockchain based devices for the everyday person. You can currently visit our website at realcointickers.com to sign up for a notification when our crowdfunding campaign at Indiegogo launches.”\n\nThis device is probably one of the first non-wallet and non-POS hardware Bitcoin device on the market.\n\nNo precise date for the crowdfunding campaign beginning has been released by the RCT team, they are still planning to set it up in the “next weeks”, so keep tuned for future updates.\n\nWhat other types of devices can we expect in the future that will take advantage of the fully networked functions of Bitcoin? How many years, before we will pay a Google Taxi with Bitcoins to bring us to the airport?', 'The whole Bitcoin network is pillared on mining. Bitcoin mining is the way bitcoins are minted and transactions are processed over the network. Bitcoin mining involves using computing power to solve complicated mathematical/cryptographic problems using complicated algorithm and specialized software. The processing power required to solve these problems is contributed by computing devices connected to the Bitcoin network and they are known as miners. Bitcoin mining ensures the security of the network and confirms each and every transaction taking place over the entire network. Fresh bitcoins are also introduced into the Bitcoin network in the process and miners receive them as a reward for their contribution to the network.\n\nBitcoin mining guarantees that the blockchain is kept updated and prevents double spending. Initially, when the network was still small, the difficulty level of mining was set low. A normal computer could do a decent job in solving the problems. However, the expansion of Bitcoin network added more bitcoins, users and increased the number of transactions on the blockchain. The expansion of Bitcoin’s network has a direct correlation with the difficulty level of mathematical problems to be solved. This translates to increased requirement of processing power. Bitcoin mining slowly graduated from CPUs to GPUs, which have a higher hash rate and hence greater problem solving capability. Currently, Bitcoin mining is carried out by dedicated processing units known as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These Bitcoin mining ASICs possess enormous processing power and at the same time are more energy efficient than other processing devices.\n\nASIC miners are costly, and they are configured to do one and only task — Bitcoin mining. These miners are generally installed on enormous servers which house hundreds and thousands of such devices running continuously throughout the day. Does this mean tat GPU mining is dead? Well, not really. Not everyone can set up a server and install ASICs. Individuals who are cryptocurrency enthusiasts and are interested in mining can still do so, using the GPUs currently available in the market but they can’t expect to make much if (any) profits.\n\nHow can you start mining Bitcoin?\n\nFor those who do not want to get their hands dirty, but still want to boast about being part of the mining community can buy cloud mining contracts to rent hash rate on a cloud based mining setup for a specific duration. While those who like to get involved, can either invest in Bitcoin mining ASICs and build their own miners, or buy pre-built miners with AISCs in them. ASIC based miners have custom components built only for the purpose of Bitcoin mining. These devices have enormous processing power, generating a huge hash rate for effective mining.\n\nWhat about those who want to try mining the old school way, using PCs? Well, if there are any old computers lying around and if they are particularly feeling generous then a custom GPU based mining rig is the way to go. It will require some money initially (let’s say a maximum budget of $2000) for starters. They can set up their own mining rig with components that are available on various online shops or a local computer hardware stores. First thing they would have to consider is a good GPU that can generate a decent hash rate. There are few high end GPUs currently available out there in the market which are capable of generating enough hashing power to be recognized by the bitcoin mining pool.\n\nOne can build a mining PC which can also double up as a gaming rig (all one has to do is buy a better processor than a cheaper one). Some of the suggested components include-\n\nThese components will help build a hi performance gaming rig at a budget cost of about $1500. Rest of the money can be spent on buying the cabinet, monitor, keyboard and mouse of choice. The NVidia GTX 970 GPUs are built using Maxwell architecture which makes it more energy efficient and powerful in comparision with other GPUs in and around the same price range. The two GPUs (upto 4 GPUs) can synchronously operate together using the NVidia SLI Technology.\n\nOnce the hardware is set up and loaded with necessary software and operating system, the rig can be fired up. In order to start mining bitcoins one has to first install few special software packages and create a bitcoin wallet. The machine is then connected to a mining pool of choice over the internet. Upon completion of all these steps, the miner will get to work mining bitcoin. However, it is not going to do much good as the current difficulty levels of bitcoin mining requires a lot more processing power than what a pair of GPUs are capable of generating. Mining altcoins using the same rig and selling them for bitcoin will turn out to be more profitable than mining bitcoin on the PC.\n\nIf you are still fixated about bitcoin mining and have $2000 to spare, there is a better idea which involves ASIC miners. One can buy ASIC based bitcoin miners for the same cost and use them instead of building a mining PC. AntMiner S5 which has a hashrate of about 1155 GH/s cost about $565 a piece. For a price of $2000, the ideal mining setup will include the following\n\nWith less than $2000 one can buy two units of AntMiner S5 with a capacity of 1155 GH/s each and also pick up a simple used/refurbished or even new PC/Laptop of choice and still end up with some money to spare. This offers a better value for money and efficiency when it comes to mining. The miners can also be used to mine any altcoin that uses SHA 256 algorithm.\n\nSetting up AntMiner S5\n\nAnother option involves investing the same amount in cloud mining to buy hashes. $2000 can get you a bit less than 5000 GHs with a promised monthly payout of 0.45 BTC. Eobot, Genesis Mining, Hashnest are fee of the many cloud mining platforms available where one can buy hashes instead of investing money on miners.\n\nIndividual bitcoin mining using GPU, FGPA and even ASICs is no longer profitable. While one can increase the number of bitcoin miners running on their end, the power consumption and cooling requirements will offset most part of the profits.\n\nNote: The prices mentioned are as listed on Amazon.com.

11/30/2015,"['Kerin Hope in Athens and Peter Campbell in London NOVEMBER 30, 2015 2 Hackers have targeted three Greek banks for a third time in five days, demanding a ransom from each lender of 20,000 bitcoin (€7m), according to Greek police and the country’s central bank. A group calling itself the Armada Collective demanded the bitcoin ransom after staging its first attacks last Thursday, and then threatened a full collapse of the unnamed banks’ websites if they refused to pay up. These initial attacks took the form of a distributed denial of service — flooding the banks’ websites with requests so that they crashed under the strain. On Thursday, they succeeded in disrupting electronic transactions at all three banks for a short period, but customer information was protected, a police official said. “No bank responded to this extortion, so the same hackers tried again at the weekend and today,” the official said on Monday. “But we had strengthened our defence in the meantime, so no disruptions took place.” Cyber experts from the Greek central bank and the police electronic crime unit were monitoring the banks’ computer systems, a central bank official added. Internet banking has grown rapidly in Greece following the government’s introduction of capital controls in June, to curb a bank run that threatened a to bring down the financial system and force Greece out of the euro. More than 200,000 new internet back accounts have been registered since then, to facilitate customers making domestic transactions. “These attacks are extremely serious but we were able to boost security and add capacity with the help of local internet service providers,” said one senior Greek banker. Paul Vlissidis, technical director at cyber security group NCC, said the Armada Collective, which has carried out several attacks in recent months, attempts to extort money from businesses that are vulnerable to attack. “In effect, they say: ‘Give us bitcoin or we will take you off the internet’,” he explained. “They claim to be able to do significant amounts of damage.” He added that the level of ransom demanded by the group — often the equivalent of only a few thousand pounds — was “targeted at a level where there’s a temptation just to pay it and make it go away”. However, Mr Vlissidis said there was no way of proving that the new attackers are from the ‘Armada Collective’, or simply trying to imitate the group by using “a similar modus operandi”. On Thursday, they demanded a ransom of 20,000 bitcoin from each of the three Greek banks, according to the central bank. DDoS attacks are a rudimentary technique in internet terms, but can result in websites being offline for several hours — causing significant disruption to a bank or consumer business. Several email providers have seen their services hit by hackers claiming to be from the Armada Collective group. In September, the Swiss government warned that the group was blackmailing local email providers. ProtonMail, an encrypted email start-up set up by CERN researchers in Geneva, was hit earlier this month, while similar groups HushMail, VFEMail and RunBox were also targeted within days of the attacks. Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins in Zurich', 'Two Barbadian economists have concluded that the country\'s central bank may want to consider holding a small amount of bitcoin as part of its portfolio of foreign reserves.\n\nIn a new working paper, the authors examine the potential role cryptocurrencies could play as part of the portfolio of external assets held by a central bank, using Barbados as a case study.\n\nThe paper reads:\n\n""Within recent years, the proportion of digital transactions done using digital currencies has grown significantly. As a result, it is possible that digital currency could become a key currency for settling transactions.""\n\nThe paper goes on to note that the Barbadian dollar is pegged to the US dollar, and that as such, a reserve of foreign currencies keeps its money safe from speculative attacks.\n\nWhile valuable in this regard, the authors state that the level of bitcoin reserves should be held in proportion to the digital currency\'s use by citizens.\n\n""Given that the proportion of transactions done by Barbadians in digital currency is not likely to exceed 10% of all transactions in the short run, it is recommended that if bitcoin is incorporated into the portfolio of foreign balances of the central bank of Barbados, that its share should be relatively small,"" it adds.\n\nA nascent industry\n\nThe paper pointed out that while innovative, cryptocurrencies are still very much in the early stages of adoption, meaning that it believes many issues still need to be overcome before a central bank could consider including bitcoin in its reserve portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, the paper says that a central bank must first determine whether it perceives bitcoin to be a currency or a tradable asset.\n\n""Most early adopting jurisdictions see cryptocurrencies as assets and as such there are capital tax implications from the sale and purchase of such,"" adds the paper.\n\nThe paper further argues that, unless recognised commercial banks, financial and central banking entities actively participate in the market, regulators will continue to exert caution within the space.\n\nHowever, it does suggest it is seeing signs that such momentum is occurring, noting:\n\n""Citibank\'s intention to create its own cryptocurrency for primarily transactional services does present a model for financial entities, if not central banks, to follow.""\n\nBitcoin mining\n\nThe paper also explores the possibility that the central bank may want to invest in bitcoin mining, but points out that in this instance, the costs to do so ""outweigh the immediate benefits"".\n\nFor the Central Bank of Barbados to competitively enter this space, the paper states, it would need to procure expertise in the subject and make a considerable investment into what the paper deems are rapidly evolving miner computer technologies.\n\nBearing this in mind, the paper says that it would be more prudent if the central bank were to become an active trader of the asset while also focusing on learning the necessary tools to transfer cryptocurrencies over the blockchain.\n\nThe primary objective of this, the paper explains, would be to replace or supplement existing systems such as SWIFT and real-time gross settlement systems.\n\nBarbados image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Beginning in December, people utilizing Estonia’s e-residency program will be able to notarize marriages, contracts, birth certificates and more on the block chain. Estonia’s e-residency program allows anyone to use its online identity service, regardless where they live.\n\nThe partnership could extend Bitnation’s role as a sovereign entity whereby open source protocol provides a sovereign jurisdiction.\n\nSusanne Templehof, Bitnation CEO and founder, said in an email to International Business Times that Bitnation’s ultimate goal is to achieve recognition as a sovereign entity, creating a precedent for open source protocol. Bitnation is currently working to remove borders for people affected by the current refugee crisis.\n\nThe Programs Overlap In Some Areas\n\nBitnation’s and Estonia e-residency services overlap in some areas.\n\nThe Estonian e-residency service is a transnational digital identification card available to anyone. The e-residency ID card is a smart card that provides digital identification, digital signing of documents, digital verification of document authenticity and document encryption, according to its website. It does not confer citizenship, tax residency or right of entry to any nation.\n\nBitnation’s Blockchain Emergency ID provides emergency identification for people who cannot obtain other identification documents. It allows people to record their existence and family relations on the Horizon block chain. The identification form creates a QR code that can be used with a cell phone to apply for a bitcoin Visa card that can be used without a bank account in Europe.\n\nBitnation provides “DIY (do it yourself) governance services” and has provided refugee emergency response and global citizenship ID on the block chain.\n\nWorld Citizenship On The Block Chain\n\nAccording to thefuturescenter, Janina Lowisz became the first “World Citizen On the Blockchain” using Bitnation to record her identification. Thefuturescenter is a website for Forum for the Future, a non-profit organization working to solve complex sustainability challenges.\n\nUnder the Bitnation/Estonia e-residency partnership, e-residence card holders will be able to use Bitnation’s public notary service.\n\nEstonia believes that people should be able to choose the digital/public services that fit them best, regardless of where they were born, said Kaspar Korjus, the country’s e-residency director.\n\nEmpowering Citizens And Entrepreneurs\n\nIf a couple marries on the Public Notary, it doesn’t signify a marriage in Estonia or any nation. It signifies a marriage in the “block chain jurisdiction.” The block chain provides a global, legally-binding proof of contractual agreements for activities such as banking and incorporations. The block chain provides such services cheaply and fast, thereby empowering citizens and entrepreneurs.\n\nBitnation’s Templehof said Estonia’s government understands globalization era dynamics better than any government she is aware of.\n\nEstonia’s e-residency program sets a global standard of competition for governance services and that others can follow Bitnation’s “path to sovereignty,” she said.\n\nTemplehof said in many countries, gay marriage is illegal. The block chain, by comparison, does not care about this.\n\nImages from Shutterstock, Bitnation & LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin exchange trading volumes have hit an all-time high even as the digital currency\'s price closes in on a 52-week peak.\n\nAccording to Bitcoinity, the busiest day for exchanges to date was recorded on 26th November, when some 2.86 million worth of bitcoin was traded across all exchanges indexed by the data provider.\n\nTrading volumes have been setting records in recent weeks, with the previous peak occurring just four weeks ago, on 30th October, when 2.49 million bitcoins were traded.\n\nAs trading volumes have risen, so has the price. The price gained $25 or 7.6% in a days\' trading, even as volume surged to its 26th November peak, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Similar volume growth accompanied price rallies at the end of October and early November.\n\nGreater mainstream adoption?\n\nAlthough the surge in volume took place on the eve of the major shopping event Black Friday – holding out the possibility of a link between greater consumer adoption of bitcoin and its price and volume spike – market-watchers CoinDesk spoke to believe the run-up has been driven by traders and exchanges themselves, not commercial activity.\n\n""Only a small percentage of exchange volume will be due to genuine bitcoin use or adoption,"" said Alistair Milne, who the runs Monaco-based Altana Digital Currency Fund.\n\nAs more exchanges introduce leveraged trading, the possibility of outsized movements in the bitcoin price grows. As borrowed funds come due, they can cause the price to jump or plunge while the borrowed sums are settled, Milne added.\n\n""But bitcoin traders, especially those using leverage, artificially amplify short term supply or demand in both directions ... when leveraged contracts come to maturity or settlement, they can cause large movements in the spot price,"" he said.\n\nOne exchange that recently introduced leveraged trading is BTCC. It launched its BTCC Pro Exchange last month, allowing traders to borrow up to 20 times their principal, leading to a ""noticeable"" uptick in trading activity, the exchange said.\n\n""We have seen a noticeable increase in users and activity since our introduction of 20x leveraged trading in mid-October,"" BTCC chief executive Bobby Lee said in a statement.\n\nLeveraged trading\n\nThe disconnect between real-world bitcoin adoption and the bitcoin price is illustrated by the fact that the total number of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain has increased at a steady rate over the past year, nearly doubling from about 53 million transactions 12 months ago to some 95 million transactions today, according to Blockchain.info.\n\nThe bitcoin price, meanwhile, is trading at around $380 today – roughly the same level it was 12 months ago.\n\n""[Bitcoin transactions] have doubled in 12 months, while price hasn\'t!"" Milne said.\n\nBesides leverage driving up volumes, some market observers also believe exchanges themselves have installed automated trading software to inflate the number of trades taking place on their platforms. This creates the illusion of a highly liquid marketplace, potentially attracting more customers.\n\nParticipants of Whale Club, a popular trading room on TeamSpeak, point the finger at exchanges for generating ""fake"" trades to pump up their volumes.\n\nMilne, for one, believes this is the case:\n\n""It has become quite obvious to anyone watching the markets daily that some exchanges – I won\'t name them – appear to run \'bots\' to ramp up their volume. I assume they believe they will attract more new customers if they appear higher in the table of exchange volume.""\n\nTwo China-based exchanges dominate the volume charts: OKCoin and Huobi, which collectively account for 78% of volume in the last 30 days, according to Bitcoinity.\n\nBy contrast, Bobby Lee\'s BTCC had about 5% of trading activity in the same period. Lee offers reasons for the increase in activity rooted in fundamental demand for bitcoin beyond speculators and the by-products of leveraged trading:\n\n""China overall has also seen a noticeable increase in volumes due to a combination of increased awareness of bitcoin as a useful digital asset, and concerns in China about the bearish stock markets here, the increasing strength of the US dollar vis-à-vis the yuan and global sovereign debt concerns.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Slush Pool was the first mining pool on the Bitcoin network to allow miners to vote for BIP 101, but recently suspended this option due to sustained DDoS attacks on its servers.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Slush Pool operator Marek Palatinus said: “We're strengthening our infrastructure and we plan to enable BIP 101 mining again.”\n\nThe block-size dispute might reach a critical juncture over the next weeks, with the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong in the first week of December, and the stated intent of several prominent Bitcoin companies to change their code to allow for bigger blocks that same month. As such, Bitcoin miners (and pools) might be faced with an important decision as to which code they will support.\n\nPalatinus said that the effort to re-enable miners to vote for bigger blocks is unrelated to this “December deadline,” however.\n\n“We're not focused on December with our decision, but we still think the block-size limit should be increased,” Palatinus explained. “Sometimes there are already blocks full of valid transactions, and there's not any particular reason why user experience with bitcoin transactions should be limited because of an arbitrary limit of 1 megabyte.”\n\nHe added, “We're close friends to Paralelni Polis, the first – and only? – bitcoin-only cafe and co-working space, located in Prague near our offices. We have real-world experience with day-to-day bitcoin transactions of common users. We also see issues related with transactions not going through the Bitcoin network and how it affects bitcoin acceptance. For this reason we consider this an urgent issue.”\n\nBIP 101 – which is implemented in alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT – is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years. Much like before, however, Slush Pool does not intend to force connected miners to vote for a BIP 101 block increase with their hashing power. Instead, individual miners will be given the option to cast such a vote if they want to.\n\n“We personally hope BIP 101 will be adopted, but we do not want to enforce BIP 101 mining on our pool,” Palatinus said. “We believe in open discussion and democracy. For this reason we want to tell our miners about all options, explain their pros and cons, and let them individually decide by their mining vote.”\n\nBIP 101 has received criticism within the Bitcoin development community, the main concern being that its exponential growth curve might lead to oversized blocks. While an increased block size would allow for more transactions on the Bitcoin network, “Decentralists ” fear that oversized blocks could further centralize mining and full nodes – in turn, potentially harming Bitcoin's censorship resistance.\n\nPalatinus, however, believes the risks of BIP 101 are being exaggerated, explaining:\n\n“Improved block compression solutions will be able to vastly decrease the risk of oversized risks in regard of centralization of mining. Additionally, Bitcoin's blockchain file is impractically big for common use already. Normal users don't run Bitcoin Core anymore, because there are many other easier and more user-friendly solutions for managing bitcoin than Core. For those who want to have a full copy for any reason, there won't be a much bigger difference.”\n\nFinally, Palatinus added that Slush Pool is open to alternative block increase proposals, too.\n\nOne alternative block-size proposal that has been gathering support is an incremental increase to 8 megabytes over four years time. Proposed as a temporary solution by Blockstream CEO and hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back, this “2-4-8” option seems acceptable to a significant segment of the Bitcoin Core development team, as well as prominent industry members.\n\nWhen asked by Bitcoin Magazine about the 2-4-8 quick fix, Palatinus said: “This will only move the same discussion to the future, not solving the real issue. However as a temporary solution – possible.”"", 'Tech entrepreneur and bitcoin guru Wences Casares saw his family lose their entire wealth three times in Argentina because of hyperinflation, a currency collapse and confiscation.\n\n""[There\'s] more people in the world who need a currency they can trust than the opposite,"" Casares told Dan Morehead, the ex-head of macro trading at Tiger Management, in a new interview on RealVision Television, a subscription financial news service.\n\nThose instances are what ultimately led him to the digital cryptocurrency bitcoin.\n\nCasares created Argentina\'s first internet provider and later sold his online brokerage firm to Banco Santander for $750 million in 2000. He is now a star of the Silicon Valley bitcoin scene, heading Xapo, a company that provides a bitcoin wallet and storage vault.\n\nThe real ""a-ha"" moment for bitcoin happened when he was planning a trip with a group of childhood friends back in Argentina.\n\n\'I was very skeptical\'\n\n""We all had to chip in some money. They were all in Argentina except me, I\'m here in California. They all got together and gave the cash to one of them. And I was trying to find a way to send money. At the time, PayPal had to stop sending money to Argentina and wire transfers were not working because of the currency control.""\n\nThat\'s when one of his friends suggested using bitcoin.\n\n""I was very skeptical because this particular friend of mine is not particularly tech savvy or financially sophisticated.""\n\nCasares did some research online and arranged a meeting in a Palo Alto cafe with someone he connected with on Craigslist. He gave the man cash and got some bitcoin in return. He immediately sent the bitcoin to his friend in Argentina.\n\n""By the time I made it back to the office my friend had sold it for pesos in Argentina. I was like, \'Wow that\'s incredible. It\'s like magic.\'""\n\nCasares compared the power of bitcoin in the developing world to the cellphone.\n\n""I think it\'s obvious the cellphone had a lot more impact in developing world than the developed world because most phones in the developing world are cellphones. If it weren\'t for cellphones the developing world would not be communicating so it really changed the lives of people in emerging markets.""\n\nThat\'s not to say that cellphones aren\'t important in the developed world though. Bitcoin will be important there too, Casares said.\n\n""It\'s easier to see how [bitcoin can be] transformative and it can change the lives of people in emerging markets, but it also has an important role to play in the developed world.""\n\nWatch the teaser below.

Most likely, this will happen this week, because now the price is rolling down from $3.60. Congratulations to those who sold their coins today for $3.80. This level is significant as an important achievement of Bitcoin price of $380, and as the descent from 0.01 ratio between LTC/BTC pair. How deep will the descent be? It was 0.99 LTC/BTC yesterday and 0.95 LTC/BTC today.\n\nBut why is it happening? It's simple: Bitcoin is growing, so it becomes more profitable, and Litecoin miners more lickely to switch to Bitcoin as their primary focus. The same situation can be observed with DASH, where it manifests even stronger.\n\nDASH\n\nEven without looking at the DASH chart, you can immediately understand that it’s falling just as Bitcoin was reaching new heights yesterday. I can close my eyes and tell you that it’s plummeting.\n\nEyes open, and indeed - it fell almost 7% on Poloniex, and now the 24-hour minimum price is 0.056. The possibility of margin trading on Poloniex and slowness of some traders and miners, who saw this graph only now they rapidly leads the price further down to 0.05. And this is the level where the most interesting trading begins.\n\nDogecoin\n\nDogecoin has a more unique character than other cryptocurrencies, and unlike Litecoin and DASH its price is less dependent on the fluctuations of Bitcoin.\n\nDogecoin did leave the tunnel between 38 and 40 Satoshi, within which it was impossible to trade profitably. But the winds of change blew and the daily trading volume on Cryptsy has grown – first to 30, then to 40, and today more than 55 BTC. The orderbook history gets filled with significant trading amounts: over 10 BTC. Something big is coming. But what is it exactly?\n\nETH\n\nI told you yesterday: not to buy ETH now, wait for a better price.\n\nThis is the same chart for the period of two weeks and one day (yesterday). A green candle displayed no continuation of growth, and there is a global trend to go down. The bottom price for ETG was 0.014-0.018, and those who bought coins at that level could close the deal with a great profit margin. As we can see on this chart, the price went to 0.028-0.032 with huge volumes and liquidity on Poloniex, which means that those who have bought and sold ETH by that time have doubled their stake.\n\nPeercoin\n\nThe main exchange for Peercoin is BTC-E. Recently, the PPC/BTC pair on that exchange began to show signs of recovery. We're used to seeing Peercoin being stuck at the level of about $0.40, when it was not considered as a profitable rate for purchase. But it turned out that $0.40 and lower is a reasonable price to place the order. We are now at the level of about $0.45, with the top line at $0.4779.\n\nConsidering the growth of Bitcoin price, which usually affects other coins’ prices negatively, it is nevertheless a good sign for Peercoin. However it is too early, of course, to think that we will return back to the $8 per Peercoin."", ""Bitcoin, the dominant digital currency that's making its way onto the board room agendas of Fortune 500 companies and into the portfolios of average investors, is poised to have a big 2016.\n\nSince emerging as a niche trading instrument in 2009, bitcoin has garnered significant media attention (more often than not, negative attention). While weathering a barrage of bad headlines, the bitcoin ecosystem has grown, attracting more than $1 billion in venture-capital funding over the last few years, supporting some entrepreneurs to build companies, services and capabilities that utilize bitcoin and the blockchain technology on which it's built, and may transform the financial services landscape forever -- and for better.\n\nIn contrast to fiat currency (like the U.S. dollar), bitcoin has no central authority, has a finite and known cap on its supply, and allows for near instantaneous value transfer. Against a backdrop of currency wars and manipulation, volatility in equity markets, and interest rate uncertainty, investors need diversification in their portfolios, and bitcoin may be the new asset that provides them with just that.\n\nBitcoin is still in its infancy, but that's what makes investing in it promising. Over the last few years, what hasn't killed bitcoin has made it stronger.\n\nRegulation? Now more of a friend to digital currency than its enemy. If bitcoin is going to fulfill its potential, it needs to do so within some regulatory framework and not in a black hole. The IRS has declared bitcoin to be property for tax purposes, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has declared bitcoin to be a commodity, and regulation at the state level has emerged, offering investors similar protections when interfacing with other money service businesses. Adoption? Taking off in a meaningful way. Today, well north of 100,000 merchants and service providers accept bitcoin as a form of payment, and number of daily bitcoin transactions continues to trend higher.""]"
