06/01/2015,"['Ask a U.S. banker about the prospects for Bitcoin, a digital currency with no trusted central authority or mechanism to reverse transactions, and you\'re likely to get a lukewarm answer.\n\nBut financial institutions are increasingly taking an interest in Bitcoin\'s recordkeeping system, known as the blockchain, a so-called distributed ledger that can be used to track much more than stateless electronic tokens.\n\nBank of New York Mellon, for example, has created its own digital currency, BK Coins, and built an employee recognition application that rewards IT staff with the tokens, which can be redeemed for gift cards and vouchers. CBW Bank, an innovative community bank in Weir, Kansas, is building a risk management system incorporating cryptocurrency technology. USAA has a team of researchers looking into the potential of the blockchain.\n\nThese institutions see possibilities for efficiency and security improvements in areas like payments and securities handling through the use of the blockchain.\n\nThe concept of a distributed ledger would seem to be the antithesis of banking. Banks have always kept all manner of data and records \x96 of payments, transactions, loans, what have you \x96in their own systems. You could argue that that\'s what banking is, the business of storing money and information about money.\n\nBut when financial institutions talk about the possibilities of the blockchain and distributed ledgers, they usually don\'t really mean an open, public database that will sustain copies all over the world, like the Bitcoin blockchain. They\'re usually talking about using a variant of blockchain technology that would live in their own data center or private cloud, or be run by a central authority. (A notable exception is the Nasdaq\'s experiment with the Bitcoin network as a means to track security ownership.)\n\n""The blockchain can fundamentally reduce costs and provide real-time service,"" said Chris Skinner, chairman of the Financial Services Club networking group in the U.K. and author of ""Digital Bank."" ""But on the other hand [bankers] want to make it centralized, which runs counter to the concept of blockchain.""\n\nLike an accounting ledger in which entries can\'t be edited once they\'ve been written, the original blockchain\'s distributed ledger is an indelible record of Bitcoin transactions. Maintenance of the blockchain is performed by a network of computers around the world running Bitcoin software. About six times per hour, a new group of accepted transactions, a block, is created, added to the block chain, and quickly published to all nodes. This allows Bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin amount has been spent, which is necessary to prevent double-spending in an environment without central oversight.\n\nKept entirely within a bank, a blockchain is ""nothing more than an application within multiple nodes,"" said Suresh Ramamurthi, the chairman and chief technology officer of CBW Bank. ""It\'s a just a great way to have failover systems.""\n\nHis $12 million-asset bank is working with Ripple Labs, developer of the Ripple protocol, an open-source distributed transaction infrastructure which has its own native digital currency, but can be used to transfer ownership of all sorts of assets.\n\n""We are integrating our existing risk-scoring analytics system to support crypto-currency protocols,"" Ramamurthi explained. ""In most of the existing channels such as check, [automated clearing house] or even debit card, there is a gap between funds availability and funds settlement that helps provide banks some time to manage the risk,"" but like wire transfers, cryptocurrency allows ""instantaneous availability and settlement,"" removing that helpful cushion of time and reintroducing risks.\n\n""As a bank, you can\'t enter into any area unless you understand it,"" Ramamurthi said. ""We\'re using some of these protocols and delving into details on how to understand the gaps and risks of that and integrate them into our risk management system. Once we do that, then we\'ll start to create applications around it.""\n\nAnything that can be defined with a number could be stored in a blockchain-like facility, Ramamurthi said \x96 a payment, a piece of property, a security. ""Anything that can be tagged, which is pretty much anything in the world, can be linked and tracked.""\n\nExperimenting at BNY Mellon\n\nBNY Mellon\'s developers downloaded open source code from Bitcoin.org, modified it to run on the bank\'s internal network, and created BK Coins.\n\n""It\'s a way for own employees to understand what it is so they can think about the implications for their own work and for our clients,"" said Suresh Kumar, the $385 billion-asset bank\'s chief information officer. ""It\'s not that we were interested in Bitcoin, we\'re more interested in blockchain"" \x96 a common refrain among bankers.\n\nIt\'s one of the first projects for the bank\'s relatively new innovation centers, set up to help employees learn about technology initiatives. ""It\'s not like going to a classroom training or a seminar, but something that people can try themselves and play with it,"" Kumar said.\n\nKumar is most interested in using a distributed ledger to track securities and corporate actions.\n\nCorporate actions are events, such as a merger or the death of a CEO, that affect the stock or debt of a company. Tracking them is a source of frustration for most financial institutions, he said, and mistakes can be expensive. ""There\'s no reason why you couldn\'t use [the blockchain] as a mechanism to disseminate information that\'s of interest to all the participants,"" he said. ""That\'s a perfect example of what is possible, that all the participants work off the same facts.""\n\nAlthough initially the bank is experimenting with the blockchain on its own, Kumar also sees a need for partners.\n\n""By nature, you\'re talking about a distributed ledger, so no one company can benefit from it by itself without a network effect, so it\'s important to keep an eye on the vendors that are bringing in a broad number of participants and get everyone to use something,"" Kumar said.\n\nAs it vets vendors in this space, the bank seeks out those that understand its technology, that have sufficient credibility with enough participants, and are able to meet bank-specific needs such as anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer compliance and security, Kumar said.\n\n""We clearly think this is a meaningful innovation and we all need to figure out how to do it,"" Kumar said. ""At the same time, we cannot put the firm and our clients at risk. It\'s a balancing act, but as with any industry, there\'s a sufficient amount of inefficiency in the financial industry and I can only imagine how something like this will help.""\n\nEfficiency is the primary goal.\n\n""Can we use this to speed up cross-border payments?"" he said. ""Are there things we don\'t even do today because they haven\'t been practical?""\n\nLike some Bitcoin proponents, Kumar compares these early days of cryptocurrency to the beginnings of the Internet itself.\n\n""As Internet technology was becoming mainstream, we tried to figure out, \'how do we use this for our businesses\'?"" he said. BNY Mellon used it to build an online brokerage.\n\n""It\'s our responsibility to make sure we understand anything new that comes up on the horizon that has a reasonable chance of success and think about how we can leverage that for our clients and our businesses,"" Kumar said.\n\nSimilar to BNY Mellon, the Swiss giant UBS has opened a technology lab in London \x96 inside the fintech accelerator Level39 at the Canary Wharf office tower -- to explore how the blockchain can be used to verify financial transactions such as securities purchases and cross-border payments.\n\nUSAA Deploys Researchers\n\nIn San Antonio, USAA has a large team of researchers looking into ways the financial services firm might use blockchain technology.\n\nLike BNY Mellon, USAA sees the decentralized nature of the blockchain as a key to efficiency.\n\n""What\'s been talked about is around creating efficiencies in a process,"" said Alex Marquez, managing director of corporate development at USAA.\n\n""That\'s what\'s intrigued us from the start. Because it\'s an immutable contract, there\'s an element that is a proof of record of a transaction that\'s very deep in security, using cryptography,"" Marquez said. ""There\'s an element of that that invokes trust.""\n\nThe auditability of the blockchain is appealing to USAA.\n\n""Any edits to that record that are embedded in the blockchain are forever embedded in that component,"" he said. Such an electronic audit trail could replace paper trails and manual audits.\n\nUSAA is in the learning phase of understanding the technology and the vendors that have begun offering their versions of it, Marquez said.\n\n""We\'re excited by the broad array of companies that are pursuing it, from the large traditional technology companies to the other financial institutions that are kicking the tires on it,"" he said. The company has spoken with several vendors, including Factom, a startup based in nearby Austin, Texas.\n\nA good use for blockchain would be any process that requires extensive recordkeeping, Marquez suggested. Property records, title transfers are possible examples. When someone buys a house, if the title to that house were embedded in the blockchain, it could theoretically be transferred to another person without the need for title insurance.\n\n""If you can make that more efficient, auditable and traceable, with 100% accuracy, that\'s something that\'s of interest,"" he said. ""But we\'re very far away still from doing any deployments. We\'re still learning.""', 'Following the revelation last week that BitFury had developed a prototype light bulb capable of mining bitcoin, the company has announced it plans to take steps to bring the devices to market in 2015.\n\nThough much about the market strategy remains in early stages, the news follows increasing reports that industry companies are attempting to find use cases for bitcoin in line with the broader trend toward connecting everyday devices to the Internet.\n\nBitFury said it intends to invite the community to become a part of its rollout plans, and that it would solicit ideas on how the light bulbs should be marketed to a wider audience as part of a collaborative release.\n\nIn statements, CEO Valery Vavilov suggested that the goal of the project would be to galvanize interest in bitcoin as a technology, and that making any money on the initiative would be secondary to promoting discovery.\n\nVavilov said:\n\n""We believe that the project’s focus should not be on making money from bitcoin mining, but on creating innovative solutions with main purpose to use this product for educational purposes and fun.""\n\nThe light bulb garnered significant attention on Reddit last week when pictures of the devices first began appearing from attendees at the Blockchain Summit, an informal four-day gathering of industry luminaries on Richard Branson\'s private Necker Island.\n\nThe announcement also follows statements from rival bitcoin mining firm 21 Inc that suggest the industry\'s best-funded startup is working to integrate bitcoin mining chips into smartphones and connected devices.\n\nBackstory revealed\n\nThe company indicated that the devices have been in the works for about a year, having first been conceptualized by board member Bill Tai and head of product Niko Punin.\n\nVavilov said that a working prototype of the light bulb was completed in early 2015, and that the version observed at the conference is an improvement on earlier attempts.\n\n""We are now on our third generation of prototype and envision this as an educational product that will help lower the friction toward understanding the technology and making it super easy for kids and adults of all ages to touch bitcoin blockchain ecosystem,"" Vavilov stated.\n\nBitFury said that only a ""couple dozen"" light bulbs have been so far completed as part of the pilot, and that tech specs are slated for release later this year.\n\nThe company envisions a four-step rollout that would find it collecting launch ideas, opening up the project to developers based on received proposals, finding a way to support teams working on the project and choosing the ""best prototypes"" to market to a wider audience.\n\nEvolving strategy\n\nIn line with this spirit of experimentation, BitFury said it is considering all manner of options for the technology\'s release, from open-sourcing the hardware to creating a software development kit (SDK) that would aim to inspire ""social applications"" of the technology.\n\nBitFury suggested that the target market for the light bulbs would be hobbyists who have an interest in exploring new technologies.\n\n""Our board member Bill Tai likens this to products he had as a child such as the RadioShack 100-in-one electronic projects kit, or to modern day Raspberry Pi bundles for first-time users,"" Vavilov continued.\n\nTo support its ecosystem, BitFury suggested the light bulbs would come with an attached wallet for transacting with friends.\n\nNotably, such social applications have also been discussed by 21 Inc, which leaked documents suggest had considered releasing its Internet of Things bitcoin devices with a connected social network.\n\nImages via John Dill for BitFury\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin wallets are typically created by randomly generating a public address and a related private key. As a result, it is important for address and key to be truly random, or else it may be possible to guess the private key by looking at the public address.\n\nTo that end, Blockchain used two sources of random numbers, in what ought to have been a belt-and-braces approach: it pulled a random number from the Android operating system’s built-in random number generator, and then connected to online service Random.org to get a second random number, which it combined with the first.\n\nUnfortunately, on some Android phones (reportedly including devices from the Sony Xperia range), the built-in random number generator failed to report back to the blockchain app. Normally, this should have been survivable, because the app used a second source of random numbers.\n\nBut on 4 January, Random.org strengthened the security of its website, requiring all visits to be made over an encrypted connection. The blockchain app, however, continued to access the site through an unencrypted connection. So rather than getting a random number, as expected, it got an error code telling it that the site had moved.\n\nIt then used that error code as the random number, every single time.\n\nA representative from Blockchain told the Guardian that “the issue we identified related to an extremely rare case where address entropy could create multiple duplicate addresses (meaning more than one wallet essentially was in custody of the address simultaneously). We immediately disclosed the issue and released a fix.\n\nBlockchain denied that the incident was a total cryptobreakdown, and said that “only a very small number of users were affected; we’ve counted just three users who have reached out related to the address in question, which is an extremely minor amount compared to the 3.5 million wallets we have.”\n\nThe magnitude of the error sparked shocked reactions from information security professionals.\n\nMelissa ? (@0xabad1dea) I’m just sitting here like ??? at the foolish audacity of acquiring remotely generated entropy for your Bitcoin app over plaintext\n\nRoot Labs (@rootlabs) Wallet relied on http://t.co/tbMRgU4EP2, which wasn't random? Just another day in the Bitcoin clown show. https://t.co/3QkFk04qVE\n\nIn the meantime, Blockchain has asked users who think they may have been affected to contact its helpdesk."", 'Share on twitter\n\nShare on Google Plus Paul Smith by Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief information officer David Whiteing has warned the bank\'s technology halo could slip unless it embraces crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, online assets like air miles, and gets on the front foot with hiring untapped technology expertise. In a wide-ranging briefing at an Australian Information Industry Association lunch in Sydney, Mr Whiteing gave the clearest indication yet that the bank has recognised a shift in global sentiment towards crypto-currencies, by revealing it is poised to kick off a trial to use peer-to-peer fiat and crypto-currency exchange Ripple for transferring payments between its subsidiaries. He also said standard customer accounts would likely soon be enabled to store various online reward credits. ""I have a view that a bank account will become a storer of value, rather than a storer of currency value, so why can\'t a bank account be used to store loyalty points in the same way that you can use the slider on a Qantas website to decide whether you are paying with points or dollars?"" Mr Whiteing said. ""We have multi-currency bank accounts today, with 15 currencies available on your phone instantly in real-time, so it is not that difficult for us to take that technology and make that a loyalty point store. It shouldn\'t be that difficult for us to then add crypto-currencies to it, and whatever other means of payment transfers people might want.""\n\nThe move to use Ripple internally is a big endorsement for the growing global fintech sector, which is pitching numerous tech-led innovations to change the way the financial services sector operates.\n\nRipple Labs has so far raised $US34.4 million ($45 million) from a range of backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures and IDG Capital Partners and has signed on smaller institutions like Germany\'s Fidor Bank and a number of US banks, but CBA is the first major bank to publicly disclose its plans to use it. Planning for future tech CBA has enjoyed a reputation in recent history of being a pioneer in technology, in relation to other financial institutions, due in large part to a mammoth program to replace its ageing core banking platforms with a modern system. However Mr Whiteing said it needed to press on with a tech agenda. ""One of the things that my leadership team talks about quite a bit is that today we are a technology team in a bank that has a technology halo, tomorrow if we get this right, we will be a technology company that does banking services,"" he said.\n\nMr Whiteing said the bank could not bet on always being ahead of the curve, so needed to design its systems and hire the right staff to be able to react quickly to industry-changing ideas emerging from the tech sector. This will include tearing up the bank\'s carefully-prepared hiring procedures when the need arises. ""We should mirror the society in which we operate, so if we become really good at being inclusive we will be able to harvest the ideas and be able to respond quickly,"" he said. ""Our graduate recruitment process is like every big corporate … it is optimised to get the best and brightest graduates that are extremely well-rounded and show great leadership potential. But quite frankly they are useless in some teams that I have got, where I actually need the person who has the first class degree, but sits in the corner of the cafeteria and really doesn\'t like to talk to people … but is also awesome in crypto or data science."" Following Mr Whiteing\'s speech director of financial services at technology startup Tilikum Investments, Jodi Stanton, said the bank\'s use of Ripple has significant positive implications for financial innovation in Australia.', 'Bitcoin is increasing its presence in the App Store, with Apple approving a second Bitcoin tipping-enabled app by the same developer.\n\nThe app, Game of Birds, incorporates a Bitcoin tipping function for players to receive in-game rewards. The tool, which revolves around players collecting coins while playing the game, has been set up initially in partnership with Coinbase but will in future be available to any wallet address.\n\nOur new Bitcoin tipping game is live ""Game of Birds"" on iOS t.co/M9rMMG36HM Tweet with the hashtag... t.co/58da9lf0WT — Christian Moss (@MandelDuck) May 29, 2015\n\n“The payment feature is simple: the game has its own wallet and the bitcoin that is sent to the users comes from this wallet,” Game of Birds’ Tokyo-based developer Christian Moss, who works under the Mandel Duck brand, told CoinTelegraph. “The game’s wallet balance is supplied by sponsors in exchange for advertising space in the app, more advertising revenue results in more bitcoin that can be sent to the player.”\n\nTo start playing and collecting bitcoin tips:\n\n“[A]ll the user needs to do is enter their email address in the app, after that they need to collect in-game bitcoins that are spread out through the levels, once a coin is collected then a small bitcoin tip is sent to their email.”\n\nThe app features a theme combining Game of Thrones and Angry Birds parody, and while the main ethos is not designed to be Bitcoin, Moss says, increasing Bitcoin’s profile among casual gamers is a main intention.\n\n“I don\'t think that Bitcoin should or needs to be the main focus of the game and the game should be fun to play without receiving Bitcoin tips – the idea behind creating the game was to try and help Bitcoin become more mainstream, I thought that if a game as viral and as popular as say ‘Flappy Birds’ also sent the players Bitcoin imagine what that would do for Bitcoins image and adoption,” he explained.\n\n“There is a lot of talk about developing the ‘killer app’ that will attract normal users to Bitcoin and I think that gaming is possibly where that app could be,” added Moss.\n\nThe authorization comes after the successful release of the same team’s previous app SaruTobi, and marks a continued trend at Apple to allow Bitcoin tipping within its hosted products. Following a series of U-turns regarding Bitcoin within iOS apps, the past year has seen a dramatic turnaround in Bitcoin’s fortunes among iOS users.\n\nTopping the trending search list Sunday was even a Bitcoin-driven app, Bitcoin Billionaire, an occurrence which received no shortage of attention from online commentators. The app, which was launched in December 2014, has surpassed 3 million downloads.\n\nGame of Birds is available to iOS users only, currently with a mandatory signup to Coinbase to facilitate transmission of tips earned during gameplay.', 'Everyone gasped. It was clear Ross Ulbricht would do serious time for running Silk Road, an online bazaar for drugs and illicit activities. But no one predicted a judge would put him in prison until he dies.\n\nWhy was the sentence, handed down on Friday, so harsh? Why did U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest treat Ulbricht, whose only weapon was a keyboard, more severely than many murderers and child molesters?\n\nFor Ulbricht’s supporters, the life sentence confirmed their suspicions: the FBI and Judge Forrest chose to make Ulbricht a scapegoat for America’s failed drug policy, and to punish him for using a technology they could not control.\n\nThe reality is more complicated. While the Silk Road saga is about internet culture and about U.S. drug policy, the real reason Ulbricht will spend life in prison is because of a poor legal strategy and the terrible things he did.\n\nThe case for Ulbricht\n\nThe 31-year-old Ulbricht is smart, handsome and, as the court heard in dozens of letters from family and friends, kind and generous as well. The Silk Road, a website he created under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts,” was a triumph of technology and libertarian ideals.\n\nSilk Road lived in the internet’s so-called dark web, and allowed people anywhere to exchange almost anything they wished in total anonymity. Buyers and sellers, who used Tor software and paid with bitcoin, could even rate each other Yelp-style for honesty and product quality.\n\nFor Silk Road’s users, this was a superior system for obtaining things (mostly narcotics) that governments, for whatever reason, had made illegal. As a marketplace, it was safer than a street corner, and its rating system let people conduct business in a civil fashion.\n\nThe rise of Silk Road also coincided with wide-scale disillusionment with the U.S. “war on drugs,” a policy that has done little to curb narcotic use, but that has had other consequences. These include an expansion of the country’s police and prison systems, broken families and the saddling of millions of people (primarily minorities) with criminal records.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Silk Road offered an online forum for consenting adults to conduct transactions that they would have conducted anyways, but with little fear of law enforcement. As for Ulbricht, his primary contribution was a website where these individuals could meet. Although he sold a few magic mushrooms in the early days, he did not have a direct role in the sales that took place on Silk Road.\n\nThis is why critics find the Justice Department’s case against Ulbricht so unsettling. The counts against him included not only conspiracy and “kingpin” crimes, but also a hacking charge based on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a law many regard as outdated and overly-broad. This led some, including journalists, to suggest that the whole affair was partly a knee-jerk reaction against new technology:\n\nHonest question: Has anyone in history ever been more harshly punished for something they did with a computer? http://t.co/qvYB8rid17 — Andy Greenberg (@a_greenberg) May 29, 2015\n\nVery bad things\n\n“It’s still unclear to me why you kept a journal,” said Judge Forrest while pronouncing Ulbricht’s life sentence.\n\nShe was referring to an online journal, seized by the FBI, that contained mounds of incriminating evidence about the acts and character of the Dread Pirate Roberts a.k.a. Ulbricht. The journal, along with seized emails, texts and instant messages, showed that Ulbricht himself believed he was much more than a website operator.\n\n“I’m running a goddamn multi-million-dollar criminal enterprise,” he said in one message, explaining why he was too busy to socialize. Another declared the U.S. government to be “the enemy.”\n\nAnd while Ulbricht may not have sold items directly, he did get a commission on every Silk Road transaction. This included sales of crack, cyanide, meth and more. The upshot is that Ulbricht became rich to the tune of tens of millions of dollars (until the FBI seized his bitcoins), in part by presiding over some very bad deeds.\n\nEven the harshest critics of the U.S. drug policy would concede some Silk Road transactions were objectively wrong. It’s one thing to object to marijuana as a Schedule One drug; it’s another to sell crack to minors. Then, there were the attempted murders.\n\nThe FBI produced convincing evidence that Ulbricht, in order to eliminate enemies, paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to people who he believed to be hit men. While the hits turned out to have been staged by federal agents, Ulbricht believed he had arranged successful killings, and even requested and obtained a photo of the “murder.” In doing so, he displayed little contrition but instead commissioned further hits. While Ulbricht did not ultimately face murder-related charges, the hits (as he believed them to be) became part of the sentencing considerations; unsurprisingly, they did not help his cause.\n\nAll of this – the profits from the sale of hard drugs, the embrace of criminality, the attempt to commit murder – makes it hard to avoid a conclusion other than Ulbricht was a bad person who did very bad things.\n\nTo save himself, he should have told the court a tale of regret and contrition. Instead, Ulbricht doubled down on the story of Silk Road.\n\nA lousy legal strategy\n\nAs Ulbricht grows old in prison, he will surely rue his choice of lawyer. That lawyer, Joshua Dratel, pursued strategies over the course of the case that can best be described as baffling.\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence against his client, Dratel chose to offer up a far-flung claim that Ulbricht was not Dread Pirate Roberts – and that the real Dread Pirate was still lurking out there on the internet. To no one’s surprise, this theory proved preposterous in court and the resulting conviction meant Ulbricht faced a minimum 20 year sentence; a guilty plea would likely have yielded less. Why did Draton let his client roll the dice on such a flimsy defense?\n\nIn the course of the trial, Dratel also failed to challenge what appeared to be an unconstitutional seizure of Ulbricht’s servers. Had he done so, he may have been able to exclude key trial evidence that helped cook his client’s goose.\n\nIn any event, the verdict came back guilty and there was little left to do but ask for mercy. Here too, however, Dratel chose an unusual tactic. He did not focus on Ulbricht’s remorse (real or feigned), but instead made academic arguments to say leniency was appropriate since Silk Road had reduced the overall harm associated with drugs.\n\nThis was a mistake on two fronts. First, as Judge Forrest observed, the argument was not entirely true: In some cases, Silk Road had expanded the market for dangerous drugs, by making it easier for more people in more places to get hold of them.\n\nMore seriously, Ulbricht was too flawed a defendant to be the poster boy for drug reform. There are no shortage of people who exemplify everything that is wrong with American drug laws (NPR has interviewed many of them), and who could have been held up as a symbol, but the Dread Pirate Roberts is not one of them.\n\nDratel’s approach, which relied on rationalizing Silk Road, was doubly unwise in light of who spoke before him at the sentencing hearing: a Massachusetts father whose son was found dead near a package of heroin purchased from Silk Road, and a mother from Australia whose 16-year-old died on his prom night after ingesting drugs he had bought from the website.\n\nIt’s questionable if those speeches should been part of the hearing in the first place; drug deaths, however tragic, will occur with or without Silk Road – and Ulbricht did not sell the drugs in question. But the parents’ words were heart-rending and sincere. Meanwhile, Dratel’s suggestion that Silk Road was just a scapegoat came across, at times, as arrogant and callous in comparison.\n\nLeaving the judge no choice\n\n“No drug dealer from the Bronx has ever made this argument to the court. It’s a privileged argument and it’s an argument made by one of the privileged,” Judge Forrest told Ulbricht before she sentenced him.\n\nShe’s right. Even though Silk Road amounted to a major criminal and drug enterprise, Ulbricht appeared to be asking for special treatment because he is white, educated and from a good family. In New York City, where many communities have suffered the ravages of drug abuse, and where legions of black and Latino men have earned harsh drug sentences, Ulbricht’s plea irked Judge Forrest.\n\nUlbricht’s arguments about deterrence also proved ill-advised. His lawyer told the court, in effect, that a harsher sentence would be pointless since it would not help to send a message about drugs. This amounted to a dare of sorts: either Judge Forrest could accept the internal logic of the Silk Road community, or else align herself with the agents of the U.S. government who perpetuate the failed drug war.\n\nForrest is a federal judge. How did Ulbricht and his lawyer think she would react to this argument? It’s no surprise that Forrest responded by deciding that, yes, she would make an example of the Silk Road founder to deter others from creating online criminal enterprises of their own.\n\nUlbricht will now remain in prison until he dies. It did not have to be this way. He and his lawyer had many opportunities to obtain a lighter sentence. But they stuck with the story of the Silk Road, and now he will pay the price.', 'Ecuador’s e-money initiative, which kicked off earlier this year after the country outlawed bitcoin, is about to see wider institutional involvement following a government directive.\n\nThe country’s banks were ordered late last month to adopt the payment system within the next year, according to a report by Pan-Am Post’s Belén Marty. The pace at which the banks are required to add support for the initiative, which is a digital representation of the US dollar – Ecuador’s official currency – depends on their size.\n\nEcuadorean banks that possess $1b or more in assets have 120 days to integrate, whereas banks with less than $150m have 360 days as of 26th May to add support. Banks with an amount of assets that fall between those amounts have 150 days to do so.\n\nThe order covers a broad swath of Ecuadorean companies, covering both private and public institutions, as well as entities ""that maintain a network of establishments available for clients and are capable of acquiring mobile money"", as reported by Pan-Am Post.\n\nAccording to the resolution outlining the adoption timeline, the initiative’s intent is to “seek efficiency in payment systems to promote and contribute to the economic stability of the country.”\n\nPlans for the “electronic money” system were struck last year, when the country’s legislature passed a bill prohibiting bitcoin and paving the way for the new currency system to take shape.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The history of money goes back a long way – at least to 2000 BC– and one way of studying the evolution of human societies (and indeed of entire empires) is to follow the money that they used. Coins evolved into banknotes which evolved into cheques which evolved into credit and debit cards, which is more or less where we are now. The big question is what happens next.\n\nIn one sense the answer is obvious: money has to all intents and purposes metamorphosed into digital bits. When you wave your new contactless debit card (or, soon, your iPhone 6) over a retailer’s card-reader, what you’re really doing is instructing a computer to reduce a number stored in a ledger on your bank’s hard drive and increase a number stored on the retailer’s bank’s ledger by a corresponding amount. No physical cash has changed hands: all that’s happened is a transfer of digital information.\n\nIt’s a long way from cowrie shells and the gold standard, but actually it’s only half a revolution. For one thing, even if money has metamorphosed into bits, governments and central banks still control it as if it were a physical thing – and they manipulate it when it suits their political purposes. (What, after all, is “quantitative easing” but a euphemism for printing money?)\n\nBut what is even more absurd is that although money has gone digital, it is still hard to move it around the world – unless you’re a bank. The internet enables an individual instantly to send an email – just a stream of bits – to someone on the other side of the world, but sending them money – also just a stream of bits – is a different kettle of fish. You have to go through established channels (banks or other licensed intermediaries), pay substantial fees and commissions, and sometimes endure unconscionable delays.\n\nThe discrepancy between technological potential and real-world actuality is a red rag to geeks, and so it’s not surprising that from the early days of the net, groups of cypherpunks experimented with ideas of “digital cash” – currencies that were purely digital, global and outside the control of governments. For years, all of these experiments failed, and then, in October 2008, a mysterious, unknown geek calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto invented a new kind of digital currency – bitcoin – and changed the game.\n\nSince then, bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride in multiple dimensions. It has attracted the attention not just of a sceptical mass media, but also of cryptography geeks, scammers, computer scientists, investors (or gamblers, depending on your point of view), entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, criminals, hackers, security services and law-enforcement agencies. To date, most of the drama about bitcoin has been played out in public. But what has been relatively obscure is the story of how the technology evolved and the identity of the individuals who have played significant roles in it.\n\nThis is the story that Nathaniel Popper set out to tell. He’s a New York Times reporter, and it shows: he has apparently limitless stamina, an eye for detail, a compulsive need to provide glib pen portraits (a key player is “a slender man with dark movie-star looks, a sophisticated accent, and clothes that signalled elegance and ease” – that kind of thing), and so on. His book has a huge cast of characters, often referred to just by their first names, so that one sometimes has the feeling of having stumbled into a family saga. And it’s structured like a tech thriller – chronological, with short chapters each concluding on the nearest thing Popper can find to a cliffhanger at that point in his narrative.\n\nBut it is also a highly readable and informative account of the early years of a technology – cryptocurrency – that may one day turn out to be almost as significant as the internet itself. Although the web has already had an enormous economic impact, its real potential remains largely untapped because of the high transaction costs imposed by traditional methods of payment represented by “old money” – credit cards and their equivalents. The economic friction imposed by card transactions (plus the associated costs of fraud and fraud-prevention) mean that the sheer scale of the internet cannot yet be harnessed. But cryptocurrencies on the bitcoin model could change that, because they would enable billions of transactions, each of which might involve only a tiny cash payment, but which in aggregate could be enormous.\n\nTwo things stand out from Mr Popper’s narrative. The first is confirmation of how long and tortuous is the road from a technological breakthrough to real-world acceptance. Anybody who thinks that bringing a technology to market is easy has never done it. The other is the colossal damage done to the prospects of bitcoin (and indeed of cryptocurrencies generally) by the Silk Road online black market, a platform known for selling illegal drugs that used bitcoins as its means of exchange, which was eventually shut down by the US authorities. Given that a currency – analogue or digital – is only as good as the trust that people place in it, the Silk Road fiasco gave governments and the media the spin that they needed – that cryptocurrencies are really only for bad people. Which is a shame, because it may be that they are just what a networked world needs.\n\nDigital Gold is published by Allen Lane (£20).

It joins a market that includes Apple Pay, PayPal, MasterPass, and Visa Checkout. Android Pay will work with any Android phone that is equipped with an NFC (Near-field Communications) chip and KitKat operating system, or later.\n\nPali Bhat, Google’s Director of Product Management, said in a press release:\n\n“Mobile payments is a big priority for Google, so we’ve been working with major networks like MasterCard to help provide a seamless experience across a wide range of phones and stores. Android Pay will offer people further simplicity, security and choice when paying for things with their Android phones.”\n\nTo enter this payment market, Android Pay has the requisite partnerships with the establishment’s payments leaders: Amex, Discover, MasterCard and Visa. To enhance the security of adding a consumer’s debit or credit card to the program, biometric fingerprint scanners are there to allow transactions to take place. Mastercard supports Apple Pay and now Android Pay, and noted the card number is not released to merchants during transactions, like Apple Pay.\n\nWith over three million merchants worldwide using the MasterCard Digital Enablement Service for options like MasterPass, contact-less payments are becoming a more common option in traditional commerce. Visa is also releasing the very similar-sounding Visa Digital Enablement Program, facilitated by new payments protocols like Android Pay.\n\nBraintree, which is a subsidiary of PayPal, has been a leader in integrating multiple payment programs for merchants, including decentralized peer-to-peer payment options like bitcoin.\n\n“We’re expanding our open platform to enable the future of mobile commerce. A key part of that is providing flexible tools that let merchants accept all relevant forms of payments so consumers can pay how they want to pay. That is the premise of our v.zero SDK — one integration, any way to pay, including what comes next,” wrote Juan Benitez, Braintree’s CTO.\n\nHe added:\n\n“With very little effort, merchants will be able to add Android Pay, also to credit and debit cards, PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, and bitcoin — all with a single integration.”\n\nIt should be interesting to see how Android Pay catches on, with Apple Pay offering many of the same features, and having been on the market for almost a year already. Apple Pay was launch in October 2014, and after an initial launch surge in October, it has leveled off to a fraction of the interest of digital payments options like bitcoin, according to Google.\n\nBitcoin has been in existence since 2009 and does all of the above services for consumers and businesses without the need for biometric scans, debit cards, credit cards, banks, or the fees included within. User’s personal information has never been a part of a bitcoin transaction, as cards are not needed to send payments anywhere in the world within seconds.\n\nWhile bitcoin has been associated with exchange closures and pump-and-dump scams, BTC payments and blockchain security issues have never been a problem compared to what has transpired within traditional card-based payment systems.\n\nWith hacks into major retailers like Home Depot, Target, and even banks like JP Morgan Chase over the last eighteen months, biometrics like fingerprint scanning are the next step in security. This loss of personal privacy is another attempt to fix a flawed payment system based on 1950’s card technology that has been beset by identity theft issues for the past decade.\n\nAccording to ACI Payment Systems, more than 1 in 3 people in the United States and the United Kingdom were impacted by credit/debit card fraud in 2012. Also, almost 5% of Americans has suffered identity theft, at some point. These are issues that do not affect bitcoin users (as long as they are in control of their private keys).\n\nWhat happens to these fingerprint scans and who keeps these records is unknown and was not released by Google during their announcement. Does Android pay trade one security issue for another? If you need to scan your fingerprint that is verified through a central server in order to send a payment “securely,” that should be a red flag of a much larger security problem, not an alleged consumer benefit to glorify.\n\nBitcoin does not require fingerprints to provide maximum payment security, so why do so-called “Payment Solutions” like Apple Pay and Android Pay need them to do the same?\n\nIt seems more like a revolving door of privacy and security questions that are not going to be answered, or even asked by the average Android Pay consumer. What a shame.', 'Crypto Public Notary, a free notary service using the bitcoin block chain to provide digital document provenance, recently launched.\n\nDigital document provenance is the ability to prove a document existed at a specific point in time, according to Alex Sherbuck, the creator of Crypto Public Notary. Using an address derived from the cryptographic hash of a digital file, any bitcoin transaction to that address serves as a public timestamp.\n\nOKCoin/Roger Ver dispute drives interest\n\nSherbuck, who works in health care IT in Pittsburgh, Pa., says he became interested in digital document provenance after reading about the recent OKCoin/Roger Ver contract dispute. OKCoin, a Chinese bitcoin exchange, announced it will no longer manage the domain Bitcoin.com due to a contractual conflict with its owner, Roger Ver.\n\nCrypto Public Notary allows anyone to obtain a notarized digital record of any type of digital file, including text, images, source code, contracts, titles, legal documents or any other digital file.\n\nFor example, using the hash of a signed contract as a bitcoin private key, the parties to the contract can derive a public key and, therefore, an address. If a single bit in the file changes, so does the bitcoin address. One or both of the two parties then send a dust transaction to that address, forever recording it in the block chain. Anyone can then verify that document links to that address and that it existed at that point in time.\n\nCrypto Public Notary uses the SHA256 hash of any digital file and uses that value as a bitcoin private key. Effectively, the file is acts as a pass phrase for anyone who wants a notarized version of the file.\n\nAlso read: NSA infiltration into encryption systems shows the need for bitcoin and cryptography\n\nTransaction provides a timestamp\n\nCrypto Public Notary provides the bitcoin address for that key pair and a private key. A party seeking the notarized file sends a small amount of bitcoin to the address. The party receiving the notarized file can then sweep the private key, reclaiming their bitcoin. The transaction in the block chain serves as a timestamp.\n\nThere is a network transaction fee. Other than this fee, the notary service will remain free, Sherbuck said.\n\nThe service runs completely in the browser. The user retains full ownership of their digital documents.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.cryptopublicnotary.com/\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
06/02/2015,"['Bitcoin has been in existence for more than six years already, yet it seems like the system is having a tough time securing the trust of the general public. After all, the cryptocurrency has gained a bad reputation for being used in underground markets and money laundering activities, and it doesn’t help that some bitcoin exchanges like Mt. Gox have suffered hacking attacks and have ultimately shut down.\n\nWhile governments and states are trying to come up with legislation to oversee this industry and protect consumers, many are still doubtful that digital currency security can be established. What does bitcoin need to earn our trust?\n\nTrusting in Digital Currency\n\nThe underlying technology for bitcoin, which is the blockchain, could hold the key in generating trust for the system. Blockchain is the public ledger of transactions for bitcoin, which are verified by a network of computers solving complex algorithms. With that, the transactions involved are purely anonymous and immutable.\n\nBitcoin transactions also come with much lower costs compared to traditional forms of payment through credit or debit cards. This is because bitcoin miners are rewarded with the cryptocurrency for every verified transaction or additional block added to the blockchain, lessening the need to profit from each transaction by charging consumers or merchants.\n\nDigital currency enthusiasts say that the rise of this cryptocurrency could wind up disrupting the financial services sector, which has long relied on a set of middlemen or intermediaries such as banks to verify transactions. Bitcoin could reduce the risk of fraud and the expense of transactions by replacing the middlemen with a suite of cold, hard technological tools.\n\nIn effect, cryptocurrencies promise to maintain the normal operations of a financial system but with fewer middlemen and lower costs. However, the lack of a regulatory body overseeing this activity still leaves many skeptical that the system would thrive.', 'Ross Ulbricht, aka the “Dread Pirate Roberts”, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole by a Manhattan Federal Court for masterminding the Silk Road anonymous online illegal marketplace. Ulbricht was labelled a drug dealer and criminal profiteer, and Judge Forrest was unequivocal in stating that “a message must be sent out that no one is above the law”.\n\nThe Silk Road was an online marketplace designed to allow users to conduct illegal business anonymously beyond the reach of law enforcement. It operated like an eBay for illegal goods, complete with the opportunity for buyers to provide feedback scores to sellers so others could gauge their trustworthiness and quality of product.\n\nThe site used a mix of sophisticated privacy technologies to try to hide the identities of its users. Run as a Tor hidden service within the Dark Web, Silk Road’s servers were only accessible through Tor software in order to mask their IP addresses and physical location. Transactions were carried out using bitcoin due to the pseudonymity it affords. Buyers and sellers guides were available on the website to assist in using the technology without detection.\n\nOfficially the FBI insists that Ulbricht made mistakes which allowed detectives to uncover his identity and location. The subsequent sites that attempted to follow in its wake were brought down through similar mistakes. But the evidence and explanations given by the FBI in court were not convincing, leading to rumours that the FBI used malware or enlisted the NSA to help track down Silk Road and its users within Tor.\n\nTechnological fall-out\n\nIt is already known that Tor users are vulnerable at the point that traffic enters and exits the Tor network. Generally though it is thought that users cannot be tracked within the network – but if there is some basis to the speculation that the FBI used malware or enlisted the help of the NSA to bring down the Silk Road then it may be possible that to identify the real internet IP addresses associated with Tor traffic. Certainly this would put an end to any chances of a new Silk Road, and it would also inevitably lead to prosecution of much of the other illegal activity that goes on within the Deep Web. On the other hand, the lack of moves by law enforcement suggests this may not be the case.\n\nThe limits to the anonymity afforded by bitcoin has also been highlighted. While the value of bitcoins remains within the blockchain, the anonymity persists. But for the owner of bitcoins to realise their value, they must be spent or transferred through exchanges into real-world currency – at which point the owner is liable to be traced. Once a wallet ID has been linked to an individual bitcoin, transactions become highly traceable, as all transactions involving that ID are viewable on the public ledger. This is why governments are choosing to regulate to bitcoin through digital exchanges.\n\nUnless bitcoin becomes more readily accepted then it will be hard for criminals to avoid the temptation to cash out at digital exchanges, linking them to their ill-gotten gains. However, there may be other cryptocurrencies with the means to get around these weaknesses in the future.\n\nSo while the Silk Road and several of its immediate successors are gone, the suggestion that the technology behind these marketplaces is flawed is based on speculation that the FBI or NSA have cracked them. If the FBI’s claims that Ulbricht and Blake Benthall of “Silk Road 2.0” were caught due to their own mistakes are true, then it’s still possible for similar anonymous marketplaces to escape prosecution in the future.\n\nOf course, in light of the severe sentence handed to Ulbricht it will depend on whether those would-be entrepreneurs with plans to found other online marketplaces have sufficient belief in the technology’s security to try their luck. So perhaps the judge’s aim in sentencing to deter others could still play a part.', 'Bitcoin will not see a surge in Greece following this week\'s debt payment decision, BitMEX\'s founder has said.\n\nThe comment comes as the Greek government is due to make four payments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) worth $1.8bn this month, with $3.3m due this Friday.\n\nThere are concerns that the country does not have the funds to pay and could potentially default on the debt, leading to its exit from the eurozone.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX, said:\n\n""Greeks are rushing to send their euros outside the country to more stable banking systems.

Throw a dynamic and interconnected social-technical distributed currency network into the mix, and even the famously epigrammatic Yogi Berra would be at a loss to package the issue in an appropriately pithy witticism.\n\nThe core developers of the Bitcoin protocol face a difficult technical decision. How they decide to respond to an impending 1MB limit on the maximum block size allowed in the blockchain will fundamentally impact how and even whether the technology can be used for everyday purchases or institutional transfers, by average people or professional investors alike.\n\nThere are now no easy answers. The many exceptional minds participating in the technical conversation launch are diverging on understandable points of disagreement against the most likely proposals. Adding to the complexity is the unfortunate fact that many well-considered arguments are by Bitcoin’s short existence purely theoretical in the present — but urgently possible and potentially quite detrimental once breached. It’s a question fraught with pressure, but one that must be addressed nevertheless.\n\nIntroducing blocksizedebate.com\n\nWe want to help clear up some of these uncertainties. Earlier this month, my colleague Eli proposed that combinatorial prediction markets can be used to provide insights into the unknown. Now, we have assembled a model market of relevant block size predictions on SciCast, a research project based at George Mason University. We created a website, blocksizedebate.com, summarizing the most recent predictions that developers can observe in real time.\n\nKeeping in mind that there are no panaceas in life, and that the information gleaned from prediction markets can be subtly influenced by incentives not present in the real world, we believe that that prediction markets can provide valuable insights into likely outcomes given certain assumptions. After receiving some encouragement from Gavin Andresen, we decided to build the project.\n\nIn this post, I’ll explain how prediction markets like SciCast can provide insight into the likely outcomes of the complex factors involved in the block size debate before describing our model and our plans to expand on this project in the future.\n\nThe debate, in brief\n\nThe crux of the debate hinges on an arbitrary protocol limit to the maximum block size added by Satoshi Nakamoto as an anti-spam measure in the network’s infant years. By temporarily limiting the size of an allowable block of 1MB, Satoshi prevented malicious actors from undermining the early network with pointless transactions.\n\nThis was not a problem for most of Bitcoin’s history, since the market-determined equilibrium block size tended far below this short-term production quota. Besides, Satoshi and other early users expected that a higher block size limit would eventually be gradually phased in as the network matured and block sizes inched slowly closer to the limit.\n\nHowever, the block size limit was never actually changed. Now, average Bitcoin block sizes creep noticeably closer to the protocol limit by the week. If current trends hold, it is projected that the network will hit the 1MB production quota by late 2016.\n\nSome in the Bitcoin community, notably leading developer Gavin Andresen, advocate that the block size limit should be increased through a hard fork to the Bitcoin protocol. Whether they support a one-time rule instituting constantly increasing block sizes, or a series of ad hoc increases as needed, or something in between, this camp worries that the increased costs in time and transaction fees caused by an inefficient production quota on block sizes could render Bitcoin all but unusable to non-institutional users — thereby potentially undermining the technology’s core value proposition and even its future.\n\nOthers worry about the potential unintended consequences of such a change. Perhaps sufficiently large block sizes will have the negative effect of centralizing mining and volunteer nodes, thereby rendering the network vulnerable to the same kinds of third party service providers from which it was created to secede. Network security could be compromised as well, if allegedly “race to the bottom” transactions fees for miners slice profits to such thin margins that the hash rate drops to dangerous levels as enough miners simply leave the market.\n\nMore existentially, some are concerned about the general effects of any hard fork change to the protocol. Earlier glitches that could be contained by the coordination of a smaller, perhaps more community-minded network may now cause more chaos than can be symbiotically managed.\n\nThese issues are complex, interrelated, and extremely potent — some of the least attractive qualities anyone would want in a decision they must make. Fortunately, prediction markets incentivize individuals to provide useful information that can help shed light on the likeliest outcomes.\n\nHow can prediction markets help?\n\nIt can be hard to determine and properly weight which opinions are most grounded in accurate evidence and probability and which opinions are founded upon less reliable factors.\n\nEconomic decisions are much less fraught with these uncertainties. Market prices promote rational economic decision-making by summarizing complex information about relative material scarcity, production, and demand into an easy-to-digest number that actors factor into their own plans — thereby influencing the price with the information of their own actions (or lack thereof).\n\nThe rhetoric of the prediction itself does not compel action, as is often the case with non-market social coordination in politics, culture, and business. Rather, market actors compare the content of any prediction to the reality reflected in prevailing prices in order to adjust or maintain their market behaviors, which is communicated to others as an updated price.\n\nScientists studying human decision-making believe that prices can be used to coordinate information and guide informed decisions about non-material questions concerning things like politics, business, and technology — what economist Robin Hanson has termed “futarchy.”\n\nHow can we “price” such information about the Bitcoin block size debate? Through good, old-fashioned betting.\n\nPrediction markets provide a messaging space for individuals to submit, observe, and react to such evidence in the form of “prices” on specific questions. In encouraging individuals to put their “money where their mouths are” by attaching a monetary incentive to opinions, prediction markets can promote more accurate projections than those arrived at solely through debate and rhetoric.\n\nWhat is SciCast?\n\nThese ideas form the motivating assumptions behind the SciCast project.\n\nWhile not a full prediction market — strict US regulations all but prohibit the operation of information markets with full monetary rewards — SciCast does allow users to bet and earn tokens by correctly projecting the answers to ongoing scientific questions (and provides some compensation through contests for accuracy and complex predictions). The platform therefore emulates market prices that serve as projections for each question.\n\nFor example, let’s say you work for a public health organization and you want to get a better idea of where to focus resources over the next year. You can put up a question asking if increasing polio outbreaks in certain parts of the world will lead to enhanced eradication efforts by the end of the year. SciCast users can read the question to understand how the answer will be determined before researching the issue and betting tokens on their best hunch.\n\nThey can mull over the issue with other betters in the discussion forum, reacting to relevant news stories and adjusting their predictions accordingly. Projections vary over time as new evidence arrives for evaluation; as time inches closer to the resolution date, you should have a better idea of whether or not it makes sense to dispatch polio eradication efforts in these zones. This particular question indeed resolved in the affirmative by the expiration date; the most recent prediction affirmed the realized trend.\n\nWhat’s more, SciCast is a combinatorial prediction market. This means that users can not just weigh in on individual questions, but can also make predictions on questions assuming that the answer to another question resolves in a specific way.\n\nUsers can view the network of questions that relate to the one they are currently researching, since the answer to other questions may influence the direction of the answer to the current question in many different ways. SciCasters can provide added precision about linked possibilities and therefore a richer matrix of projections to guide decision-making. You can find more detailed explanations of how to use SciCast at its website.\n\nHere’s what we did\n\nOver the past few weeks, Eli and I have been formulating relevant questions about the Bitcoin block size debate to understand what the impact of two specific block size proposals would have on the Bitcoin price, hash rate, number of transactions, and number of node operators at various points in 2016. They were published two weeks ago and are open for predictions.\n\nThe two proposals we are studying are:\n\nIncreasing the block size through a hard fork, and The “replace by fee” patch proposed by Peter Todd. Other proposals can certainly be added for analysis over time, but we decided to begin with these two as a proof of concept.\n\nThe official question for (1) reads: “Will a hard fork in the Bitcoin protocol introduce a change to the block size limit by DATE?”\n\nWhile the official question for (2) reads: “Will the replace by fee patch be adopted into the Bitcoin reference client by DATE?”\n\nThe questions were duplicated four times to resolve as either “yes” or “no” on one of the following dates:\n\nMarch 31, 2016;\n\nJune 30, 2016;\n\nSeptember 30, 2016; or\n\nDecember 31, 2016.\n\nAdditionally, questions asking users to predict a specific number or range about the Bitcoin price, network hash rate, daily transaction volume, and number of nodes were duplicated to resolve on each of those four dates. This allows users to make predictions about what will happen to each of these key network variables if the two protocol changes that we are analyzing occurs or does not occur on the last day of every third month over the next year.\n\nHere’s how everything fits together\n\nLet’s say that you believe that the block size limit needs to be increased through a hard fork as soon as possible. If it is not increased, you believe that the price will crash. If it is increased, you think that the price will at least remain stable.\n\nYou might start by looking at the prevailing price projection for March on 2016. Currently, the market projects a price of US$358. If the block size limit is not increased by that date, the market projects a price of US$338, only slightly lower than the basic projection. You can bet on your hunch that the price of bitcoin will crash if the block size is not increased by March 31, 2016 by setting the question about a hard fork to resolve as false, and submitting a projection of only US$60, as shown in the example to the left.\n\nNext, you could reflect your prediction that the price of bitcoin will not change very much if the block size limit is enacted. Simply set the question about a hard fork to resolve as true and then select a bitcoin price that is closer to the basic market projection of US$358, as shown in the second example above.\n\nYou could then repeat the same prediction process for the prices resolving on June 30, September 30, and December 31, perhaps with even more dramatic price movements as the problem grows greater over time. By clicking on the “network” tab of any question, you can see how questions relate to each other and affect connected predictions.\n\nPerhaps you discover that the market projects a patterned association between movements in price and the Bitcoin hash rate. To earn extra tokens, you might place bets on hash rate questions that were initially unrelated to your main thesis that the bitcoin price will crash without a block size increase.\n\nOr maybe resolutions to other Bitcoin questions inform and change your opinions on the likely impact of the total number of transactions if the replace by fee patch is implemented. The possibilities are not exactly endless, but they are pretty open-ended. SciCast allows users to learn and earn from the market of predictions, resulting in a dynamic probability matrix that developers can use to get insights about the likelihoods of their actions given certain assumptions.\n\nA table displaying the current predictions for all of the questions resolving at the end of 2016 can be accessed at blocksizedebate.com.\n\nThe future of our mild futarchy\n\nSince being published on SciCast, a number of users have cast their tokens to project the likely outcomes. But we still need more. Because projections are more likely to be accurate when questions receive a sizable number of predictions, we are hoping to spread the word about our project so that plenty of people get involved and add their insights.\n\nSciCast is a unique tool because of its combinational prediction options, but it is only one of many ways to generate market projections. We will continue to monitor and add questions to SciCast as appropriate. At the same time, we will explore new and alternative options to harness the power of markets and provide answers to these difficult questions.\n\nIdeally, we will develop a combinational prediction market with true monetary risks and rewards — perhaps on one of the blockchain-based platforms currently in development.\n\nWe’ll post analyses of the results and updates about our progress on Plain Text and at blocksizedebate.com — stay tuned, and happy predicting!\n\nBy Andrea Castillo', 'World\n\nChristmas 2015 may find you with a money-making light-bulb stuffed into your stocking, if ASIC manufacturers BitFury have their way.\n\nThe news of a light bulb that can mine Bitcoin when plugged in made significant waves on Reddit four days ago when pictures began to emerge depicting the BitFury-branded device (it’s hard to know what else to call it), from the Blockchain Summit – a gathering of Bitcoin visionaries and shakers on Necker Island, owned by Richard Branson.\n\nFor BitFury the project is evangelical rather than visionary. BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov says of the initiative “We believe that the project’s focus should not be on making money from Bitcoin mining, but on creating innovative solutions with main purpose to use this product for educational purposes and fun,”\n\nBitcoin’s cryptocurrency system relies on an ecostructure of donation of CPU cycles and bandwidth to maintain and update the blockchain transaction ledger underpinning the system. Contributors are rewarded in bitcoins, 25 per ‘hash’. ASIC manufacturers create hardware specially designed to handle Bitcoin data, and BitFury provide a range of machines and chips, all rather drier in ambit than the user-friendly light bulb, to handle the exigencies of Bitcoin hashing.\n\nThe light bulb has no commercial price tag estimated yet, but is said to be released with a accompanying wallet for social transactions. It was conceived over a year ago by BF board member Bill Tai and the company’s head of product Niko Punin, with a functional prototype created earlier this year. The version revealed at the Blockchain Summit is the latest in a series of prototypes, and is increasing awareness of the capacity of modest devices to contribute to the Bitcoin network – and be rewarded.\n\nThe company has announced various possibilities for the development of the light bulb project, including the possibility of open-sourcing the hardware itself and releasing an SDK to inspire ‘social applications’ of the project, all aimed at the kind of hobbyist enthusiasts likely to tinker with a Raspberry Pi or strip down a popular new hardware release.\n\nThe announcement of the BitFury light bulb follows a recent trend towards using the potential ubiquity of the Bitcoin network to overlay potential new strata of social networks, with details of 21 Inc’s own Bitcoin-based socially networked devices having recently leaked on to the net.', 'Getty Images\n\nThe National Security Agency knows Edward Snowden disclosed many of its innermost secrets when he revealed how aggressive its surveillance tactics are. What it doesn\'t know is just how much information the whistleblower took with him when he left.\n\nFor all of its ability to track our telecommunications, the NSA seemingly has little clue exactly what documents, or even how many documents, Snowden gave to the media. Like most large organizations, the NSA had tools in place to track who accessed what data and when. But Snowden, a system administrator, apparently was able to cover his tracks by deleting or modifying the log files that tracked that access.\n\nAn Estonian company called Guardtime says it has a solution to that: using the same ideas that underpin the digital currency Bitcoin, the company says it can ensure no one can alter digital files, not even an organization\'s most senior executives or IT managers. The idea is to stop the next Snowden in his tracks by making it impossible to tamper with data, such as the NSA log files, in secret.\n\nTo prevent people from spending a single bitcoin twice, all transactions are recorded in a global, distributed ledger called the blockchain. All copies of the bitcoin client software include a copy of the blockchain, and falsifying the ledger would require controlling at least half of all the copies in existence.\n\nGuardtime\'s Black Lantern uses the same idea applied to any chunk of data, such as an access log file or the data gathered by Internet of Things sensors. The blockchain could then be distributed to every executive, or even every employee, to ensure no one person can alter it. It doesn\'t encrypt the data, but it can let you know if someone has tampered with it.\n\nHad the NSA been using Black Lantern, the agency would have been able to detect Snowden\'s activities early on, or at least would have much better idea of what Snowden took, says Guardtime CTO Matt Johnson, a former agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations agent and defense contractor.\n\n""It keeps honest people honest,"" he says. ""It makes it impossible for them to lie.""\n\nSecuring Digital Assets\n\nThere\'s irony in a former federal law enforcement officer pitching a bitcoin-style decentralized cryptography system as a way of securing the NSA\'s data. Bitcoin proponents praise the blockchain as a way for citizens to hide their online tracks from the government; but Guardtime shows how the same technology could be used as a tool for surveillance.\n\nWe\'ve already seen others repurpose bitcoin\'s code to create applications like Bitmessage, (an attempt to create a secure peer-to-peer messaging platform) and Namecoin (a decentralized alternative to the domain name system). Some hackers even aspire to create autonomous distributed corporations: online services that could exist without any human owners.\n\nBut Guardtime suggests these technologies are good for more than creating highly decentralized applications that replace or circumvent governments and corporations. Large organizations could use this technology to secure their assets.\n\nGuardtime isn\'t the only company working on this. Last year IBM published a report proposing the creation of a blockchain-driven communications system for the Internet of Things. But Guardtime\'s product isn\'t theoretical. The Estonian government is using it for a range of purposes, including protecting data archives and patient health records. And through a partnership with telecom company Ericsson, Black Lantern is being sold to private firms.\n\nMaking Data Tamper-Proof\n\nLike IBM, Guardtime thinks the Internet of Things could be the killer application for the blockchain. As more and more connected devices gather data and store it in the cloud—and governments and private citizens alike create automated systems that respond to that data—ensuring data hasn\'t been tampered with is crucial – especially if you have to trust outside vendors or hosting providers.\n\n""We have to demonstrate the the hardware has not been tampered with,"" says Ericsson CTO Jason Hoffman.\n\nThat could be especially important for securing safety critical systems such as connected cars, implanted medical devices and airplane control systems.\n\nIt is important to understand the data itself isn\'t stored in the blockchain. Rather, it stores what\'s called a cryptographic hash, a long and unique mathematically-generated string of letters and numbers that corresponds to the original piece of data. Cryptographers can use these hashes to tell whether a file or piece of data has been changed. If you\'ve ever downloaded a piece of open source software that displayed a bunch of random characters with a label like ""SHA"" or ""MD5"" next to the download link, you\'ve seen this in action.\n\nThese sorts of hashes are what Guardtime distributes to various machines. The upshot is that private data, such as health care records, can be monitored with the blockchain without those records ever needing to be shared.\n\nFrank Cilluffo of the George Washington University Center for Cyber and Homeland Security is intrigued. Cilluffo says a properly implemented version of the concept could have huge security ramifications because it addresses internal, not external, attacks. ""This is throwing the way we think on its head,"" he says.\n\nThe big question is whether any of this will work the way the company says it will. But the theory is sound says Matthew Green, a cryptographer and assistant research professor computer science at Johns Hopkins University. Although he isn\'t familiar with Guardtime\'s product, Green says some of the basic ideas have been explored before, including in this paper co-written by cryptographer and former WIRED columnist Bruce Schneier. ""Block chains and decentralized systems seem like an obvious extension to this idea,"" Green says. The limitations are the cost of running additional servers to host the blockchain, and the fact that you\'re just monitoring whether data is changed, not protecting the data itself.\n\nKeeping Governments Honest\n\nWhile Black Lantern could be used by governments to protect its secrets, it just as easily could be used as a tool to keep government accountable.\n\nUsing Guardtime, a government could, in theory, give all citizens a copy of a blockchain that records changes to email log files. It wouldn\'t stop a political leader from deleting important email, and it wouldn\'t place the contents of the email, or even the metadata, in the ledger. But it would alert auditors and investigators to changes.\n\nIn other words, using the blockchain as a surveillance tool could go both ways. Convincing any government agency to implement such a radical safeguard, however, is another matter.', 'James D’Angelo wants to cap the world’s carbon emissions, and he wants to do it using bitcoin — that digital currency you’ve heard about but don’t quite understand.\n\nThe NASA engineer turned rapper turned conservationist turned cryptocurrency enthusiast turned YouTube personality calls his plan “the people’s cap-and-trade,” or Sno-Caps. It would give everyone in the world equal access to the carbon market, have almost no operating costs, and require zero government involvement.\n\nCue the head scratching and skeptical faces. Yes, it’s an unconventional idea. And yes, it’s coming from an unconventional guy, but let’s see where this goes.\n\nI called up D’Angelo last month in Brookline, Mass., where he lives with his wife and 3-year-old son. He was eager to tell me about Sno-Caps, but first, I said, I wanted to discuss his résumé. It was “interesting,” I told him. D’Angelo laughed and said interesting was a nice way to describe it — one his mother probably wouldn’t use.\n\nHe assured me that there was some method to the madness — behind every seemingly random twist in his career path was either a fascination with technology, passion for the environment, desire to fix broken political systems, or some combination of the three.\n\nD’Angelo started working at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland in 1988, while earning a master’s degree in computer science and electrical engineering from MIT. The work was engaging, he said, and the people were great, but he just couldn’t sit through any more doughnut-fueled 7 a.m. meetings.\n\n“As a 24-year-old who liked music and going out, it was tough,” he said. Plus, he’d always been an excitable guy and was ready to try something new.\n\nSo, naturally, D’Angelo moved to Philadelphia, pretended to be an experienced music producer, and used his technical know-how to loop and sample his way into the rap industry. One thing led to another, and he became Oatie Kato, front man of The Goats, an early-’90s rap trio known for its politically charged lyrics. Here’s some “lost footage” remixed by Oatie himself back in 2013 (D’Angelo is the one in the white t-shirt, using a hammer as a microphone). Enjoy:\n\nOver the years, D’Angelo also dabbled in the movie biz and did wildlife conservation work in Kenya, Bolivia, and Gabon. He first heard about bitcoin in 2012, when he was doing volunteer research for a liberal Austrian economist (because of course he was). The guy studied local currencies and hated bitcoin, D’Angelo recalled.\n\n“I just kept hearing how bad this new thing was, but I had to research it, and I didn’t hate it,” D’Angelo said with a laugh. “So I got pretty excited about it and started reading more and more.”\n\nFast-forward to the present. D’Angelo now works as a cryptography and finance consultant. He also hosts the World Bitcoin Network channel on YouTube, where he explains bitcoin basics and gushes about all the ways we could use the technology.\n\nLast year, D’Angelo released this 40-minute explainer video introducing the bitcoin-based “people’s cap-and-trade” plan. He named it Sno-Caps for its association with the cold and because D’Angelo used to really like snow cones (this guy!):\n\nHere’s the gist: Starting at birth, every person on earth would be entitled to an equal share of carbon emissions each year. The size of that share would depend on a global emissions cap coded into the Sno-Caps software.\n\nTo claim their shares, people would just have to open up bitcoin accounts and register with D’Angelo’s system. Then, throughout their lives, they’d be free to lease out their carbon shares to big emitters in exchange for money, all of which would happen via the bitcoin network. And because everyone would be leasing, rather than selling, there’d be no risk of someone buying up the market, and people could always cancel their leases with companies that misbehave.\n\nNow, in a perfect world, D’Angelo would launch Sno-Caps, recruit a small cohort of early adopters, do some serious publicity, and then the network would go through a Facebook-like explosion, resulting in a people-run, government-free global cap-and-trade system.\n\nIn reality, D’Angelo has to iron out a few kinks before launching, and even then, the odds of Sno-Caps taking off like Facebook are slim — like, insanely slim.\n\nThat said, the idea behind Sno-Caps — that citizens of the world could band together and start their own cap-and-trade system, collectively flipping off their stagnated governments in the process — is just too juicy to pass up. So let’s dive in and take a look.\n\nWhy bitcoin?\n\n“Anyone dealing with bitcoin really has to throw away their brain and start from scratch,” D’Angelo told me. “I’ve thought about it a good portion of each week for three years and have to say, I don’t get it all, and I’m learning new stuff each day.”\n\nFirst introduced in 2009 by an unknown inventor who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin isn’t just a digital currency. Digital currencies have been around since the ’90s, starting with E-Gold back in 1996, so that’s nothing new. The true innovation behind bitcoin — and the reason people are so geeked about it — is the way the system keeps track of transactions.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of how the technology works, check out this beginner’s guide. Otherwise, if you don’t have time to fall down the rabbit hole, here’s the abbreviated version of why — in D’Angelo’s opinion — bitcoin is the perfect platform for a worldwide cap-and-trade system:\n\nEvery exchange of bitcoin is recorded on “the blockchain,” a transparent, online public ledger that people can use for free to conduct peer-to-peer transactions without third-party brokers (or their damn fees). No central authority owns or controls the system, and every transaction is linked to every other transaction on the blockchain, so if someone tries to erase or change a transaction, his or her shenanigans will ripple through the entire system, visible to everyone.\n\n“We’re talking about something that’s fundamentally different from any way of reporting information that we’ve ever known — a permanent and immutable and public database,” D’Angelo said. Which is why he wants to use it to track the world’s carbon emissions.\n\nHow would Sno-Caps work?\n\nWith Sno-Caps, anyone in the world — you, your mom, an African farmer, Cher — could lease out their annual shares of carbon emissions directly to corporations in exchange for money. The transactions would all happen via “smart” contracts on the bitcoin network, where everyone would be able to see who’s entitled to what emissions.\n\nIf the government tried to run a free-market system like this, it would be a “trillion dollar bureaucratic nightmare,” D’Angelo wrote in this white paper about the idea. Plus, he wrote, with government-run cap-and-trade programs, all the action happens on a “trapeze” above voters’ heads. The people’s cap-and-trade, he argues, would engage citizens and incentivize the masses. It would also hold big emitters accountable for their actions, give regular people an easy way to make a profit, save the environment, prove that unicorns exist, and bring Robin Williams back to life.\n\nOK — you’ve already thought of a few dozen reasons why this couldn’t work, right? How would you get the poorest people in the developing world signed up? How would you make sure no one user can claim multiple shares through multiple accounts? How would you get corporations on board when there’s not much in it for them?\n\nD’Angelo addresses many of these potential hurdles in his white paper (spoiler alert: none of them have perfect solutions, yet). For example: To attract corporations, he suggests first appealing to eco-conscious companies that might want to make a statement — he’s looking at you, Whole Foods. Then, as the network grows and gains legitimacy, he expects other companies to join in.\n\nOf course, none of this will ever work if there’s no way to punish corporations and people for emitting more carbon than they’re allotted. This is where a governing body would come in handy, and D’Angelo acknowledges that if Sno-Caps proves workable, it might actually be good thing for governments to back it as official policy (it’s much easier for them to do that than try to build something from scratch, he said).\n\nOtherwise, D’Angelo said, Sno-Caps would rely on “regulation by reputation” — the same kind of system that keeps people well-behaved when they use services like Uber, Airbnb, and eBay.\n\nPeople would act as watchdogs, calling out companies for emitting more than they’ve leased. And they’d –in theory — be motivated to do this because they’ve got skin in the game. The effectiveness of this system would, of course, depend on a) people knowing how much companies are actually emitting and b) bad actors caring when people call them out. Such a regulatory system would be shoddy at first, D’Angelo explained, but would ideally scale with the network.\n\n“My guess is the feedback loop will go after really big companies first, and individuals will be forgiven,” he said, “but I could see it turning. Americans are going to have to pay up, right?”\n\nSno-Caps already has a fan base\n\nLast year, D’Angelo entered Sno-Caps into the U.S. Carbon Price competition run by the MIT Climate CoLab, an online crowdsourcing platform that invites anyone around the world to propose solutions to the many problems we now face thanks to climate change. It tied for the Judges’ Choice award.\n\nThe win was a nice credibility boost for D’Angelo, a non-academic who uses YouTube as his publishing platform. “It’s tough being an outsider. People are snobby, and I still feel it every day,” he said.\n\nTom Malone, director of the CoLab and a professor in MIT’s Sloan School of Management, said that getting “wild ideas from unexpected places” is part of what the CoLab is all about.\n\nHe said he was an especially big fan of Sno-Caps because it skirted government involvement.\n\n“That in part helps make this feasible in a way that the conventional solutions people are talking about [are not],” he said. “It certainly seems that getting agreement of large national governments to deal in significant ways with climate change is not an easy process.”\n\nMalone and others at the CoLab were so intrigued, in fact, that they’re considering hosting a special competition just for ideas that involve digital currencies in the hopes of attracting more non-government solutions. And in April, the MIT Media Lab announced a new digital currencies initiative led by Brian Forde, former White House senior advisor for mobile and data innovation.\n\nAs for D’Angelo, his plan is to raise some money, hire a small team of software engineers, and get this thing launched. Success is a long shot, and D’Angelo knows that, but if there’s a chance it could take off, he figures, why not give it a try?\n\n“Everyone pre-supposed that the solution to climate change is going to come from politics,” D’Angelo said. “I think that’s almost always the worst answer. … You can do really magical stuff with technology.”', 'In many ways, gold and Bitcoin are similar. They are both scarce; gold is scarce by nature and Bitcoin has scarcity coded into its protocol. Gold and Bitcoin are divisible; gold can be melted into small coins or even shaved into tiny flecks. Each bitcoin is divisible by eight decimal places. They are both fungible; each ounce of gold is interchangeable with the next, and all bitcoins are interchangeable with one another. Gold and Bitcoin are also very different in many respects. Gold is physical, Bitcoin is digital. Gold relies on banks for safekeeping and payments, Bitcoin is stored on a computer and tracks payments with a distributed, public ledger. Gold is vulnerable to robbers, while Bitcoin is vulnerable to hackers. The list goes on and on.\n\nAlso read: A Guide to Buying Gold with Bitcoin: Gold Bars, Nuggets, and Jewelry\n\nNewcomers often make these comparisons between gold and Bitcoin and ask the question: is Bitcoin better than gold? This question does not have an easy answer, and arguments revolving around it regularly crop up in the Bitcoin community. The pros and cons of gold and Bitcoin blur the line of superiority between the two, making the victor unclear. Therefore, in this series, we will present the main advantages and disadvantages that the two assets hold over one another, allowing the readers to answer this question themselves. This article will cover the advantages and disadvantages of gold and Bitcoin when it comes to transaction costs and centralization.\n\nTransaction Costs\n\nGold takes up physical space, requiring a significant amount of material resources to transport from location to another. Moving gold takes roads, vehicles, human labor, and safe locations for storing the gold. Furthermore, these transportation components require large amount of resources as well. Roads require massive amounts of capital and labor, as do vehicles and storage facilities, and human labor is relatively scarce, which tends to make it expensive. Even a collector storing a small supply of gold in his or her home must expend a significant amount of resources. The collector needs a safe or some kind of storage device to securely hold the gold, as well as physical space for the storage device. The collector also has transportation costs; he or she either has to drive to a gold broker to buy the precious metal, or pay to have it shipped to his or her house. Using gold as a currency demands space on one’s person, as he or she has to carry coins in their pockets or bags. This particular space requirement has historically led to the use of gold-backed paper notes as substitutes for hard cash, which creates a need for trust that we will examine in part 2.\n\nBitcoin is the clear winner when it comes to transaction costs. This currency exists in the digital world, its most intense space demands come in the form of memory. The minimum amount of physical space required for storing Bitcoin, then, depends on how the user wants to handle his or her money. Bitcoin can be stored on something fairly sizeable, such as a computer. On the other hand, a Bitcoin wallet can be stored in something as unintrusive as a cell phone, flash drive, or even the owner’s brain. Daily payments can be made easily with a mobile wallet, eliminating the desire for paper substitutes.\n\nCentralization\n\nCentralization affects both gold and Bitcoin, albeit in different forms. For gold currencies, centralization can develop in mining and banking. Bitcoin centralization occurs through mining and nodes. The more centralized both gold and Bitcoin become, the more reliant they are on trust to run smoothly. Trust will be examined in depth during part 2 of this article.\n\nGold mining becomes centralized where economies of scale exist. The more costly mining becomes, the larger firms must be in order to remain efficient. This growth means that the optimal size for a gold mining firm might require that the firm hold a large market share — possibly even a majority. The effects of gold mining centralization are straightforward. As gold mining becomes more centralized, control over the supply of gold becomes more consolidated.\n\nGold can also be centralized at the banking level. This centralization occurs by banks gaining market share through competition, or when governments centralize the banking system through legal means. A cartelized (or monopolized) banking system gives a small group (or one firm) control over the storage of an economy’s gold. As far as paper substitutes are used, a centralized banking system can control the supply of an economy’s bank notes. Centralized banking may be considered more dangerous than consolidated gold mining, because a bank can use its power to run fractional reserves and issue paper notes in excess of its gold reserves. Some people believe fractional reserve banking is the root of the business cycle, and discourage its practice.\n\nBitcoin mining centralization occurs through the same process as gold mining centralization. Bitcoin miners with economies of scale are more efficient than smaller miners, thereby creating a tendency for mining firms to grow larger as costs increase. Just like with gold mining, the optimal size for a Bitcoin mining firm may mean that it controls a majority of the mining market — or, in Bitcoin’s case, a majority of the network’s hashing power. A mining firm with a majority market share is more dangerous than a large gold miner, because Bitcoin miners play a powerful role in the overall network. If a miner gains 51% or more of the network’s total hashing power, it is in a position to double spend. Such an event would harm the integrity of the Bitcoin network and would drive many people away from the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin nodes can become centralized as well, which makes the network more vulnerable to an attack. Nodes are essential to the network because they store the blockchain and broadcast transactions across the entire network. Without nodes, Bitcoin would not be able to exist. Two major factors play into node centralization: a growing need for memory and a lack of economic incentive to run nodes. As Bitcoin becomes more widely-accepted, blocks become larger and in turn the blockchain takes up more memory. Since nodes store the entire blockchain, the computers running the nodes must have enough memory and be able to increase their memory capacities over time. However, since nodes currently receive no income, the cost of upgrading memory falls entirely on the operator. The absence of node income eliminates any economic incentive for running a node, making it an action of pure altruism. As a result, fewer people are willing to run nodes as the blockchain gets larger, thereby centralizing the node network. The fewer nodes that exist, the easier it is for an attacker to take down the network, since there are fewer places that need to be forced offline.\n\nThus, the issue of centralization is not as clear-cut as transaction costs; it is possible that neither gold nor Bitcoin is a winner in this category. Both assets are susceptible to centralization, which can have negative impacts in both cases.\n\nWhich is better, Bitcoin or gold? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nImages: All4BTC, CBS Armored Trucks, Russia-Insider, CoinText\n\nThis author’s views do not necessarily reflect those of Bitcoinist.net.\n\nOriginally posted on: Is Bitcoin Better than Gold? Part One: Transaction Costs and Centralization', 'Startup accelerator Boost.vc is diversifying its next cohort of startups, shifting its line-up of accepted startups from focusing solely on Bitcoin to include those working on virtual and augmented reality.\n\nIn a chat with TechCrunch last week, Boost.vc co-founder Adam Draper explained the accelerator’s reasoning. “We’re good at building communities around early tech sectors. We bring together investors, entrepreneurs, and builders, and by focusing investments on a category over time, we ourselves become experts in the subject, and thus more valuable to startups that might want to join.”\n\nAfter two and half years investing in Bitcoin-related startups, Draper says the team decided they didn’t need to only apply those strengths to a single ecosystem. So with their next cohort, or “tribe,” of startups, the accelerator plans to accept a roughly equal number of virtual reality startup as those working to solve problems with Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition to mentorship from investors and entrepreneurs with experience in the virtual reality scene, startups that join up in the next group get free housing (for teams of 1-4 people) and $15-25,000 in capital in exchange for ~6% of their company. It’s like the living arrangement on HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” except without an investor hanging around with a bong all day.\n\nAs for the kinds of virtual reality startups the accelerator will be investing in, Draper says Boost will not be backing teams working on hardware. Instead, they’re looking for companies building a software infrastructure around the creation and consumption of experiences in virtual reality.\n\nDraper thinks that outside of gaming, the earliest successful VR products will show up on Google’s Cardboard and Samsung’s Gear VR. And with applications like Google’s Expeditions popping up, Draper says he’s “very excited about VR and education technology.”', 'The government of Ecuador is pushing forward to establish its national electronic currency, PanAm Post reports. The central bank has given 360 days to all financial institutions in Ecuador to get on board. Top financial institutions with assets of more than $1 billion USD will have only 120 days to comply.Ecuador’s official Resolution 064-2015-M, announced on May 25, states that all entities of the public, private, and cooperative financial sectors must join the government-run Electronic Currency System as “Macro Agents.”\n\nFinancial institutions will have to provide an electronic tender option for all the services they currently offer and those they will subsequently offer. The text of the resolution (in Spanish) is available online on the government’s website.The new resolution comes less than one year after the government asked Congress to approve the creation of the new currency, with the condition that its adoption should be voluntary, El Diario Financiero reports. Though President Rafael Correa criticized the use of the U.S. dollar in the country, because it limits the ability of the government to incentivize falling exportations, he said his administration is not planning to stop using the U.S. dollar.\n\n""The new institutional vision of the central bank considers financial inclusion and the modernization of payment systems as strategic objectives."" states the resolution, which was approved on April 16 but officially published last week. The new electronic currency ""seeks efficiency in payment systems to promote and contribute to the economic stability of the country.”\n\nFalling oil prices – oil exportations account for 25 percent is the country’s income – and the rising exchange value of the U.S. dollar due to the recovering U.S. economy have caused a liquidity crisis in Ecuador.\n\nThe new electronic currency isn’t related to bitcoin. The U.S. dollar has been the only official legal tender in Ecuador for the past 15 years. Alternative currencies such as bitcoin are banned. The citizens of Ecuador who want to invest in bitcoin or other digital currencies can do so only outside of Ecuadorian territory. Not surprisingly, the strong opposition of the government of Ecuador is motivated by the fact that bitcoin has no regulating or supervisory body.Bitcoin users in Ecuador criticize the government’s Electronic Currency System because it eliminates privacy from all financial transactions.\n\n“With the electronic currency all transactions are linked to your identity, something which doesn’t happen with physical money, so it seems like a de facto acquired right is being progressively lost,” bitcoin advocate Luis Nuñez told the PanAm Post. “Bitcoin has a decentralized model that has clear rules: It’s transparent and public, it promotes freedom, and it’s adopted freely; the other is a centralized model that seeks to control information, and in which the rules conform to the political vision of the day.”\n\nOther governments are warming up to the idea of digital currencies controlled by the state – of course, with the privacy aspect taken out. There are rumors of “Fedcoin” in the United States and some kind of “Eurocoin” in Europe. Greece’s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis wrote a blog post in February proposing a cryptocurrency dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin).\n\nPhoto FamZoo Staff / CC BY-SA 2.0']"

New York is the first state to do so, seeking to create a replacement for money transmission guidelines that, Mr. Lawsky said, date to the Civil War.\n\nBitcoin and other virtual currencies have grown in popularity both in the global technology community and on Wall Street.

Critics on the Internet site Reddit satirized the regulator by depicting him atop the Iron Throne from the HBO series “Game of Thrones” with the caption “Hail King Lawsky.”\n\nIn his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Lawsky said that the main goal had been to provide useful guidelines for virtual currency businesses rather than stifle the emerging technology altogether. The BitLicense, he said, applies only to financial operations and not to software developers, individual users or retailers who accept Bitcoin payments.\n\n“Financial regulators and policy makers need to recognize that when it comes to digital currencies and other new payments technology, the genie is already out of the bottle,” he said.\n\nMr. Lawsky added that regulators and proponents of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies needed to work together to make sure that new technologies continue to flourish while protecting consumers.\n\nStill, some within the virtual currency industry took a dim view of the new rules. Coin Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, took issue with anti-money-laundering provisions of the final guidelines, which it contended were too vague.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“It’s a mixed bag, is the best that can be said about the BitLicense,” Jerry Brito, Coin Center’s executive director, said in a statement. “Other states are already looking to the BitLicense as a model for their own frameworks. We are working with them to ensure they do not repeat the mistakes made here.”"", ""The question of whether or not bitcoin the currency can be separated from the blockchain is not a new one; it has pretty much been around since the inception of the digital currency. It has gained increasing relevance over the last few months, as major financial institutions have begun to recognize the potential of a distributed ledger system, which is what the blockchain is.\n\nHuge amounts of money are being thrown at the technology and at companies set up to exploit it, yet many of those financing the projects are, at best, skeptical when it comes to the currency. One of two things therefore has to happen; either these firms must find a way to separate the technology from the currency or they must embrace bitcoin itself. In the light of that, whether the former can be done or not becomes of enormous import.\n\nLike most things related to Bitcoin, this question engenders passion from two opposing sides. The fervent supporters of the currency scoff and say that of course the blockchain can’t be separated from Bitcoin, while detractors are just as certain that it can be, and probably should be. As is often the case when disagreement is so stark, there is an element of truth to both positions.\n\nThe reality, it seems to me, is that while blockchain technology can be replicated without bitcoin specifically, there has to be some kind of token associated with the ledger in order for the system to work. If that is the case, then why separate out bitcoin, where the hard work of gaining recognition and establishing value has already been done? The whole point of a distributed ledger is that there are multiple (hopefully thousands of) computer systems verifying and recording each transaction. In the case of Bitcoin these are the miners, who are rewarded for maintaining the records by being given blocks of Bitcoin when they solve certain mathematical problems.\n\nBack when bitcoin was worthless there were very few miners, and consequently the computing power that would have been needed to compromise the system and effectively steal or fake bitcoin was negligible. At that time, though, there would have been no point in attempting such a thing. Why steal or counterfeit something that is essentially worthless? As the value of bitcoin rose, though, the value of the blocks rewarded to miners increased along with it, leading to more miners and more computer power being deployed.\n\nThe beauty of the blockchain protocol is that it ensures that once a certain level of acceptance, and therefore value, has been achieved, altering the record for nefarious purposes would always demand more computer power (and therefore expense) than the rewards warranted. If blockchain technology were to be divorced from bitcoin or any other token, however, the new blockchain would be extremely vulnerable unless significant amounts of money were paid to those charged with the record keeping. Once again, the question then becomes “Why bother?” You may as well just enter transactions in a database kept in more than one place...in other words you are back to what we have now.\n\nIn fact, replicating the blockchain without bitcoin as the token of choice has been done many times already. Dogecoin, Litecoin or whatever other altcoin you care to name are all examples of just that. All of them are essentially based on Blockchain technology, but they all use a newly devised and essentially limited token. If you were to use something like the blockchain to challenge the existing global payments system, but use existing fiat currencies as the tokens, then you would face a problem.\n\nThose currencies are based on an inflationary model, meaning that the supply of them can be increased infinitely, thus infinitely reducing their value over time. What incentive is there for a miner or similar to commit to a long term project with future reward when the ultimate value of that reward is guaranteed to be less after the time has elapsed? There really isn’t one.\n\nBoth sides in this debate look to have some logical and factual basis for their position. The blockchain obviously “can” be separated from Bitcoin; it has already been done. What the opponents of Bitcoin miss though is that doing so, while possible, would be far from practical. If you simply ask people to keep a ledger you are back to trusting them or some third party that checks on them, or you face an enormous expense to reach the number of record keepers where that isn’t needed. Either way you have negated the advantages that caused you to attempt the thing in the first place.\n\nProbably like most people, when I first heard that Wall Street was investing in the technology, I assumed that they would find some way of using it that would not involve using bitcoin or some other altcoin. The deeper I have gone into the question of whether that is possible, though, the more convinced I have become that it isn't. The only practical solution would be to keep Bitcoin or something similar as the payment for maintaining a distributed ledger, and in the long run that bodes well for the value of the existing currency."", 'Actor, comedian and activist Russell Brand has come out in support of Ross Ulbricht after he was sentenced to life in prison for starting the Silk Road.

Based on BitGo’s revolutionary multi-signature technology, the Bitfinex exchange now provides individual multi-signature wallets for each customer, allowing traders to verify funds on the blockchain for complete transparency while retaining institutional-level security.\n\n“The era of commingling customer Bitcoin and all of the associated security exposures is over,” said Zane Tackett, Director of Community & Product Development at Bitfinex. “The trading community has long sought individually verifiable accounts without sacrificing security or performance. With the help of BitGo’s multi-signature technology, the Bitfinex team is very excited to be the first exchange in the world to automate Bitcoin settlements using ‘On-Blockchain’ customer segregated wallets.”\n\nSimilar to gold exchanges offering proof of physical gold, the Bitfinex exchange allows for near-real-time verification of customer Bitcoin balances as confirmed by the Blockchain. All funds and private transactions are secured with multi-institutional, multi-signature, two-step authentication and advanced policies that support individual and institutional trading activities.\n\n“We’ve been working with Bitfinex for several months and are impressed by their dedication to security for their users,” said BitGo CEO Mike Belshe. “The industry has been clamoring for exchanges to adopt the multi-sig model, and we’re proud that Bitfinex selected BitGo’s platform to do it. This new level of transparency and security makes breaches such as those of Mt. Gox impossible.”\n\nLike other current bitcoin exchanges, Bitfinex previously implemented security via a shared pool, similar to using one set of keys to access an entire bank vault. Today, Bitfinex uses a unique set of keys for each user, and separates each user’s funds on the public blockchain. This powerful combination of BitGo’s multi-sig technology with Bitfinex’s exchange mitigates most of the shared pool security risks while simultaneously enabling users to verify their individual holdings on the blockchain.\n\nABOUT BITFINEX // Bitfinex is the world’s leading Bitcoin exchange, and provides the most advanced trading platform in the digital currency space. A leading source of price discovery, Bitfinex also underpins a large part of the bitcoin economy by enabling merchants, payment processors, individuals and traders access to the deepest pool of liquidity. Founded in 2012, Bitfinex is an established thought leader in the digital currency exchange space, and one of the most secure platforms to have been released.

Today, there are many businesses that are in perpetual pre-launch, like the vaunted Open Bazaar, who seems to have been on the brink of release ever since Bitcoin was just a whitepaper. The cloud storage industry within the Bitcoin community is still an open door to entrepreneurs, and Sia has stepped forward to fill this market niche.\n\nIn the mainstream, you have companies like Amazon and Dropbox already providing cloud storage, but neither is ready to use the revolutionary block chain technology Sia is employing. They do not use Bitcoin’s block chain but their own proof-of-word block chain, so I spoke to Sia’s David Vorick about what innovations and value they bring to the market through block chain technology.\n\nWhy are Bitcoin block chain technology and cloud storage a good match for the market going forward?\n\nOne of the major advantages using a block chain for storage is that you can make contracts with people you don’t trust. In traditional cloud storage, when you provide files to a data center you need to trust that they will still be around tomorrow, adding a lot of overhead. I trust Amazon and Dropbox to keep my files safe, but the result is that they get a monopoly over my data and can charge very steep prices.”“In using a block chain, I can split my data over many untrusted and unknown services, and be confident that they will be penalized for misplacing my file. Even if a majority of them *do* misplace my file, I can still recover all of my data. A single service no longer has a monopoly, and, very similar to bitcoin mining, the cost of cloud storage is brought very close to the raw cost of hosting data.\n\nAlso read: Decentralized Storage Application Storj Gets a New Look and Opens Closed Beta Access to You\n\nAren’t there security issues with putting information into “The Cloud”? Why should I trust a “cloud” with my information? What guarantees can you provide consumers with regards to their information?\n\nSecurity is not just a foremost concern of Sia; it is a mandatory foundation. All data is encrypted by the clients before being uploaded, and cannot be seen by the hosts. As for getting the data back, we use erasure coding algorithms to make sure that even if many of the hosts disappear, the data is still recoverable.\n\nAlgorithms such as Reed-Solomon encoding means that data can be split up into 30 pieces. It can be given to 30 different hosts, and of those 30 hosts, only 10 need to remain online for the data to be recovered in full. The overhead is only 3x, which is the same overhead that is used by traditional cloud storage. Statistically, however, 10-out-of-30 is much, much safer than 1-out-of-3, and you have significant warning time hosts start disappearing (you can repair the file back to its original redundancy at any time).\n\nHow does bitcoin’s price volatility affect your pricing and business? If BTC prices drop $100, how will that affect you long-term and your customers “in the cloud?\n\nJust like with bitcoin mining, price volatility has an impact on our hosts. Because contracts must be made using crypto-currency, the value of the contract is subject to price swings. This will not be a risk for consumers, who commit to the value of the contract within minutes and do not need to hold on to crypto-currency throughout the duration of the contract.\n\nSia does have an advantage in stability, however: hosts must keep crypto-currency locked up throughout the duration of their contracts. This can provide a dampening effect because hosts cannot respond immediately to news, and people will need to buy crypto-currency to use storage on the network. It is not yet clear how strong the dampening effect will be – though I guess that it will be moderate at best.\n\nI predict that Siacoin will be more stable than most crypto-currencies, though not so significantly that it could be considered ‘stable’ compared to things like bonds or the dollar.\n\nWhat is the history of bitcoin and cloud storage?\n\nWe have two popular competitors: Storj and MaidSAFE. Though these two products have held the public spotlight for the majority of our existence, they have yet to release a product. We will be releasing on June 7th, and to the extent of my knowledge that makes us the first decentralized storage platform to launch. There is a third popular alternative, IPFS, which has somewhat similar goals but is not decentralized in the same way.\n\nFor more information, including their whitepaper, contact them on their website @ siacoin.com\n\n\n\nDo you trust cloud storage?

Just last month, UK-based digital assets service provider Elliptic partnered with Gem to offer a custodian service for the private keys of multisig wallets.\n\nThe californian bitcoin API developer, which has raised $3.3m to date, launched its multisig wallet API back in April.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.', 'The FinCEN action against XRP II LLC (Ripple) took many by surprise early last month, although many in the Bitcoin community were not shocked to see an organization with such close ties to a digital token face backlash for “willful violations” of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and failure to implement appropriate anti-money laundering (AML) procedures.\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce has been quick to gain an in-depth understanding of the action taken against Ripple Labs, and the Washington, D.C.-based trade association plans to discuss the implications of the regulatory action in a public briefing June 4th at 1 p.m. EDT.\n\nBefore their briefing, the Chamber of Digital Commerce was willing to answer a few questions related to the Ripple case via email. Chamber of Digital Commerce President Perianne Boring provided input on the Ripple case with added assistance from Carol Van Cleef of the trade association’s advisory board.\n\nChanges to the Ripple Protocol?\n\nIn the minds of many digital currency advocates, the most troubling aspect of the Ripple action was the agreement to make regulatory compliant changes to the Ripple protocol. Of course, as Boring pointed out, Ripple Labs seemed to disagree with this assessment of the deal with FinCEN via a piece in the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ article contained statements from Ripple Labs Bank Secrecy Act Officer Antoinette O’Gorman:“All that Ripple had agreed to, she said, was to build enhanced ‘analytical transaction monitoring tools for monitoring transactions across the protocol’ and to furnish information drawn from that monitoring to U.S. authorities upon request. The changes had ‘nothing to do with the protocol itself,’ she said.""\n\nBoring added that this would be a key point of discussion during the Thursday briefing. When speaking specifically about what changes Ripple Labs would have to make due to their agreement with FinCEN, Boring stated:“This is consistent with FinCEN’s minimum standards for money service businesses, which states that ‘money services businesses that have automated data processing systems should integrate into their systems compliance procedures such as recordkeeping and monitoring transactions subject to reporting requirements.’ Given these expectations, as a practical matter, the analytical tools must either be incorporated into the protocol or be built on top of the protocol to enable the company to monitor transactions.”\n\nMore Action to Come from FinCEN\n\nDue to the swift action from FinCEN and their partner agencies on the Ripple situation, it should come as no surprise to find that the Digital Chamber of Commerce also finds more action from FinCEN against various businesses involved with token issuances and crowd sales to be “inevitable.” Boring pointed to a May 6th keynote speech by FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Cavalry at the West Coast AML Forum in which the director indicated that a series of supervisory examinations of virtual currency businesses has recently been launched by the IRS.\n\nBoring added:“Please note that it is the IRS that conducts such examinations for FinCEN. Any deficiencies detected in these examinations are then reported to FinCEN. FinCEN then may decide to take enforcement action. With the laser focus right now on these businesses, we expect more actions are inevitable.”\n\nThe president of the Digital Chamber of Commerce also noted, “IRS examinations are not the only way that virtual currency businesses may find themselves vulnerable to enforcement actions by FinCEN.” She pointed to ongoing criminal investigations and even press coverage as two other activities that could trigger an investigation by another regulatory body such as the SEC.\n\nPublic Briefing on the Ripple Action\n\nIn an effort to bring more clarity to the current regulatory environment in terms of token issuances, crowd sales, and other activities surrounding digital currencies, the Chamber of Digital Commerce is holding an industry briefing on Thursday, June 4 at 1 p.m. EDT (10 a.m. PDT). The key points of the briefing will be to:\n\nDiscuss the implications of the first civil money penalty action against a digital currency company;\n\nGain a more in-depth understanding of what it means for companies in the ecosystem;\n\nEvaluate what steps need to be taken immediately to minimize or eliminate potential violations;\n\nAssess how to prepare for upcoming Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) examinations by the IRS.\n\nThe briefing will be held via telephone, and participants can register before the start of the event to receive the dial-in information.\n\nAs part of her final comments, Boring added a few notes about the importance of regulatory clarity in the digital currency ecosystem:“Investors don’t fear regulation; they fear uncertainly. Gaining regulatory clarity is an important part of the development and growth of this industry.”\n\nIn order to help with the ever-changing regulatory landscape in the digital currency industry, the Chamber of Digital Commerce has put together the first AML compliance course specifically designed for businesses involved with bitcoin and other digital assets. Boring noted, “The Chamber will continue to take a leadership role by advancing the public-private sector dialogue, offering educational webinars and training sessions, and serving as a clearinghouse for information sharing within the industry.”', 'LAS VEGAS, June 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Financial technology company Anthem Vault today launched HayekGold (the \'hayek\'), a digital token that enables more people to own and spend gold.

Many in the bitcoin community have little idea of what he was convicted of, or the sentences for these offenses. With the trial now concluded, the sentencing details for this landmark case have been revealed. This article will provide the concise reference guide, with the official court documents, and a summary of where Ross Ulbricht goes from here. To see the entire official court file, click here.\n\nThe case number is 1:14-cr-00068-KBF and was adjudicated in the Southern District of New York, which is code for Manhattan, New York City. The five crimes Ross Ulbricht was convicted of, for all of which he pled “not guilty,” include:\n\nAiding and Abetting Distribution of Drugs\n\nContinuing Criminal Enterprise\n\nComputer hacking Conspiracy\n\nFraud with Identification Documents\n\nMoney Laundering Conspiracy\n\nThe prison sentence will be administered as follows:\n\nThe defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons for a total term of: Counts Two (2) and Four (4) (“Aiding and Abetting Distribution of Drugs” and “Continuing Criminal Enterprise”): Life to run concurrently (meaning at the same time, not one life sentence after another); Count (5) (“Computer hacking Conspiracy”): Five (5) years to run concurrently; Count Six (6) (“Fraud With Identification Documents”): Fifteen (15) years to run concurrently; Count Seven (7) (“Money Laundering Conspiracy): Twenty (20) Years to run concurrently.\n\nHowever, the defendant may have some small influence over where their sentence is carried out, as far as what prison facility. On page 4, it is “respectfully recommended” that Ulbricht’s sentence be carried out at FCI Petersburg I in Virginia if he is not deemed to be a “public safety factor” risk.\n\nIt appears FCI Petersburg I is a lower security prison. If he is deemed a “public safety factor” risk, it is again “respectfully recommended” that Ulbricht serves his sentence in USP Tuscon in Arizona or USP Coleman II “as a second choice,” in Florida. This again indicates that Ulbricht has some influence over the location.\n\nTerms for a “supervised release” are covered, but considered the fact that he received two life sentences, outlining those terms here seems pointless.\n\nThe financial penalty to Ulbricht is spelled out beginning on page 7. A US$500 assessment, not fine or restitution is owed, but no payee is listed. This “lump sum” is due “immediately” and is payable to the clerk of the court.\n\nApparently, the U.S. Government believes he has quite a large sum of money hidden away. On page 8, the entire page simply states “Forfeiture in the amount of US$183,961,921.00 is Ordered. Not a fine or assessment, but “forfeiture.”\n\nIt appears all the bluster about “Dread Pirate Roberts” and his intent to kill others did not wash, legally, in this trial, again making this sentence seem ridiculous in its severity. The only crime that was claimed to have been committed in this trial that may even come close to justifying any life sentence might be “Money Laundering Conspiracy,” and that was only a twenty year term.\n\nDraw your own conclusions, but I’d advise anyone who wants more details on how this case was handled to seek out Alex Winter’s “Deep Web” movie, narrated by Keanu Reeves, for more information. Coincidentally, it was released on May 31, just two days after Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison. Winter was present during the trial and gives a first-hand account of what actually happened here.', 'Exascale Power Co., a Portland, Ore.-based company, plans to build a supercomputer in New Mexico that will boost the power of the block chain processing infrastructure. The “One ExaFlop” system will bring parity with the computational power of machine systems and the human brain, allowing for the dawn of a new era of true artificial intelligence, the company claims.\n\nPhase two will be a “One Zettaflop” supercomputer, which is one thousand times larger than the Exaflop system.\n\n“Our mission is to build large data centers with wholesale power contracts for economies of scale, allowing us to provide competitively-priced commodity cloud computing services to improve the human condition,” John Fitzpatrick, CEO of Exascale Power Co, told CCN.\n\nCompetitive pricing for cloud computing\n\nThe primary purpose of each system is to offer competitively-priced commodity cloud computing services to industry. Economies of scale will allow Exascale to price lower than Amazon, Google, Microsoft and all others per CPU hour, Fitzpatrick said.\n\nThe secondary purpose of each system is to accelerate computational research in medicine to cure diseases, and energy research to develop clean, cheap fusion power to improve the human condition.\n\nThe tertiary purpose of each system is to scale Bitcoin block chain processing for wider adoption in the global financial system, Fitzpatrick said.\n\n“We will have ready access to nearly the entire electrical grid in the United States, and we will get the very best price at any moment in time as a volume buyer of power,” said Fitzpatrick noting that New Mexico is at the intersection of the three major power grids in the U.S.\n\nThe Exascale power system architecture includes Mellanox Infiniband fiber, Nvidia chipsets, IBM open source power PC chips and custom ASICS chips for block chain processing.\n\nASICS processors support Bitcoin at present\n\nWith ASICS processors, the bitcoin community has already reached an aggregate global capacity of One Exaflop in block chain processing power, he said.\n\n“The barrier to reaching One Exaflop on Linpack with the technology of today is a 1,000-MW power supply,” Fitzpatrick said, “and with the New Mexico location, we will have the ability to scale to Zettaflop capacity in phase two.”\n\nScaling of infrastructure is critical to realizing the promise of block chain processing for the global financial system, he noted.\n\n“The enabling part of building out this bitcoin infrastructure is the mining fees,” Fitzpatrick said, “Any bitcoin miner has the seignorage power of a sovereign nation to create money.”\n\nAlso read: Australian alternative currency/banking firm DeMorgan Ltd. to offer free webinar on supercomputers beginning June 17\n\nCompany files debt offering\n\nNot only does an exascale system require enormous electrical power, but also enormous financial resources for the projected cost of $50 billion, Fitzpatrick said. The company has filed a debt offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Our rights offering is for debt, convertible to equity at buyer discretion,” Fitzpatrick said. “Our lenders own us.”\n\nThe company has a core group of 50 engineers, with staffing of 2,500 required at full system build-out,” Fitzpatrick said, noting the company is currently hiring.\n\nThe project marks Exascale’s first foray into bitcoin and block chain processing.\n\nThe company brings a 15-year history in financial services and supercomputing.\n\nAccording to the MIT Technology Review, Fitzpatrick in 2002 was president of JJX Capital, a startup hedge fund company. According to the article, JJX Capital was developing a computer to predict the future price movements of every stock, bond, and commodity traded in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the U.S. probably won’t build its first practical exascale supercomputer until 2023. To hit that target, engineers will need to do three things. First they’ll need new computer architectures capable of combining tens of thousands of CPUs and graphics-processor-based accelerators. Engineers will also need to deal with the growing energy costs required to move data from a supercomputer’s memory to the processors. Finally, software developers will have to learn how to build programs that can make use of the new architecture.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
06/04/2015,"['New York has become the first state in the US to lay down regulations and rules for the trade of virtual currency including Bitcoin.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) released the new rules on Wednesday. Outlined by Benjamin M. Lawsky, Superintendent of Financial Services, the new regulations will affect traders which accept, sell or buy virtual currency.\n\nThe rules have been formed after a two-year long investigation into cryptocurrency. The ""BitLicense"" regulations (.PDF) contain consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity rules tailored for companies using virtual currency, including Bitcoin.\n\nAt the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington, DC on Wednesday, Lawsky said digital currency highlights the dynamic nature of financial markets and technology, and the pace of change is only doing to accelerate in the years to come. As a result, ""regulators need to be ready to meet that challenge.""\n\n""We have a responsibility to regulate new financial products in order to help protect consumers and root out illicit activity. That is the bread and butter job of a financial regulator,"" Lawsky said.\n\n""However, by the same token, we should not react so harshly that we doom promising new technologies before they get out of the cradle.""\n\nLawsky noted that attempts to ban Bitcoin would likely fail, as banning computer code is nigh-on impossible. Instead, the financial regulator said the key is balancing the protection of consumers, the reduction of fraud and still permitting innovation breathing space.\n\nIf companies use virtual currency and are holding on to customer funds, they need to apply for a license. However, app developers who are developing software do not need to -- as the department will not need to act as a financial intermediary. Lawsky commented:\n\n""There is a basic bargain that when a financial company is entrusted with safeguarding customer funds and receives a license from the state to do so -- it accepts the need for heightened regulatory scrutiny to help ensure that a consumer\'s money does not just disappear into a black hole.""\n\nIn addition, companies will need the approval of the financial regulator if they make substantial changes to their business models or products, as well as the inclusion of new controlling investors. However, they will not need permission before seeking funding through investment rounds or small software updates.\n\n""We have no interest in micro-managing minor app updates. We\'re not Apple,"" Lawsky told attendees.\n\nThe regulations have been drawn up in response to virtual currency being used for illegal activity -- such as for the trade and purchase of drugs and weapons on the now-defunct underground marketplace Silk Road, as well as cyberattacks which have taken place on cryptocurrency exchanges and resulting in the loss of customer funds.\n\nMt. Gox, once the dominant Bitcoin exchange on the web, closed its doors last year due to an alleged cyberattack. This rapid closure ended up costing consumers who traded in Bitcoin roughly $500 million.', ""California's State Assembly has approved a bill calling for digital currency companies to be regulated in a similar way to banks.\n\nFormulated by Assemblyman Matt Dababneh, chairman of California's Banking and Finance Committee, bill AB-1326 was approved following a 55-22 vote in favour.\n\nCurrently undergoing review by California's Senate – having already completed the first of three readings – if passed, the bill would require digital currency businesses to obtain an annually renewable license from the Department of Business Oversight (DBO), unless they are exempt from doing so by the agency.\n\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, license applicants would incur a $5,000 non-refundable registration fee; would be required to complete an application which includes identifying any previous virtual currency services provided by the applicant.\n\nAccording to California's legislative process, if the bill is approved by the Senate, it will proceed to the state's Governor who can either sign it into law, allow it to become law without a signature or veto it.\n\nA vetoed bill can be overridden by a two thirds vote in both houses. If it does become law, most bills typically come into effect on the first day of January of the following year.\n\nRegulatory pressure\n\nThe news comes amid increasing regulatory pressure from state legislators.\n\nJust last month, North Carolina's House of Representatives approved a bill calling for specific digital currency regulation. Similarly to California's bill, House Bill 289 is currently undergoing review in North Carolina's Senate.\n\nSubmitted by Republican Representative Stephen M.

People can hide their identities behind a wallet address, and generate additional addresses if needed. But is Bitcoin as anonymous and privacy-centric as uneducated people assume? The answers might surprise you.\n\nAlso Read: All About: The Blockchain Part Six\n\nAnonymity vs. Pseudonymity\n\nRight now, there is a decent level of customer privacy in business. But it only exists on a conditional basis. In the current financial infrastructure, any bank can and will disclose any personal information if the government requests it. While this may not be of great concern for most people right now, it is a violation of privacy.\n\nMany people look at digital currency as a way to secure unconditional privacy. Yet, Bitcoin itself is not anonymous, but rather pseudonymous. However, as interesting as that may sound, Bitcoin’s pseudonymity is fragile in daily life. Linking transactions reduces the level of privacy, and general usage leaves traces all across the internet. There are privacy-enhancing tools, such as CoinJoin, but they are costly.\n\nMore importantly, studying the blockchain can lead to unveiling someone’s identity. There are several practical ways to analyze the blockchain: change-addresses and the correlation of transactions are the most obvious choices. But what about the public addresses of services (exchanges and mining pools), or even the scraping of web resources, such as keeping Bitcoin address in forum signature?\n\nAs of late, there seems to be a lot of research going on concerning blockchain analysis. But several companies are exploring a business model to increase the number of high-level analysis tools dedicated to revealing information stored on the blockchain. Therefore, the level of privacy in Bitcoin will only decrease as blockchain records become more exploitable over time.\n\nBitcoin’s Fungibility, Or Lack Thereof /b>\n\nFungibility makes units interchangeable, and it is one of five fundamental properties of currencies (durability, portability, divisibility, scarcity and fungibility.) Fungibility is embraced by governments in traditional, centralized currencies. But how does fungibility hold up when talking about decentralized, digital currencies?\n\nThere are several types of fungibility when it comes to currencies. one type is voluntary fungibility, in which people can choose not to accept a unit of currency as equal to another unit. This type of fungibility can arise if currency taints are shared publicly. Taints mean that the currency in question — whether it is a coin, bill or a virtual currency — can be linked to illegal or dubious activity in some way.\n\nThere is a high level of social pressure to not accept tainted coins in order to avoid fraud and theft. Even though the avoidance of tainted currency mostly occurs with fiat currency, Bitcoin lacks privacy, which potentially threatens its fungibility. While Bitcoin comes close to being a digital form of cash, it lacks the absolute fungibility that would allow it to properly claim that moniker.\n\nVoluntary fungibility for digital currencies does not work, so we need to add privacy to make Bitcoin function as a proper currency. Right now, there is a lot of attention aimed at Bitcoin’s lack of fungibility, which has in turn generated many proposed solutions to the issue. Most of these efforts can be found in the form of various altcoins, each with their implementation that may or may not be as private as they claim.\n\nLeave us your thoughts on Bitcoin’s fungibility, privacy, and anonymity in the comments below!\n\nSource: Bitcoin Brussels Meetup Presentation by Jérémie Dubois-Lacoste\n\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nThis author’s views do not necessarily reflect those of Bitcoinist.net.\n\nOriginally posted on: Bitcoin is Not Anonymous and Lacks Privacy', 'Financial technology company Anthem Vault today launched HayekGold (the \'hayek\'), a digital token that enables more people to own and spend gold.

Anthem Vault decided to change the name to HayekGold to help clarify exactly what the crypto-asset is and how it works.\n\n“When most people talk about cryptocoins, they are referring to a digital currency that can be mined (created) with a computer,” notes the HayekGold website. “HayekGold, however, does not involve any digital mining. Sure, the physical gold has to be mined in the traditional sense (by digging into the earth!), but the digital tokens can never be created out of thin air. They can only come into existence when real gold is deposited into Anthem Vault.”\n\nPresumably, the company also wanted to avoid associations with “altcoins” of dubious reputation and trustworthiness. In fact, HayekGold runs on the Counterparty infrastructure, which is a layer on top of the Bitcoin network. That means that HayekGold is not an altcoin but a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and every transaction is recorded on and secured by the real Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAnthemVault\n\nhttps://www.weusecoins.com/anthemvault-review/\n\nprovides individuals with an efficient and liquid way to buy, own and sell physical, 100 percent fine gold and silver bullion.

Margin is an exciting instrument that allows clients to amplify their trading profits and gain in both up and down markets.\n\nKraken is now one of the few exchanges allowing clients to trade bitcoins on margin. Within the next few weeks, Kraken will be offering up to 20x leverage.\n\nMargin trading is available to clients who have verified their accounts to Tier 3 or Tier 4.\n\nClick here to learn more about how to become verified to Tier 3 or Tier 4. Currently margin trading is only available for the bitcoin-euro currency pair (XBT/EUR). However, clients can margin trade the XBT/EUR pair using their USD balance.\n\nAt launch, Kraken is initially offering up to 3x leverage, meaning that a margined position can gain 3x more than the underlying move in bitcoin price. A 4% gain in bitcoin price means a 12% gain in a 3x long position. Traders can similarly leverage their gains when the market drops. A 4% drop in bitcoin price means a 12% gain in a 3x short position.\n\nOpening a margin position is as simple as toggling a button in the order form to select the level of leverage and all the other order details work the same way they do for normal trades, including the many advanced order types Kraken supports. Open positions are easily closed with an opposing leveraged order. If you go long 3 bitcoins with a leveraged buy order, you can close the position by selling 3 bitcoins in a leveraged sell order.\n\nInitially there is no extra fee for margin trading. You simply pay your normal trade fee on the opening and closing volume of the margin position. So if you would normally pay 0.10% for a trade, you will pay 0.10% to open a margin position and 0.10% to close that position. Positions open for more than 24 hours will also be charged a 0.05% renewal fee to keep the position open for the next 24 hours. Traders who wish to avoid this fee should close their position within 24 hours.\n\nFor more information on the benefits and risks of margin trading, please see Kraken’s Trading Guide and FAQ.\n\nAbout Kraken:\n\nFounded in 2011, San Francisco-based Kraken (www.kraken.com) is the largest Bitcoin exchange in euro volume and liquidity and also trading US dollars, British pounds and Japanese yen. Kraken is consistently rated the best and most secure Bitcoin exchange by independent news media. Kraken was the first Bitcoin exchange listed on Bloomberg terminals, the first to pass a cryptographically verifiable proof-of-reserves audit, and is a partner in the first cryptocurrency bank. Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, the Tokyo government’s court-appointed trustee, and Germany’s BaFin regulated Fidor Bank.', 'San Francisco-based bitcoin company Coinbase has suspended operations in Wyoming until further notice.\n\nA company blog post cited the Wyoming Division of Banking\'s recent regulatory legislation as a decisive factor for ceasing business in the western US state, noting it would render continued operations impractical.\n\n""We understand that the Wyoming Division of Banking interprets the Wyoming Money Transmitter Act to require licensure of entities which offer hosted bitcoin wallet services, and that as a condition of such licensure, licensees must maintain dedicated fiat currency reserves in amount equal to aggregate face value of all bitcoin held on behalf of customers,"" noted the post.\n\nCoinbase said it would be impractical, costly and inefficient for the company to establish a redundant reserve of fiat currency in equivalent value.\n\n""We understand this suspension will inconvenience our Wyoming customers and we apologise that we cannot currently project if or when our services may be restored,"" it concluded.', 'Bitfinex has become the first major bitcoin exchange to offer on-blockchain transactions.\n\nTypically, exchanges work off-chain, meaning that user balances are settled within a central database.

It has raised $40 million from top venture capitalists. It has added luminaries to its advisory board, like former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Visa founder Dee Hock. It also is the subject of a previously-unreported fraud lawsuit that could eventually threaten its very existence.\n\nThe plaintiff is LifeLock ( lock ) , a $1.5 billion online-identity security company that in December 2013 paid $42.6 million to acquire Lemon, a digital wallet company led by eventual Xapo founder Wences Casares. In its complaint, LifeLock claims that Xapo was launched ""using a product developed by Lemon employees, in Lemon\'s facilities, on Lemon\'s computers, and on Lemon\'s dime.""\n\nCasares and four other Xapo employees (each of whom previously worked at Lemon) are named as defendants. Xapo itself is not named, but LifeLock is asking the court to force Casares, et al to disgorge ""the value of the Xapo product attributable to Defendants’ misrepresentations, omissions, breaches of duty, and other wrongful conduct."" And, if Casares is found guilty, LifeLock -- which has a long history of being sued itself -- could be emboldened to file its next complaint directly at Xapo.\n\nRecent history\n\nAccording to LifeLock, Lemon originally began work in April 2013 on a bitcoin product that would be integrated into its main digital wallet offering. But Lemon\'s board of directors killed the project that summer, around the same time that it entered into merger conversations with LifeLock. It is unclear if the board\'s directive and the merger talks were related, although LifeLock says that it declined an early offer to only acquire the digital wallet app, which would have allowed Casares to ""continue developing a bitcoin business.""\n\nThe two sides worked out a deal for all of Lemon in mid-September, and the transaction closed three months later. It valued Lemon at $42.6 million, although $5 million of that was put into an escrow that LifeLock would later claim for performance issues unrelated to the lawsuit (effectively valuing the purchase at $37.6 million). There is no mention in the merger agreement of a carveout for bitcoin IP.\n\nLifeLock says that it was aware that Casares had built himself a ""personal"" bitcoin storage vault. In January 2015, however, he told the board that other investors were asking to store bitcoin with him, and requested ""a letter from LifeLock acknowledging that it would not stake claim to Casares’ bitcoin storage vault or their bitcoins, and thereby place their investments at risk."" Casares subsequently asked for similar letters for five other Lemon employees -- two of which were part of an Argentinian subsidiary --to which LifeLock rejected the request, ""expressly telling Casares that no other Lemon employees could work on his personal storage venture.""\n\nFrom the complaint:\n\nCasares then claimed that those individuals were also investors and that he simply wanted an acknowledgement that they could be investors and provide strategic advice. Casares agreed that under no circumstances would those individuals perform day-to-day work and, indeed, would provide nothing more than strategic advice for what LifeLock understood to be Casares’ personal bitcoin storage business that he intended to offer to other wealthy Silicon Valley investors.\n\nLifeLock provided the letters, referring to the five other Lemon employees as ""strategic advisors"" and ""investors."" On March 6, 2014, Casares presented four of those five acknowledgement letters for signature to LifeLock president Hillary Schneider. Less than one hour after the documents were executed, Casares tendered his resignation.\n\nCourtesy of Xapo\n\nGiven that LifeLock still allegedly thought Casares was just working on his pre-existing bitcoin storage vault, it asked him to remain ""through an orderly transition and Casares agreed to delay his departure in order to do so.""\n\nOn March 13, Casares announced the launch of Xapo, with $20 million in venture capital from Benchmark, Ribbit Capital and Fortress Investment Group ( fig ) . He also told The New York Times that Xapo\'s team included three people who, at the time, were still full-time Lemon/LifeLock employees. One of them, Frederico Murrone, had received one of the aforementioned acknowledgement letters (which Fortune has learned did refer explicitly to ""any IP related to bitcoin"").\n\nLemon immediately began investigating, which included interviewing employees (excluding Casares, who refused) and forensically imaging all Lemon computers and servers (including those in Argentina). It claims to have found a treasure trove of evidence that Casares and his co-defendants had kept developing Lemon\'s bitcoin technology ""in secret"" long after the board had ordered it to stop—in the Lemon offices, on Lemon computers, ""during Lemon-paid business hours."" In fact, a Xapo-branded and logo\'d app quietly launched in the Google Play store just six weeks after Lemon\'s acquisition by LifeLock, and more than a month before Xapo\'s formal launch announcement.\n\nForensic analysis of Defendants’ computers also revealed presentations that Defendants had authored for potential Xapo investors during the time they were employed by Lemon, detailing the bitcoin wallet functionality of the app. One of these presentations touted the fact that “Xapo offers both a wallet and cloud-based cold storage” and that Xapo would offer “seamless 1-click transfer from Wallet to Vault.” The document’s metadata indicates that it was last modified on February 4, 2014—months after LifeLock’s acquisition of Lemon. Electronic artifacts on Casares’ computer indicate that Casares too had had Xapo-related files on his Lemon computer going back to December 2013, but that Casares deleted those files from his Lemon computer shortly before tendering his resignation.\n\nAnd it goes on. For example, the complaint claims that Lemon general counsel (and current Xapo president) Cynthia McAdam ""often claimed the need to work from home,"" but actually was working from Xapo\'s Palo Alto offices on Xapo business (she is named as a defendant).\n\nWences Casares Photograph by Scott Olson — Getty Images\n\nMcAdam\'s Lemon contract expired on the same day as the Times story was published, but Lemon soon terminated for cause three remaining employees who were believed to be Xapo employees, including Frederico Murrone. It negotiated for nearly four months with Casares before also firing him for cause on August 1, 2014.\n\nLemon then filed its suit in Santa Clara Superior Court on October 3, 2014. Neither Casares nor his co-defendants have yet filed a formal response, although Casares and McAdam have filed the equivalent of a motion to dismiss.\n\nThis motion -- known as a demurrer, in which defendants don\'t actually refute plaintiff allegations -- mostly focuses on the acknowledgment letters, with Casares arguing that he was indeed given latitude to work on Xapo. The defense also asserts that Lemon is making an arbitrary distinction between Xapo ""employees"" and ""advisors,"" writing:\n\nIn Defendants\' industry, it is not uncommon to describe persons collaborating on a project as advisors—indeed, even Steve Jobs was reportedly brought in as an ""advisor"" to Apple when he returned to that company in 1997.\n\nRecent court filings show that the ""discovery"" period could soon commence, although it is far too early to determine if this case will ultimately go to trial.\n\nBig bitcoin buzz\n\nCasares, a serial entrepreneur from Argentina, is something of a figurehead in the bitcoin community, since he has a number of hits on his resumé. He founded Patagon, an Argentinian online brokerage in 1997 and sold it to Banco Santander in 2000 for $750 million. He founded Wanako Games, a Chilean videogame developer in 2002 and sold it to Activision ( atvi ) in 2006. Then, of course, there was the creation and sale of Lemon.\n\nMuch like Barry Silbert (the creator of SecondMarket, who founded the Digital Currency Group) or Halsey Minor (founder of CNET, who founded BitReserve), Casares is seen as one of the big names in broader tech that later jumped into bitcoin—a good sign for the industry. In a talk at Chicago Ideas Week this year, Casares called bitcoin ""the new gold standard.""\n\nBut this lawsuit threatens both his reputation and his company\'s intellectual property. One former IP attorney, speaking to Fortune on background, said that the LifeLock suit against Casares is ""exactly the worst kind of IP suit for the defendant.""\n\nAlthough Xapo is well funded with big-name advisors , it has had its recent struggles. Tech blog The Information reported last fall that two banks have ended their relationships with the startup. Casares was quoted in that story as summing up the banks\' views thusly: ""Here’s a cashiers check for all your cash, thank you for your business."" The company also moved its global headquarters to Zurich last month, attracted by its ""regulatory stability,"" Casares said, during a time when bitcoin companies based in New York are concerned about the state\'s BitLicense regulatory framework.\n\nCasares has not commented about the suit on the record, but his attorney Steven Ragland (who also is representing McAdam) provided the following statement:\n\nThis is a baseless lawsuit. LifeLock has no right to any Bitcoin related business or IP that Wences Casares or his colleagues may have worked on during their time at Lemon or after. As LifeLock\'s President has attested in a legally binding document, LifeLock does not have any right, claim or interest to any Bitcoin IP. LifeLock\'s claims lack merit and we look forward to proving their allegations false.\n\nXapo itself has made no public comment on the lawsuit, nor did Casares mention the legal dispute to its three new advisory board members -- Larry Summers, Visa founder Dee Hock and former Citigroup ( c ) chairman and CEO John Reed -- or at least not until Fortune began making calls. Each of the company\'s two $20 million funding rounds occurred prior to the lawsuit being filed, although a source familiar with the situation says that investors in the more recent financing were aware that a lawsuit was possible. One investor, speaking on background with Fortune , said he was completely unaware actual litigation had been filed.\n\nSpeaking on background, people close to Xapo insisted that even if Casares is found guilty, it wouldn\'t hurt the company. But that may be a stretch: if LifeLock wins its case, Xapo, a financial services company, would have a CEO who was convicted of civil fraud.\n\nLifeLock has declined comment, beyond its court filings.\n\nAmong the bitcoin community, there are three or four companies you hear mentioned more than any others. Xapo is one of them. This suit\'s ultimate resolution will go a long way toward determining how much longer Xapo remains part of the conversation.\n\nSubscribe to Data Sheet , Fortune\'s daily newsletter on the business of technology.', 'Swedish mining hardware firm KnCMiner is deploying a new bitcoin ASIC it says will be a ""game changer"" for the industry.\n\nFirst announced last November, the 16nm Solar is six times faster than the company\'s previous 28nm design. Unlike conventional \'flat\' chips, its components are stacked three-dimensionally to increase efficiency and processing speed.\n\nSam Cole, KnCMiner\'s CEO, said in a statement:\n\n""We\'ve produced four consecutive all-new chip designs in only two years, exceeding even Moore\'s Law and we see no signs of this development slowing down going forward.""\n\nKnCMiner, which raised a $15m Series B in February, also unveiled details of a new mining facility in Boden, Northern Sweden. The 18,000-sq ft warehouse – roughly the size of four basketball courts – is scheduled to launch this September.\n\nThe company said it has earmarked land adjacent to its two flagship data centres, located at a former military base, for future expansion.\n\nAll upcoming data centres will run exclusively on the 16nm Solar, Cole told CoinDesk, with all 28nm chips being ""phased out"".\n\nGreen concerns\n\nAt a time of declining profitability and squeezed margins, efficiency is paramount as mining firms jostle for economies of scale.\n\nKnCMiner\'s operations in the Arctic Circle use locally-sourced hydroelectric power – Europe\'s cheapest – alongside sub-zero air to lower the firm\'s energy footprint and keep costs low.\n\nThe company says the ""environmentally friendly"" chip, capable of 0.07 w/GHs, will increase the efficiency of its industrial mining farms by six to eight times.\n\nDespite concerns about mining centralisation, the firm said its increased hashing power, which will push the overall hashrate higher, will also bolster the network as a whole. Cole told CoinDesk:\n\n""A higher total hashrate further increases the network\'s integrity and security. As such, this piece of news should make many bitcoin aficionados worldwide rejoice.""\n\nWhen the Solar was first announced, the ASIC pioneer suggested it would bolster the consumer hardware and cloud services offered by KnCMiner.\n\nHowever, in a period marred by shipping delays, customer complaints and a potential class action suit, KnC has been withdrawing from the highly-competitive consumer space to focus on its role as an industrial-scale transaction processor.\n\nAll cloud mining contracts are currently listed as ""sold out"" on KnCMiner\'s site.

CoinTelegraph spoke to HaoBTC CMO, Eric Mu, who described what it’s like to work in a newly built bitcoin mine located in the beautiful and rugged mountains of China’s Sichuan region.\n\nHaoBTC is headquartered in Beijing, and has a mining subsidiary located in Sichuan. It previously hosted the majority of its miners in two mines in Mabian and Meishan, but has since relocated to a new facility in Kangding, Sichuan, due to the region’s favorable climate and low electricity costs.\n\nLocated next to a US$10 million hydro-power station, the construction of the new facility cost between US$600,000 and US$700,000, and the company is looking to expand its hash rate and buy even more miners in the near future.\n\n“I will tentatively make the claim that we are the cleanest BTC mining facility in the world.” -Eric Mu\n\nCoinTelegraph: Why did you decide to relocate to the Sichuan province?\n\nEric Mu: Like all large miners, we are perpetually on the lookout for cheaper power. Chinese mining had previously concentrated in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi, regions rich in coal, resultant in cheaper power. Now they are moving westward en masse because the power there is even cheaper.\n\nCT: What was it like when you first arrived to this location?\n\nEM: Bitcoin is often called the new frontier and you will hardly see a place that’s more frontier than this place. After an eight hour drive from the provincial capital, you enter the mountainous region of the eastern Tibetan plateau. Rocks are the size of houses; the land is barren with small trees; the mountains are untamed like wild cannibalistic beasts.\n\nThen all of a sudden, several warehouse-type buildings have sprung up and heavy-duty trucks loaded with thousands of black metal boxes arrived with a bunch of young people who call themselves miners though they carry no pickaxes. They are Bitcoin miners, the pioneers of the digital frontier.\n\nCT: What are day-to-day operations like and how are the people?\n\nEM: We monitor the conditions of the miners remotely and repair the broken ones. We check the temperature and cooling system, making sure the water pipes are not clogged. We do night patrols to ensure there are no unwanted visitors. People in surrounding areas are migrant workers building tunnels and roads. There are also a few Tibetan villagers.\n\nCT: How big is the team? Do they get paid in bitcoin?\n\nEM: The company has two offices: the Beijing office is where our development team is based. Then we also have an eight-person team at our mining facility. We just interviewed an applicant today so this number may grow to be nine if the guy is lucky. BTC payment is an option; employees can choose whichever way they want to be paid.\n\nCT: What kind of people work at the Bitcoin mining farm? What motivates them to live and work in such an area?\n\nEM: Most of them were electricians or indoors furbishers prior to coming to the BTC mining and some have been working in other BTC mines for as long as two years prior to working for us. Our salary is deemed to be competitive even in the mining industry.\n\nRight now people here work seven-day weeks, but once the construction is done, they will be able to take one month of vacation for every two months of work. China may have a bad labor record, but we try to reverse the image to make sure our people are well taken care of and their morale remains high. We just discussed buying commercial insurance this morning.\n\nCT: What were the biggest difficulties that you faced in the mine? How were these resolved?\n\nEM: Secondhand miners are in short supply. We only realize this when we decided to expand. The timing is perhaps to blame. The old models had been discontinued while the new generation has yet to be released.\n\nCT: What hash rate do you ultimately want to achieve at this facility?\n\nEM: The hydro-power station we work with has a max output in excess of 12,000 kW. Given the 28nm ASIC mining equipment that we are currently using, we estimate the hash rate will top at somewhere between 10P and 12P.\n\nCT: What is the average temperature that you try to maintain inside the farm?\n\nEM: It is between 32 to 37 degrees Celsius most of time, which is deemed very low. This is achieved by a combination of high altitude location, and a highly effective water cooling system. Even in the hottest time of the year, I expect this will be controlled under 40.\n\n“Still we hope one day [the electric company] will accept BTC. There won’t be any direct financial gain for us, but it might be a boon for people’s confidence.”\n\nCT: How much of your revenue is taken by intermediaries (banks, conversion fees, etc.)? How much would you save if the electric power company accepted bitcoin directly?\n\nEM: Very little and very little. We exchange our BTC for fiat on local exchanges. Almost all Chinese exchanges charge no fees for trading and charge a small percentage for cash withdrawal.\n\nSimilarly, the Chinese banks charged no fees for domestic transfers. The power station doesn’t accept BTC, for good reason — they have to pay back their bank loans and pay their employees. Still we hope one day they will accept BTC. There won’t be any direct financial gain for us, but it might be a boon for people’s confidence.\n\nCT: Can you give us an estimate of how much you pay per kWh, including fees and taxes?\n\nEM: We run our miners in different locations, and the hydro-power stations usually have tiered pricing system to account for the seasonal rainfall rises and falls — they generated less power in winter so the prices are slightly higher. With everything accounted for, the cost is around US$0.045 per kWh. But as we are still in the process of relocating our miners to the new facility, we expect this number to drop further. Even this price is competitive worldwide, which is why we are confident to invite people to invest with us.\n\nCT: What is the expected return on investment?\n\nEM: There are way too many variables to do a definitive cost calculation. But we expect eight to ten months time to ROI, assuming the BTC prices will stay stable. The estimation took account of the fact that we borrowed some of our funds from our users.\n\nCT: Factoring all of the costs, how much would you say does it cost to mine one bitcoin?\n\nEM: This is by no means accurate, and I do hear a few different versions, but our own estimate is RMB 1,000 [~US$161] (not ours but the average cost in the market) at the current difficulty level.\n\n“When you do the cost assessment, rent, labor cost and hardware shipping time are all important factors. This explained the fast growth of hash rate in China.”\n\nCT: How does this compare to the average rate in parts of the world where bitcoin mining is taking off, particularly Iceland, the Pacific Northwest, etc.?\n\nEM: I don’t have numbers of the mining facilities from these regions. But I heard Chinese investors coming back from Iceland reporting that the non-electricity costs are too high there. When you do the cost assessment, rent, labor cost and hardware shipping time are all important factors. This explained the fast growth of hash rate in China.\n\nCT: How do you handle waste, and how eco-friendly is this facility?\n\nEM: I can’t think of any waste aside from broken miners that had to be junked. Our facility is built right next to the hydro-power station, so even the loss of power in transmission is negligible. We don’t use AC, instead relying mostly on water for cooling, which also saves energy. Hydro power is one of the cleanest forms of energy, so I will tentatively make the claim that we are the cleanest BTC mining facility in the world — I would be very glad to be proven wrong.\n\nCT: Do you mine alt coins?\n\nEM: No.\n\nCT: What are your plans regarding the next Bitcoin halving?\n\nEM: Increase our hash rate and do it as fast as we can. We are still almost a year away from the next halving and we are confident that we will recoup our investment by then. With that said, it does affect the prospect, which is why we work so hard to expand our power and part of the reason that we launched the bank to allow people to invest with us.\n\n“We usually pay our miners in BTC. Granted the number of people accepting BTC is small at the moment, but it is growing.”\n\nCT: How is bitcoin used in China, and are you starting to see regular people become familiarized with cryptocurrency?\n\nEM: Bitcoin is used as the currency in the community, not very different from fiat currency. We usually pay our miners in BTC. Granted the number of people accepting BTC is small at the moment, but it is growing.\n\nRegular people are being introduced to cryptocurrency and I have been witnessing this firsthand. Take the hydro-power station employees, for example. When we first pitched the idea to them, few of them even heard of BTC. Now they are asking how feasible it is to buy a BTC miner and mine at home.']"

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""Bitcoin bank and payment processor Xapo faces uncertain waters as much of the company’s executive team is being sued for contract violations.\n\nThe misgivings center on the last months that Xapo co-founder and CEO Wences Casares, along with other Xapo employees, worked for the mobile wallet Lemon.In December 2013, the $1.5 billion online security company LifeLock acquired the mobile wallet for $42.5 million (and rebranded it LifeLock Wallet). As reported by Fortune, the lawsuit is over whether Xapo was originally developed during his and other Xapo employees’ time working for Lemon. Or as LifeLock’s compliant puts it, “using a product developed by Lemon employees, in Lemon’s facilities, on Lemon’s computers, and on Lemon’s dime.”\n\nSeveral months before Lemon would be acquired by LifeLock, the mobile wallet startup started working on a Bitcoin product, but the project was quickly terminated by its board of directors. Casares, Lemon CEO at the time, pushed on with the digital currency product, which was a Bitcoin storage service for himself and other Lemon executives (one of Xapo’s core services).He approached LifeLock’s board with a letter that asked them to acknowledge they sought no stake of his Bitcoin vault’s intellectual property. In a letter dated February 12, 2014 and signed by LifeLock president Hillary Schneider, LifeLock acknowledges that it does not hold any claim to Bitcoin intellectual property and transfers all rights to Casares.\n\nCasares also asked for letters requesting permission for Lemon/LifeLock employees to work on his bitcoin project in their free time. When four out of five of these requests were rejected by Schneider, Casares announced he would resign from his role as Lemon’s CEO. A week later, on March, 13, 2014, Xapo’s launch was announced, along with a $20 million funding round raised from Benchmark, Ribbit Capital and Fortress Investment Group.According to LifeLock, the security company has found overwhelming evidence that Casares, former Lemon engineer Frederico Murrone (Xapo co-founder and COO), and former Lemon general counsel Cynthia McAdam (Xapo president), along with two other former Lemon employees, were developing the Bitcoin startup with Lemon’s resources.\n\nLifeLock is not suing Xapo, at least not yet (a judgment in Lifelock's favor in current lawsuits could open the door to the Bitcoin startup being next). But the security company is seeking damages from its former employees for their alleged misactions. Specifically, they are seeking reimbursement for “the value of the Xapo product attributable to Defendants’ misrepresentations, omissions, breaches of duty, and other wrongful conduct.”\n\nBesides having to potentially pay back a large settlement to their former employer, having much of Xapo’s executive team losing a civil lawsuit could be damaging for the financial service startup’s reputation and relationship with existing financial institutions, such as banks.Neither Xapo nor any of the accused former Lemon employees have made any public statements on the lawsuit, but Casares’ attorney Steven Ragland, who also is representing McAdam, provided Bitcoin Magazine the following:\n\n“This is a baseless lawsuit. LifeLock has no right to any Bitcoin-related business or IP that Wences Casares or his colleagues may have worked on during their time at Lemon or after. As LifeLock’s President has attested in a legally binding document, LifeLock does not have any right, claim or interest to any Bitcoin IP. LifeLock’s claims lack merit and we look forward to proving their allegations false.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information about the letter regarding Bitcoin intellectual property signed by Caesares and Schenider."", 'BitPay, the global bitcoin payment processor provider, just got a little more consumer friendly.\n\nThe bit of big news that came from the company this week (June 3) is that BitPay is taking its consumer-facing bitcoin wallet out of beta and opening it up to the general public. But what does that mean for the bitcoin community?\n\nPYMNTS caught up with BitPay at IRCE this week in Chicago, where BitPay’s Marketing Manager Emily Vaughn shared why the company’s announcement is a big step for both the bitcoin community and the company itself.\n\n“It’s a pretty big move for us because we’ve been strictly B2B for the past few years and now we are sort of experimenting with being able to enhance our services by adding a consumer layer. It was actually something that we built for all of the developers and employees that work at BitPay that “live” bitcoin and use bitcoin in their daily lives,” Vaughn said. “We found we needed a more secure wallet and a wallet that was truly functional for daily activities. So we brought that out of beta and it’s available on iOS, Android and Windows — it’s the only bitcoin wallet on Windows. We’re pretty excited to see where it can go. That’s a big announcement for us.”\n\nBitPay’s core product is payment processing, which means security is always top of mind. And when it came to its latest service to rollout into the bitcoin market, the company said it didn’t take any shortcuts in ensuring the same security features were offered across its platform of services.\n\nBitPay Goes Beyond B2B To Copay\n\nJust one year ago, BitPay built its bitcoin wallet that BitPay says was secure enough for its own company’s funds. And after ensuring it was ready to rollout to the consumer audience, it released what it’s calling the first version of Copay.\n\nCopay’s features include the ability to hold bitcoin, and hold bitcoin across multiple wallets while offering shared and personal wallets across all devices. From a developer’s perspective, it’s also all open source. The open source aspect, Vaughn said, is something the company was very excited to announce.\n\nCopay works exactly how it sounds. The bitcoin wallet enables users to copay from the wallet, but both users must authenticate a purchase. That ensures both parties agree to the purchase, which can be useful for couples who want a joint account, or even for friends or business partners who want the same convenience. And it comes with that multi-signature touch.\n\n“The multi-signature adds a social layer. …We think multi-signature security is really where the whole industry is going. I would think that not too long from now that will be a pretty standard issue for a bitcoin wallet feature,” Vaughn said. “But we’re really excited that Copay works the way that it does because it’s a true bitcoin wallet,” Vaughn emphasized. “So it’s not like a consumer has to create an account with us where we have their keys. We don’t have their keys. They have their keys. But, it‘s enabling the bitcoin holder to set whatever layer of security the user requires.”\n\nThis means enabling wallets that can require one signature, or a wallet that requires five. As explained above, different wallets can require different signatures. For Copay, the extra layer of security is what makes it most appealing to the general bitcoin public. BitPay’s goal with Copay was to provide the trust for its users that their bitcoin could be secure, making it so users don’t look to store their bitcoins on a third-party service that is more likely to be hacked.\n\n“That’s a cool function of Copay. And from a security standpoint we think that’s very necessary. Copay requires co-signature. We wouldn’t have required anything else,” Vaughn said. “It’s a bitcoin wallet built for bitcoin developers by bitcoin developers.”\n\nThe Internet And Bitcoin\n\n[pullquote] “Once bitcoin becomes the backend technology for financial activities in your daily life, then it will really be like the Internet. I don’t know how the Internet works, but I use it every day. That’s where bitcoin really needs to be for bitcoin to get millions of users all over the world.” [/pullquote]\n\nBitcoin is like the Internet, Vaughn says, parroting the metaphor that many bitcoin advocates have used in the past to describe its innovation. When it first came out it was clunky, not so user friendly and no one really understood how to use it — or what its true power was. But then the Internet evolved into something consumers use today without so much of a thought of how or why (unless it’s not working). Bitcoin, she noted, has evolved in many of the same ways, but still has some catching up to do on the tech side.\n\n“Bitcoin is a really, really new technology. You’ve heard about comparisons that compare bitcoin to the early Internet,” Vaughn said. “Where bitcoin is right now is like where the Internet was in the early ’90s. Which is not too far off base. Bitcoin is still clunky — we’re using QR codes, we have alphanumeric randomized addresses and that’s not the user friendliness that consumers have come to enjoy.”\n\nThe backing of big financial players like NASDAQ and the NYSE endorsing the bitcoin blockchain (in a small way) has really helped propel bitcoin’s image onto the table for deeper discussions. In New York, an official bitcoin business license is being reviewed, and across the nation, as PYMNTS detailed in last week’s Bitcoin Tracker, states across the U.S. are reviewing how bitcoin can be regulated.\n\n“It’s really great to see massive, traditional financial institutions buying into bitcoin. …We think that’s fantastic for the industry because to us that indicates a level of interest in bitcoin as an infrastructure. Using bitcoin to replace clunky, outdated, slow financial infrastructure. That’s what’s going to cause bitcoin to take off,” Vaughn said.\n\nWhich goes back to the Internet comparison, Vaughn emphasizes. Consumers don’t always understand the nuances of the Internet, but most who have access embrace it most hours of the day and don’t really care how it works – so long as it does.\n\n“Once bitcoin becomes the backend technology for financial activities in your daily life, then it will really be like the Internet. I don’t know how the Internet works, but I use it every day. That’s where bitcoin really needs to be for bitcoin to get millions of users all over the world. People don’t need to understand the technology in order to use it, but to get those big endorsements I think will push bitcoin where it needs to go in order for it to stabilize a little bit,” Vaughn said.\n\nWhere Regulation Comes Into Play\n\nThe big R word. The word everyone in the bitcoin community is talking about.\n\n“As a payment processor — we are open to working with regulators. We are fully compliant. …We have to work with banks for account settlements to our merchants or to provide transfers for the payroll processing we are exploring. Even so far as starting a wallet,” Vaughn said. “We want to make sure from a regulatory standpoint we are all in the green.”\n\nShe also shared her personal belief that lawmakers and politicians need to be aware of the impact that regulation has on innovation — especially when it comes to financial tech.\n\n“If you regulate something to the point where we can no longer improve the technology then it’s sort of forcing people to use it in a way that isn’t effective and isn’t efficient and isn’t really serving any purpose. And bitcoin really does have the ability to fix a lot of broken aspects of our financial system. It’s not going to get to where it needs to if there is too much red tape,” Vaughn said. “But, at the same time, I do think regulatory oversight is going to help bitcoin become accepted by more traditional institutions. Banks are looking at bitcoin as a way to improve their internal process. If there is no safety for them, but if in their mind bitcoin is just a criminal instrument, then we’re not doing ourselves any favors.”\n\nBitPay, she noted, works with regulators to ensure the company is expressing the views of the bitcoin community, particularly those looking to innovate the space. And that’s not something BitPay plans to shy away from, she said.\n\nTo view PYMNTS’ previous Bitcoin Trackers, click here.', 'ECUREX GmbH, a Zurich, Switzerland-based digital finance marketplace for traders and financial institutions, has become the first digital currency exchange platform to be fully compliant with the Swiss Banking Act. The ECUREX trading system is not yet operating, but the team announced that this is its next objective. The team has scheduled the system’s first release.\n\nThe company reported the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has released an opinion letter stating that ECUREX’s business model is compliant with the Swiss Banking Act. FINMA released the letter following 16 months of investigation, ECUREX noted.\n\nA challenging regulatory environment\n\n“Switzerland probably has the most challenging regulatory environment for such a business and we are thrilled to be the first with a business model that allows us to operate here,” said Paolo Tasca, CEO of ECUREX. “We think a stable regulatory environment is not only beneficial for us in the long-term, but also for our customers.”\n\nECUREX has also been the first digital currency exchange platform to be compliant with the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act since April 2014, the company noted.\n\nSwiss pension fund manager was refused to withdraw money to save it from negative interest rates\n\nDigital currency equivalent to foreign currency\n\nRegulation of digital currency exchanges in Switzerland is stricter than in other countries because it considers digital currencies equivalent to any other foreign currency. The professional operation of bitcoin trading platforms constitutes financial intermediation with the requirement to comply with both the Banking Act and the Anti-Money Laundering Act.\n\nECUREX uses a multi-level platform to provide users security and control over their own deposits throughout the trading cycle.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The BitLicense is here.\n\nWhat is that, you ask? Something a bit less sexy than its flashy name suggests: it’s the set of regulations that will govern digital currency businesses operating in New York State. The much-ballyhooed bitcoin law, developed and revised by the New York Department of Financial Services and its superintendent Benjamin Lawsky over the last year, was made official on Wednesday. It has also been the cause for much consternation in the bitcoin community.\n\nExecutives, policy pundits, and investors have been concerned that BitLicense would stifle innovation at startups. At a bitcoin breakfast event in Manhattan in April, a group of them traded complaints (“They ended up with a pound of soup where they threw in all the different bank rules and AML [anti-money laundering] rules… they ended up with something very salty,” said Tim Byun of BitPay) and hyperbolic predictions (if BitLicense is too stringent, New York City will “lose the next Wall Street” to Silicon Valley, Estonia, or North Carolina, said Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures).\n\nWhen Lawsky suddenly announced last month that he would resign his post in June to go into private practice in California, the bitcoin community rejoiced. “Ding Dong, Lawsky’s gone,” tweeted Anthony di Lorio. Sal Delle Palme tweeted, “Ciao, Lawsky!” And Times reporter Jenny Anderson observed there would be “champagne corks popping” at banks as a result.\n\nBut now that Lawsky’s law is here, the celebration is over—and the critics are speaking out.\n\nSurprised and saddened that NYDFS didn’t update BitLicense definitions to clearly exclude multi-sig. Uncertainty is bad for innovation. — Jerry Brito (@jerrybrito) June 3, 2015\n\nWhat are bitcoin folks most upset about? They see the final policy, which requires licenses from business that hold and transmit money on behalf of customers, as being overly restrictive. They resent that BitLicense requires companies covered by the policy to get pre-approval for every new product rollout—which the companies think might be a slow process. They fear that new bitcoin startups that don’t yet have revenue will have to spend big money on legal fees and approval processes. They had hoped the final language would overtly exclude companies that offer a “multi-sig” product (a security approach involving the ownership of two separate private keys), since those companies don’t truly have full custody of a customer’s bitcoins. (The final product does not clearly exclude multi-sig entities; Ryan Selkis, director of investments at the Digital Currency Group, called this an “inexcusable oversight.”) And they worry that, since BitLicense is the first designated set of regulations for bitcoin businesses from a single state, other states will now follow New York’s example and use BitLicense as a template for their own regulatory policy.\n\nIn a statement, the well-funded startup Coinbase responded publicly: “We remain concerned over specific components of the BitLicense that were left unchanged, including state-specific AML rules that are inconsistent with federal guidelines. Moreover, it’s troubling that this nascent industry is being subjected to more onerous regulations than those typically applied to legacy financial institutions.” The nonprofit policy advocate Coin Center, meanwhile, posted a handy tracker that compares digital currency policies across different states to that of New York.\n\nMany in the bitcoin community have railed that BitLicense will cause the city to lose bitcoin startups to the looser regulatory pastures of Europe or states like North Carolina, which has been praised for its friendliness toward digital currency businesses. There is an effort underway in the New Jersey legislature to propose tax cuts for bitcoin businesses. Such a move would incentivize digital currency startups to move their headquarters to New Jersey. (Indeed, some companies, like the digital wallet provider Xapo, have already fled New York—Xapo moved its global headquarters to Zurich last month.) Matt Odell, co-founder of a bitcoin informational site, Coinprices.io, said in an email blast that BitLicense, as it stands now, “will stifle innovation in New York as bitcoin businesses move to friendlier locales.” He called parts of it “draconian” and said, “much of it is too vague to give bitcoin companies the certainty that they are indeed complying with the law.”\n\nNot everyone was unhappy with the new policy. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of one of the hottest bitcoin companies, Circle, told the bitcoin news site Coindesk, “Would I welcome lighter touch? Sure, but I think it’s an important stake in the ground.” He added that the policy is clear and straightforward for his company, but “for others, not so much.”\n\nIn just a few weeks, the hue and cry from these boisterous bitcoiners will move off of Benjamin Lawsky and on to the shoulders of his yet-to-be-announced successor.', 'Silk Road kingpin Ross Ulbricht’s recent conviction and life sentence was more than simply a crackdown on a massive online black market for illegal drugs. It was a nail in the coffin of the radical new “cryptocurrency” Bitcoin, as Bitcoin was the glue that held Silk Road together.\n\nOr was it? How significant the rise and fall of Silk Road was for Bitcoin is a matter of some debate, as is the purpose of Bitcoin itself. Controversy, however, is nothing new for Bitcoin. In fact, it seems the story of this digital currency consists of nothing but controversy.\n\nIn fact, perhaps the greatest challenge for Bitcoin is divining the technology’s true purpose. Early innovators often espoused radical Libertarian goals for revolutionizing the banking system and with it, the world economy. By disintermediating third parties, Bitcoin promised to usher in a new world order of free market commerce.\n\nOnly the Bitcoin story didn’t work out that way. Bitcoin soon became a haven for criminals – not just Silk Road, but any number of money launderers and other shady types who gravitated toward an anonymous, relatively safe method for conducting financial transactions, in particular across national borders.\n\n“Because of its openness, Bitcoin will continue to be used by shady actors,” explains Nathaniel Popper, New York Times reporter and author of Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money. “In some ways, the good comparison is cash. Bitcoiners love saying the main medium for illicit transactions is still probably $100 bills because it can be an anonymous form of transacting that’s untraceable, and Bitcoin still has that quality as well.”\n\nIn fact, just this week news came to light that an Australian company paid hackers a ransom in Bitcoin. Clearly, Bitcoin is the extortionist’s currency of choice, as it combines the anonymity of cash with the global convenience of traditional wire transfers.\n\nIf Bitcoin’s true purpose is to facilitate criminal activity, then perhaps Bitcoin itself is – or should be – illegal. However, the US Government for its part pointed out that Bitcoin in and of itself wasn’t illegal, but clearly required regulation. “There’s no way the good attributes of Bitcoin will succeed without a strict regulatory regime,” points out Clay Nelson, until recently the Director of Business Development for Bitcoin startup BitPay.', 'Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.\n\nBitcoin\'s Wild West days may be numbered, or so the headlines would have us believe.\n\nThis week saw the release of the final version of the BitLicense, New York\'s long-awaited, and still heavily debated, state-specific regulation for bitcoin businesses. Unsurprisingly, the news was extensively covered in the media, and often heralded as a milestone in the evolution of the emerging technology.\n\nMany stories used legitimizing language and headlines that foreshadowed that bitcoin had taken yet another step toward inclusion in the wider financial world.\n\nHowever, the technology\'s growing pains were still on display this week, as it continued to be associated with illicit Deep Web-based activities and development issues dogged one of its most well-funded startups.\n\nMilestone legislation\n\nThe victory lap for the BitLicense came swiftly following its 3rd June release, with the mainstream narrative all but arranged to trumpet the government\'s stamp of approval.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\'s Michael J Casey wrote a piece, which noted:\n\n""Outgoing New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky released sweeping new rules for licensing digital-currency businesses in the state Wednesday, staking part of his legacy on launching a specialised regulatory regime for an industry that many experts believe could play a significant role in the financial system.""\n\nIn the article, Casey quoted Lawsky\'s statements in which he voiced his belief that the legislation struck the appropriate balance between protecting customers and rooting out illicit activity, while showing commitment to not ""doom promising new technologies before they get out of the cradle"".\n\n""Whereas some have questioned why existing money transmission regulations can\'t be used for virtual currency businesses, Mr Lawsky said those Civil War-era laws simply wouldn\'t work for digital currency, a technology unlike anything we had ever seen before,"" said Casey.\n\nMore marginalized were the many dissenting voices who occasionally appeared in such content, arguing that the BitLicense would discourage the same spirit of innovation that propelled the early Internet.\n\nExtensively covered by Western mainstream media, the news was also picked up by less likely outlets around the world, showcasing the technology\'s growing appeal abroad.\n\nKommersant, a Russian Daily, ran a headline which implied bitcoin had been legitimised as a digital currency; a loosely translated version read: ""Cryptocurrency Recognised A Full Part of The Financial Market"".\n\nThe article said:\n\n""The key provision of the new rules is that now all the companies that work with cryptocurrency, you must have a special license from the Department, which should improve the safety of customers and transparency of operations cryptocurrency.""\n\nSuch articles could no doubt have an influence on coming conversations regarding regulation that is seeking to ban the technology in Russia under rules for monetary surrogates.\n\nNail in the bitcoin coffin\n\nIt wasn\'t all good news for bitcoin.\n\nFollowing Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht\'s life sentence last week, it was not surprising to see how the debate around bitcoin\'s use in illicit activities was reignited.\n\nForbes published a piece by Jason Bloomberg in which the author outlined the digital currency\'s link to the Deep Web.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n""Silk Road kingpin Ross Ulbricht\'s recent conviction and life sentence was more than simply a crackdown on a massive online black market for illegal drugs. It was a nail in the coffin for the radical new cryptocurrency bitcoin, as bitcoin was the glue that held Silk Road together.""\n\nBacktracking slightly, Bloomberg asked how significant the demise of Silk Road was for bitcoin, noting that this was part of an ongoing debate.\n\n""Controversy, however, is nothing new for bitcoin. In fact, it seems the story of this digital currency consists of nothing but controversy,"" he wrote, adding: ""In fact, perhaps the greatest challenge for bitcoin is divining the technology\'s true purpose. Early innovators often espoused radical Libertarian goals for revolutionising the banking system and with it, the world economy"".\n\n""By disintermediating third parties, bitcoin promised to usher in a new world order free of market commerce,"" noted Bloomberg.\n\nDespite this, the author proves seemingly negative about bitcoin\'s performance.\n\n""Bitcoin soon became a haven for criminals – not just Silk Road, but any number of money launderers and other shady types who gravitated toward an anonymous, relatively safe method for conducting financial transactions, in particular across national borders,"" he said.\n\n\'Total crypto breakdown\'\n\nElsewhere, Blockchain struggled to right its news narrative, which has been marked by the kinds of security issues that may be alarming given that it closed $30.5m in funding late last year.\n\nThe Guardian ran a piece with an alarmist headline given the small number of users apparently affected, writing:\n\n""Blockchain has issued an update for the Android version of its bitcoin wallet after discovering a critical failure which breaks the cryptocurrency\'s security.""\n\nWhether intentional or not, the latter seems to imply that Blockchain\'s bug could potentially affect bitcoin as a whole, as opposed to just users who store their holdings on Blockchain\'s wallets.\n\nWriter Alex Hern explained:\n\n""Bitcoin wallet application Blockchain has rushed to release an update after a critical bug left multiple users unaware that they were sharing a bitcoin wallet, leaving their cryptocurrency completely unsecured.""\n\nHe continued: ""The bug affected users running Blockchain’s app on Android version 4.1 or older [...] it resulted in one specific address being generated multiple times, leading to a loss of funds for a handful of users.”\n\nAccording to Hern, the bug was due to a series of questionable development choices:\n\n""Bitcoin wallets are typically created by randomly generating a public address and a related private key. As a result, it is important for address and key to be truly random, or else it may be possible to guess the private key by looking at the public address.""\n\nIt seems that Blockchain used two sources to create the random numbers, pulling a random number from Android\'s built-in generator, and then connecting to online service Random.org to obtain the second combination.\n\nHern noted that on some Android devices, the built-in random number generator failed to connect and report back Blockchain\'s app.\n\nThen, the battering continued.\n\nMichael Mimoso wrote a piece for Threat Post with ""Crypto Calamity For Blockchain Android App"" as its headline.\n\nDescribing Blockchain as one of the busiest bitcoin wallets, the article said: ""Shoddy crypto is being blamed for the loss of bitcoin for an unnamed number of Blockchain users.""\n\nIt seems that New York\'s plans to regulate digital currency companies, at least for now, will do little to help solve the pain points for companies still struggling to gain wider adoption.\n\nNewspaper image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As such, many thoughts put forward with respect to usages (current or imagined) must be viewed skeptically. One must wonder, for instance, if the person who champions a particular currency-related use case is doing so because he stands to financially benefit; i.e. they might be holding a lot of Bitcoins.\n\nAll caveats aside, my enthusiasm for crypto currency remains high, even while specifics around use cases in the arts is cloudy. I thought it wise therefore to bring in another voice — a voice I know to be transparent and trustworthy - to the conversation to discuss this topic.\n\nZoe Keating is not only a fine musicians/composers (“Into The Trees"", Ms. Keating\'s SoundCloud postings), but also an artist who has embraced transparency around her music more so than any artist I know. For example, Ms. Keating frequently posts detailed royalty statements that allow people to see unvarnished accountings.\n\nI imagine it\'s this combination of musical brilliance and the embracing of technology/transparency that led Ms. Keating to being invited to The Blockchain Summit held at Richard Branson\'s Necker Island that just ended (here is a video of the Blockchain Summit, with Ms. Keating’s music as the score).\n\nI asked Ms. Keating some questions about this experience, and her thoughts on crypto generally, and her responses (edited only for grammar and clarity) are below. I urge you to read the entirety of Ms. Keating’s responses; they are the most clearly articulated on this topic I’ve yet to see.', ""Roughly nine months ago, Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen made a rather interesting comment on Reddit in which he claimed, “I suspect many [cloud mining companies] will turn out to be Ponzi schemes.”There have been a few cloud mining scams uncovered over the past year or two, and it appears that another one could unravel in the near future. An anonymous source has provided information to Bitcoin Magazine regarding the possibility of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme involving Bitcoin Cloud Services (BCS), which is currently one of the largest cloud-mining providers on the market.\n\nFounded by a known scammer with Photoshop\n\nOne of the common attributes of a Ponzi scheme in the Bitcoin world is a reliance on anonymous owners. BTC Cloud Services LTD is registered to Gabriel Kleiman and Esteban Amador Soto Martinez.While the first name does not bring up any identifying information online, the second name is associated with another bitcoin-related scam, bitcoincloudhashing.com. This information is available publicly on the bitcointalk forums thanks to Puppet’s Cloudmining 101 thread, but it hasn't stopped an estimated 4,300 users from signing up at Bitcoin Cloud Services. BCS also claims to be a silver member of the Bitcoin Foundation on their website, even though the foundation recently dropped the cloud mining company as a sponsor.\n\nFurther, the pictures of a supposed mining facility on the Bitcoin Cloud Services website contain no information about the mining facility or its owners besides a single banner hanging in the background. Compare to the photo below from Genesis Mining showing CEO Marco Streng in one of the company's mining farms.\n\nEditor's Note: This photo of Genesis Mining CEO Marco Streng is provided courtesy of Genesis Mining and provided for comparison and reference only. Genesis Mining is not connected to Bitcoin Cloud Services in any way.\n\nThe “company” also released a poorly made video based off the Photoshopped images in an effort to bring more legitimacy to their activities:\n\nThe supporting evidence on the blockchain\n\nOne of the key pieces of data provided by the anonymous source is a spreadsheet compiled via publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain but we do not know the specific bitcoin mining software used. By watching Bitcoin Cloud Services’ payout address, the anonymous source was able to estimate the number of customers receiving payouts, along with BCS’s profits and losses. BCS seems to have started to operate at a loss near the end of April. How did BCS respond? By offering an extra year on their currently available mining contracts. Typical behavior of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme.\n\nThis offer could be an attempt to keep a Ponzi scheme going for as long as possible. After all, it will last only as long as new money is coming in. The back-of-the-envelope math based on the spreadsheet indicates that the operators could run off with as much as 2,500 BTC ($570,000 at current prices) with a bitcoin mining scam.\n\nIf it looks like a duck...\n\nGoing back to Puppet’s Cloud Mining 101 thread, it seems clear that he understands the likelihood that BCS is a Ponzi scheme. The thread lists seven different criteria that are usually found in a Ponzi scheme, and BCS fits the bill in six out of seven criteria. The only test that BCS seems to have passed is having pictures of their mining facility on their website. Of course, as Puppet notes in his thread, “Pictures can be faked.” This seems to be what has happened in the case of Bitcoin Cloud Services. Puppet currently has BCS listed under “Likely Ponzi scams that have yet to collapse,” and it’s unclear how long BCS will be able to keep up the charade. Up to this point, Puppet has been correct with 95 percent of his calls of a probable Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme. Bitcoin Magazine has reached out to BCS for comment."", 'In most jurisdictions, security deposits are intended to provide landlords with a financial guaranty against nonpayment of rent or excess damage to a rental property during tenancy. In the past the primary way to provide this guarantee has been for the tenant to deposit funds, in trust, with the landlord. The landlord takes custody, but not ownership of the funds. The obvious problem is that, aside from ethical and legal obligations, a landlord has no incentive to return a tenant’s security deposit - which is why almost everyone who has been a renter has a “they-didn’t-return-my- security-deposit” story.\n\nCustodial security deposits present the same problems as most custodial accounts. Custodial accounts are easy to “borrow” from. In the case of security deposits, the penalties for misuse of funds are comparatively low to the reward of keeping the money and most tenants will not actually sue to recover a deposit. While some jurisdictions require that landlords hold security deposits in a separate account, some don’t. In the end it really doesn’t matter whether the funds are in a separate account or not because they’re controlled solely by the landlord with little, if any, oversight by tenants or anyone else.\n\nUnfortunately, many landlords have a standard practice of not returning security deposits regardless of the condition of the premises. When the tenant receives a form notice that they’re not getting their deposit back, they’re faced with two choices: fight or walk away. Often the deposit amount simply isn’t enough to justify taking time away from work, traveling to a jurisdiction where they may no longer live, and presenting evidence before a court where success is never guaranteed. Undocumented residents and those hiding from domestic abusers cannot go to court to recover deposits. Regardless of the reason, many tenants simply walk away. Angry at the landlord. Angry at the system.\n\nWe can do better.\n\nUsing bitcoin’s multisignature address feature we can create a 2-of-3 address, where the tenant is a signer, the landlord is a signer, and a trusted disinterested third party holds the third key. In minutes, and from anywhere in the world, the tenant, landlord, and third party can combine public addresses to create a multi-signature address with a 2-of-3 signing configuration. Once the address is created, the tenant funds the address. All parties can verify on the public blockchain, within 10 minutes, that the funding has occurred and within about an hour the landlord can be confident that the funds will be there at the end of the term. Then nothing happens for a year. Or more. The landlord cannot misappropriate funds, as it takes two signers to move funds out of the account. At the end of the lease, the tenant creates a transaction transferring the entire deposit to another tenant-owned address. The tenant sends the transaction to the landlord for signing. If the property is damaged the landlord can send a counter transaction and ask the tenant to sign. The landlord and tenant can then negotiate among themselves. If they cannot reach agreement, they can get the third party signer involved.\n\nAlternatively, a transaction can be structured to acknowledge the most common scenario - where there is no damage to the premises and the deposit should be returned in-full to the tenant at the end of the lease. To make the deposit refundable by default, at the beginning of the term, both the landlord and tenant sign a transaction refunding the deposit at a future date. Bitcoin’s nLockTime feature allows them to create a post-dated transaction that cannot be processed before a stated date. By signing an nLockTime transaction, dated for the length of the lease plus 30 days, the landlord will have 30 days to make a claim and get the third party to override the transaction. A time-locked refund transaction shifts the burden of proof to the landlord, who must make a claim and prove damages in order to obtain deposit money. If the landlord and tenant agree to extend the lease, the funds can be relocked with two simple transactions.\n\nWith or without nLockTime, bitcoin’s multisignature addresses are superior to traditional custodial landlord accounts because they ensure landlords do not unlawfully commingle, keep, or spend the tenant’s funds. It balances the power between the parties and provides public oversight through the network. Importantly, the third party is not involved if the landlord and tenant agree on the refund amount themselves. This keeps costs down and encourages communication. Finally, the parties are still protected by traditional landlord/tenant laws and the third party would be required to follow those laws. This is one example of ensuring due process through technology.\n\nSo often in fintech we see solutions in search of problems. In this case, technology can quickly, easily, and cheaply solve a real problem for millions of renters. While in the short-term price volatility and the lack of incentive for landlords to adopt this solution may make it less likely to gain widespread adoption, neither minimize its potential. Bitcoin’s built-in multisignature feature can simultaneously protect landlords and tenants while righting the grossly imbalanced power dynamic between the two. With multisig you could actually get your security deposit back in-full without going to court. Imagine that! Photo modified from BTC Keychain / CC BY 2.0']"

A parent can use a 2-of-3 wallet with their child to moderate the child’s spending habits and ensure they don’t accidentally lose bitcoins to a virus. There are many more possibilities.”\n\nThe Copay multi-signature wallet provides a convenient flow for sending funds from shared wallets which small or co-owned business could greatly benefit from. For example, a small online business on e-commerce platforms such as E-Bay or Amazon could adopt the Copay wallet to combine the budget of the business into one shared wallet and then allocate the expenses through approvals from different departments of the company.Furthermore, the Copay multi-signature wallet brings the security of bitcoin wallet into a whole new level.\n\nEven if a bitcoin wallet service provider or exchange were ever compromised, the private keys would not be, so the possessed bitcoin would not be affected.Copay wallet is also the first bitcoin wallet to support the bitcoin testnet on both iOS and Windows Phones. This feature allows developers to create / test new bitcoin applications across different platforms with ease. This may also pave the way for additional blockchains to be added to the Copay wallet, including altcoins or other blockchains built on top of the bitcoin protocol such as Counterparty and ChainDB, another BitPay project.\n\nSecurity and Open Source\n\n“We’re serious about security and privacy. Not only is the Copay app open source, the server is too,” BitPay’s development team announced on BitPay’s official blog.\n\nThe development of Copay began in 2014, following research of Gallippi which stated that not a single account from the world’s top 100 richest bitcoin accounts was secured with multi-sig technology. With a vision to ease the process of securing wallets with multi-sig technology and to increase the number of multi-signature wallets globally, BitPay created Copay on bitcore on July 9, 2014.“I’d like to see 10 percent of bitcoin in existence stored in multi-signature wallets,” Gallippi said.\n\nWithin a few days after its launch, over 1000 BTC has been stored on Copay already and the open source code on GitHub is being contributed by hundreds of bitcoin developers worldwide, offering improvements in the code s and new features that could increase the east of use of the Copay wallet.', 'Whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is not a simple question to answer. With community discord that’s almost as hot-blooded as the block size debate, one will notice that even after delving into digital currency technicalities for months, there is just no general consensus on the profitability of cloud mining.\n\nFor those who are unaware, Cloud Mining is the process of Bitcoin mining utilizing remote servers with a shared pool of processing power owned by a Cloud Mining company. It sounds extremely convenient, but cloud mining can become a bit of a messy deal given the concept’s rough start.\n\nWe’ve heard it all before: companies disappear with user funds, paying out early investors once new ones join, and making a run for it weeks later, which leads the average investor from avoiding the common year-long contracts.\n\nOr the argument that Bitcoin is too volatile to start with, making the profits highly unpredictable. The investment required for personal bitcoin mining is risky on its own, so imagine that risk compounded when trusting a third party with your money.\n\nLone-Wolf Bitcoin Mining vs. Cloud Mining\n\nTo settle this dispute, CoinTelegraph spoke to parties on both sides of the bell-curve: Marshall Long, CTO of Cryptsy, and Alex Gromov of Hashflare. When asked about the benefits of cloud mining over normal mining, Long explained:\n\n“The reality is this. Many large scale miners, including Mintsy and FinalHash work very hard to get cheap electric rates. In fact these electricity rates can be worked down very low sometimes under US$0.02/kWh. Now the average rate for a “decent” price in the USA is around US$0.08/kWh. But because big miners can leverage their capital in a way that can convince Power Companies to give them great rates, this allows them to pass on savings AND profit to customers.”\n\nWhile Gromov raises another undisputable advantage: the price.\n\n“In case of a purchase the user is very limited in choice by the technical offer from the seller. As an example, let us suppose the cheapest machine that vendor offers — is a 1 TH/s miner. Even though at this moment the equipment has become much cheaper than a few years ago, you may see this option is not for everyone, especially if you are just getting started with Bitcoin. “In this case, it’s a lot easier to take advantage of cloud mining services, where you can find out what bitcoin mining is at a basic package of literally 10 GH/s equal to less than 5 dollars.”\n\nThe Current State of Cloud Mining\n\nThere’s no way around it: Cloud mining is going through rough days.\n\n“Many users, after having a bad experience, have lost faith in the possibility of fair mining in the cloud, and thus all new projects are now greeted with a great deal of skepticism,” adds Gromov.\n\nThis, however, could be good for entrepreneurs eager to plug the leaks in the outdated cloud mining model. To keep up with a consumer base that is more aware by the second, serious companies will need to become “far more transparent and the companies that don’t will fall to the way side,” says Long.\n\nMintsy, in an effort to protect users who are afraid of investing too much in cloud mining, have enabled them to sell user-to-user contracts on the website’s marketplace. Marshall argues that the point behind this resides in the fact that “when cloud mining companies empower their customer base utilizing new technologies everybody wins. An agile cloud mining company both has customer loyalty and the dynamics required to operate effectively in bitcoin.”\n\nSpotting the Ponzi Schemes\n\nHashflare.io has a simple answer to finding out whether or not the cloud company you’re interested in contracting with is a scam:\n\n“If you draw an analogy between recent projects that have deceived their clients and closed down, you will notice that they all share several traits: short lifespan and the promise of a very high ROI, such as 200-400% per year.”\n\nThis hype, which has little to do with actual mining, can be avoided if users invest instead in cloud mining companies that are also “a manufacturer of related equipment, such as: HashCoins for HashFlare, AntMiner for Hashnest, and KnC for KNC Cloud.”\n\nMintsy sees this a little bit differently, by employing proof-of-hashrate where customers can view “the blockchain and see proof that we have the hashrate we say we have and that we are running on full reserves and not double selling hashrate.”\n\nThe overall legality and regulation of Bitcoin cloud mining is still not clear, making it even more of a risky investment, but the technology behind most of the big companies listed above is interesting to say the least. While this is a very challenging time for legitimate cloud mining companies, it is very interesting to see healthy competition acting as a driving force behind the development of digital currency mining.', 'Several days of correction have the Bitcoin price drawing a flatline around $225 and 1400 CNY.

All accounts, assets and company documents have been handed over to the Swiss justice ministry and are under investigation.\n\nIn an open letter released on the official website of Bitmine AG, the company’s management claimed that Bitmine AG had tried to restructure its products and services by seeking new investments. It failed, however, to raise enough funding to continue its production of ASIC miners which led to the company’s bankruptcy.\n\nBitmine AG initially engaged in a contract with Innosilicon, a Chinese chip manufacturer to develop their 28nm ASIC. The company provided the manufacturer with explicit instructions, process of creating the mask, wafers and IC packaging concurrent to the one-year exclusivity agreement on the chip. However, Bitmine AG said it discovered that Innosilicon had violated the contract and sold the A1 chips itself.\n\nMoreover, the shipment of the A1 chips was delayed for a few months, and the majority of the chips were defective plus we do not know what bitcoin mining software was used.\n\n“Innosilicon repeatedly delivered us broken chips or \'junk grade\' ones as part of the purchased (and paid for) lots, forcing us to place ever bigger and bigger orders in order to fulfill our customers’ orders and eventually draining out most of the company’s money,"" Bitmine said. ""Out of all the ordered chips, a huge part of them were simply not working and could only be thrown away in the garbage bin.”\n\nBitmine also stated that the rapid increase of mining difficulty has been one of the core reasons why more than half of the customers canceled the orders.“If bitcoin was still valued at well over $1,000 like it was in the beginning of 2014, nobody would have tried to cancel his orders and we would all be rich,"" Bitmine AG said. ""Unfortunately, the BTC value collapsed constantly since Mt.Gox’s bust, and mining difficulty exploded to values that nobody was able to predict at the time we were selling our products.”\n\nLawsuits Filed Against Bitmine AG\n\nRegardless of the attempts of Bitmine AG to explain the company’s status to their furious customers, the ASIC miner developer began to face multiple lawsuits claiming defrauding since April, 2015.\n\nSince its presale of a new product called CoinCraft Series 28nm, customers of Bitmine AG did not receive a single mining rig for at least 2-3 months. The refund requests were ignored by the company while Bitmine AG continued to launch new products.\n\nCurrently, the company is charged with multiple lawsuits and will face its customers in court this month.', 'Augur, a fully-decentralized, open-source prediction market platform based on blockchain technology, intended to revolutionize forecasting, decision-making and the manner in which information consensus is collected and aggregated, has been selected as one of the five finalists in the ""Breakthrough"" category at the XCS Challenge at Exponential Finance 2015.\n\nThe Singularity University and CNBC hosted the Exponential Finance 2015 conference (New York, 2-3 June), which examines how rapidly accelerating technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, crowdfunding, digital currencies, and robotics are rapidly disrupting businesses throughout the financial industry.\n\nThe Singularity University, based at Moffett Federal Airfield in California and sponsored by high-profile high-tech firms including Google, is an educational center dedicated to world-changing applications of disruptive, exponentially accelerating technologies.\n\nAugur, a fully-decentralized, open-source prediction market platform based on blockchain technology and Ethereum, intended to revolutionize forecasting, decision making, and the manner in which information consensus is collected and aggregated, has been selected as one of the five finalists in the ""Breakthrough"" category at the XCS Challenge at Exponential Finance 2015.\n\n“Singularity U traditionally highlights the most innovative and cutting edge technology and we feel Augur definitely deserves to be here,” said Augur’s Marketing Director, Tony Sakich, to CoinTelegraph. “Prediction Markets have the potential to create more accurate forecasts in so many fields that the applications could go on for a long time. The most exciting immediate application is for political polling as Augur would enable the largest consensus of models possible.”\n\n“Harnessing the blockchain, Augur has created the first online platform for a global market of predictions,” states the Exponential Finance website. “Anybody can create a market for an event, and anyone can wager whether that event will occur or not.\n\n”Prediction markets harness the “wisdom of the crowds” to create powerful and uncensorable forecasting engines. “This is the future of forecasting,” says the Exponential Finance announcement.\n\nPrediction markets are speculative markets created for the purpose of making predictions. The current market price for a prediction – for example the election of a particular candidate – can be interpreted as an aggregate, crowdsourced estimate of the probability of the prediction. For example, if a prediction market security rewards a dollar if a particular candidate is elected, those who think the candidate had a 70 percent chance of being elected should be willing to pay up to 70 cents for the security.\n\nEvidence suggests that such financial incentives make prediction markets more effective than other forecasting strategies. The Iowa Electronic Markets typically predicts elections within one percent, more accurate than polls or expert opinions. Since 1988 it has correctly predicted the outcome of every U.S. presidential election. The Foresight Exchange, one of the oldest active prediction markets, is a public, play-money market allowing individuals to sign up for free and predict the future.\n\nPrediction markets had a moment of fame in 2003, when the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a proposed futures exchange developed by the United States\' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), was canceled after a wave of accusations of incentivizing terrorism, which resulted in the resignation of John Poindexter, head of the DARPA unit responsible for developing the project.\n\n""The idea of a federal betting parlor on atrocities and terrorism is ridiculous, and it\'s grotesque,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden.\n\nThe PAM was inspired by the work of George Mason University economist Robin Hanson, a leading researcher in the field, co-creator of the Foresight Exchange, and author of a seminal paper on “Idea Futures,” who is now one of the Augur advisors. Hanson explains his ideas on prediction markets and Augur in a short video posted on the Augur website.\n\nAccording to Hanson, real money markets such as the Iowa Electronic Markets – and Wall Street – predict election outcomes better than opinion polls. Referring to previous regulatory obstacles encountered by prediction markets such as PAM, Hanson notes that all of our familiar financial instruments: stocks, insurance, commodity futures, options were once forbidden by anti-gambling laws.', 'Gymnut, the first peer-to-peer app connecting people and trainers, is now accepting bitcoin for its in-app store. Gymcoins, the prepaid store tokens, will allow users to pay for specialized workouts and more through the app. Gymnut’s founders are scientists pursuing their PhDs who realized that the best way to counter the rise of chronic disease was through focus on proactive health and tangibles like exercise, nutrition and lifestyle combined with technology that allows connection for personal training. The underlying principles of personal training encompass goal-setting, motivation, personalized workouts, nutrition plans, accountability and tracking to drive behavioral change.\n\nCurrent personal training models are badly broken. Similar to the analogy of outdated banking software stifling commercial models, large gyms have a monopoly over personal training, which take large cuts from trainers and make client retention difficult because of the high premiums they are forced to charge. The rise in online training and peer-to-peer commerce has offered trainers the freedom to build a career independent of centralized gyms or organizations while leveraging social media.Gymnut is a social fitness app on a mission to redefine training by connecting fitness enthusiasts with a community of trainers and fellow gym nuts dedicated to improving health and fitness. Gymnut empowers trainers to build and monetize their followings by offering workouts and training plans through an iTunes likeworkout store, which lets users find exactly what they are looking for from curated workouts personalized for different goals, for prices as low as $0.99.\n\nGymnut has integrated BitPay’s API on their app to allow customers to top up their account with bitcoin.\n\nGymnut is also a premium sponsor of the #ProofOfWorkout 30-day challenge, encouraging participants to share their stats for a chance to win store credits.\n\n#ProofOfWorkout\n\nThe #ProofOfWorkout 30-Day Challenge has expanded to over 90 participants with each person sharing their progress on social media. Organizer, Emily Vaughn, expressed her excitement over participant engagement stating, “We hoped for 50 participants and expected much less. To have just under 100 people getting fit with bitcoin is an inspiring turnout, so we’ve been brainstorming on how to create more value for these challengers and keep them motivated.”\n\nWhat keeps everyone so engaged? The answer lies in how they stay connected. #ProofOfWorkout encourages participants to use social media to set a unique goal and share progress for that goal with a worldwide community. The proof of work comes from making progress known to the community of challengers by sharing workout statistics and action shots. #ProofOfWorkout and its sponsors, like Gymnut, incentive challengers with bitcoin-funded Gyft cards and redeemable prizes.Being a social fitness app, Gymnut captures the core principles behind #proofofworkout – that by sharing progress, motivating, and keeping each other accountable, participants have better success at establishing healthy habits.\n\nWith the #ProofOfWorkout Challenge coming to an end June 9th, this week is closing out the challenge with “Share Your Stats!” Three challengers can win $25 towards the Gymnut store by sharing screenshots of their fitness app after a hard workout. The final prize of a $100 Gyft card to Nike remains for the five most active participants.', 'Apple said in January that 2015 would be “the year of Apple Pay.” A recent Reuters report suggests otherwise, however. According to an interview with retailers, as the payment system is approaching the end of its first year, many don’t see the demand for the platform.\n\nApple’s contactless payment system has gained some traction with financial institutions and merchants, although according to the recent survey the percentage of acceptance is small. Reuters surveyed 98% of retailers from the National Retail Federation’s list of the top 100 U.S retailers. Less than a quarter accept Apple Pay, while nearly two thirds said they would not be using the service this year.\n\nThe biggest reason cited by merchants was ""insufficient customer demand."" Customers are not using the product, they said. Another concern with Apple was that it wasn’t granting merchants access to customer data.\n\nTwenty-eight total retailers confirmed that because there is no available customer research, they won\'t accept Apple Pay. According to one anonymous business surveyed, Apple has been pushing its mobile payment service, even when companies tell Apple they have no plans to accept their form of payment. The business stated:\n\n“They have been pushing hard and it’s been that way for months. They have called and tried to persuade us even after we communicated our decision to them.”\n\nSome retailers said they were content with the service, and that customers who did use Apple Pay said they were happy about its acceptance by the store. Whole Foods confirmed that its shoppers were pleased with the “speed, convenience, and security” of the platform. The company showed that 2% of its sales in March were accounted for by Apple Pay.\n\nThe retail giant Walmart conflicted with Apple\'s system in the past and repeated its previous opinion. A senior executive for the company said that Walmart\'s issue with Apple Pay is the lack of data control. Most credit card company data is far more accessible than Apples. Walmart is a supporter of CurrenC, however, which they say provides more sufficient data.\n\nApple continues to advertise the service as the top payment processor of the future, and they cite increasing retail acceptance so far at over 700,000 locations. Apple told the IOS online publication Imore:\n\n“There\'s tremendous momentum from not only large retailers but also Main street merchants, with payment service providers telling us they\'re seeing unprecedented demand from small and medium businesses nationwide.""\n\nThe California tech giant has gained quite the slice of profit from its merchant and bank acceptance. Hundreds of institutions jumped on Apple Pay early, scared they might lose the fresh market. Banks and credit card companies agreed to pay Apple 0.15% per credit card transaction. For debit cards, Apple collects 0.5%. Despite Apple’s profits, many retailers are not willing to use Apple’s service due to reports of customer demand being low. The year 2015 may not belong to Apple Pay, after all.', 'For Bitcoiners, Purse.io seems to be one of the best options for spending Bitcoin for goods, as Amazon carries almost anything you would want to buy. In addition to the ability to spend Bitcoin on Amazon products, Purse.io allows you to choose a discount rate between 1-50%. However, since Purse acts as an escrow service, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to get a 50% discount on anything. In past transactions with Purse, I’ve gotten up to a 35% discount on items that were less than $10, 30% off of items that were less than $30, and 25% off of anything higher than that. In general, the higher you set your discount, the longer it’s going to take to get your item. Purse.io works by providing an escrow service between two irreversible transactions, an Amazon purchase (once shipped, it cannot be stopped) and a Bitcoin transaction. When a shopper spends their Bitcoin, it is held in escrow until they confirm the shipment of items, at which point it is released to the buyer of the Amazon order.\n\nDisclaimer: The author received no funds from Purse or special incentive to conduct this review.\n\nAlso read: Is Bitcoin Better than Gold? Part One: Transaction Costs and Centralization\n\nPurse Instant\n\nPurse has an option for instant purchase, made either directly by Purse. Purse Instant allows you to get a 5% discount on any purchase, as well as have the order filled. With the purchases I’ve made on Purse with discounts of over 25%, I’ve had to wait for over a day for a couple of them to fill. If you need your item incredibly fast, purchase something that is eligible for Prime and use Purse Instant, otherwise it isn’t worth setting a higher discount. Purse Instant is for buyers that want to spend Bitcoin on Amazon stuff and get it in 2 days. In my experience, your item will only take two more days to arrive with a 25% discount, which is worth it if you aren’t in a rush.\n\nFor my test of Purse Instant, I purchased a new Star Wars shirt (in time for Star Wars day!). The order was very straight forward, and after placing it, it was filled within 5 minutes. The item shipped that very day and arrived on time as expected. I am super happy with my shirt, and, in this case, Purse Instant was essential to get the shirt before Star Wars day. While I own more than one Star Wars shirt, it’s always nice to have another. Purse Instant works as you would expect, and is probably more reliable than the “choose your discount” transactions, since the buyers are Purse staff. I had an issue with a “choose your discount” purchase a while back, in which the buyer didn’t buy one of the items on the spend order. Purse.io staff took longer than expected (and the 24-hour respond time stated on their website), but when they did respond it was quick and decisive. Purse.io has special software that can tell if an item wasn’t purchased through Amazon, so there is no clear way to cheat the system or another user. The issue between the buyer and I was resolved in a way that satisfied both parties.\n\nChoose Your Discount\n\nThis is where Purse.io really shines. The ability to get up to 35% off of a purchase is incredible. Pair Purse.io with Circle, and you can purchase BTC with your bank account for free and then use that Bitcoin to save a ton on your purchases. Best of all, with Purse, you don’t even need to hold an Amazon Prime subscription, as most buyers have Prime. For the test transaction for the “choose your discount” method of purchase, I bought a very high-end travel mug, by Contigo. I chose a 30% discount off of the $20 list price. After waiting a couple of days, the order filled for just over $15 for me, a 30% saving off the original Amazon price. This transaction went without a problem, and I received my mug two days after the order filled, for a total wait time of 4 days and over $5 in savings, just by spending Bitcoin.\n\nI am very happy with this purchase; my mug keeps coffee hot for 7 hours, or cold drinks cold for 17 hours. This mug was a lifesaver for Finals Week, providing the fuel needed to study hard.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Purse.io is an incredible option for spending your Bitcoin, if you can wait, opt for a high discount. If you need the item ASAP, opt for Purse Instant, but know that you will miss out on some big savings. If you are looking for a good use of your Bitcoin for purchasing goods, Purse.io is an excellent option.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about Purse.io? Comment below!\n\nImages via Purse.io and Drew Cordell.\n\nThis author’s views do not necessarily reflect those of BTC.com\n\nOriginally posted on: Purse.io: Purse Instant and Choose Your Discount Review', 'CoinTelegraph spoke with the co-founder and COO of Eris Industries, Preston Byrne, on why the company decided to leave the UK and move its operations to the United States.\n\nAs reported in May, Eris Industries has ordered its staff to leave the United Kingdom due to the proposed UK’s Investigatory Powers bill, which the company says gives the government “completely unnecessary” surveillance powers on data.\n\n“This is a red line for us, and should be for every blockchain firm. Distributed systems don\'t work without secure cryptography.” — Preston Byrne\n\nCoinTelegraph: What does Eris Industries do?\n\nPreston Byrne: Eris Industries makes free, open-source developer tools that allow people to create, manage, and administer their own, permissioned blockchains. Anyone, anywhere can use our tools, completely free of charge, and without our express permission, knowledge or consent.\n\nPermissioned chains aren\'t about money: they\'re about being useful in managing data on a distributed network, without the need for a central server or dedicated, specialized hardware. What we do shouldn\'t, therefore, really be thought of in terms of cryptocurrency. MySQL would be a more appropriate analogy.\n\nCT: How will UK’s Investigatory Powers bill affect your operations?\n\nPB: Before I get into this point, we are fully aware that the draft bill has not yet been released. However, it is common practice for British governments to informally float controversial proposals in the press before introducing them as legislation. We made our decision based on the content of a report in the Telegraph which was consistent with the prior statements of both David Cameron and Theresa May, in public forum, to the effect that:\n\nA) the UK would mandate state-mandated backdoors in all cryptography; and\n\nB) the UK would require all telecommunications providers to retain user data for 12 months\' duration.\n\nAs for the crypto ban, given the Telegraph\'s reporting, the prime minister\'s comments in January of 2015 that ""we must not allow a means of communication between people ... that we cannot read,"" and the government\'s failure to issue even a very simple denial (which would have ended the discussion immediately), we are proceeding on the basis that this proposal, or one like it, is contemplated for the as-yet unreleased draft Investigatory Powers bill.\n\nWe could say a lot about the wisdom of such a proposal, but Cory Doctorow\'s rebuttal in the Guardian will almost certainly put it better: ""\'Weak crypto\' is like \'slightly fatal.\'"" This is a red line for us, and should be for every blockchain firm. Distributed systems don\'t work without secure cryptography.\n\n“[I]t is likely that [companies] could, at some point in the future, be classified [as telecommunications providers] if blockchain databases become routinely used.”\n\nAs to data retention, the blockchains we make are run by their users (or can be administered by a portion of them) to provide a web interface-type, highly resilient, global service without the use of a central server or ISP. It is thus likely that a blockchain system (and each blockchain system) is a ""telecommunication system"" within the meaning of s. 4 of the Telecommunications Act 1984.\n\nCompanies providing blockchain communications as a service (BSaaS) may therefore fall within the ambit of any definition of ""telecommunications provider"" within the draft Communications Data bill from January and, therefore, also within the scope of the Investigatory Powers bill. Even if they don\'t straight out of the gate, it is likely that they could, at some point in the future, be so classified if blockchain databases become routinely used.\n\nBeing classified thus would involve an obligation to retain user information for a year. This would be onerous from an administrative perspective, and extremely expensive to implement — one British web hosting provider, UKFast, estimated its up-front compliance costs for this provision alone to be £30 million. Retention obligations would furthermore complicate our data protection obligations, and introduce the security state into the very core of our business.\n\n“[I]t would be easier to do business from Antarctica: we could get just as much done with none of the cost and associated operations risk.”\n\nAssuming we could get a reliable broadband connection, it would be easier to do business from Antarctica: we could get just as much done with none of the cost and associated operations risk. Plus, we could hang out with penguins, and penguins rock.\n\nCT: What other businesses have also left, or are threatening to leave, if this bill passes?\n\nPB: So far we know of only one: Ind.ie, a privacy-oriented social networking service.\n\nI suspect people think Eris was jumping the gun or overreacting when we announced our departure. In truth, we made up our minds six months ago — as reported by the Guardian — and had actually thought the Communications Data bill had gone away for good.\n\nEris is unique among crypto firms (and tech firms more generally) in that both our CEO, Casey Kuhlman, and I are trained lawyers who were very recently active in private practice. We both geeked out on the draft Communications Data bill when it first was published six months ago, and almost immediately ascertained that its passage was not in our commercial interests.\n\nBy announcing our intent to depart, we sought to alert other IT businesses to the scale of the commercial threat, and spur them to pay very close attention to the bill once it\'s introduced and to undertake a full impact assessment. We figured it was important to get out in front of this and set the narrative before the government could.\n\n“It doesn\'t take a political radical to see that this kind of architecture is ripe for abuse, and that this bill will put the surveillance state at the very heart of British daily life.”\n\nCT: Besides cryptocurrency-related companies, what other businesses will be affected, and how?\n\nPB: Virtually any technology where a communications service is provided to a user. See Ind.ie\'s announcement of its departure. If the reporting is accurate, virtually everything (text messages, emails, browsing histories, instant messaging services), everywhere, relating to everyone would be covered.\n\nIt doesn\'t take a political radical to see that this kind of architecture is ripe for abuse, and that this bill will put the surveillance state at the very heart of British daily life. As I said, I\'d rather do business from Antarctica than live like that.\n\nCT: When will it be decided if the bill passes, and is there a concerted effort (lobbyists, petitions, etc.) to kill the bill?\n\nPB: We don\'t know. It shouldn\'t take much: 10 courageous and principled Tory rebels, plus a three-line whip from all the parties in opposition, will do the trick.\n\nIf the rebels organize themselves quickly enough, this bill may yet be stillborn. If, however, the government does introduce it, we know that the Scottish National Party and the Lib Dems (at minimum) plan to oppose it. We\'d hope that Labour, though presently in disarray, would do the same. Multiple civil liberties organizations, including the Open Rights Group and Big Brother Watch, have made public statements against it, as have a number of peers in the House of Lords.\n\n“[N]obody really wants [this bill] — but they\'re just being British and \'hanging on in quiet desperation,\' even though they\'re really extremely unhappy.”\n\nTo be honest with you, I can\'t find a single intelligent person outside of the security or military apparatus who supports this legislation. There are no thought pieces in the press exhorting the UK public to accept more intrusive surveillance. That leads me to believe that nobody really wants it — but they\'re just being British and ""hanging on in quiet desperation,"" even though they\'re really extremely unhappy. To this, I\'d say only that there are times when it\'s OK to be a little impolite to authority, and this is clearly one of them.\n\nCT: Who in particular is pushing this within the UK government? Who is against it?\n\nPB: We don\'t know. In favor? The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary and whoever is advising them, I suppose. Against? We\'ve heard other government departments are skeptical, but that nobody\'s been paying attention to it and the bill came as a surprise, so nobody has yet built a cogent business case against it.\n\nCT: Why the U.S.? Why not other cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdictions, for example?\n\nPB: Our tech doesn\'t involve cryptocurrency or decentralized value transfer, so ""crypto-friendliness,"" as most people understand it, is really a moot point.\n\nAdmittedly, Germany is the best destination from a crypto-regulatory perspective. However, on balance, commercial considerations make the U.S. our preferred alternative to the UK for now.\n\n“[M]ore than half of [Britons] say they would use the Internet less if they knew they were being watched.”\n\nCT: What will it take for you to return to the UK?\n\nPB: Although we\'re UK-incorporated and have our offices there, we run the company on a distributed basis and move around — a lot. This question really means, ""Where do you want to make your next hires, grow, and set down roots?""\n\nLondon is a great city — I\'ve lived in Britain for 13 years (first Scotland, then England), and consider it home. However, this proposal has really put me off — sort of like that one friend of yours who gets too drunk one evening and behaves really inappropriately, such that you never look at them in the same way again. I confess that it\'s kind of nice being back in America where CCTV isn\'t absolutely everywhere.\n\nWe\'d have to discuss it as a company, but in my personal view, this illiberal bill would need to be cast back into the void whence it came. It doesn\'t deserve to become law. Polls show Britons don\'t think the government has justified additional surveillance powers by a margin of 20 to 1, with more than half of them saying they would use the Internet less if they knew they were being watched.\n\nI\'ve yet to see favorable press coverage of the bill, if it exists. And practically every security professional I have seen quoted — anywhere — states that this legislation is not only a bad idea, but one which is completely daft.\n\nThis legislation is clearly incompatible with a free society. It\'s my hope my friends and colleagues in Britain will see it the same way.']"
06/07/2015,"['According to the mainstream press, Bitcoin has died…Many, many times. That’s why Jordan Tuwiner started Bitcoin Obituaries – to compile the many obituaries which have been written about the nascent cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\nHe had noticed a preponderance of articles claiming Bitcoin would soon be gone..\n\n“I wanted to collect the articles and make a monument showing Bitcoin’s resilience. I knew the site would be funny, but also shows Bitcoin’s strength over time,” Tuwiner told Cryptocoins News.\n\nTuwiner’s favorite obituary is called “So, That’s the End of Bitcoin Then”. The obituary states:\n\n“Bitcoins aren’t secure, as both the recent theft and this password problem show. They’re not liquid, nor a store of value, as the price collapse shows and if they’re none of those things then they’ll not be a great medium of exchange either as who would want to accept them? . . . It’s difficult to see what the currency has going for it.”\n\n“Bitcoin is up 1,590% since this obituary was published,” Tuwiner tells CCN.\n\nAs for who would want to accept them?\n\n“Microsoft, Newegg, Overstock,” he points out.\n\nTuwiner has found a common thread from one obituary to the next.\n\n“The authors have no understanding of how Bitcoin works or basic economics,” he tells CCN. “Take the first sentence from the obituary above: ‘Bitcoins aren’t secure, as both the recent theft and this password problem show.’ Bitcoin itself is quite possibly the most secure currency in history. You can securely store it yourself. Third party exchanges lead to theft. Not Bitcoin.”\n\nIn another obituary from 2011, Why Bitcoin Will Fail as a Currency, the author claims: “And thanks to hoarding and attrition, we can be sure that it will eventually serve as nothing more than a collector’s item.”\n\nJordan doesn’t it see it this way.\n\n“Bitcoin would be worthless without ‘hoarders.’ Hoarders prevent Bitcoin from becoming a collector’s item,” he says.\n\nWith 71 obituaries currently published on the website, Tuwiner expects there will be many more. Individuals are encouraged to send in obituaries they’ve found through the website’s submit page.\n\nThe first Bitcoin death, according to Tuwiner, was December 15, 2010. Salon, Wired, Financial and Business Insider have all written the most amount of Bitcoin obituaries.\n\nPeople have liked his idea.\n\n“The response has been overwhelmingly positive. BO has been on the front of /r/bitcoin a bunch of times, and featured on CNN, The Guardian, CNBC, and Engadget.”\n\nTuwiner recently launched No Third Party. He defends Bitcoin to this day, despite having a keen insight of Bitcoin’s many deaths…\n\n“The beauty of Bitcoin is that there is no barrier to entry,” he tells CCN. “Anyone in the world can join and use the Bitcoin network. A Bitcoin wallet is the gateway to the network.”\n\nThus, he continues his work in Bitcoin with No Third Party.\n\n“NTP’s wallet overviews explain each wallet’s features, with a focus on privacy and security. It needs to be easy for users to understand how their money and identity are protected.”\n\nWhat has he learned from all the Bitcoin obituaries?\n\n“The most important thing to take from Bitcoin Obituaries is: don’t panic,” Tuwiner said.\n\n“It’s still early, and not a single person knows Bitcoin’s future. Use the tech and don’t invest more than you can lose. Sit back and watch as Bitcoin changes the world.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '— Top nav — Blockchain 101 – Bitcoin – – What is Bitcoin? – – How Can I Buy Bitcoin? – – How Does Bitcoin Mining Work? – – How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work? – – How Can I Sell Bitcoin? – Blockchain – – What is Blockchain Technology? – – How Does Blockchain Technology Work? – – What Can a Blockchain Do? – – What is a Distributed Ledger? – – Why Use a Blockchain? – Ethereum – – What is Ethereum? – – How Do I Use Ethereum? – – How Does Ethereum Work? – – What is a Decentralized Application? – – How Do Smart Contracts Work?

The reports also claim that each investor has injected over $1,000 into the Bitcoin Capital, for which they are offered a 50% equity in the fund.\n\nA third part of the generated funds are promised to be invested in Bitcoin Capital’s Bitcoin mining rig in Iceland, a place which will also make sure that investors get to receive daily dividends in the form of newly-minted Bitcoins. This step is planned to ensure speedy investment returns for the investors, something that puts Bitcoin Capital’s plan in an altogether different category, as it seems.\n\nBut more than its promises, the VC fund is riding high on its backer’s reputation in the market. Max Keiser is known to be one of the most celebrated faces in the finance sector, for his previous professional collaborations with BBC News, Al Jazeera, Resonance FM and Huffington Post. He currently works for the last two, and also hosts a self-branded financial program on RT, titled Keiser Report.\n\nHis activism for the cryptocurrency sector however was something that earned him a reputation inside the Bitcoin sector. He supported the idea of decentralization when every government and bank was rubbishing it right away.\n\n“I have been critical of the traditional financial system for many years on my show” Keiser said. “I was the first global news outlet to cover bitcoin when it was trading at $3, recognizing its potential to change the world. Many startups in the bitcoin space credit Keiser Report for getting them started in the business. Bitcoin Capital allows the founders and investors to experiment with new crypto financial business models and currencies to transform global finance.”\n\nKeiser later was involved in a couple of cryptocurrency-based startups, the last being StartJOIN, a crypto crowdfunding business model rumored to be receiving support from the Bitcoin Capital VC Fund in the near future. The fund however will keep its priority on growth oriented blockchain startups that are in need of expert and financial consultations.\n\n“I would hate if the end result is that we produce a cheaper, better way for traditional financial institutions to rig the markets cheaper – but I think the true power is for individuals using Bitcoin on a peer-to-peer basis,” Keiser’s partner in the project and the CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com, Simon Dixon stated.', ""Out of the buzz surrounding Bitcoin has come unique journalism and multimedia. Over the course of cryptocurrencies’ beginnings, many podcasts, radio broadcasts, and YouTube shows have appeared around the same time, giving listeners and viewers information on Bitcoin and many other subjects in a new way. Each show has added its own color and new voices to the decentralized community.\n\nCoinTelegraph wanted to provide an inside glimpse of some of the industry's most popular crypto-related broadcasts and podcasts. We asked hosts to tell us how they came to create their shows, how they began talking about Bitcoin, what types of topics they cover, and what some of their most memorable guests and moments have been.\n\nMad Bitcoins\n\n— Hosted by Thomas Hunt.

Much like the MP3 was better than the CD, Bitcoin is better than fiat currency. It’s only a matter of time before everyone else figures that out too.” — Thomas Hunt\n\nThomas Hunt: I’d always known about Bitcoin, but I was never really involved until I saw the price spike to US$250 in April 2013 after the Cyprus collapse. I suddenly realized all these companies had grown up around Bitcoin and had made it incredibly useable. It was then that I decided to do anything I could to help spread the word about Bitcoin.\n\nSubjects include cryptography, money, banking, and math — as heady topics. With the MadBitcoins show, I try to make short entertaining videos to help lighten the mood around Bitcoin. I believe the best way to educate someone is to entertain them first.\n\nThe blockchain is like Pandora’s box. Now that it’s open, there’s no going back. Much like the MP3 was better than the CD, Bitcoin is better than fiat currency. It’s only a matter of time before everyone else figures that out too.\n\nThe Crypto Show\n\n— Hosted by Chris Neanderthal, Harlan Dietrich and Danny Sumthin. Listen on Texas Liberty Radio at 89.1fm in Austin, 8pm to 10pm Central, find archives and learn more at TheCryptoShow.com.\n\n“Our ‘Crypto’ radio is so apt because it captures so many important and not unrelated ideas, such as cryptocurrency, underground movements, and anarchist thinking.” — Chris Neanderthal\n\nChris Neanderthal: The radio broadcast emerged around March of 2014 out of a local Bitcoin meetup and the first annual Texas Bitcoin Conference. The show was Harlan's (creator of Brave New Books) brainchild, borne of his recognition of the burgeoning revolutionary significance of decentralized, disruptive, open-source technologies. Our “Crypto” radio is so apt because it captures so many important and not unrelated ideas, such as cryptocurrency, underground movements, anarchist thinking, and the “cryptocracy” (that is, hidden powers behind, and machinations of the State).\n\nTopics include 3D printing, anarchism and agorism, the Austrian School of Economics, natural health remedies, media manipulation and psychological warfare, alternative interpretations of historical and current events, esotericism, and anything else that we find credible and relevant.\n\nWe have had the great privilege and good fortune of having excellent, thought-provoking guests almost without exception, including Lyn Ulbricht and Cody Wilson. One of our favorite recent guests was bravetheworld.com's Julia Tourianski, who is simply brilliant and whose no-holds-barred attitude, dynamism, and passion I find infectious and inspiring.\n\nThe Crypto Show probably wouldn't have had its long list of illustrious guests without the connections, networking skills, and personal savvy of our co-host, Danny. We also wouldn't have the coolest logo in all of radio without one of our other favorite guests, Crypto-Graphics.com\n\nDecentralize.FM\n\n— Hosted by Eric Martindale of Bitpay, James Walpole of Bitpay and Tony Sakich of Augur. Visit decentralize.fm, subscribe via Soundcloud or follow on Twitter @DecentralizeAll.\n\nEric Martindale: Back in September of 2014, we were all working at BitPay and were very passionate about Bitcoin and decentralization in general. We wanted to start something with a more broad scope than just Bitcoin, or even cryptocurrency, as we felt that there were already enough content producers talking about Bitcoin — so we committed to expanding our subject matter to everything decentralized, and believe us, everything can be decentralized!\n\nWe really like to go beyond the scope of bitcoin and politics, and discuss how decentralization applies to other topics; decentralized governance, alternative market structures, intellectual property, anything that has single points of failure, or centralization due to stagnation. We want our listeners to know the merits that decentralization brings, and encourage them to think about how to decentralize more than just finance.\n\nThe interview we did with musician and producer Steve Albini was spectacular, as he shared some outside perspective that a lot of people in Bitcoin, or even the crypto community at large, often don’t get the chance to hear. Ryan X. Charles’ insight into Reddit’s crypto-equity endeavors and Glenn Jacobs’ (that’s Kane from the WWE!) libertarian philosophy were both fascinating subjects to cover, but all of our guests have been truly fantastic. It’s really incredible to see the breadth of perspectives from so many different industries!\n\nDe Week van Bitcoin (The Week of Bitcoin)\n\n— Host: Paul Buitink. Watch on YouTube and subscribe to get notified when new episodes come out. Want to join the weekly live show? Follow them on Google+.\n\nPaul Buitink: I was so enthusiastic about bitcoin that I wanted to share my excitement and journey with others. I'm a big fan of the sharing economy and letting knowledge flow freely. Since I'm Dutch and there did not exist a Dutch audio or video channel yet about Bitcoin, I started with a Dutch show together with Tuur Demeester in November 2013.\n\nOver time, we've had dozens of interesting guests and subject material, basically all the main players from the industry, but also many people from the alternative money space at large, like gold experts and contrarian economists. I've personally always been most interested in the currency/money aspect of bitcoin, although all the other applications and blockchain technology in general interest me a lot as well.\n\nWe've had many interesting guests over the years. Our most popular show was with Andreas Antonopoulos with almost 12K views. It also featured a range of co-hosts and lots of live questions from the audience. It was a memorable show.\n\nLet’s Talk Bitcoin\n\n— Hosts: Adam B. Levine, Andreas Antonopoulos and Stephanie Murphy. Listen on LetsTalkBitcoin.com or Soundcloud, where you can listen to all of the shows in the Let’s Talk Bitcoin! Network. iOS users can install the Let's Talk Bitcoin! App that lets you download and play podcasts, read articles, participate in community forums and participate in an audience rewards program.\n\n“I started a Bitcoin podcast because at the time there weren't any and I think listening to someone talk about something is a more natural way to learn than reading an article or a paper on it.” — Adam B. Levine\n\nAdam B. Levine: I started a Bitcoin podcast because at the time there weren't any and I think listening to someone talk about something is a more natural way to learn than reading an article or a paper on it. There were all of these brilliant technically minded people who were working on technologies that have the potential to change everything, but if you wanted to understand it and your brain didn't work the same way, it was like trying to learn another language with cantankerous native speakers. I published the first episode of Let's Talk Bitcoin in late April 2013. It was the fifth bitcoin podcast I'd started and the first one I'd consider a success.\n\nLetsTalkBitcoin.com is what I like to call an experimental community platform. It's where we try out new technologies and tools with real users who are doing things that in a few years will be normal at every other website. Because of that, I've actually taken steps that most consider anti-growth because we just haven't been ready for much larger of an audience than the hardcore early adopters in our community who might not yet understand where we're going, but have liked the ride so far. The Let's Talk Bitcoin! show and network involve about 20 people currently. We're almost entirely powered by volunteers, myself included.\n\nAlthough they weren't happy events, I have fond memories of several multi-day collaborative investigations with David Perry, Charlie Shrem and others after the Mt. Gox collapse that produced interesting and useful results."", 'Taringa!, Argentina’s largest social network, has seen an average increase of 40% in content creation since the integration of bitcoin last month.\n\nOn April 21, Taringa! launched an initiative called Taringa! Creadores, which enables users worldwide to receive the payments for ad revenues and incentives in bitcoin. Within days of its launch, Taringa! received thousands of requests from existing users. As PR manager Agustina Fourquet told CoinTelegraph on April 23:\n\n“We have users in all Latin America, the U.S. and Spain. The first day that Taringa! Creadores was launched, in less than 24 hours, without any kind of marketing or broadcasting, 2,000 users sent us mails interested in participating.”\n\nSimilar to YouTube, incentives are based on the “social value” of user-generated content. Users also have the ability to tip other content creators in bitcoin. Since Taringa! Creadores is still in beta, however, the bitcoin initiative currently supports no more than 2,000 invited users, selected based on their popularity as content providers.\n\nAll 2,000 Taringa! Creadores users received a Xapo wallet and then received payments in bitcoin for their advertising revenues and incentives based on the social value of their content. They are also allowed to tip each other with bitcoin, along with the daily points they can disperse throughout the network. The issued points can be converted to bitcoin and ultimately can be cashed out as Argentinian pesos.\n\nUnlike previous traditional payment platforms, most notably PayPal, the users are not required to wait for a certain period of time, or pay transaction or conversion fees for their ad revenues. Instead, Taringa! Creadores sends the payments directly and instantaneously to the Xapo Wallet, allowing users to either cash out to their native currency, or keep the bitcoins, hoping to see a short-term increase in the value of bitcoin.\n\nThe speed and the low costs of bitcoin transactions has encouraged users to create more content, causing a surge of content creation growth. In a blog post, Taringa! Co-Founder Hernan Botbol stated:\n\n""We have always wanted to offer a financial reward to our users because we believe that it is fair. We want more people to publish on Taringa! and devote their time exclusively for Taringa!”\n\nAccording to OroyFinanzas.com, Botbol believes that Taringa! Creadores will support millions of users by 2016, as he explained, ""If bitcoin will someday achieve widespread adoption, it surely will in Argentina.”', 'We have been covering a lot about the Indian Bitcoin ecosystem for a while now, and in a recent post we have discussed the various features offered by prominent Indian Bitcoin start-ups in an attempt to get more people to adopt and use Bitcoin in their day-to-day transactions.\n\nZebpay is one such Indian Bitcoin company which has made the process of Bitcoin transfer as easy as sending instant messages on WhatsApp or WeChat. Zebpay has recently started selling cash vouchers for e-commerce sites, which can be bought using Bitcoin. This way, the company is allowing its customers to indirectly use Bitcoin for shopping on selected Indian online stores.\n\nIn a recent communication with Sandeep Goenka, one of the founders of Zebpay, we were informed that the company is planning to sell prepaid mobile credits for Bitcoin in the near future. We asked him a couple of questions regarding Zebpay’s new features and more. This is what he had to say-\n\nNewsBTC: What influenced Zebpay to offer its customers the option of buying Flipkart and Amazon vouchers with Bitcoin?\n\nSandeep: One of Bitcoin’s promises is to get the unbanked at par with the privileged rest of us. At Zebpay, we are working hard to fulfil this promise. In the first phase, we developed a mobile-only simple Bitcoin app targeted at regular people. Now in the second phase of our company, we are working hard to solve specific user needs.\n\nMillions of Indians do not have credit / debit cards and are unable to participate in the e-commerce revolution in the country. However, now a Zebpay user can buy Bitcoin with his bank account and use them to buy vouchers of popular Indian e-commerce companies like Flipkart, Amazon, MakeMyTrip, BookMyShow, Dominos and more. Not only that, he will get 10% off on these vouchers, so he can buy, for example, a Flipkart voucher of INR 1,000 for INR 900 only via Bitcoin using Zebpay.\n\nNewsBTC: How does it work?\n\nSandeep: Inside the Zebpay Android or iPhone application, a user can click on “Shop” on the home screen. He’ll then be able to see a list of vouchers that are available for purchase in his country. When he clicks on a voucher of his choice, he will see the price of the voucher after discount which is usually between 5-10%. He will also see the amount, in Bitcoin needed at the current exchange rate to buy the voucher. The user then clicks on “buy” and enters his 4 digit PIN to confirm the purchase. The respective amount in Bitcoin will be transferred from his Zebpay wallet and he receives a message with a voucher code. The user can use this code to shop on these e-commerce sites.\n\nThe above process takes less than a minute.\n\nNewsBTC: How was Flipkart’s reception towards this move? Do you think Flipkart and other e-commerce players in India will adopt Bitcoin as one of the payment options anytime soon?\n\nSandeep: The vouchers we sell are from 3rd party resellers which are appointed by these companies and the company is not directly involved. Rakuten, which is Japan’s biggest online store like Amazon and Flipkart started accepting Bitcoin 2 months back.\n\nMerchants pay anywhere between 1-5% or even higher to accept credit card payments. As I mentioned, in India, millions of users do not have credit / debit cards unlike many Western countries. Online companies are struggling due to the lower adoption of credit/debit cards in the country. Everyone knows how Uber is struggling and experimenting with different digital payment methods in India.\n\nIf merchants accept Bitcoin, their cost can go down to less than 1% and this includes the cost to convert Bitcoin back to Rupees or Dollars. These companies are already studying the viability of accepting Bitcoin from technical and legal perspectives. It is only a matter of time before every business in the world accepts Bitcoin as a payment method. I believe in 1-2 years, we will hear the first big Indian e-commerce company starts accepting Bitcoin.\n\nNewsBTC: How long do you think it will take for Zebpay to be the Paytm for Bitcoin? What do you think needs to change in the current situation for that to happen?\n\nSandeep: With the exponential increase in Bitcoin awareness and adoption, I believe in 3 years, Zebpay has the potential to become a global Paytm for Bitcoin, with our users using Zebpay to transact with merchants, buy vouchers, gift cards, airtime and more.\n\nNewsBTC: Recently, there was news about banks withdrawing their service to one of the Indian Bitcoin exchanges. Did Zebpay also face any challenges with regard to banking partners (in the past or present)? If so, how are you planning to deal with it?\n\nSandeep: The news is overblown. One Bitcoin company lost one banking partner. All other Bitcoin companies including ours continue to operate absolutely normally without any problems. The Bitcoin Alliance India which is an alliance of all Bitcoin companies along with Nishith Desai Associates, India’s top law firm are working hard to proactively represent Bitcoin and suggest best practices to RBI. Most Western countries have given Bitcoin a legal recognition and come out with Bitcoin friendly regulation.\n\nIn fact, progressive countries like Singapore and UK are working hard to attract Bitcoin companies to operate in their jurisdiction. Bitcoin is a precious resource like gold. It is easy to understand this and we are sure with all the positive news around Bitcoin, we will have favourable working conditions in India too.\n\nIf things go according to the way Sandeep has speculated, we can expect an increased Bitcoin adoption across the country in a couple of years along with \\increased competition between Bitcoin businesses across the world to capture the maximum market share.', 'John Gruber and Joshua Topolsky, two of the best reporters in the business, were riffing on the air last week about what Apple would have done to Mark Gurman if WWDC were a spy movie and Apple a truly evil corporation.\n\nSomething terrible. Cut brake line. Bullet in the back of the head. Murder.\n\nYoung Mark Gurman, as Gruber calls him, took it as the compliment it was. At 21, a rising senior at the University of Michigan, he’s no longer the teen blogging phenom I profiled three year ago. He’s not much of a secret either. When Techmeme last month began listing authors by how frequently they are linked to from news and social media sites, Gurman topped the list, ahead of reporters at the Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch and Re/Code. He’s become a one-stop shopping site for mainstream media trying to keep up with Apple news. His work was cited in more than two dozen posts on Fortune.com in May alone.\n\n“He’s been kicking ass on secret Apple stuff,” says Gruber, whose WWDC walkup podcast was a 130-minute conversation with Gurman. “I think he’s done a better job than anyone who’s ever tried to do it.”\n\nThere’s no magic to it. Gurman has good sources in both the developer community and within Apple, and he works them relentlessly. I confess that I was skeptical in January when he reported on 9to5Mac that four ports would be replaced with one in Apple’s next MacBook. I should have known.\n\nBut it’s at WWDC that Gurman’s shoe-leather reporting shines brightest, and he’s worked this year’s event harder than ever. If you want to know what’s coming Monday — or at least what’s expected — you might as well start with the round-up Gurman published Friday. It’s the post everybody else is linking to, including Wall Street analysts.\n\nI caught up to Gurman on Saturday at his parents’ home in Los Angeles where, lacking an invitation from Apple, he will watch Monday’s keynote remotely. He’s got one more year in Michigan, where he’s taking a lot of technical courses — software design, server structure, data analysis — at the School of Information. To carve out more time for coursework he cut back this year on day-to-day rumors to focus on the big scoops. After graduation he’s thinking about business school — he likes Stanford — and relocation to San Francisco or New York.\n\nHe’s cagy about what comes next. Perhaps a start-up. Perhaps television, where someone like Gurman who knows what he’s talking about would be a welcome relief from today’s talking heads.\n\n“I like the spotlight,” he says. “I feel like I’m capable of bigger things than just writing about Apple.”\n\nFollow Philip Elmer-DeWitt on Twitter at @philiped.

Not only will you receive information such as the current Bitcoin price, but also information about public addresses, such as their current balance and the last address that a wallet has interacted with.\n\nIn doing so, it becomes easier for people to check their Bitcoin wallet balance and track their expenses, but it also allows anyone in the world to analyze your public wallet address.Granted, users can generate infinite new public wallet addresses, but this kind of blockchain analysis at the cost of a text message can cause quite some harm.\n\nOn the other hand, you could make the argument that “you shouldn’t use Bitcoin or the blockchain if you want to hide transaction details.” And that statement is more than valid up to a certain extent, as not everyone wants their address to be monitored – by any random person on the planet- for legitimate reasons.\n\nThat being said, smsBlockChain will offer anyone in the world access to the blockchain, regardless of whether or not they have an internet connection. It is not possible to send money without an internet connection [at this point], but from an informative point of view, all of the blockchain information is just a text message away.\n\nAt the time of publication, services offered by smsBlockChain are available to anyone in the world.

The rise in disclosures is a sign of the increased pressure on companies to give more information to investors and the public after the angry reaction to aggressive tax planning. PwC, the professional services firm, said: “We see this move towards increased tax transparency as part of a trend which we expect to continue in 2015.” The findings are based on PwC’s analysis of annual reports, corporate websites and other social responsibility reports for financial years ending between January and December 2014. The number of companies providing information about their general approach to taxation rose from 32 in 2012 to 49 in 2013, and has now reached 56. The information provided included comments on matters such as the openness of their relationships with tax authorities, their willingness to undertake aggressive tax planning and whether they had achieved a “low-risk” tax status from HM Revenue & Customs. However, only a relatively small number — one-quarter — of FTSE 100 companies provided any breakdown of their taxes around the world, up by just three over the past year. The limited number of “country-by-country” disclosures — information on where companies paid tax — stems from a reluctance from some groups to put such information in the public domain, while others have not yet collected it. Regardless of whether they make voluntary disclosures, multinationals will be forced by law to compile data for tax authorities showing where they earn their profits and pay their taxes, under the global crackdown on tax avoidance known as the “base erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS) initiative. The details of how these new rules — expected to provide governments with a crucial weapon in the crackdown on avoidance — will be released on Monday by the Paris-based OECD. PwC said the small increase in the number of companies making public country-by-country disclosures was not surprising, as many FTSE 100 companies were collecting the data required by the BEPS initiative for the first time for 2014 year-ends. “This would have allowed companies to assess their position internally while considering whether, and how, to make these disclosures public in future years.” The CBI employers’ group, has opposed making tax data public, saying it “risks reducing public understanding of the tax debate by swamping people in highly complex data with no context”. But many tax experts expect companies with a “good” story to tell to publish tax information voluntarily. PwC said that of the 25 companies that reported country-by-country information, eight were in the extractive industries and four were banks, which are already subject to mandatory reporting regimes.', 'An easy way to get more people acquainted with Bitcoin is through encouraging non-profit organizations to accept Bitcoin donations. Bitcoin dramatically reduces transaction costs, which would allow non-profits to use more of their resources in advancing their causes.\n\nAlso read: Charity Coin is the First “Proof of Donation” Crypto-Currency\n\nThis is where Bitcoin provider, Cubits, and non-profit fundraising service Wikando come into place. In a new partnership, Cubits and Wikando aim to bring Bitcoin to the world’s biggest charities. Eight months in the making, this extensive collaboration could potentially accelerate the rate of Bitcoin acceptance among charities.\n\nWikando pioneered the concept of fundraising-as-a-service in 2008, and has attracted big names such as Oxfam, Amnesty International, The Salvation Army, and Doctors Without Borders. In partnering with Cubits, international charities now have the option to accept easily Bitcoin donations – at zero cost.\n\nWhile charities in the past have taken Bitcoin donations, it was usually because they were ideologically committed to the digital currency, going out of their way to accept Bitcoin. Now, the Cubits-Wikando partnership allows non-profits to start accept Bitcoin through a seamless integration.\n\n“We are always looking for ways to expedite the donation process, whether it’s making it faster, cheaper, more secure, or more readily accessible to anyone, anywhere. Accepting Bitcoin was the obvious choice, and Cubits helped us make this choice a reality.” – Peter Kral, Chief Technology Officer, Wikando\n\nWikando’s online software allows organizations to accept Bitcoin through a web browser, while Cubit allows transactions to be sent with no fees. This combination of services is aimed at making it easy for charities to accept Bitcoin, and allowing them to use the full amount of their Bitcoin without losing anything to fees.\n\n“Non-profit organizations can now process donations without having to worry about installing hardware, downloading software, implementing encryption, or maintaining servers, thereby freeing up their energy and resources to focus on helping their causes.”\n\nBitcoin makes donating available to a wide range of people. Even people who normally cannot afford to donate to charity can use Bitcoin to give small amounts that would normally be eaten up by fees in a fiat transaction. Donations can stay anonymous too, which can help people contribute to causes that are unpopular for religious or political reasons, but are noble causes otherwise. Regardless, charity is one of the biggest use cases for Bitcoin, and there’s no sign of that changing anytime soon.\n\n“We are extremely proud to be a part of Wikando’s fundraising-as-a-service platform, because for us, Bitcoin isn’t only about doing business well, but doing the world good.” – Cubits CEO Tim Rehder, CEO, Cubits\n\nDo you think charities accepting Bitcoin is the way to mainstream adoption?

06/08/2015,"['(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nSometimes it\'s hard to tell whether Bitcoin is more like Ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme.\n\nWhatever it is, though, it isn\'t a currency. It\'s a tech stock. Each Bitcoin is really a share in a system that seems to make it cheaper to transfer things online—money, stocks, bonds, even the deed to your house—by cutting out the middleman. Well, kind of. Bitcoin doesn\'t remove the middleman so much as replace him with middlemen who don\'t make you pay much, but make society as a whole do so instead. Is this progress?\n\nIt\'s supposed to be. Ever since the early days of the Internet, people have been trying to figure out how to transfer money online without having to go through the financial system. The problem, though, is if I send you money, how do you know I haven\'t already spent it or sent it to somebody else? You don\'t. So the only solution has been to have a trusted third-party, like a bank, sit in between us. I send the money to the bank, it verifies that I actually have this money to send, and then it sends it on to you, all for a 2 percent fee, of course.\n\nBitcoin\'s breakthrough is to have a decentralized network of ""miners"" sit in between us instead. Now, remember, these miners are trying to win new Bitcoins by solving computationally-taxing math problems. The clever part, though, is that in the process of doing so, they also create a public ledger of every single Bitcoin transaction, what\'s called the blockchain. That includes every Bitcoin that\'s ever been won, every Bitcoin that\'s ever been used, and every Bitcoin that\'s ever been transferred. So now we don\'t need a bank to know that I have the money I\'m sending to you, and that I\'m only sending it to you. The miners confirm all this. And the best part is that instead of having to pay the bank myself to do this, the system pays the miners in new Bitcoins.\n\nThe question, though, is how you get people to mine Bitcoin to begin with. Sure, you can tell them that Bitcoin is digital money they can use to buy things online, but they already have money they can already use to buy things online. And while merchants would be more than happy to save the 2.5 percent they pay in credit card transaction fees, customers are a lot more more blasé since they don\'t pay them directly. The answer, then, was to do what makes anything popular: make it exclusive. Specifically, Bitcoin limits the total number of coins that will ever be created to 21 million. Now, for Bitcoin\'s first year and a half, as Nathaniel Popper documents in his page-turning history Digital Gold, there were still only a handful of people, if that, mining it. But that began to change when libertarians, who were convinced, just convinced, that the Federal Reserve\'s money-printing would mean the doom of the dollar, discovered Bitcoin and its non-inflatable money supply. A boom was born.\n\nBut what made people mine Bitcoins is what has kept from spending Bitcoins. Think about it like this. Bitcoin\'s finite supply means that its price should go up, and keep going up. So if you have dollars that are losing a little value to inflation every year and Bitcoins that are gaining it, which one are you going to use to buy things with? The question answers itself, and it raises another. Why would this ever change? Unless you can\'t buy something online with dollars—like drugs—you\'d always want to use your dollars instead. Buying things with Bitcoin would be like cashing out your Apple stock in 1978 to go grocery shopping even though you have plenty of actual cash lying around.\n\nThe catch-22 is people buy Bitcoins because they think the price will go to infinity and beyond once everybody uses them, but they don\'t spend their own Bitcoins because they think the price will go to infinity and beyond once everybody else uses them. And so nobody uses them. But if nobody uses them, then the price will stay stuck at something a lot less than infinity let alone beyond. So the Bitcoin faithful have tried to not only convert people, but also convince them to martyr themselves, financially-speaking, for the crypto cause. It goes something like this. Hey, do you want to hear about the future? It\'s a digital currency called Bitcoin that lets you spend or move your money online without paying any fees. Sounds great. How does it do that? Well, Bitcoin saves you money by making transactions irreversible. So ... if I get scammed, I got scammed? There\'s nothing I can do about it? Yes. Okay, but is it at least easy to use? The thing is, I don\'t actually use it. I just hoard it. I\'m waiting for some greater fools to push up the price by using theirs. Oh. Yeah. So you should buy some Bitcoins and use yours. I\'ll get back to you on that.\n\nBut Bitcoin is good for something other than redistributing wealth from one libertarian to another. That\'s transferring money, or anything else for that matter, online. ""The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types,"" Bitcoin\'s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto wrote back in 2010, including ""escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc."" So anytime you need to send any kind of financial asset or agreement to somebody else, you can send it along with a Bitcoin and, through the beauty of the blockchain, avoid having to pay a lot of fees. That\'s why Wall Street banks are looking into whether they can build their own blockchains to cut costs before their competitors do. And while sending money is cheap within the U.S., it\'s not not across international borders—the average transfer fee, according to the World Bank, is 7.5 percent. It\'s not hard to imagine, in other words, that Bitcoin could claim a big chunk of the $500 billion remittance market, although the difficulty of actually getting the physical cash to people in developing countries is still a significant hurdle.\n\nWait a minute, though. How does the blockchain cut costs again? Remember, instead of you paying the bank a fee to process a transaction, the Bitcoin system pays miners new coins to do so. Then these transactions get added to the list of all others in the public ledger, the blockchain. But anytime it seems like you\'re getting something for nothing the costs are probably just being hidden. What are those costs? Well, Bitcoin mining is a pretty expensive business. Even the most specialized computers, which mine Bitcoins and only mine Bitcoins, require a lot of energy. So much so that Bitcoin miners have set up shop in far-flung places like Iceland where geothermal energy is cheap and Arctic air is cheaper still—free—for them to run and cool off their machines at the lowest possible price.\n\nOkay, but why should we care that Bitcoin miners have big energy bills? They\'re the ones paying them, after all. Well, for the most part. The problem is the price you pay for energy doesn\'t include the cost we all pay for pollution. So energy-intensive businesses that are paying less than they ""should"" for it can generate environmental spillovers on everyone else, or what economists call negative externalities. Once you take this into account, it\'s not clear how much Bitcoin is really cutting cost so much as shifting them. Specifically, it turns your transaction costs into our pollution costs. Now, Bitcoin might still lower costs overall, but the calculus isn\'t as simple as it appears if you only add up the benefits.\n\nIt\'s not clear what Bitcoin is or what it will be, but it is clear what it\'s not. It\'s not a currency. People don\'t set prices in Bitcoin and, for the most part, don\'t buy things with it either. The only function of money it comes close to performing is as a store of value, but it doesn\'t even do that well. Even though it seems like Bitcoin prices should go up and up and up, it hasn\'t for a year and a half now. In fact, Bitcoin\'s $225-a-coin price is 80 percent less than its December 2013 peak. That said, Bitcoin might be a better way to send things online—or at least its technology, the blockchain, might—but, again, that depends on how much energy it takes to run the network. In the meantime, though, Bitcoin is still a little bit of a Ponzi—or is it a pyramid?—scheme that its libertarian early adopters are trying to cash in on.\n\nThe future might not belong to Bitcoin, but it should to its technology.', 'E-commerce giant Overstock.com has become the first company to offer qualified buyers the option of purchasing corporate bonds that will trade using Bitcoin’s blockchain protocol.\n\nIn a speech last year at Inside Bitcoins Las Vegas, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne announced a special partnership with Counterparty that led to the creation of a project known as Medici. The Medici project was designed to create a decentralized stock exchange within the Counterparty platform. Thus, the Medici project itself is based on blockchain technology.\n\nThe bonds will be sold privately and will sell for a combined total of $25 million.\n\n“The cryptorevolution has arrived on Wall Street,” said Byrne. “We’re making it official by offering the world’s first ‘cryptosecurity.’”\n\nOverstock’s cryptosecurities will be traded on a unique platform with much greater speed and reliability than traditional bond trading technology. Overstock’s cryptosecurities will be traded using custom-built TØ.com technology. TØ.com means that trades made with the system clear in the same day instead of the standard Wall Street technology, which traders call T+3, which clears and settles trades in three days.\n\nBased on blockchain technology, TØ.com technology increases the reliability and speed of trades. In addition to the speed, buyers of the cryptosecurity will be able to track asset ownership directly on Bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\n“Issuing the TIGRcub bonds on the TØ.com platform proves that cryptotechnology can facilitate transparent and secure access to capital by emerging companies,” Byrne said.\n\nInformation about the cryptosecurity offering was distributed to investors on June 1. The offering is being made only to institutional buyers that meet the legal definition of an accredited investor by rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nBy offering bonds while following regulations, Overstock.com is able to bring the world’s first security based on blockchain to investors. Decentralized trading systems have the ability to improve trading infrastructure in the future.Blockchain technology itself is drawing more attention; projects at Citibank’s EMEA Mobile Competition were named as ‘Top Innovations.’ Social media startup, GetGems, is to receive $400,000 from the Magma VC in recognition of their innovative platform that is based on top of Telegram.\n\nByrne has purchased the world’s first cryptobond for the sum of $500,000. This will reduce the available total of the bonds to $24.5 million.\n\n""It\'s not exactly Jonas Salk injecting himself with his polio vaccine, but I wanted to own the first cryptosecurity ever issued,"" stated Byrne. ""I intend to demonstrate my belief not just in Overstock, but in the TØ.com platform that we built and, indeed, in the cryptorevolution itself.""\n\nThe purchase of the first ever Cryptobond marks a successful start to the Medici project and the expansion of blockchain technology into Wall Street-based trades.\n\nThis post was updated with information about the first bond purchase at 3:44 EDT on June 8, 2015.', 'People are robbed all the time for all kinds of things. Their expensive watches, cell phones, wallets, you name it. It’s only now and then that people are robbed of their bitcoins, and usually this happens through hacking or some other digital means.\n\nNot so in the case of a young man who, for whatever reason, decided to sell $1,100 worth (roughly four and change at current rates) via Craigslist. According to CNBC, an unidentified man showed up to the designated meeting place in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and soon found himself at the wrong end of two pistols.\n\nIt was a classic Craigslist crime. The same methodology is used to heist all kinds of goods, not just digital currency. The seller is comforted by the presence of a single buyer, led to another location where he is ambushed by the supposed buyer and an accomplice. In this case, they forced the seller to make the transfer and then also stole his phone.\n\nThe man has yet to come forward on any online forum, and CCN urges him to get in touch with us if he’d like to tell his story in more detail. The question remains of whether or not the criminals have been able to fully wash the coins yet. Stealing bitcoins is a bit like robbing someone in front of a crowd. The chances of no one figuring out where the money are significantly lower, due to the public nature of the blockchain. If the seller has a backup of his wallet anywhere, he’ll be able to track the coins at least to a certain point, if not all the way to their final conversion to profit.\n\nAlso read: The Government Could Struggle to Seize Your Bitcoin\n\nThere is even a chance that law enforcement could subpoena the details of an account if the coins wound up in a regulated exchange for sale. Which seems unlikely. The most likely destination for these coins will be a Dark Net Market such as Agora, where they can be converted into goods both legal and illegal and then turned into profit from there. Perhaps that was the fundamental motivation, as most Bitcoiners are not hardened criminals with the knack (or tools) to rob people at gunpoint.\n\nNot the Wisest Way to Sell Bitcoin\n\nUsing Craigslist was, of course, the seller’s first mistake. There are many ways to get cash for your bitcoins, and CCN urges our readers not to use something like Craigslist for such. The site LocalBitcoins.com is dedicated to the sale of bitcoins, and in a place like New York, there is a fairly active scene of people willing to buy and sell bitcoins for paper currency. There are, of course, the occasional thefts there, as well. But at the very least you have a fighting chance to make a wise decision, as there is a rating system on the site, and you obviously don’t have to choose anyone who hasn’t done trades before.\n\nBut then, of course, if you don’t need the money right away, it’s probably wisest to go with a traditional exchange. Never leave your coins on the exchange when you’re done trading, as that has time and again proven to be a good way of losing them. But when you sell your coins this way, you have a far lower probability of coming up empty handed than you do meeting strangers on the street and expecting them to hand over cash.\n\nBitcoin is digital gold, and until we all treat it with the same care and security as we treat physical gold, cases like this will continue to happen. On second thought, they’ll continue to happen anyway, but there are more ways than ever to keep them from happening to you.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Estonia’s LHV Bank has backed a project to create a financial services platform and money-transfer app that will utilize bitcoin to facilitate transactions.\n\nThe Cuber Wallet app, which is available on both Android and Apple devices, enables users to send and receive euros instantly and free of charge. The experimental system uses the bitcoin blockchain by way of colored coins, according to the bank.\n\nLHV Bank has also announced the creation of an experimental type of digital security. The development of the bitcoin-based certificate of deposit mirrors work conducted in other parts of the world by other institutions like Nasdaq OMX Group Inc that are keen on experimenting with bitcoin.\n\nSwedish company ChromaWay AB, which focuses on colored coin technology, assisted with the creation of the Cuber platform. Developers from a variety of nations worked on the project, including those from Estonia, Ukraine, Sweden, Israel and Russia.\n\nRain Lõhmus, CEO of Cuber Technology, a subsidiary of LHV Group, said in a statement:\n\n“We hope Cuber can ... liberate innovation from organizational borders, truly decentralize it. And true innovation in [the] financial sector will flourish.”\n\nWork on the project began last year, as indicated during an interview with LHV head of retail banking Andres Kitter. At the time, Kitter told CoinDesk the bank saw the initiative as a way to ""explore what could be built on top of the underlying technology"".\n\nThe money transfer app is currently undergoing testing and is free for download, but currently comes with deposit restrictions.

According to Blockstream, the code will allow community developers to experiment with sidechain functionality, with initial features allowing users to transact and issue digital assets.\n\nThe release comes months after Blockstream raised $21m in seed capital from investors including Reid Hoffman, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang’s AME Cloud Ventures.\n\nIn interview, Blockstream co-founder and president Dr Adam Back expressed hope that the release of Sidechains Elements would drive community members to contribute to the initiative.\n\nBack told CoinDesk:\n\n“Our hope is that people in the community will participate, look at it, submit patches, get involved and try out all you can do with the proposed bitcoin extensions.”\n\nSidechains are blockchains designed to integrate with the bitcoin blockchain by way of two-way pegs, allowing for the transfer of assets between the two networks. The project has been heralded as a potential solution to bitcoin's perceived scalability issues for its attempt to enable experimentation on bitcoin's code.\n\nCurrently, the sidechain made available for developers utilizes testnet coins rather than real bitcoins, and the decentralized peg only allows for two-way transactions between the bitcoin testnet and the sidechain testnet.\n\nNext phase of development\n\nAccording to Back, the release of Sidechains Elements will help contribute to the next phase of development: putting the code into the hands of entrepreneurs and institutions looking to utilize sidechains.\n\nHe cited banks in particular as one group of interested parties, which he noted are interested in the ability to issue and distribute assets on the blockchain, as well as provide infrastructure for what Back called “new kinds of markets”.\n\n“This sidechain release and releases and features to follow will be a good implementation point for those kinds of projects,” he said.\n\nBack pointed to the confidential transactions feature as one of the more notable aspects of the release, suggesting that the concept can help bring a new degree of privacy to bitcoin. Those who use the feature would be able to obscure the amount being sent from parties outside of those actively involved in the exchange or selected third parties.\n\nBIP submission\n\nA major step to come is the drafting and submission of a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that will call for sidechain functionality to be added to bitcoin’s codebase.\n\nIf approved, the addition to bitcoin’s code will enable the decentralized two-way peg and the ability to merge-mine sidechains with bitcoin.

Even for a state that made great efforts to engage with industry leaders to find a mutually acceptable solution - something other states have been loathe to undertake - New York\'s regulations fell short of satisfying Bitcoin\'s backers.\n\nBenjamin Lawsky, the Superintendent of the state\'s Department of Financial Services (DFS), announced the regulations at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington DC. ""We want to promote and support companies that use new, emerging technologies to build better financial companies,"" he said during a speech at the event. ""We just need to make sure that we put appropriate regulatory guardrails in place.""\n\nAs a protean technology that can serve as a digital currency, commodity or ledger system with unlimited potential, Bitcoin has befuddled, terrified and entranced regulators and law enforcement officials since its inception in 2008. The technology\'s potential and quixotic nature left it with no precedent.\n\nLawsky\'s first steps reflected the challenge Bitcoin posed to government regulators. He jumped into the mix in August 2013 by publicly characterizing Bitcoin as a ""virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals."" His stance softened over time as Lawsky began to publicly espouse the technology\'s benefits and repeat the industry\'s criticisms of the financial sector.\n\nCompared to other state regulators, who had largely remained silent, the move propelled Lawsky to the forefront of regulation of the new technology. In many ways, the BitLicence he came to propose - the first of its kind in the nation - came to define Lawsky\'s tenure as New York\'s leading financial regulator: he plans to resign from the post at the end of the month.\n\nDespite Lawsky\'s embrace of Bitcoin\'s potential, the first version of the Department\'s proposed BitLicense released last July upset many in the Bitcoin community.

At the time of writing, almost 600 investors have bought in, with three days to go until the end of the fundraiser. Fifty percent equity will be split between the investors.Bitcoin Capital, a high-risk, high-return fund, is run by renowned financial journalist Max Keiser and Simon Dixon, co-founder of Bnk To The Future, an online investment website for crowdfunding small businesses mainly focused on financial innovation. The fund, open to qualified investors who want to speculate on the growth of the cryptocurrency sector, offers a spread of investments covering startups, bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency trading. Each of the three investment lines will have one-third of the fund invested into it.\n\n“Max Keiser has a consistent record of presciently and profitably identifying big trends. He was one of the few media personalities to devote significant coverage to us early Bitcoin evangelists. Watching his new fund's performance will be very interesting,” said early bitcoin investor and Host of the Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast Trace Mayer.\n\n“Bitcoin Capital is a Cayman Islands tax efficient investment fund for professional investors who want exposure to the growth of Crypto Currencies like Bitcoin and Blockchain technology,” states the Bitcoin Capital website. “One-third of the fund invests in companies in the Crypto Currency and Blockchain sector. For earlier stage startups we have created a completely new model for finding deals to invest in. The startup must first raise finance through CrowdFunding on StartJOIN.com, qualify for Equity CrowdFunding on BnkToTheFuture.com and reach at least 50% of their funding goal from investors before they qualify for Bitcoin Capital to explore investing. They have to prove their traction with the crowd before we explore the Investment proposition.”Besides seed funding to blockchain startups, Bitcoin Capital invests one-third of all funds in mining, which is used exclusively to pay daily dividends to investors (in bitcoin) for as long as the mining process is profitable. The remaining third of the fund is invested in cryptocurrencies and digital tokens.“We invest in longer term growth coins where we believe in the story rather than short term coin speculation,” notes the website.“At the same time as investors benefiting from any growth of the sector, we are able to offer investors daily dividend determined by the mining process,” said Dixon . “We are able to do all the geeky things like running mining rigs in Iceland and buying coins on exchanges that investors who are new to the sector are unable to do. Thanks to our experience and involvement in the sector from very early on we are able to combine these new models of finance together.” Keiser hosts Keiser Report, a financial program broadcast on Russian state media channel RT, a weekly show about finance and markets on London's Resonance FM, and writes for The Huffington Post. An outspoken Bitcoin activist, Keiser stated in an interview that he would base the entire economy on the digital currency.“I have been critical of the traditional financial system for many years on my show,” said Keiser. “I was the first global news outlet to cover bitcoin when it was trading at $3, recognizing its potential to change the world. Many startups in the Bitcoin space credit Keiser Report for getting them started in the business.

The document reads:\n\n""We would argue that, when compared to MasterCard’s network, the claims pertaining to the speed and safety of digital currencies [do] not hold up, not least given that on average it takes 10 minutes for a block to be verified and that digital currencies are far more susceptible to hacking attacks.""\n\nMasterCard goes on to say digital currency transaction costs may currently be lower than those involved in traditional payments methods, but this is because digital currency service providers don’t currently bear the cost of complying with consumer protection and anti-money laundering laws.\n\nHowever, if regulation requiring this is introduced, the company says, the transaction costs will soon rise.\n\nConsumer protection\n\nMasterCard\'s submission suggests any new regulation the UK government creates should address the current lack of consumer protections in the digital currency space.\n\nOne of the risks it flags is that consumers currently have no form of official redress if they use digital currency to make a purchase and the merchant fails to deliver their goods.\n\nTo further highlight the safety of the existing financial system in comparison, the document references the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees customers of registered companies up to £85,000 per person in compensation if the firm goes out of business.\n\nThe response makes numerous references to the high-profile failure of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, highlighting how customers can suffer due to the lack of protections in the digital currency space.\n\nMasterCard also believes bitcoin users are in danger as the cost of mining bitcoins will rise when usage of the currency increases, until the cost becomes unsustainable. It continues:\n\n""To achieve economies of scale, the higher marginal costs of digital currencies will lead to a reduction in the number of miners down to a monopoly miner, defeating the original design of digital currencies and opening them up to system-wide fraud.""\n\nFinal recommendations\n\nMasterCard suggests the government should create regulation that addresses the risks associated with cryptocurrency while still enabling lawful digital currency businesses to ""flourish"".\n\nThe ""current blockchain process"" doesn’t provide sufficient transparency, it says, and regulation should require all transactions to go through regulated and transparent administrators, which would be supervised by relevant domestic, European or global authorities.\n\nDigital currency companies should also be licensed and supervised in the same way non-bank money transmitters are. They should be required to ""perform Know Your Customer checks, maintain an AML program, file suspicious activity reports and address cybersecurity vulnerabilities"".\n\nFinally, MasterCard believes the government should develop consumer protections which would force digital currency companies to create a formal consumer complaint process and enable the reversal of unauthorised charges.\n\nOther submissions\n\nOther companies to submit responses to the call for information include Accenture and Citi.\n\nAccenture suggested in its response that the UK government should consider regulating bitcoin wallets, applying the same identification requirements as it does to bank accounts.\n\nCiti’s Treasury and Trade Services Technology and Innovation Team, on the other hand, suggested the Treasury should think about creating its own digital currency.\n\nView MasterCard\'s full response below:\n\nMasterCard Response to ‘Digital Currencies: Call for Information’ by CoinDesk\n\nCheck out our in-depth bitcoin regulation report for more on this topic.\n\nMasterCard image via Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

When the government offered millions of yuan each to evict a nearby village to build a dam, the story goes that the villagers, who probably had no notion of a number that large, refused categorically.\n\nBut money is coming, in a way many wouldn’t expect.\n\nThe mine\n\nPeople have been puzzled by the fast growth of bitcoin mining in China. However, one big reason it has ramped up so dramatically is the buildout of hydropower in the west of the country.\n\nThe first petahash mining farms were built in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia where coal was cheap and plentiful, but even cheap coal can’t compete with free water.\n\nNow, the farms are migrating en masse towards the west. Our local power station, with a capacity of 25,000 kW, started generating power in 2013, but when HaoBTC\'s CEO Wu Gang came across it last year, the company was having difficulty paying its employees.\n\nIt couldn\'t obtain the quota enabling them sell power to national grid, which prefers the state-owned power stations over those that are privately-owned. Also, the county-level grid could only consume a small percentage of the power the station generated.\n\nWhen Wu Gang appeared on the scene with a wacky idea to mine bitcoin using hydropower, people were initially skeptical. However, once they overcame this initial bout of confusion it was clear a win-win arrangement could be formed.\n\nPrior to the discovery of the new power supply, Wu Gang already owned mining operations in two locations, producing 7 PH/s. Once preparation at the local hydropower station was completed, Wu Gang’s miners quickly relocated to take advantage of the cheap power.\n\nTwo buildings have now been constructed to house the miners and two more are currently underway.\n\nThe farm operates over 10,000 Antminer S3 units, which, alongside the huge ventilation fans, generate a drone that is more than a little annoying. Not what I would call deafening, but you have to be loud when you talk to someone even close to you – an ideal environment to teach you to be economical with words.\n\nAs for the temperature, it is often around 35 degrees Celsius, but it doesn\'t feel that hot because of the wind.\n\nThe employees\n\nOf the seven people employed at the farm, most are in their early twenties and have been in the business for one to two years.\n\nThe 6,000 yuan ($967) monthly salary might not be much for a white collar employee in Beijing, but for the village kids who have no advanced degree or special professional skills, this is good money.\n\nBy comparison, a 40-year-old employee at the local hydropower station told me he got paid slightly more than 3,000 ($484) yuan per month.\n\nMoney is certainly a big factor in making life in an isolated environment more bearable, especially when 1,500 yuan extra is added for their sacrifice of weekends.\n\nOnce the two remaining buildings have been constructed, the mine workers will be able to have one month of vacation for every two months of work, though some might miss the 1,500 yuan subsidy.\n\nAll the staff in the company’s Beijing office, most of whom are programmers, get paid in BTC, but workers here still prefer fiat – the idea of a bitcoin salary is easier to pitch to programmers.\n\nThe day-to-day\n\nMy first week working at the farm involved more menial labor than I expected. I consider myself reasonably fit, yet after moving hundreds of miners off the truck and onto the shelves, I was depressed by my sore arms the next day. By contrast, my colleagues were in good spirits and maintained their high efficiency.\n\nMy coworkers are from Hunan and Sichuan and their accents make communication slightly hard – I still have trouble understanding them when they talk among themselves, but they always make an effort to speak in mandarin when speaking to me.\n\nAfter various conversations at the facility, I soon realized they are knowledgeable about bitcoin. However, not so much about the latest news or theoretical debate, but the legendary figures who made their names and fortunes by investing early.\n\nWu Gang is one such legend and, needless to say, their hero. This is especially true for those from his hometown in Hunan.\n\nRoutine at the mine is simple. At 07:50am we have a morning meeting. All who fail to attend on time get a small penalty.\n\nEveryone is required to explain what they did the previous day and what they plan to do that day. All problems are reported and solutions are proposed and at the end of each meeting, the manager, Mr Guo, assigns tasks and gives a pep talk.\n\nThe staff then splits off into two teams, each of which has a leader who has more responsibility and a slightly bigger paycheque.\n\nOne such employee, Mr Guo, is a mild, soft-spoken man from Hunan. Before being involved in bitcoin, he ran a small camera repair shop in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province.\n\nOne day, he was contacted by his old schoolmate Wu Gang, who he hadn’t seen for years. Guo was asked if he was interested in managing his bitcoin mine. With no prior experience and no idea what bitcoin was, Guo took the challenge. Two and half years on, Guo has managed three farms and become an expert on the cryptocurrency.\n\nDowntime\n\nThere aren’t many recreational activities to speak of at the mine. Spare time is whiled away with copious amounts of cigarettes, the occasional beer, TV, smart phones and good old poker games.\n\nChewing dried betel quid is also common – I was told it works as a form of stimulant and is slightly addictive. I tried it once, it tasted like mint-flavored chewing gum.\n\nWhile the surroundings are beautiful, there’s not much to do outside the mine. Some coworkers told me they have been here for three months and the farthest they have ventured is a small town some 20km away. Their verdict was: ""Absolutely nothing to see. The local Tibetans make sure everything is overpriced.""\n\nBitcoin believers\n\nBitcoin is famously volatile but that is perhaps one of the reasons we love it – the unpredictability. For someone to invest millions of dollars in a mining farm, you have to have a strong faith in the technology.\n\nWu made it rule number one that everyone joining this company must be a believer in bitcoin. But it is also a business, so the farm will probably only last as long as it is profitable.\n\nThe electrical rate right now is low and the team’s dedication and expertise adds to our competitiveness. But we are not blind to risk – profitability may become unattainable someday, we may have to sell our equipment to those who can still make profit. Until then, the machines whir on.\n\nSee more images of the bitcoin mine on Flickr.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

06/09/2015,"['ShapeShift.io, a well-known digital currency exchange, has just announced that the trading platform is available on the IOS app store, making it the first mobile exchange app ever permitted on the app store.\n\nAlong with Apple’s announcement of iOS 9, users will be able to trade bitcoin with monero, counterparty, dash, and other altcoins from their phones.\n\n“Since inception, ShapeShift has changed what is expected of altcoin exchanges,"" said ShapeShift.io Founder and CEO Erik Voorhees in a press release. ""Having a presence on mobile is a crucial step in our roadmap for delivering the mostfrictionless experience possible while working at the speed of digital currency.”\n\n“Shapeshift mobile iOS app is the next step towards instant accessibility of crypto - no matter where you are,” said Lisa Cheng, founder of Vanbex.Unlike traditional exchanges, users can trade without an account or email address. Arguing that the increased privacy is good for consumer protection, (no data in the hands of a third party) users also have access to shifting one coin or digital asset to another, receiving a payment shortly after deposit.\n\n\n\n“Most exchanges hold customer funds and extract personal information, which is an archaic and insecure model,” said Voorhees. “Mt. Gox was a teachable moment for everyone in the Bitcoin community, and ShapeShift has innovated these problems out of the picture. We are both faster and more secure. This is real consumer protection – no funds or sensitive information is stored on our servers, nor on the user’s phone in case it is damaged, destroyed or stolen. Digital currency has brought to humanity a more secure infrastructure, and so we build in that spirit.”\n\n\n\nOver the past few months, ShapeShift has partnered with a number of companies to expand their service, including Purse.io, an escrow service that allows customers to purchase items on Amazon for a discount by using digital currency, and Vaultoro, a platform that allows users to trade digital currency for bullion.\n\n\n\nHistorically, Apple has been rather anti-digital currency on the app store, having a time period of several months in which Bitcoin wallets weren’t even allowed. Since then, Apple has allowed for wallets, and now the first-ever exchange.\n\nDespite the supposed change of heart, Apple Pay is still charging forward without Bitcoin, and it doesn’t look like it will look to adopt it or its technology anytime soon. ShapeShift’s mobile app might mark a change in app store policy in which more digital currency exchanges will be allowed to launch mobile applications on the IOS platform.', 'MasterCard is lobbying the UK government for increased regulation of bitcoin and other digital currencies that pose a threat to its legacy credit-cards business, as it tries to adapt to the transformation of a payments industry long overdo for change.\n\n“In the current environment we feel that the risks of digital currencies outweigh the benefits,” the company wrote in strongly worded letter, obtained by digital currency website Coindesk, in which MasterCard asks the UK government for more regulation of crypto currencies.\n\nThe letter, sent in response to the UK Treasury’s call for information last year, is the latest sign that established financial companies are taking bitcoin and other digital currencies more seriously—and pushing for a level playing field.\n\nFrom the letter:\n\nWe would argue that, when compared to MasterCard’s network, the claims pertaining to the speed and safety of digital currencies does not hold up, not least given that on average it takes 10 minutes for a block to be verified and that digital currencies are far more susceptible to hacking attacks. Additionally, while digital currency transaction costs are currently lower, this is because providers of digital currency services do not currently bear any compliance costs, whereas providers of other forms of electronic payment bear the cost of complying with consumer protection laws and anti-money laundering laws.\n\nA MasterCard spokesman says the submission to the UK officials was “developed to help them understand the policy issues around virtual and anonymous currencies.”\n\nIts claims are self-serving, of course, but the company has a fair point. If traditional financial companies that make loans, issue credit, and transfer money all have to follow globally agreed-upon rules to prevent institutional failures, consumer fraud, and illicit activity, then so, too, should the upstarts.', 'Bitcoin extortionists DD4BC have begun targeting Scandinavian companies with complex DDoS attacks.\n\nDD4BC is blackmailing targets by asking them to pay 40 bitcoins or more to avoid their central services being subject to DDoS attacks. Extortionate demands typically appear in emails around an hour after targets are blitzed off the web with high-volume assaults, reports Danish security firm Heimdal Security.\n\nThe group assured victims that they are only extracting a one-off payment, according to extracts from one extortionate demand from the group obtained by Heimdal.\n\nPay and you will not hear from us ever again! In many cases, our ""customers"" fear that if they pay us once, we will be back and ask for more. That’s not how we work. We never attack the same target twice. We do bad things, but we keep our word.\n\nDD4BC has previously targeting financial institutions all over Europe prior to its latest forays against targets in Scandinavia.\n\nHeimdal reports that the group typically ramps up the level of attack, and varies the mechanism of assaults, to cause victims the maximum possible discomfort.\n\n""The typical pattern for the DD4BC gang is to launch DDoS attacks targeting Layer 3-4, but if this does not have the desired effect, they will/can move it to layer 7 with various types of loop back attacks with post/get requests,"" wrote Andra Zaharia, a marketing & communication exec at Heimdal Security. ""The initial attack typically lies on a scale between 10-20GBps. This is rather massive, but often not even close to the real threat.""\n\nDD4BC typically move on after 24 hours of a sustained attack but victims shouldn\'t necessarily rely on that, Heimdal cautions. ®', 'The authors of the much-discussed Bitcoin Sidechains paper “Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains,” released in October, formed the company Blockstream to implement sidechains and accelerate innovation in digital currencies. In November, Blockstream closed a $21 million seed funding round with nearly 40 high-profile investors.\n\nThe Bitcoin Sidechains paper envisages an ecosystem of “sidechains” separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain but interoperable with it by means of two-way pegs, allowing for the transfer of assets between sidechains and the main blockchain. A sidechain can implement changes from Bitcoin Core, for example, more powerful scripting features or more watertight privacy. According to Blockstream, sidechains enable innovators to safely develop new applications without jeopardizing Bitcoin’s core code and putting billions of dollars worth of digital currency at risk.\n\nFor a readable explanation of sidechains, see “A simple explanation of Bitcoin ‘Sidechains,” by Richard Gendal Brown, executive architect for banking innovation at IBM UK. Despite the considerable interest in sidechains, the enthusiasm of developers has been so far dampened by the lack of actual implementations of sidechains.\n\nNow Blockstream has announced Sidechain Elements, a sidechain development framework with open source code and developer sidechains.\n\n“We’re excited to announce the release of Sidechain Elements,” says Adam Back, co-founder and president of Blockstream. “Sidechains extend Bitcoin functionality through interoperable blockchain networks and today’s open source release includes an experimental sidechain that has a number of new working capabilities. With the release of Sidechain Elements, Blockstream is moving this effort into the community.”\n\nSidechain Elements includes functioning code and a testing environment for working with sidechains with several components: the core network software to build an initial testing sidechain, eight new features not currently supported by Bitcoin, a basic wallet and the code for moving coins between blockchains.Blockstream\'s CTO and Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell explains Sidechain Elements in a video on the Blockstream website.\n\nAs open-source, protocol-level technology, developers can use Sidechain Elements to extend the functionality of Bitcoin and explore new applications of the Blockchain. ""Although both are ultimately needed, sidechains are true innovation and value add in contrast to merely increasing the block size and kicking a larger can,"" said early Bitcoin investor Trace Mayer.\n\n“We’re inviting developers to work with us, to test and use the code for their projects, and to share their proposals and code for additional capabilities,” says Back. The new features not currently supported by Bitcoin Core include Confidential Transactions, Basic Asset Issuance, Relative Lock Time and several others.\n\nOne of the most powerful new features being explored in Elements is Confidential Transactions, a cryptographic tool to improve the privacy and security of Bitcoin. This feature keeps the amounts transferred visible only to participants in the transaction (and those they designate). A detailed explanation of Confidential Transactions by Maxwell is available here.\n\nWith Basic Asset Issuance, users can issue their own assets via newly created units that represent fungible ownership of an underlying asset type. These tokens can theoretically represent any asset including vouchers, coupons, currencies, deposits, bonds, shares, etc.\n\nWith Relative Lock Time, the consensus-enforced semantics of the sequence number field is modified to enable a signed transaction input to remain invalid for a defined period of time after confirmation of its corresponding output, for the purpose of supporting consensus-enforced transaction replacement features. This feature is also useful for efficient implementation of blockchain secured off-chain layers like the Lightning Network, where related transactions can take place instantly on “micropayment channels” off-chain, and only the final settlement is processed by the blockchain.\n\nBlockstream will seek to provide Sidechain Elements as a base for the nearly 30 blockchain innovation initiatives that have been announced by major financial institutions in the past few months. Since the deployment of sidechains interoperable with Bitcoin requires the implementation of suitable tweaks to Bitcoin Core, Blockstream is working to draft a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for a fully decentralized two-way peg and merge-mined sidechains.\n\nOnce fully implemented, sidechains will probably have a disruptive impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem. For example, it seems likely that the useful features of some altcoins, such as improved scripting, transaction times and privacy, could be replicated in a sidechain without losing interoperability with Bitcoin.\n\nImage via Blockstream.', 'Tel Aviv, a city of about 400,000 residents in the heart of Israel, is considered one of the leading cities in the world in Bitcoin adoption. For new bitcoiners, Tel Aviv is like a dream come true; it has everything you need to get started with the digital currency.For starters, the Israeli Facebook Group “Israeli Bitcoin” has more than 4,500 members. The group is extremely active and friendly to newcomers.Also, for those who wish to hear an active stream of lectures about the Bitcoin ecosystem there is the Israeli Bitcoin Meetup Group. The group gets together roughly twice a month inside the Google Campus on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. The group has more than 1,800 members, and on average you can find 30-50 people in each meetup.But Tel Aviv is not all about lectures and theory; it’s a city that also puts Bitcoin into practice. The Bitcoin Embassy is a place where Bitcoin entrepreneurs get together to work on Bitcoin-related projects. It’s located in the heart of Tel Aviv’s financial district, amid major banking institution headquarters and across the street from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. It is also a place the community can use to organize different Bitcoin-related events.\n\n“The Embassy, as we call it, is the home of a large community of people from all walks of life, hosting lectures, courses, tutorials, and even the GBA meetings. It provides an open office setting that anyone can use along with a fully stocked fridge and coffee machine. Many consider the Embassy as the Parthenon of Bitcoin.”- Eli Sklar, Bitcoin Ambassador\n\nFor us, bitcoin isn’t just bitcoin - all open trade technologies are within our scope ... One of our core values is transparency. We are among the rare organizations that videotape and upload for public viewing all of our board meetings, allowing everyone to see exactly what is going on.” - Meni Rosenfeld, chairman of the IBA\n\n“As Israel is a live and kicking Bitcoin hub ... we thought it would be a great place to host a large-scale international event... indeed and it was a great success!”- Nimrod Gruber, event organizer.\n\n“The purpose of the Hackathon was to expose new entrepreneurs, designers and developers to the opportunities within Bitcoin and the blockchain, and indeed some of the teams had their first acquaintance with Bitcoin in the event itself.”- Reuven Palatnik, Hackathon co-organizer\n\nEvery Sunday, two events occur at the embassy. The first is the Satoshi Square where Bitcoiners get together to trade bitcoin and discuss different matters. The second is a bitcoin security workshop for beginners.The Israeli Bitcoin Association (IBA) is a nonprofit organization with a mission to ensure that the people of Israel will benefit as much as possible from Bitcoin technology. They hold board meetings at the embassy and also are in charge of leading the Bitcoin meetups. The IBA currently has 150 registered members.The IBA deals with regulatory issues regarding bitcoin in Israel, spreading the word about the digital currency and supporting users, businesses and researchers. The board is elected through a democratic voting process of all of the IBA members.There are four bitcoin ATMs located throughout Tel Aviv. Out of a total of 150 businesses that accept bitcoin in Israel there are almost 50 brick-and-mortar stores that accept bitcoin as payment in the city. The businsess include kindergartens, tattoo parlors, lawyers and even one car repair shop. Since Tel Aviv also has a great nightlife, out of these 50 businesses, 15 are bars and restaurants.Throughout the past year, there have been two notable Bitcoin events in Tel Aviv. The first was Inside Bitcoins Tel Aviv, which was held last year in October. For two days, 350 participants attended lectures from key people such as Vitalik Buterin, Peter Todd and Meni Rosenfeld.The second event was the Bitcoin Hackathon conducted in Israel in March. One hundred participants attended the hackathon, and almost half of them stayed up all night building decentralized apps.Tel Aviv is becoming the leading city for bitcoin adoption in Israel and perhaps in the whole Middle East. While the number of participants in the Bitcoin scene may seem small at first glance, it should be remembered that the entire population of Israel is only 8 million.

This technology could be very beneficial to all Australians, providing a low-cost and fast method of sending low-value payments overseas.""\n\nMoreover, she added that the solution they have created would allow the bank to identify the payment originator of each transaction. This solution, she said, is consistent with bank\'s requirements to comply with anti-money laundering and ""know your customer"" rulings.\n\nANZ, on the other hand, has been in talks with Ripple Labs, the creator of the payment network, and is in the process of investigating the advantages of such a system for its clients, a spokesperson said.\n\nWestpac and ANZ follow the lead of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), which announced on May 29, its plan to integrate Ripple for distant settlements between its subsidiaries.\n\nSpeaking at the launch event of the Australian Information Industry Association, David Whiteind, CEO at CBA said the bank has been testing ""crypto-protocols"" in order ""explore the benefits of intra-bank transfers using these protocols.""\n\nWhile three of Australia\'s ""big four banks,"" are gauging the merits of the Ripple network for global transfers, they are still reluctant on adopting bitcoin, pointing out the lack of regulation and the risks associated with money laundering.\n\nWestpac\'s Rachel Slade said her company is interested in new technology and is currently evaluating bitcoin and the blockchain. However, bitcoin remains a ""watching brief,"" she said.\n\nA spokeswoman for ANZ said the bank has been watching regulatory developments, and although ANZ is looking to offer the latest payment technologies, the banks needs to manage risk and comply with regulatory obligations.\n\nShe said:\n\n""Regulators globally are currently reviewing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to better understand the technology and possible implications, and we would need to see the outcomes of any review before confirming future plans.""\n\nRipple Labs, which announced its intention to expand to the Asia-Pacific region earlier this year, has set up a regional office in Sydney on April 6, in a response to the ""growing demand for Ripple\'s real-time settlement protocol in the region.""\n\nAs of May 7, it was reported that 25 banks and 10 hedges funds had been secretly trialing Ripple, Dilip Rao, managing director of Ripple Labs in Sydney, told the Sydney Morning Herald.', '0\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol“Bitcoin adoption in Venezuela will explode any time now,” one early cryptocurrency adopter in the South American nation confidently predicts. Bitcoin experts argue that the worse an economy is, the more interest there is about the digital currency’s benefits — and Venezuela is a strong candidate for the next bitcoin boom.\n\nStringent controls on access to foreign currency and runaway inflation — last week saw a sudden jump in the unofficial dollar rate to Bs. 400 per dollar — have led to the number of Venezuela’s bitcoin users doubling since 2014, according to data provided by Bitcoin Venezuela.\n\nProtegete de la inflacion,cambia tu cupo cadivi internet cencoex a BITCOIN unete a la revolucion del dinero Venezuela pic.twitter.com/iOgbar8b8g — Bitcoin Venezuela (@BitcoinONG) May 31, 2015 “Protect yourself from inflation, change your Cadivi/Internet/Cencoex dollars to bitcoin and join the money revolution in Venezuela.”\n\nA representative from the country’s leading bitcoin advocacy organization, who wished to remain anonymous, told the PanAm Post that they offer Venezuelans the chance to buy the cryptocurrency online and thus escape the ever-increasing devaluation of the national currency.\n\nThe Venezuelan government enacted strict controls over foreign currency in February 2003 under late former President Hugo Chávez. Citizens looking to travel abroad or shop online are only allowed a limited amount of dollars (for the latter purpose, the government grants them just US$300 per year).\n\nBitcoin’s volatility is a well-known obstacle to widespread adoption, a fact recognized by the spokesman for Bitcoin Venezuela, but he argues that “the price never fluctuates at the same rate as the devaluation of the bolívar, which lost 60 percent of its value in one month.” As such, the virtual currency can serve not only to transfer value, as in remittances, but also to store value.\n\nThe bitcoiner community in Venezuela, gathered in a Facebook group with almost 4,000 members, speaks to the growing interest in the cryptocurrency. “The SurBitcoin exchange is already the second largest in transaction volume in Latin America after Brazil. The growth is evident,” the bitcoin advocate said.\n\nInstead of viewing the currency as an enemy, the administration of President Nicolás Maduro should see it as an ally, he argued: “Bitcoin removes pressure on the exchange market, as thousands of people and firms need foreign currency.”\n\nA member of the Bitcoin Venezuela Facebook group who goes by the handle “Movi Ve” deplored the “brutal” depreciation of the national currency. Today, “the bolívar is just paper,” he wrote.\n\nBitcoin usage started around three years ago in Venezuela. Movi Ve explains that he makes enough to live on from transferring bitcoins. He says the cryptocurrency “is a lifeboat for Venezuelans” and is safer and faster than the black market for dollars, in which “scams are everywhere.”\n\n“Bitcoin makes changing bolívares to dollars much easier and quicker,” he argued.\n\nMounting interest has prompted the community to organize a meet-up next week in an university in Maracaibo, Venezuela’s second-largest city. “I’ll be launching my website with information on bitcoin trading,” Movi Ve added.\n\nAccording to coinmap.org, a website that tracks persons or businesses accepting bitcoin worldwide, there are 17 establishments in Venezuela that accept the digital currency: eight of which are in the capital, Caracas.\n\nCurrency Flight\n\nVenezuelan economist Luis Oliveros explained to the PanAm Post that the supply of foreign currency in Venezuela has plummeted while demand has continued to grow. As a result, Venezuelans “are running” to the black market to find dollars, he says.\n\nThe “Cadivi dollars,” Oliveros explains, were the government’s way of easing up on currency controls. “The Venezuelan government had to find a way to give people traveling abroad dollars. So they made the decision of granting Venezuelans an annual travel quota.”\n\nWith time, the Cadivi quota became smaller and smaller. Nowadays the figure varies depending on the travel destination and duration.\n\n“The quota has always been fixed at a much lower rate [than the unofficial market]. This created incentives for many people to travel, and play the system,” because “those travelers who buy dollars at the official rate are being subsidized by those who stay.”\n\nTranslated by Daniel Duarte.', 'Rancher Labs, which aims to make running Docker containers more manageable, now has $10 million in Series A funding from Mayfield and Nexus Venture Partners to do just that.\n\nSeveral companies from startup Docker Inc. itself to established players like Red Hat (RHT) are building infrastructure products around containerization technology, a lightweight form of virtualization that packs multiple workloads into less hardware.\n\nRancher describes its RancherOS project as a pared-down distribution of the Linux operating system , which is ideal for running containers.\n\nContainers themselves create new layers of technology that can sit on top of clouds, virtual machines, and even physical servers. “We’re developing an infrastructure tier that sits at the same level, and runs anywhere Docker can run,” said Rancher Labs Co-Founder and Vice President of Sales Shannon Williams via email.\n\n“This normalizes all of the crazy differences between clouds, and means apps will run exactly the same, regardless of the infrastructure differences.”\n\nOthers doing somewhat similar things include Weaveworks and ClusterHQ, although Williams would argue that RancherOS is more flexible in what networking and storage technologies customers can use. But it’s not just about startups, industry giants from Amazon (AMZN) Google (GOOG) web services, and Microsoft (MSFT) have all approved the use of containers to some degree.\n\nBased in Cupertino, Calif., Rancher Labs has an interesting pedigree. It was co-founded by Williams and three other former Cloud.com veterans in 2014.\n\nCloud.com, and its CloudStack technology, was later acquired by Citrix Systems [Fortune-stock symbol=”CTSX”]. CloudStack, based on an Apache open-source project, was an early, and some would argue more mature competitor to OpenStack, a free cloud computing software platform.', 'SWIFT Innotribe released a white paper entitled “Power Women in FinTech Index: Bridging the Gender Gap” at the Digital Finance Conference 2015 in Vancouver on June 3.\n\nThe paper is the first in a series planned by Innotribe, and presents a global index of 400 “powerful and impactful” women who “are beating the odds and building careers of their dreams” to occupy top positions in FinTech companies. Co-author Christine Duhaime, a financial regulatory lawyer and the executive director and co-founder of the Digital Finance Institute, writes:\n\n“A growing body of research suggests that organizations founded by women or that take leadership roles by empowering women in FinTech are more innovative and return better financial results.”\n\nThe authors state that the FinTech environment is promising for women because it offers “transformative powers” for success. It is “considered to be a disruptive force to the banking status quo,” as well as an “‘equalizing’ medium,” — for instance, between the banked and the unbanked.\n\nDiversity\n\nGender diversity, however, remains “hindered,” say the two authors, “by the continued stagnation of women in leadership positions and the continued depletion of female technology talent.” For one example, in 2014, there were only 51 female CEOs in Fortune 1000 companies.\n\n“One of the clear results from women we interviewed for the paper,” Duhaime says, “is that we need to fix the industry for inclusiveness, and we need to fix it fast.” Even where women have founded tech companies and assumed top positions in the tech world, their perspectives on women in FinTech are “often missing,” say the authors. Their goal for the report was to “focus on the positive” — the voices of women who have succeeded.\n\nFemale Voices\n\nThe paper includes interviews with seven women, two of whom work in the Bitcoin space for BitPesa. When asked about the “biggest issue facing women in the workplace,” CFO Amy Ludlum said:\n\n“Lack of diversity within women in leadership. A handful of women occupy very powerful positions, and I’m proud that they do, however those women don’t necessarily represent me. Men have hundreds of thousands of professionally successful men to look up to. [...] ‘You can’t be what you can’t see.’”\n\nMin-Si Wang, manager for M&A advisory activities, said “curiosity” is the key characteristic she attributes to her success in the FinTech industry, because it drivers her “to learn about new technology like Bitcoin.”\n\nThe Index\n\nThe authors initially wanted to highlight 100 of the most influential women globally. When they crowdsourced the list, however, they received 300 nominations. They ultimately finalized the list at 435, of which they chose to include 400 whose experiences would provide mentorship and role modeling to women who want to achieve similar successes.\n\nThe list contains several women from blockchain tech-related companies. Besides the two already mentioned, it includes:\n\nCatherine Nicholson, Founder of BlockCypher\n\nCharlene Chen, COO at BitPesa\n\nElizabeth Rossiello, CEO at BitPesa\n\nHannah Kim, Co-Founder and CEO at Volabit\n\nOula Doudin, Founder of BitOasis\n\nThe paper covers existing research that highlights the gender imbalance in FinTech, and offers recommendations for improvement. Innotribe’s next paper in their series, to be published later this month, will cover the voices of Millennials in FinTech.', 'SÃO PAULO - Moedas virtuais não são mais novidade para ninguém e sua rápida ascensão nos últimos meses chamaram atenção do mercado, principalmente em relação à bitcoin .

Anecdotally, this has been the make up of bitcoin\'s core community since the cryptocurrency began, at least if media reports and Internet chatter are to be believed.\n\nBut in 2015, is this still an accurate reflection of its user base worldwide? In our latest research report – Who Really Uses Bitcoin? – we put this theory to the test.\n\nAnalysing nearly 4,000 responses received in our multilingual survey, likely the largest in bitcoin\'s history, the 45-page report provides an in-depth look at who is using bitcoin, who isn\'t and why that matters.\n\nBut more than that, this report attempts to identify ways in which the community that uses the cryptocurrency can expand its reach, moving beyond the current demographic to new groups, with different cultures, economic status and needs.\n\nHighlights include:\n\nA complete profile of the average bitcoin user by age, gender, location and background.\n\nDetailed consumer spending data – how are people acquiring and using their bitcoin?\n\nTips for companies expanding bitcoin\'s technology to emerging markets and underrepresented groups.\n\nExpert insight on bitcoin\'s ""branding problem"" and why improving accessibility is critical.\n\nAt a glance\n\nBy and large, the survey\'s responses paint a picture faithful to the young, white, tech-savvy men that have become the \'poster boys\' of bitcoin.\n\nOf the 3,515 respondents who told us they owned bitcoin, almost 60% were under 35 years old.\n\nDespite a growing number of initiatives such as Bitcoin Women\'s Day, women using bitcoin are still a minority, with over 90% of bitcoin users in our survey identifying as male. Though this figure is a minuscule improvement (5.2%) from the male majority seen in previous surveys.\n\nWith regards to race, 65.8% of respondents in the survey identified as \'White\'. Second came \'Asian\'.\n\nWhile these figures reinforce the young, white, male stereotype, other findings – such as average income – are more surprising. The question of average earnings providing a very even split across all earning brackets. Those earning $50,000–$100,000 came top, at 23.9%. One in five said their household income was below $25,000.\n\nWhile many are tech-savvy, the notion of bitcoin users being \'early adopters\' of technology also stumbled into trouble. Three quarters of respondents said they got into bitcoin after May 2013, and one third began using bitcoin in the last year.\n\nThis data, like any, has its limitations. The four web surveys – offered in Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and English – were propagated across various local interest groups, but were predominantly accessed via CoinDesk\'s main site and social media platforms.\n\nFor this reason, responses are largely linked to our North American and European readership and do not necessarily reflect the profile of bitcoin users outside these regions. For example, our Chinese language survey received comparatively few responses, though there are known to be many cryptocurrency users in the region.\n\nWe have not weighted the results to compensate for this imbalance, but present the findings of the survey as-is.\n\nIn terms of the location of respondents, 49.85% were based in North America, followed by 32.99% in Europe and 9.36% in Asia.\n\nCoinDesk Research\n\nCoinDesk provides world-leading news, analysis and information on digital currencies. Our unique position in the space gives us the opportunity to provide research and in-depth analysis on the pressing issues that surround one of the most exciting emerging technologies around.\n\nWho Really Uses Bitcoin? is the third report in our research series. It follows Cryptocurrency 2.0, an inside look at the companies expanding blockchain technology beyond currency, and the Bitcoin Regulation Report, a primer on the legality of bitcoin worldwide.\n\nPriced at $99, Who Really Uses Bitcoin? is available for purchase on CoinDesk\'s research page.

They can also do the same via regular bank ATMs from their personal bank accounts, with a direct fund transfer.\n\nConvenience store options\n\nIn January, BitoEX, Maicoin\'s competitor, launched bitcoin purchasing at thousands of Taiwan\'s FamilyMart, OK mart and Hi-Life stores, adding the country\'s largest chain, 7-11 last month. The service uses a cellphone number and PIN combination system to transfer bitcoins directly to users\' wallets.\n\nWith MaiWallet, users set up a bitcoin purchase on their phone or tablet, which displays a barcode for a convenience store cashier to scan. Customers not using MaiWallet can still use the service, but will need to use the web interface to generate a code to enter at the convenience store.\n\nThe mobile app is currently available as a closed beta, though anyone can contact the company to request an invite. The company says it is looking at an official release for MaiWallet in late summer or early autumn.\n\nAccount top-ups with physical ATMs are limited to NT$500,000 ($16,200) per day to please AML regulators. Using Taiwan\'s \'eATM\' system with home-based card readers, users are limited to NT$30,000 ($972) a day.\n\nWithin those limits, determined after consultation with local authorities, there is no need for Maicoin customers to provide any ID to use the service.\n\nThe system is purchase-only at this stage, and does not allow users to sell bitcoins in return for cash.\n\nConsumer-oriented exchange\n\nIn operation for just over a year, Maicoin\'s bitcoin exchange services are aimed at the consumer, merchant and remittance markets, rather than professional traders.\n\nIt has raised $2m in venture funding over two rounds, and has over 30,000 registered users. Liu said the company has processed over $4m in consumer and remittance transactions in the past year, though this could not be confirmed.\n\nMaicoin\'s only hiccup came in February with the collapse of alleged bitcoin-based investment scam \'MyCoin\' in Hong Kong. The names, identical when spoken aloud, may still cause confusion but Liu said it has not adversely affected Maicoin\'s business to date.\n\nTaiwan\'s consumer market shows great promise for bitcoin, especially through social media like Facebook, which Liu describes as ""huge"" in the territory.\n\nMaicoin has just launched integration with Facebook Shopping Cart, allowing smaller Taiwanese online merchants to accept bitcoin. The company is also actively reaching out to local hotels, pubs and other bars to begin accepting bitcoin.\n\nRemittance partnerships\n\nMaicoin has also partnered with Philippines exchange and remittance service Coins.ph to serve the large number of Filipino expat workers in Taiwan.\n\nUsing Maicoin and Coins.ph apps, over 78,000 foreign workers in Taiwan can send money to their home countries any time and in any amount, without incurring extra fees.\n\nThis could provide an advantage for workers who only get one day a week off (Sunday) and often spend that day at remittance brokers\' branches transferring their money.\n\nLiu said the biggest hurdle in getting regulatory approval for Maicoin\'s system was its handling of local currency, not bitcoin.\n\n""The conversation here is no longer about the legality of buying and selling bitcoin. It\'s about being a full payment processor. That\'s a huge step forward from last year.""\n\nA recent hackathon at National Taiwan University (NTU ) called \'Bitcoin and Big Data\' attracted over 300 students keen to explore the new field, he said.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But years before Bitcoin was a global phenomenon and the subject of financial speculation, it was a piece of open-source software that was struggling to attract more than a handful of users.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, the Bitcoin software had been up and running for a few months since being launched by a shadowy creator named Satoshi Nakamoto. The software gave out free bitcoins to anyone who downloaded and ran the software, to encourage new participants, but almost no one seemed interested — after all, what would someone do with the free bitcoins?\n\nAn unlikely savior\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto stuck around cryptography forums and an incipient Bitcoin message board, responding with excitement to anyone who expressed interest — but almost no one was there. It was, at this point, that the technology got its savior from an unlikely place: a small dorm room in Helsinki.\n\nWhen Martti Malmi found Bitcoin in the spring of 2009, he was in his second year at the Helsinki University of Technology. Lanky, with birdlike features, Martti shied away from social contact. He was happiest in his room with his computer, writing code, which he had learned to do at age 12, or hammering away at enemies in online games, while listening to heavy metal music on headphones.\n\nA libertarian-leaning lone wolf\n\nMartti’s reclusive, computer-centric life led him to the ideas behind Bitcoin, and ultimately to Bitcoin itself. The internet had allowed a teenage Martti to discover and explore political ideas that were far from the Finnish social democratic consensus. He began following the ideas of the libertarian economists, which encouraged people to create their own destiny, aligned with Martti’s lone-wolf approach to life. Who needs the state when you have talent and ideas?\n\nDuring his college years, Martti had become fascinated by the rise in Scandinavia of the Pirate Party, which promoted technology over political engagement as the way to move society. Napster and other music-sharing services hadn’t waited for politics to reform copyright law; they forced the world to change. As Martti pondered these ideas, he began wondering whether money might be the next thing vulnerable to technological disruption. After a brief spasm of random web searches, Martti had found his way to the primitive website at Bitcoin.org.\n\n""I would like to help with Bitcoin.""\n\nIn his first email to Satoshi Nakamoto, in May 2009, Martti had offered his services:\n\n""I would like to help with Bitcoin, if there’s something I can do,"" he wrote.\n\nBefore reaching out to Satoshi, Martti had written about Bitcoin on anti-state.org, a forum dedicated to the possibility of an anarchist society organized only by the market. Using the screen name Trickster, Martti gave a brief description of the Bitcoin idea and asked for thoughts:\n\n""What do you think about this? I’m really excited about the thought of something practical that could truly bring us closer to freedom in our lifetime :-)""\n\nMartti included a link to this post in his first email to Satoshi, and Satoshi quickly read it and responded.\n\n""Your understanding of Bitcoin is spot on,"" Satoshi wrote back.\n\nA primer to explain Bitcoin to the world\n\nSatoshi quickly gave Martti practical suggestions for how he could help the project. The most important was the simplest: to leave his computer on with the Bitcoin program running. Five months after Bitcoin was launched, it was still not possible to trust that someone somewhere was running the Bitcoin program.\n\nAs to the more complicated programming needs, Satoshi told Martti that there was ""not much that’s easy right now."" But, Satoshi added, the Bitcoin website did need introductory material for beginners and Martti seemed like the right person for the job.\n\n""My writing is not that great — I am a much better coder,"" Satoshi wrote, encouraging Martti to try his hand.\n\nTwo days later, Martti proved Satoshi right by sending a lengthy but accessible document addressing seven basic questions, ready to be posted on the Bitcoin website. Martti provided straightforward, if occasionally stilted, answers to questions like, ""Is Bitcoin safe?"" and ""Why should I use Bitcoin?""\n\nSatoshi liked the document so much that Martti was quickly given full credentials for the Bitcoin website, allowing him to make any improvements he wanted.\n\nWithin a few weeks of his initial exchanges with Satoshi, Martti had totally revamped the Bitcoin website.\n\nThe onslaught of new users was slow to arrive, however. A few dozen people downloaded the Bitcoin program in June, to add to the few hundred who had downloaded it since its original release. Most had tried it once and then turned it off.\n\nBut Martti kept at it. After releasing the new website, Martti turned to the software’s actual underlying code. He did not know C++, the programming language that Satoshi had written Bitcoin in, so Martti began teaching himself.\n\nWorking day and night\n\nMartti had time for all of this because he failed to land a summer programming job — a failure that gave Bitcoin a much needed boost over the next months. Martti got a part-time job through a temp agency, but he would spend many of his days and nights at the university computer lab and find himself emerging at dawn. He and Satoshi communicated regularly and fell into an easy rapport.\n\nWhile Satoshi never discussed anything personal in these emails, he would banter with Martti about little things. In one email, Satoshi pointed to a recent exchange on the Bitcoin email list in which a user referred to bitcoin as a ""cryptocurrency,"" a neologism inspired by the cryptographic functions that made it run.\n\n""Maybe it’s a word we should use when describing bitcoin. Do you like it?"" Satoshi asked.\n\nThey also batted potential improvements to the software back and forth. Martti proposed making Bitcoin launch automatically when someone turned on a computer, an easy way to get more nodes on the network.\n\nNew strategies for expanding the network of miners\n\nSatoshi loved it: ""Now that I think about it, you’ve put your finger on the most important missing feature right now that would make an order of magnitude difference in the number of nodes.""\n\nDespite Martti’s relative lack of programming experience, Satoshi gave him full permission to make changes to the core Bitcoin software on the server where it was stored—something that, to this point, only Satoshi could do. Starting in August, the log of changes to the software showed that Martti was now the main actor. When the next version of Bitcoin, 0.2, was released, Satoshi gave credit for most of the improvements to Martti.\n\nAt about the same time, Martti set up an online forum where the small but growing group of people attracted to the technology could communicate.\n\nMartti was given credit for improvements to Bitcoin itself\n\nThe Bitcoin forum went online in the fall of 2009 and soon attracted a few regulars. One of them, who called himself NewLibertyStandard, talked about the need for a website where people could buy and sell bitcoins for real money. Martti had been talking with Satoshi about something similar, but he was eager to help NewLibertyStandard. In the very first recorded transaction of bitcoin for United States dollars, Martti sent NewLibertyStandard 5,050 bitcoins to use for seeding the new exchange. In return, Martti got $5.02 by PayPal.\n\nIt would still be almost a year before Bitcoin would attract even a moderate following, but Martti Malmi had already proven that bitcoins could be worth real money, and he would help it prove that it could do much more than that. The cryptocurrency has now spawned hundreds of startups, raked in hundreds of millions in venture funding, and made its way from an outsider idea to the boardrooms of nearly every major bank and stock exchange in the world. Martti has continued to be interested in disruptive finance; he now works for MONI, a stealth startup building a bridge between the old and new worlds of financial services. And those bitcoins for which Martti received $5.02? They would be worth roughly $1,196,850 today.\n\nThis is an excerpt from From Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money by Nathaniel Popper Copyright © 2015 by Nathaniel Popper. Reprinted courtesy of Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. It has been edited for clarity and context.', 'So, now we have it. After several attempts and, to the credit of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), much consultation with the nascent Bitcoin industry and its advocates the final version of the regulations for that industry were released last week. Those who have read my ramblings on virtual currency in the past may be aware that I tentatively welcomed the idea of the BitLicense, as it is known, and don’t generally share the morbid fear of regulation that many supporters of digital currencies displayed when the idea of a license was first floated.\n\nIn fact, back in September, when the first draft of the proposed regulations were revealed I wrote that, given the inevitability of regulations of some sort, the fact that NYDFS was asking for industry and Bitcoin community input was a good thing. It suggested that the end product had at least a chance of being reasonable. Being from the world of financial markets, though, I was under no illusion that the finished draft would be perfect. Unfortunately the final document, while probably as good as could be expected, is closer to the fears of others in many ways than to my initial optimism.\n\nSome of the regulations are sensible and, by increasing public confidence in the currency, could give the growing industry a serious boost. Most of the early sections that deal with background checks for company officers and the like make sense. There is no reason that Bitcoin related businesses should be exempt from requirements that apply to other financial concerns, although it should be noted that they don’t stop criminal behavior. Bernie Madoff et al have proven that over the years. What they do, however, is increase consumer confidence, an important development if Bitcoin is to gain widespread acceptance. Similarly, capital and reserve requirements don’t prevent bankruptcy or losses; they just make them slightly less likely. Including virtual currency as an acceptable form of reserve though is a big step towards more general acceptance. Things like requiring companies to have a cyber security policy and to keep records are, again, more about conforming to people’s perceptions of a respectable business than actually preventing any wrongdoing.\n\nUnfortunately the document also contains the kind of ridiculous requirements that are all too familiar to anyone who has worked in the financial services sector, most notably in its section 200.19 (a) which deals with consumer protection. Most of the required warnings that will end up as unread fine print on any document, web page or promotional products emanating from companies involved with Bitcoin are simply pointless and ridiculously obvious. It should go without saying that, as with any currency, Bitcoin’s relative value can fluctuate and depends on people’s willingness to accept it in exchange for goods and services. Making businesses state so explicitly, though, makes it sound as if that is some unique risk of a digital currency. Similarly, the warning in section 200.19 (a) (8) that “The nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack” ignores the fact that virtually all financial transactions between institutions around the globe are conducted virtually, so are just as vulnerable.\n\nEven this might not be as bad as it first seems. I guess the reality is that in the litigious world in which we live, warning people that coffee is hot or that power tools can cause injury is what businesses have to do. Requiring Bitcoin related businesses to do so may serve to protect them at some point in the future. To some extent, such nonsense has become so ubiquitous that most of us simply ignore these warnings and make our own informed assessment of real risk. I hope that will be the case with Bitcoin.\n\nThe real problem, however, is more to do with missed opportunity. Not including a “safe harbor” clause for startup ventures risks leaving innovation and development in the space to existing financial institutions who can afford the licensing process at an early stage; institutions that have an inbuilt interest in maintaining the status quo. In addition, not addressing issues that are unique to Bitcoin, such as key security, is a mistake that will probably have to be rectified. I suspect that both of these omissions will have to be addressed at a later date, but history tells us that adding to regulations once they are in place is not just likely, it is almost inevitable. The community will have to remain vigilant if those additions are to be helpful rather than just increasingly burdensome.\n\nDespite these reservations, though, I believe that ultimately this is momentous news that will be good for the Bitcoin community. There will still be those that see having to provide ID to open an account with a New York based company as an infringement of their rights, or that simply object to any regulation whatsoever on principle. At least for now they will be at liberty to deal only with companies outside the NYDFS’s jurisdiction. Eventually, however, it is likely that areas of the world that don’t have regulated Bitcoin businesses will be like those with unregulated banking now, distrusted dinosaurs. When that day comes, though, it will be as a result of the widespread global acceptance of Bitcoin, something which those of us motivated by utility rather than ideology see as a desirable end. Last week, NYDFS took the first, if somewhat wobbly, step towards that goal.', 'ShapeShift.io founder Erik Voorhees has launched the first iOS cryptocurrency trading app in App Store. With this launch, Apple users can exchange Bitcoin and 34 other virtual currencies with just a tap on their phones.\n\nThe team at ShapeShift has first created an app for the iOS store because they expected “resistance from Apple’s carefully guarded App Store.” However, the company will be rolling out an Android version very soon since most of the consumers are still using Android phones.\n\nSpeaking to Forbes, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange said, “We wanted to do the Apple one first because Apple makes it tricky to get Bitcoin apps approved. It was actually an extremely fluid process. I guess the ghost of Steve Jobs was looking out for us.”\n\nVoorhees expects ShapeShift’s app to increase the number of transactions occurring on the exchange. The exchange received 13,000 orders in May, and is witnessing a phenomenal growth of 20% per month, said Erik. ShapeShift users had been demanding a mobile app to trade Bitcoin at ease. The exchange charges a very low transaction fee on trading orders.\n\nShapeShift does not store any currency or user information, thereby eliminating the risk of users’ funds being compromised in a Mt. Gox-type attack. The same security principles will apply to the newly introduced mobile app as well.\n\n“We don’t ever have to hold customer money like a normal exchange. It’s a definite advance for consumer protection because there’s no risk of hacking or of the operators running away with money.”\n\nAbout Erik Voorhees\n\nIn 2012, Voorhees co-founded the Bitcoin transfer company Coinapult and worked as the Head of Marketing at BitInstant before founding ShapeShift in 2014. ShapeShift remains unprofitable till date, but Voorhees hopes to reverse this performance as more and more users join the cryptocurrency exchange platform.', 'It’s a small deal that is a sign of a larger trend: Mexican bitcoin exchange Bitso has acquired another, smaller Mexican bitcoin exchange, Unisend. The value of the deal has not been shared.\n\nBitso, the larger of the two parties, is still a very small operation. As bitcoin news site Coindesk reports, Bitso’s trading volume in the last 24 hours amounted to 33.4 BTC—less than $10,000 worth of bitcoin—which is less than 1% the size of the leading U.S. bitcoin exchange, Coinbase.\n\nSo why is this important? Bitso buying Unisend is an effort to achieve scale in the burgeoning bitcoin market in Mexico. It is also a sign of further consolidation among bitcoin exchanges, which began cropping up across the world in the last two years. (For example Coinbase, which grabbed an investment from the New York Stock Exchange, got a considerable deal of attention when it launched.)\n\nIn the past year, a U.S. bitcoin exchange, Coinsetter, bought out Canadian exchange Cavirtex; another Canadian exchange, Vault of Satoshi, shut down; an Indian exchange, BTCXIndia, shut down; and now this Mexico merger.\n\nWhen Coinsetter announced its acquisition of Cavirtex in April, Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz told Fortune, “We expect to do and see more of this. I look at this as the beginning of a broader consolidation of the space.” He may have been precisely right.\n\nBitso CEO Pablo Gonzalez echoed the sentiment, telling Coindesk today, “Consolidation makes sense at this point, in preparation for the huge potential that we see coming with remittance partners poised to begin activity over the bitcoin rail.”\n\nRead more Fortune coverage of digital currency:\n\nThis lawsuit could sink one of the hottest bitcoin companies\n\nSwitzerland is a bitcoin capital.

Consolidation makes sense at this point, in preparation for the huge potential that we see coming with remittance partners poised to begin activity over the bitcoin rail.""\n\nBitso, which acquired Unisend Mexico for an undisclosed amount, will be taking on Jose Rodriguez, its former CEO, as vice president of payments.\n\nCommenting on the acquisition, Rodriguez was confident the new team would accelerate growth and surpass competitors Volabit and Mexbt to become the leading bitcoin exchange in the country.\n\nFomer Unisend customers will be migrated to Bitso, according to the pair.\n\nBoom and bust\n\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, Bitso launched an e-commerce platform and point-of-sale (POS) system, BitsoPagos in January this year.\n\nGonzalez, who said the bitcoin market is set to ""boom"", seemed positive about the digital currency\'s future, noting how it could help Mexico\'s remittance market and cross-border payments.\n\nThe merger follows the closure of various bitcoin exchanges including Canada\'s CARVITEX – later acquired by New York platform Coinsetter in April – and Vault of Satoshi.\n\nElsewhere, BTCXIndia shut down operations in May.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.\n\nMexican flag image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Now, Symbiont has announced that it has secured $1.25 million of seed funding from influential financial market leaders including Duncan Niederauer, former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). A ‘Series A’ round of institutional investment is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015.\n\n“Symbiont is bridging the gap between Wall Street and the emerging blockchain ecosystem,” said Niederauer. “It’s an exciting, timely and much-needed development for the long-term health of the markets.”\n\n“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leverage this previously unimaginable technology for the greater good of investors, financial institutions, and global financial markets,” said Smith, co-founder and CEO of Symbiont. “The blockchain not only has the potential to democratize markets but to drive down the cost of doing business across all sectors.”\n\nThe Financial Times notes that the investment reflects growing interest by professional traders and infrastructure providers in the use of blockchain technology for global financial markets. Symbiont is developing a platform that allows market participants to create digital, programmable versions of securities. The company hopes the development of these securities, and their availability in one global, decentralized peer-to-peer network, will increase efficiency and transparency and lower the cost of issuing, trading, settling and clearing securities.\n\nReuters reports that Smith emphasized that the company does not run an exchange.\n\n“Our focus is not trading digital currencies,” said Smith. “Our focus is the application of the blockchain or distributed ledger technology in conjunction with smart contracts for the issuance, management, trading, clearing, and settlement of different traditional financial securities.”\n\nSymbiont isn’t the only company trying to revolutionize the stock markets with the blockchain technology. Nasdaq, a prestigious stock exchange and leading financial institution, recently announced that it will leverage blockchain technology as part of an enterprise-wide initiative, starting with a pilot project in Nasdaq Private Market, a recently launched marketplace that handles pre-IPO trading among private companies.\n\n“Utilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,” said Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld. “Our initial application of Nasdaq’s blockchain technology-enabled offering will modernize, streamline and secure typically cumbersome administrative functions, and will simplify the overwhelming challenges private companies face with manual ledger record-keeping.”\n\nOverstock is developing a new independent stock exchange dubbed Medici, powered by blockchain technology. The new stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet.\n\n“The cryptorevolution has arrived on Wall Street,” said Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. “We’re making it official by offering the world’s first ‘cryptosecurity.’”\n\nIn 2014, Counterparty’s technology was selected as the main software backbone for Medici. It was later revealed that Medici will include a wider variety of Bitcoin technologies, protocols and blockchains, but now it appears that Counterparty’s technology will play an important role in the emergent cryptosecurities sector via Symbiont.\n\n“After studying the intricacies of [the blockchain] it became clear that blockchains in general, and Counterparty specifically, could solve longstanding, previously intractable problems that exist in modern financial markets,” Smith said in March. “This epiphany made the decision to join forces with the Counterparty team a logical one.”\n\nplaceholder', 'Bitcoin businesses have been getting a lot of attention in recent months. Some of that new attention can be attributed to massive VC funding flowing into the world of digital currency. If this trend continues, the Bitcoin industry will surpass the $1 billion USD mark in VC funding will be passed before the end of the year.\n\nAlso read: CleverCoin Incubated by Boost VC: Exclusive Interview\n\nSolving A Critical Issue\n\n\n\nThere are two critical issues when it comes to digital currency. Issue number one is the fact that the concept of digital currency is rather difficult to explain unless you are talking with tech-savvy people. Then again, the direction of that conversation also depends on your personal approach towards explaining Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, even if most people may not fully grasp the technological concept of Bitcoin, that doesn’t mean they are not interested in the currency. In fact, a lot of people are intrigued by the somewhat mysterious nature of cryptocurrency and are eager to learn more. Plus, some individuals — or even companies — may want to invest some money into cryptocurrency. But how do you go about that in a quick, easy, and convenient manner?\n\nThat brings us to problem number two: there is a very steep learning curve for cryptocurrency, especially if you are looking at it from the point of view of an investor. Furthermore, the world of Bitcoin and digital currency has been plagued by scams, making it rather difficult to navigate the waters as a novice user.\n\nAll of that does not change the fact that Bitcoin and the blockchain have a ton of potential. We are only starting to scratch the tip of the iceberg of what we can use this technology for, and investors are starting to understand Bitcoin’s potential.\n\nBitcoin Capital: Equity Crowdfunding for Cryptocurrency\n\n\n\nIn order to bypass all of the “geeky stuff” and “due diligence” associated with cryptocurrency investing, a high-risk high-reward investment fund has been created. Bitcoin Capital will be managed by Max Keiser — entrepreneur, investor and financial journalist — and Simon Dixon — ex-investment banker, entrepreneur, investor, and Co-Founder of BnkToTheFuture.\n\nBitcoin Capital wants to offer something to both large and small investors. Investing in Bitcoin Capital will serve two purposes. On the one hand, this venture capital fund will be investing the raised money in high-profile startup companies in the Bitcoin, Blockchain and Crypto ecosystem. On the other hand, Bitcoin Capital offers investors a way of generating a passive revenue stream. Dividends are paid out — in Bitcoin — every day. In doing so, Bitcoin Capital becomes the very first fund to pay out daily dividends in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Capital will fund its daily dividend payouts by investing one-third of all raised funds into Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin Capital will invest other parts of the funds into key areas of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin itself, as well as other digital currencies. The end goal is to give every investor full exposure to the growth of blockchain technology. The blockchain is responsible for powering the Bitcoin network, and the technology is being experimented with by various companies.\n\nMax Keiser told Bitcoinist that:\n\n“I have been critical of the traditional financial system for many years on my show — Keiser Report. I was the first global news outlet to cover Bitcoin when it was trading at $3 recognising its potential to change the world. Many startups in the Bitcoin space credit Keiser Report for getting them started in the business. Bitcoin Capital allows the founders and investors to experiment with new crypto financial business models and currencies to transform global finance.”\n\nOvershooting the Funding Goal\n\nWhen the Bitcoin Capital campaign was launched on BnkToTheFuture.com, some steep goals were set in order to make this campaign a success. To have the slightest chance of success, a minimum amount of 223,974 EUR had to be raised. Accepted payment methods included Bitcoin, Startcoin, all major credit cards and bank transfer.\n\nHowever, that is a rather conservative number, as both Max Keiser and Simon Dixon were hoping to raise the full 895,997 EUR needed to fully fund Bitcoin Capital’s launch. As of press time, that goal was overshot by quite a margin, raising a total of 1,148,927 EUR — which amounts to approximately $1,297,460 USD. No less than 619 investors have backed the Bitcoin Capital project, and there are still a few hours left on the clock.\n\nSimon Dixon, Co-Founder of BnkToTheFuture, told Bitcoinist:\n\n“There is so much happening with peer to peer, CrowdFunding, Bitcoin and Blockchain technology that it is taking the investment community and financial sector by surprise. We know the sector inside-out and provide a very easy way for investors to get started and be directly involved in the future of finance. If the sector turns out to be as big as we think it will be, investors can benefit from the growth of the alternative finance and Bitcoin sector as a whole.”\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Bitcoin Capital and the BnkToTheFuture equity Crowdfunding platform?

We do not have a complicated and expensive vetting process for advertisers. If we start to receive complaints about their services, as we have with BCS, we look into them straight away. We contacted the company after receiving complaints from readers who have not received payouts, and after a reasonable period we did not receive any response.\n\nThere are others in the news space who wish to use this as an opportunity to question our credibility, but here we are, telling the story, not hiding anything.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Scam Alert – BTCFlap.com\n\nBitcoin Cloud Services advertised with us for a couple of months. After receiving complaints and receiving no response from the company this week, we’ve decided to cancel their advertising contract and expose them here on CCN. We will do this with any bad business who comes our way.\n\nUnresponsive, Not Paying\n\nThe company has not made its payouts for several days, a sure sign that a Ponzi scheme is winding down. The way a Ponzi works, if you don’t know, is that new money is used to pay old buyers. Eventually new sales slow down, and the scam operator is unable to continue paying old buyers. That’s most likely what’s happening with BCS. With cloud mining scams, users are encouraged to continue re-investing their funds, so as to make even more money. In too many cases, users have eventually found themselves with nothing at all to show for their investment.\n\nA user wrote to us just this morning, saying:\n\nThought you’d like to know that this BTC mining company is not paying out on contracts, not replying to emails and not answering the phones. Yet they are still taking new orders!\n\nIndeed, nothing happens when you call the phone numbers listed on their site. It’s a very common feature of the more obvious Bitcoin scams out there: there’s a phone number, which provides a certain level of comfort to the mark. But when you call, you’re encouraged to leave a message that will never be returned.\n\nAnother outlet has also rightly pointed out that the hardware displayed on their website is most likely faked. Further, a simple analysis of their payouts make it appear that they have not made enough to make payouts, essentially operating at a loss. Now for several days they have failed to make any payouts at all, while still taking new orders.\n\nThus, all we can do is tell you to avoid them. Advertising is advertising; you should never trust it without research, no matter if you trust the outlet displaying it. Mining is not as easy as depositing funds into an account at some far-off “cloud mining” plant and letting it roll up into more money. That’s now how mining works. Mining is a very difficult, low-margin investment which can often lead to losses even if you’re not trusting someone else to do it for you. If you’re looking to invest your Bitcoin, find a good business plan on BTCJam.com, invest in other cryptocurrencies, or something like that. Because to date, most cloud mining has proven to be a low-profit endeavor when not an outright scam.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
06/11/2015,"['A 17-year-old Virginia teen faces up to 15 years in prison for blog and Twitter posts about encryption and Bitcoin that were geared at assisting ISIL, which the US has designated as a terror organization.\n\nThe teen, Ali Shukri Amin, who contributed to the Coin Brief news site, pleaded guilty (PDF) Thursday to a federal charge of providing material support to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\n\nFurther Reading Islamic State takes to social media, has about 46K Twitter accounts Dana Boente, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said the youth\'s guilty plea ""demonstrates that those who use social media as a tool to provide support and resources to ISIL will be identified and prosecuted with no less vigilance than those who travel to take up arms with ISIL.""\n\nAccording to the defendant\'s signed ""Admission of Facts"" filed Thursday, Amin started the @amreekiwitness Twitter handle last June and acquired some 4,000 followers and tweeted about 7,000 times. (The Twitter handle has been suspended.) Last July, the teen tweeted a link on how jihadists could use Bitcoin ""to fund their efforts.""\n\nAccording to Amin\'s court admission (PDF):\n\nThe article explained what Bitcoins were, how the Bitcoin system worked and suggested using Dark Wallet, a new Bitcoin wallet, which keeps the user of Bitcoins anonymous. The article included statements on how to set up an anonymous donations system to send money, using Bitcoin, to the mujahedeen.\n\nIn August, the youth tweeted that the Khilafah—Islam\'s political system and messenger—needed an official website ""ASAP"" and that ISIL should stop releasing propaganda ""in the wild"" and instead should consider using JustPaste.it.\n\n""Through various tweets, the defendant provided information on how to prevent the website from being taken down, by adding security defenses, and he solicited others via Twitter to assist on the development of the website,"" according to his signed admission.\n\nOn his blog, the boy ""authored a series of highly technical articles targeted at aspiring jihadists and ISIL supporters detailing the use of security measures in online communications to include the use of encryption and anonymity software, tools and techniques, as well as the use of the virtual currency Bitcoin as a means to anonymously fund ISIL.""\n\nSentencing for the honor student at Osbourn Park High School of Manassas is scheduled for August 28. The boy remains jailed.\n\nAmin\'s lawyer, Joseph Flood, said his client\'s motivation was religion and distaste for the Syrian government. ""Sometimes people feel frustrated in their inability to effect change against a government committing atrocities,"" Flood said. ""He was blogging on the Internet. It\'s as simple as that.""\n\nAmin is also accused of radicalizing an 18-year-old Virginia youth, Reza Niknejad, who traveled to Syria in January to join ISIL. Niknejad was charged Wednesday with conspiring to provide material support to ISIL and conspiring to kill and injure people abroad. Amin admitted that he helped Niknejad get a mobile phone, assisted him with travel, and hooked him up with ISIL supporters overseas.\n\nHe also said he delivered a letter from Niknejad to his family. The letter said that Niknejad ""did not plan to see his family again.""', 'It’s been barely a week since the BitLicense was released, and it has already driven a bitcoin startup out of New York.\n\nShapeShift.io, a bitcoin startup that allows people to quickly exchange digital currencies without an account or arduous signup process, has completely cut off service to New York in response to the state’s new regulatory policy for digital currency businesses. The BitLicense, which was finalized last week, sparked fear among the bitcoin community during its revision process over the past year, and now that it is out, has courted criticism for the various licenses and approvals it requires of companies that store and transmit money for customers. It is seen as too stringent and restrictive of innovation.\n\nThe BitLicense backlash began last week with official statements and responses from bitcoin startup executives as well as policy pundits. ShapeShift is the first business to promptly ‘get out of dodge’ in response to the policy. (Bitcoin wallet provider Xapo moved its headquarters to Switzerland last month, but stated that it was not out of fear of regulation.)\n\nThe company has suspended service to all users in New York State, and is redirecting its homepage for Internet visitors there to PleaseProtectConsumers.org, with a long note about the issue of identity theft and how bitcoin and the blockchain can prevent it.\n\nThe current homepage of ShapeShift.io, after the company cut off New York.\n\nA blunt passage toward the end of the text reads: “Bitcoin and blockchain technology have enabled a new standard of financial privacy and consumer protection… Unfortunately, in spite of the technological achievements that now protect consumers, some jurisdictions have legally mandated the continued extraction of sensitive private information.” Then it lists those jurisdictions; they are New York State and North Korea. That likely isn’t the company, in terms of privacy law, New York wants to keep. ShapeShift is inviting other digital currency companies to do the same: cut off service to New York and redirect its web site there to the PleaseProtectConsumers page.\n\nIt is quite a statement by a buzzy startup and a big name in the bitcoin community.\n\nWhile Shapeshift has so far raised only a seed round of just under $1 million from Roger Ver (nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus”) and Barry Silbert (founder of the Digital Currency Group), CEO Erik Voorhees is a widely followed voice in the digital currency world who founded Coinapult and worked at BitInstant. Vorhees founded ShapeShift and ran it using an alias at first until he came out as its CEO in March.\n\nWhen the Bitlicense was announced last week, Voorhees tweeted that “California is winning.” ShapeShift investor Roger Ver, meanwhile, tweeted a longer screed:\n\n#BitLicense pic.twitter.com/ajJ8Wp9jKA\n\n— Roger Ver (@rogerkver) June 3, 2015\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\n“Since New York has mandated unethical and dangerous data collection of users, we have no choice but to suspend service to that territory,” Voorhees said in a strongly worded public statement on Thursday. “We hope other jurisdictions will be less reckless with the private information of their residents. Finally digital commerce can be safe—if only regulators would let it happen.”\n\nThe chief architect of the BitLicense, Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the NY Department of Financial Services, announced last month that he would step down from his post at the end of June. Before he went out the door, he found time to release his regulatory policy. Many in the bitcoin community are hoping his yet-to-be-named successor might later come up with a friendlier one.\n\nAs for ShapeShift’s big move, the NYDFS had this to say, in a statement sent to Fortune: “We always recognized that there is going to be some part of this community that is against even pretty standard financial regulatory oversight measures, such as anti-money laundering controls and other consumer protections. That said, one digital currency company has already received a license from NYDFS and a number of others have stated they intend to seek BitLicenses shortly. Ultimately, we believe that prudent regulation will be important to building greater consumer confidence in digital currency and sparking wider adoption.”', 'Global Singapore-based bitcoin payment processing startup and mobile wallet GoCoin has announced that the company is set to proceed with a strategic merger agreement with veteran e-commerce and credit card processing company Ziftr.\n\nTogether, the two companies will offer a combined payment processing platform specifically targeted to merchants.\n\nGoCoin’s decision to enter into a merger with Ziftr was greatly influenced by the continuous decline of their bitcoin platform’s transaction volumes, GoCoin explained. “With a growing number of marquee brands consistently coming on our platform only to become disenchanted due to low transaction volumes, GoCoin will no longer sit back and wait for change to come.”\n\nTogether, the two companies aim to rise above international competitors including Bitpay and Coinbase, by providing better tools and features with incentives for everyday purchases for its users. According to their press release, GoCoin and Ziftr are already equipped with the team and technology needed to “swiftly surpass” well established bitcoin payment processors and financial institutions.\n\nWith the existing payment gateways and the mobile wallet of GoCoin, Ziftr plans to aggressively challenge its competitor, Stripe, through the development of “a hybrid traditional and digital currency payments powerhouse with a built-in customer loyalty program.\n\nGoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard announced, ""When consumers ask \'what\'s in it for me?\', Bitcoin has a serious adoption problem. Loyalty points play a key role in a consumer\'s choice of payment method, and with the ziftrCOIN loyalty platform integrated into the ziftrWALLET, I believe we can finally give consumers the right experience to choose digital currencies over cards at checkout.""\n\nGoCoin is currently the world’s third largest blockchain payment processor, just behind Bitpay and Coinbase. With a diversified portfolio of clients which includes top mining companies such as Bitfury, Zoomhash, Hashpros and KnCminer and global brands including Shopify, CheapAir and Paypal, GoCoin plans to develop a platform efficient for many industries with the help of Ziftr. As of now, the company hopes to attract key players in the entertainment industry, specifically film producers and distributers.\n\n""Ziftr has many of the necessary assets to accelerate mainstream adoption of digital currency, so merging with GoCoin and gaining access to its rapidly growing network of merchants gives our combined altcoin-friendly company the power to truly disrupt the $20 trillion global payments market,"" Bob Wilkins, CEO of Ziftr commented. ""Our platform will allow merchants of all sizes to benefit from the transparency and efficiency of blockchain payments by giving them a better solution than what\'s currently available.”\n\nAs Wilkins explained, GoCoin’s network of merchants grew rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2014, it was responsible for 37 percent of all new merchants accepting digital currency including dogecoin, litecoin and bitcoin.\n\nWhile the plans for the unified platform of GoCoin and Ziftr have not been released just yet, the large user base and rapidly growing networks for both companies could be a key factor for the merger to bring the services and platforms of these two companies to a new level given the synergies.', ""Blockstream recently released their long-anticipated, initial version, of a sidechain protocol called Sidechain Elements. This project has the potential to greatly extend the usability of Bitcoin, perhaps even solving major problems like the infamous transaction limit that threatens Bitcoin's scalability.\n\nThe company, and talented staff, received $21 Million in Venture Capital funding last November. Many bitcoin professionals and enthusiasts have been anxiously waiting to hear more about the resulting sidechain project, previously hinted at in their whitepaper.\n\nThe announcement coincided with a blog post, a new website, and even a 47-minute long in depth video by developer Gregory Maxwell explaining the whole system. The vision of how exactly sidechains are going to work and benefit us all is starting to become clear.\n\nA useful way to visualize a sidechain is to imagine an off-blockchain service, such as an exchange like Coinbase, that holds your bitcoins and lets you use a platform. Off-blockchain services can move transactions away from the Bitcoin blockchain, avoiding a range of issues including blockchain bloat.\n\nSidechains are essentially smart contracts, or computer protocols that can facilitate and enforce the fulfilment of an agreement. Sidechains can lock up your bitcoins in exchange for tokens on a secondary blockchain, and can be retrieved by returning the tokens. These alternative blockchains can behave very differently than the Bitcoin blockchain. This negates the use of Proof of Burn, often seen in crowdsales, which can make Bitcoins permanently unusable.\n\nAlthough it's tempting to think of a sidechain as an altcoin that is backed by bitcoin, the tokens on the sidechain aren't independent of Bitcoin, and don't even exist when bitcoin isn't locked in. A major reason that many altcoins were created, according to their creators, was to improve upon the shortfalls of Bitcoin. Many were designed with faster confirmation times, while citing bitcoin's ten-minute confirmations as being too slow for practical use. Others power decentralized applications, such as social media platforms and financial services, while some even offset carbon emissions and reward solar power producers.\n\nSidechain Elements is a protocol, that once fully developed, will allow many different vendors and projects to make their own sidechains. One day we may see thousands of sidechains, or perhaps not see any of them at all, calling all of it simply Bitcoin.\n\nThe proposed uses for sidechains don't seem to ever stop coming in. They could address a range of issues, and add an even bigger range of features:\n\nFar higher transaction (TPS) bandwidth: Solving one of the largest problem bitcoin faces today.\n\nMore divisibility: Smaller-than-satoshi units.\n\nSuper-duper-smart contracts: Allowing functionality we can't imagine yet.\n\nAdvanced privacy features: A truly anonymous coin could be possible.\n\nReversible transactions: Allowing chargebacks finally.\n\nCredit: Bitcoin deposits could act as collateral for a credit account on the sidechain.\n\nBlockchain size relief: Wallets on a sidechain could be full clients, that are tiny.\n\nFaster confirmation times: The sidechain could have any conceivable confirmation rate.\n\nLegacy banking instruments: Banks could keep control over their own digital currencies.\n\nWith so many uses it's no wonder that a half dozen Bitcoin core developers, and many other talented people, were attracted to this project. Sidechain Elements could conceivably become a standard inclusion of Bitcoin itself one day, if it is found to be universally useful.\n\nWhile Sidechain Elements is still in Alpha, the protocol is unavailable for general consumption. The alpha testing tokens are created when Testnet bitcoins are held in a specific smart contract known, as a two-way peg. Pegged bitcoins are held in exchange for tokens on the alpha testing sidechain. Using a two-way peg also means that pre-mining, a practice often associated with scams, can be avoided.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to expect many altcoins, specifically those that have functionality that sidechains can replace, will die off in rapid succession after the full release of Sidechain Elements, whenever that comes. Some altcoins are truly unique though, and we have yet to see which ones will survive this potentially massive upgrade to the ecosystem.\n\nA common questions about sidechains is why colored coins can't simply be used for these new functions, without the peg. They are, after all, smart contracts themselves. It turns out that colored coins are incompatible with Bitcoin’s Simplified Payment Verification (SPV). It wasn't always that way, but this problem was the result of a trade-off that bitcoin developers had to make during a previous version upgrade.\n\nSidechain Elements alpha release is currently based completely around a group of centralized servers. In future versions the protocol will run on a more decentralized network, but for now there are just seven servers. When users enter into a Sidechain Elements contract they’ll be sending testnet bitcoins to a 5-of-7 multisignature address, with one key stored on each server.\n\nThese servers also double as the mining network for the Sidechain Elements blockchain, and are the only nodes that can mine it. All of this is done with smart contracts, making it impossible for humans to interfere with the storage or release of bitcoins.\n\nThe future for Sidechain Elements looks bright, but not yet certain. Developers are being encouraged to download the Alpha Elements Client, gets some bitcoin Testnet coins, and start creating and testing as much as possible. Blockstream's president, Dr. Adam Back, the inventor of the mining process Satoshi used to create bitcoin, hashcash, recently expressed his desire that the release of Sidechain Elements would drive the bitcoin community to contribute to the open source project. There is no target date set yet for a fully-developed, production-ready client, but with the working alpha client now in the community's hands the development time should be greatly reduced."", 'The developers of OpenBazaar, the open-source decentralized marketplace protocol, have received $1m in seed funding.\n\nThe project received backing from venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, and angel investor and board member William Mougayar.\n\nOpenBazaar aims to enable broader peer-to-peer e-commerce, free from the privacy and economic concerns attributed to more centralized models, using bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\n\nThe announcement comes more than a year after DarkMarket, the proof-of-concept decentralized market on which OpenBazaar is based, won the hackathon at the Bitcoin Expo Toronto in April 2014. OpenBazaar, later forked from DarkMarket, has since released several beta versions, with the most recent, dubbed \'Portobello\', launched in late April.\n\nThe funding will be used to support several full-time developers, as well as enable the creation of OB1, a new company that will develop services for future OpenBazaar users.\n\nUnion Square Ventures managing partner Brad Burnham told CoinDesk his firm became involved with the project in a bid to support continued innovation that utilizes the blockchain, which he said is key to ""opening up markets again"".\n\nBurnham said he sees OpenBazaar serving a critical role in the development of a new kind of shared public data layer that will reduce the commercial barriers that exist between companies and their customers, explaining:\n\n""There are going to be a few public companies that provide some basic building blocks and we are trying to make some investments in those companies, and we think OpenBazaar is one of them.""\n\nDecentralized commerce\n\nBoth Mougayar and Burnham said the development of OpenBazaar and its underlying concept of decentralized commerce is deeply intertwined with the growth of bitcoin and the blockchain itself.\n\nMougayar, who advises technology startups and is also an investor in ChangeTip, said he has been following the project since DarkMarket won the hackathon in Toronto last year.\n\n""Open, peer-to-peer commerce is as much about an ideology as it is about a creative implementation of the bitcoin blockchain technology using multi-sigs and Ricardian contracts as the basis,"" he said.\n\nThose backing the project say they don\'t support the utilization of the technology for illegal trade, a use case cited by some who see OpenBazaar as a way for dark web markets to flourish without any centralized points of failure. Sellers could use the peer-to-peer nature of OpenBazaar to trade directly instead of through a centrally controlled marketplace, thereby avoiding the kinds of operational weaknesses that ultimately led to the downfall of Silk Road.\n\nBurnham acknowledged that the protocol could be used by dark market operators, but stressed the OpenBazaar developers have no interest in supporting such use cases.\n\n""They certainly won’t be in the business of providing enhanced services to marketplaces that are selling illegal goods,"" he noted.\n\nBurnham pointed to the creation of protocols like HTTP and SMTP as evidence that legitimate use cases can quickly outpace any potentially illegitimate purposes that may arise during the early stage of development.\n\n""[Protocols are] neither good or bad – they can be used for both. But those particular protocols have proven to be incredibly valuable to society,"" he concluded.\n\nDollars image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

I truly believe that [because of the] 4 billion people who live on cash today. It is the biggest step forward in the democratisation of money we\'ve ever seen,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nWidely referred to as the digital currency\'s ""patient zero"" – a term coined by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman – the entrepreneur is credited with spreading the word about the digital currency throughout Silicon Valley and reticent financiers on Wall Street. A mission which, he said, has drawn laughter from skeptics. ""Bitcoin sounds a little like science fiction at first.""\n\nIt seems Casares is used to dealing with technology skeptics. Hailed with launching Argentina\'s first Internet service provider (ISP), he recalls speaking to the CEO of Telefonica – a Spanish telecommunications giant – about the Internet in the early 1990s, urging the executive to pay attention to the emerging revolutionary technology to little avail.\n\nAlthough the comparison between the Internet and bitcoin is not new, Casares regurgitates it convincingly, drawing on his own personal experience:\n\n""Bitcoin is exactly the same thing, but for money. It moves money from anywhere to anywhere, in real-time, for free and no one controls it and no one can stop it.""\n\nPatience is key, he added. ""We don\'t have to get anxious and think that we have to create some really glamorous fancy use case for bitcoin. A year ago there were five million using it. Today there\'s about 12 million people using it. It\'s just growing organically.""\n\nA solution for a real problem\n\nHaving grown up in Argentina, the entrepreneur was exposed to an unstable economy, stifled by hyperinflation, currency controls and the confiscation of bank accounts. His family, he said, survived ""all kinds of crazy things, the kind that you never forget"".\n\nAs an entrepreneur, Casares set out to help the unbanked, continuing his attempts to integrate technology into financial services. His initial enthusiasm, however, began to flag when he started considering that an attainable solution would not emerge in his lifetime. Then came bitcoin.\n\n""When I saw bitcoin, I said oh my god, this is the chance. It is going to change the lives of 5 billion people. It make take 10 years, 20 years, but who cares, this is what the Internet took and look at the impact it has had.""\n\nArgentina, he said, is one of the most real-use cases for the digital currency as it is helping solve a real problem. ""What I like about Argentina is that it\'s very real. People using bitcoin do not know technology, they are not financially savvy. They are every day people using bitcoin, not because they think it\'s cool or glamorous but because it solves a problem. I think that\'s really powerful.""\n\nIn his opinion, bitcoin may not work in countries like the United States where people trust the fiat currency. ""It [the dollar] is a currency that they feel has served them, their parents and grandparents well. People have credit cards and they can pay online. Why would they want to fix something that is not broken.""\n\nBitcoin vs blockchain\n\nCasares is openly skeptical about the ongoing – and increasingly popular – blockchain tech trend, which has seen many mainstream financial institutions and prominent figures hail the distributed ledger\'s disruptive potential while undermining bitcoin as a digital currency.\n\n""I think that most people who say that do not understand what they\'re talking about,"" said Casares, adding ""I think that they are trying to be politically correct.""\n\nBack in the day, he explained, executives or business people were reluctant to go on-record to comment on the Internet\'s promise, in fear of any public backlash if it failed to succeed.\n\nTraditional finance organisations, said Casares, do not want to say anything positive about bitcoin. Instead, they insist on using a very convoluted argument that praises blockchain tech, but dismisses the digital currency. ""It\'s childish,"" he added.\n\nWith regards to banks\' incessant desire to innovate and propagate disruptive technology such as the blockchain, Casares dismissed this, saying: ""They are not even dipping their toe.""\n\nA future with bitcoin\n\nA honed businessman, Casares founded Patagon, which quickly established itself as Latin America\'s first comprehensive Internet financial services portal and expanded its online banking services abroad, to the US, Spain and Germany, and was later purchased for $750m in 2000 by Spanish bank Banco Santander.\n\nSince then, Casares has embarked on various business ventures, all of which he subsequently sold.\n\nWhen asked if Xapo will be the only startup he\'ll keep, he said:\n\n""I want to dedicate the rest of my career to help bitcoin succeed. I want do it from one permanent platform and I want that platform to be Xapo.""\n\nHe added: ""I don\'t need to sell a company, I don\'t want to and I am more motivated with helping bitcoin succeed than making money or selling a company.""\n\nOn the topic of Xapo, the company made the news recently after online identity firm LifeLock – which purchased Casares\' previous company Lemon, a digital wallet platform, for $42.6m in December 2013 – named the entrepreneur and his former colleagues in a criminal complaint, alleging contract violations.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in August 2014, alleges breach of contract and fiduciary duties against Casares; Cindy McAdam president and general counsel and Federico Murrone; founder and COO. LifeLock says that Xapo\'s software and related intellectual property was ""developed by Lemon\'s employees, in Lemon\'s facilities, on Lemon\'s computers, and on Lemon\'s dime"".\n\nCasares declined to comment on the ongoing suit. These troubles aside, Casares is optimistic about the future and hopes the work he is involved in will have a lasting impact.\n\n""When I am old and I go back to Patagonia with my grandkids, hopefully they\'ll ask me what I did with my career and I\'ll say that I helped a little for bitcoin to succeed.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""When CoinTelegraph asked the Bitcoin Wallet software providers listed on bitcoin.org, they showed broad support for increasing the Bitcoin block size limit from 1 to 20 MB.\n\nThe teams behind Bitcoin Wallet, Bread Wallet, Coinomi, mSIGNA, Electrum, MultiBit and Armory all indicated they support Gavin Andresen's proposal to increase the block size, which would allow for a greater number of transactions to be handled by the Bitcoin network. GreenAddress was the only opponent, as covered on Monday regarding web-wallet providers' stance on the block size issue.\n\nMost of the software providers acknowledged that raising the block-size limit would come with a trade-off, as the increased hardware and bandwidth requirements could result in a loss in full nodes. None of them believed 20 MB would lead to a problematic level of centralization.\n\nSome developers, however, shared a concern with critics of the increased limit that there will be a need for some scarcity in Bitcoin blocks in the long run, in order for a fee market to emerge. Bitcoin miners need to earn enough income in order to keep the network safe. Finally, several of the providers indicated they support a switch from Bitcoin core to Bitcoin-Xt in order to allow for bigger blocks, if no consensus among core developers can be found.\n\nIncrease\n\nMany gave two reasons for their support of the proposed block size increase. First, most of them said it is necessary to allow users to continue to make cheap use of the blockchain.\n\nSecond, some echoed the concerns of Mike Hearn, Bitcoin-Xt developer and prominent proponent of the increase. They said they believe that the inability of miners to validate all transactions due to small blocks could lead to chaotic situations for Bitcoin as a whole, as payments could become stuck on the network. MultiBit developer Jim Burton told CT:\n\n“Gavin presented his reasoning for 20 megabyte blocks at the recent DevCore London that I attended, and he has a convincing argument. We need bigger blocks in Bitcoin to enable the regular Jo to stay on chain and not be forced to off-chain solutions.”\n\nArmory core developer Alan Reiner said on the Bitcoin development mailing list:\n\n“Seven transactions per second is pathetic for a global transaction system. It is a couple orders of magnitude too low for any meaningful commercial activity to occur. If we continue with a cap of seven transactions forever, Bitcoin will fail. Or at best, it will fail to be useful for the vast majority of the world — which probably leads to failure.”\n\nElectrum lead developer Thomas Voegtlin also agreed with an increase before the current 1 MB blocks are filled up. He told CT:\n\n“I do support an increase of the maximum block size, because it is safer than doing nothing and reaching full blocks. Indeed, I fail to see how reaching full blocks would result in a working fee market; I believe that idea is ideologically driven wishful thinking. If blocks reach full capacity, we are more likely to see users being annoyed and stopping using Bitcoin.”\n\nCentralization\n\nPerhaps the most important argument against raising the limit was that the need for additional hardware and bandwidth in order to run a full Bitcoin node would lead to an increase in centralization of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nMost of the wallet software providers did not share this concern, however. They either believed that the risk is being blown out of proportion by opponents of the increase, or that it is a small trade-off that is worth the benefits of bigger blocks. BreadWallet co-founder and CEO Voisine said:\n\n“I think these concerns are not justified. Just as bitcoin mining pools allow many more people to participate in mining, there are plenty of promising future developments like the lightning network, blockchain sharding, and other techniques to continue to allow people with fewer resources to participate in the network, without resorting to the drastic measures like introducing unpredictable transaction failures.”\n\nSimilarly, Coinomi founder John L. Jegutanis explained:\n\n“I am not worried about centralization at all. Bigger blocks will surely strain the network infrastructure, but even now the nodes that run on home ADSLs are not contributing to the network. Running a pruned node will help alleviate some of the pain.”\n\nMultiBit's Burton did agree that a higher block-size limit might lead to a loss in decentralization on the network, but considered it a fair trade-off. He said:\n\n“Personally I think 20 MB blocks will be OK from the decentralization perspective though it will of course knock some nodes off the network due to, say, bandwidth caps. I think 20 MB is an acceptable compromise between the need for more transactions and keeping Bitcoin decentralized.”\n\nOriginal Intent\n\nMost share a somewhat conservative sentiment, preferring to refrain from drastic changes to the mechanics of Bitcoin, or they wanted to keep the system close to one envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. Andreas Schildbach, lead developer of Bitcoin Wallet for Android and Blackberry, said:\n\n“The hard limit is just meant as a last barrier for spam attacks, nothing else. The soft limit is what limits blocks in reality, and that can be decided by each miner separately. Currently, most miners still use 0.75 MB, so it's very unlikely the 20 MB will be used right from the point where the hard limit is increased.”\n\nSimilarly, Armory's Reiner posted on the Bitcoin development mailing list:\n\n“Satoshi didn't believe one megabyte blocks were the correct answer. I personally think this is critical to Bitcoin's long-term future. And I'm not sure what else Gavin could've done to push this along in a meaningful way.”\n\nBreadWallet's Voisine said:\n\n“The proposed increase is the simplest and most conservative course of action to keep the network behaving the same as it does today, as usage continues to grow. With over US$3 billion of value being stored in bitcoin, it is reckless to introduce drastic changes to how the network functions.”\n\nOthers, however, believe that Bitcoin will need to see drastic changes at some point in the future, and believe an increased block size limit is merely a temporary solution.\n\nElectrum's Voegtlin told CT:\n\n“I believe the issue of long-term mining incentives will require a fundamental change to the Bitcoin protocol. That problem is less urgent, but more important than the maximum block size. I would like a solution to be adopted as soon as possible, ideally together with the block size increase. As long as that issue is not resolved, I do not think it is reasonable to consider Bitcoin as an investment opportunity.”\n\nBitcoin-Xt\n\nSeveral developers indicated that a switch from Bitcoin core to Bitcoin-Xt for the main implementation as suggested by Andresen, would be supported by their software. Some have even made the switch already, yet others say that it would ultimately be up to individual users to make the decision whether to support 20 MB blocks. Coinomi's Jegutanis told CT:\n\n“Personally, I support Gavin and Mike Hearn with their effort to deploy the new 20 MB blocks. We already moved all our bitcoin nodes to the Bitcoin-Xt to show support. The increase of the block size makes sense even if you had deployed the lightning network, it will scale even more.”\n\nLikewise, MultiBit's Burton suggested he had no problem with connecting to Bitcoin-Xt. He said:\n\n“At MultiBit, we like the Bitcoin-Xt fork Mike Hearn has made. It supports his Lighthouse project, which is a great piece of enabling software. MultiBit connects directly to the Bitcoin network and will work with both Bitcoin core and Bitcoin-Xt.”\n\nSimilarly, co-CEO and CTO of Ciphrex Eric Lombrozo said:\n\n“Our software can just as easily support any maximum block size. We’ll support whatever maximum block size our users want. On a technical level, we can support either 1 MB and 20 MB block sizes with the change of a single configuration parameter. We’ll make it easy for our users to pick whatever they want.”\n\nPolitics\n\nFinally, some of the wallet providers indicated there might be a much bigger issue at stake. Ciphrex's Lombrozo, in particular, pointed out that the real problem might not be the maximum block size by itself, but the lack of a streamlined governing model for Bitcoin in order to collectively make decisions like these. He said:\n\n“We believe the fundamental issue here is that, as Bitcoin Core developers, we’ve so far failed to develop a good metaconsensus and formal forking and merging process to decide these kinds of issues. The block size limit is just the one of many controversies that will arise regarding changes to the protocol and, in particular, to the consensus rules. Everyone saw this one coming. Unfortunately after over six years of Bitcoin, we still don’t have a process to agree on these kinds of things.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“Rather than avoiding network forks like the plague, perhaps we should design for them. However, forks are the easy part. It’s merging and reconciling them that seems to be really, really hard. It’s this latter part that needs considerable work. There are a few proposals out there — for instance sidechains — that at least address some of the technical hurdles that might arise in being able to have consensus that can span multiple chains. However, this still leaves open the question of how we ultimately end up converging upon a new consensus protocol. In particular, migrating applications to a new consensus protocol seems far from trivial in the general case.”\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to AirBitz, BitGo, Bither, Hive, Mycelium, and Ninki, but received no responses by the time of publication."", 'A new company in Taiwan called Maicoin announced its plans to let customers buy bitcoin in 10,000 convenience stores in the country. According to its founder and CEO Alex Liu, this could benefit foreign workers who are using bitcoin for remittances.\n\nTo do so, customers need to create a Maicoin account using the mobile app or web-based wallet. They can place an order to buy bitcoin through these and pay in cash at the counter of the convenience store to complete the transaction. Purchases can also be done through regular bank ATMs from their personal accounts and fund transfers.\n\nBuy Bitcoin Anywhere\n\nWith plenty of convenience store branches located all across the territory, people can practically buy bitcoin anywhere in Taiwan. These includes branches of chains like 7-11, Family Mart, OK Mart, and Hi-Life.\n\nThe Maicoin wallet or MaiWallet displays a barcode that convenience store shopkeepers can scan to credit the balance. For now, the wallet app is still on beta but it holds a lot of potential in enabling those who don’t have an actual bank account to make remittances or pay their bills through bitcoin.\n\nAccount top-ups with physical ATMs are limited to NT$500,000 or roughly $16,200 per day to please AML regulators. Using Taiwan’s ‘eATM’ system with home-based card readers, users are limited to NT$30,000 or around $972 a day.\n\nMaicoin has been in operation for a little over a year and also offers a bitcoin exchange services. However, their offerings are focused more on consumers and merchants rather than financial traders and investors.\n\nThe company has been able to raise $2 million in venture capitalist funding and has currently over 30,000 registered users. According to Liu, Maicoin has been able to process roughly $4 million in consumer and remittance transactions in the past year.', ""The influx of new digital technology is drastically changing how users seek entertainment – and how they pay for it, a trend which shows no sign of slowing.\n\nOver the past 15 years the internet has increased ease of paying for entertainment services and allowed for diversification of subscriptions catering to users’ needs. In 2015, however, a further shift is underway in customer habits, one in which Bitcoin is already carving a niche.\n\nEach to their own\n\nWhile previously it was the norm that professional TV and online entertainment services were paid for in bulk via a subscription, new research suggests the ability to pick and choose not only individual services but individual sessions, paying only for the exact material required, is what the consumer will be demanding in future.\n\nA survey by Irdeto released to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last January found that young adults in the US and UK are expecting to use internet-based services for the majority of their entertainment over the next five years. Changing are habits of using pay TV bundles; now, it is ‘a la carte’ internet streaming using smart devices which is becoming the standard.\n\nAccording to Irdeto, 27% of US consumers are “expecting to watch most content through Internet TV services like Netflix or Amazon Prime.”\n\nThis is true not only for mainstream entertainment, but likewise for niches such as adult entertainment, this market having also conspicuously benefited from Bitcoin over the past few years. Venues such as online casinos and even escort services have increasingly experimented with the added flexibility and control that Bitcoin offers.\n\nInitial forays into offering customers a more tailored experience through Bitcoin began with simple ‘adoption’ for payment. Appropriately, in Las Vegas, Bunnies of Las Vegas escort agency made waves by becoming the industry’s first to accept Bitcoin. This was followed by a huge rise in crypto-only gambling options in the online realm, but just as with other industries, Bitcoin usage for adult entertainment is evolving.\n\nChange of image\n\nIn an effort to break away from the ‘traditional’ traits of the adult industry – many of which mirror the payments industry and include fees, middlemen and unclear charging – this year has even given rise to a Bitcoin-only adult chatroom service. Unlike those which have gone before, however, the service, Xotika TV, is seeking to run entirely on Bitcoin with no involvement of fiat currency at all.\n\nIts creator and CEO, Cristian Cora, views Bitcoin as the key to creating both more fairness for workers and customers, allowing for the kind of transparency which so far the adult industry has not been known for.\n\n“We think that for Bitcoin to succeed it needs to end up effectively in the hands of cyber-girls, not only tech-savvy enthusiasts,” Cora told CoinTelegraph. “Even if initially most of the models will convert their bitcoins to fiat, they will do so by using independent exchanges, localbitcoins, etc., our goal is to provide an entirely Bitcoin-powered platform.”\n\nXotika allows for users to fund an account with Bitcoin and spend it with a model of their choice, funds being sent directly to the model’s corresponding wallet which can then be accessed and used almost immediately.\n\nThe goal, Cora explains, is to become the adult version of Amazon’s on-demand and broadcasting service Twitch, where anyone will be able to broadcast in exchange for bitcoins. As such, the service is attempting to build out for the longer term, banishing advertisements and building its Bitcoin infrastructure in-house.\n\n“When we first announced Xotika, we were approached by various wallet providers or Bitcoin processors but we respectfully declined their offers,” Cora notes.\n\n‘Not reinventing the wheel’\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to Cora for more detailed information on Xotika’s plan within the adult market, as well as to get additional perspective on how consumer habits regarding entertainment are shifting into new territory.\n\nCoinTelegraph: The consumer entertainment market is evolving to include more demand for a la carte services. Why do you think this is and how are you ensuring Xotika retains a unique selling point as the market intensifies?\n\nCristian Cora: I’m not an expert in the consumer market but I can say I'm an old-school internet addict and from that point of view, I can confirm the increasing demand for premium services in all categories. This being said, Xotika TV is not an original idea which plans to reinvent the wheel... but rather a response to the requests of Bitcoin’s community.\n\nIt has been generally discussed that for Bitcoin to succeed in adoption it needs to reach directly in the hands of our dear cyber-girls and this is exactly what we are trying to do.\n\nWith an active developer team we’re dedicated to pioneering Bitcoin technology and embed it with the adult streaming industry – we are confident it’s a win-win situation.\n\nCT: What made you decide to focus entirely on Bitcoin as a means of supporting the site? How do you view Bitcoin usage changing in the mid to long term for the kind of audience likely to try Xotika?\n\nCC: Like I said before, my team and I are early Bitcoin adopters. At first we used to mine, we even traded for a while, developed an exchange platform, etc. Over the last few years we had the opportunity to witness with our own eyes the evolution of cryptocurrency and the blockchain concept and in our opinion up until now, Bitcoin is by far the most promising digital currency.\n\nAlternative cryptocurrencies have emerged but they remain in Bitcoin’s shadow. At one point, Bitcoin itself will disrupt the consumer market and Porn is one of the best domains we can approach right now.\n\nCT: Xotika’s payment system is being constructed entirely in-house. What made you decide not to use a payment processor or popular wallet? What features does Xotika’s have which differ from the experience offered by services like BitPay or Coinbase?\n\nCC: Bitcoin is still at an early stage and from our personal experience, most exchanges or payment processors depend on relations with their bank, country or state regulation, etc. This dependency is unstable and history shows us about mood swings in government decisions regarding Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, etc.\n\nSince we want to help spread Bitcoin adoption, our goal is to create a system fully powered by Bitcoin. This way we avoid any complication that may occur if a certain exchange or payment processor stops working.\n\nWe can guarantee our users high-end security and no hassle without the involvement of third parties. That way, users can choose freely from a variety of popular wallets and keep their bitcoins. My hope is that models across the world will start using Bitcoin on a daily basis for e-shopping, bills, toys, gifts, etc.\n\nCT: What kind of plans do you have for expanding the service?\n\nCC: The platform is still in a beta phase. In the near future we want to finish the affiliate program at which we`re working right now. We are all involved with all our resources in this project and we will keep a very close eye to see where this goes. Our most sincere hope is, of course, “TO THE MOON!”\n\nNevertheless, with projects like Xotika’s still in the design phase, it is safe to say that Bitcoin’s practical use for consumer entertainment remains low outside gambling communities.\n\nWith the weight of the community palpable as prices continue to be lackluster, in 2015 it is as much about increasing Bitcoin usage in general as it is about providing mainstream consumers with a cutting-edge experience."", 'Digital Gold author Nathaniel Popper, who wrote his first Bitcoin article about the Winklevoss Twins‘ involvement in it, interviewed the twins earlier tonight in New York at an event hosted by GeneralAssemb.ly.\n\nGemini Weeks Away\n\nThe burning question among the Bitcoin community was on the progress of Gemini, the brothers’ exchange, which will be based in New York. Up to now, they’ve told the world they were waiting on the finalization of the BitLicense proposal to get things going, although Cameron Winklevoss made sure to say, “Our tech is there. We are ready to operate.”\n\nPrior to that, Tyler had said, in regards to how long it will be before the exchange will be approved by the government, “We feel like it’s weeks. […] We do feel like we’re on the two yard line.” He made sure to walk that statement back some, saying it could be his “famous last words.”\n\nAlso read: Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF Files for 1m Shares on Nasdaq; More to Be Revealed in January\n\nBitcoin is as Important as the Block Chain\n\nCameron addressed a common refrain heard recently, wherein old-school investors are saying that the block chain is the real innovation, and that Bitcoin is really unnecessary. Specifically, he said, “Some people are saying I love the Blockchain, I hate the Bitcoin, but you need them both.” Tyler described Bitcoin as the “carrot” that promotes the securing and decentralization of the network.\n\nQuestions from the in-person audience were rather basic in nature, far below the level of understanding that our readers would likely have asked the brothers. The last audience question was regarding the typically BTC/USD pairing, and although the question showed a fundamental misunderstanding of how Bitcoin exchanges work, Tyler took the opportunity to clarify that Bitcoin is a transnational technology. He said there had been some internal debate about where to operate, and that ultimately they had settled on New York because the BitLicense would overall offer them some guidelines on how to operate legally, in contrast to other jurisdictions where running a digital currency business can still be quite ambiguous.\n\nOn this subject, of regulation, the brothers had earlier in the interview expounded on the importance (in their view) of regulation. Tyler said:\n\nWe’re in favor of healthy regulation. [NYDFS] really are a friend of Bitcoin in New York. Money can be used for bad thigns and we have to keep that in mind.\n\nAlthough the LiveStream audience repeatedly indicated they’d like to hear the brothers weigh in on the current block size debate and how it might affect the future of Bitcoin, instead the second question delivered to them from the LiveStream audience was about their position on Bitcoin. To this, they said, “We are bullish and we still have our Bitcoin stash.” They said they are holding long term, and had throughout the interview underlined the fact that Bitcoin is as yet a new technology.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"

The report outlined how ""the U.S. Secret Service has observed that criminals are looking for and finding virtual currencies that offer anonymity for both users and transactions"".\n\nFor now, the report asserts, terrorist groups are relying on cash to facilitate the transfer of funds worldwide, an outcome fuelled by broad financial surveillance in the global banking system.\n\nOther methods, including charity fraud, also present significant terrorism financing risks.\n\nThe full 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment can be found below:\n\nNational Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment – 06-12-2015\n\nBinary stream image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The transfer of bitcoin doesn’t constitute delivery of goods or services, and therefore it’s not subject to VAT.\n\n“This is the most reasonable way to classify bitcoins in the context of VAT, and we are fortunate that the tax administration agrees with our view,” says Luzius Meisser, president of Bitcoin Association Switzerland. “Bitcoin is a currency, and thus should also be treated like a currency.”\n\nIn February 2014, a group of three Swiss Bitcoin organizations jointly wrote a formal inquiry to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration to clarify the legal situation of bitcoin with regards to VAT. The tax authority replied that bitcoin is to be treated just like any other payment option – trading bitcoin for Swiss francs is seen as similar to trading euros for Swiss francs. Furthermore, the transaction fees charged by bitcoin exchanges are VAT-free.\n\n“This is excellent news for bitcoin in Switzerland as it provides the legal certainty we need to professionally operate our business,” says Niklas Nikolajsen, CEO of Swiss bitcoin exchange and service provider Bitcoin Suisse AG.\n\nOther European nations have made similar decisions. Recently, the Spanish tax office confirmed that, under Spanish law, bitcoin has been recognized as a financial service, and therefore the cryptocurrency isn’t subject to the nation's 21 percent VAT.\n\nIn the European Union, which Switzerland is not part of, there is not yet clarity on the VAT status of bitcoin. In June, however, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg is expected to hold a hearing on the matter, Handelszeitung reports.\n\n“We hope that the Swiss decision can serve as an inspiration for Europe,” said Mathieu Buffenoir, vice-president of Bitcoin Association Switzerland.Bitcoin is now confirmed to be exempt from VAT in Switzerland, but other regulations apply. Switzerland considers digital currencies such as bitcoin equivalent to any other foreign currency. This means that the professional operation of bitcoin trading platforms constitutes financial intermediation with the requirement to comply with both the Banking Act and the Anti Money Laundering (AML) Act. Recently ECUREX, a digital finance marketplace for professional traders and financial institutions headquartered in Zurich, announced that it has become the first digital currency exchange platform to be fully compliant with both.\n\nSwitzerland, a modern country in the middle in Europe with a world-class financial system, a stable regulatory environment, and a thriving economy unencumbered by the often lengthy and ineffectual bureaucratic procedures of the European Union, is emerging as a good location for bitcoin businesses.\n\nIn related news reported by Handelszeitung, preparations are under way for the establishment of the first bitcoin bank in Switzerland, according to multiple sources in the financial sector. The bitcoin bank would be set up as a normal commercial bank connected to the banking network and compliant with the Banking and AML Acts, and able to offer all standard banking services.

It’s a moral and ethical stand we’re going to take. ShapeShift does not store any currency or user information, thereby eliminating the risk of users’ funds being compromised in a Mt. Gox-type attack. The same security principles will apply to the newly introduced mobile app as well.”\n\nThe bitcoin licensing rules set forth by Benjamin Lawsky and the NYDFS earlier this month applies several proactive data-gathering guidelines designed to thwart digital fraud, money laundering and other criminal activities.\n\nIn particular, Voorhees has conflicting views about recording customer information for Know-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance. He clarified that the company is willing to provide generic data on wallet addresses, IP logs, and devices.\n\nHowever, the bitcoin advocate, who founded Coinapult and draws experience from BitInstant, takes a firm stand on consumer privacy and feels customers’ names and addresses are off limits.\n\nBecause of this, the business finds the rules to be anti-competitive and risky for users who are concerned about protecting their identity.\n\n“Identity theft is an epidemic, more costly to society than many other forms of theft and crime,” mentioned Voorhees. ”\n\n“Bitcoin has finally solved this problem, by enabling 100 per cent secure transactions without attaching your private information. Now, New York wants to mandate that consumers continue to be put at risk, even though technology has provided a solution to identity theft.”', 'BitHub launches to help incubate SA’s bitcoin startups\n\nCryptocurrency is a hot topic and the talking point on everyone’s lips. Bitcoin has existed for a few years but is starting to make its way into the mainstream market. In South Africa, ecommerce giants Raru and Takealot has been some of the first major retailers to accept bitcoin as a payment method via payment gateway, PayFast.\n\nLaunched this week, BitHub is a new space geared towards digital currency innovation based in Woodstock, Cape Town. According to Ian Merrington, CEO of CiTi, one of BitHub’s goals the incubation of cryptocurrency startups. One of the ideas is to line up innovators with banks while it’s currently in talks with Barclays to create a fittech hub at the Bandwidth Barn, and to foster cryptocurrency development.\n\nBitHub hasn’t just been created to facilitate startups. The organisation is also a physical space — at the Bandwidth Barn — for talks and forums. They take the time to create a 12-month timetable for events that are interesting to bitcoin. They also want to create awareness among developers and those who don’t know anything about bitcoin and crypto currencies.\n\nRecently, there has been a surge in startups adopting bitcoin for various uses. One of these is BitPesa, a Kenyan company focusing on instant trading. BitPesa uses bitcoin as a vehicle for currency transactions, due to its exceptionally low transaction fees. Currency can then be transferred in and out of your BitPesa account to the currency of your choice.\n\nMerrington gives the example of using it for title deeds. This can be beneficial for those outside of the banking system as the currency can be traced all the way back to its origin. There are other uses, such as anti-piracy measures and utility meters.\n\nThe digital currency still has its problems, for example, it’s seen as an anarchist currency existing outside of the standard banking system. At times, it is also volatile in its worth, but so are most currencies, like our own South African rand.\n\nOne of the pros to bitcoin is its “bulletproof” creation. Built on algorithms, bitcoin uses a blockchain model, which cannot be frauded. This is in part due to the number of bitcoin transactions that can be processed per second, which sits at nine. There are discussions around increasing this number to enable scalability for the currency’s growth. Other attractive attributes include peer-to-peer transaction processing, anonymity from traditional banking systems, and it is self-policing.\n\nImage: By Zach Copley via Flickr', 'Bitcoin\'s security risk will ""never be reduced to zero"", according to a report released by insurance market Lloyd’s today.\n\nThe 31-page document, commissioned to assess the risks involved in insuring bitcoin operations, warns that companies will continue to face a ""dynamic threat"", regardless of their security practices.\n\nGarrick Hileman, an economic historian at London School of Economics (LSE) and one of the report\'s authors, told CoinDesk that while security in the industry is tightening, systemic issues remain:\n\n""The improvements we’re seeing in many bitcoin risk areas, particularly at the firm level with the incorporation of multisig and other industry best practices, have been well documented. What has been covered less is how many old risks remain (eg 51% attacks) and new risks that are emerging.""\n\nHe cited the fact that the majority of mining takes place inside ‘The Great Firewall of China’ as one of his concerns. The report mentions several others: bitcoin\'s volatility, its lack of liquidity and an uncertain regulatory climate.\n\nThough these global issues are important in shaping the ""overall risk profile"" of bitcoin, the report says they are unlikely to be transferred directly in a policy.\n\nRisky businesses\n\nFor the growing number of bitcoin businesses applying for insurance, there are other risk factors in play. Coin Center\'s Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburgh outline the \'local\' threats faced by companies (ie insider attacks) and the kinds of solutions that may help prevent them: server-side security, multisig or hybrid wallets and cold storage.\n\nThe duo also address the poor track record of exchanges in guarding bitcoins to date, citing early research that 45% of the exchanges tracked failed.\n\n""Rather than quantifying risk from past performance, Coin Center advises that insurers and industry observers keep tabs on whether a business is employing these new controls,"" the authors write.\n\nOn the whole, the takeaway from Bitcoin: Risk Factors for Insurance is mixed. While bitcoin crime is shown to be an order of magnitude larger than credit card fraud, the authors point to signs the ecosystem is maturing.\n\nWhile it might run against the decentralised ethos of the bitcoin network, the establishment of recognised security standards for enterprises may help bitcoin in the long-term, it says.\n\n""As with any system of security, measures must evolve with the threat, and their effectiveness will rely on routine and robust application [...] with responsible and innovative risk management, insurance can be a key component of the future of bitcoin.""\n\nBitcoin insurance\n\nReporting profits of £3.2bn in 2014, Lloyd\'s market, one of the oldest of its kind, houses 96 syndicates who underwrite risk. It specialises in ""unusual risk"", including celebrity body parts and space tourism.\n\nIts report, Bitcoin: Risk Factors for Insurance, part of its research series on emerging risks, coincides with the expansion of its cyber division. Currently, Lloyd\'s holds around 15% of the world\'s insurance against cyber attacks.\n\nLloyd\'s was first linked to bitcoin after a deal to insure London-based vault Elliptic, at the time hailed as a ""milestone"" for the nascent industry, fell through last year.\n\nSince then, bitcoin companies including Circle, Coinbase and Xapo have gone public with details of their insurance policies. However, they are anomalies in a market still lacking in consumer protection.\n\nThe tides could be turning however, as more insurers engage with digital currency technology. The Lloyd\'s report was commissioned, Hileman said, following growing interest expressed by the bitcoin ecosystem in Lloyd’s insurance coverage.\n\nThe report\'s launch and panel discussion at One Lime Street yesterday, was very well attended, he said, adding:\n\n""The underwriters asked very specific, savvy questions, the type you’d expect from people who are actively examining the suitability of insurance for various aspects of the bitcoin value chain.""\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report misspelled Jerry Brito\'s last name.\n\nFeatured image: Milan Gonda / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The creation of the lab came after the publishing of an extensive report about the benefits of the blockchain by the international bank.When the report was published, UBS Group CIO Oliver Bussmann told the Wall Street Journal, “I believe – and this is my personal view – that blockchain technology will not only change the way we do payments, but it will change the whole trading and settlement topic.”\n\nSince then, that hypothesis has begun to get some traction as the Nasdaq OMX Group began experimenting with a pilot of blockchain technology as a record-keeping ledger for the Nasdaq Private Market, a small market launched in 2014 to handle the trading of shares belonging to private companies.Smart-bonds likely is just one of several technological applications of blockchains UBS’ lab is exploring. The lab, which is located in the London offices of European fintech startup accelerator Level39, is meant to spur new innovations that can bolster the bank’s long-term growth\n\n.“Blockchain technologies can make banks more efficient – for example, through instantaneous settlement rather than the days it takes at present, lower costs and lower operational risk,” said Batlin during the IDX Derivatives Expo in London. “The simple lesson for banks is that if we don’t do it someone else will.”\n\nDifficulties remain\n\nBitcoin’s proof-of-work mining algorithm is responsible for the digital currency’s unique characteristics of network security and decentralization, but as Batlin pointed out, it is also causes the system to be slow and expensive. Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain often take a hour or move and require large amounts of electricity via miners who verify transactions. These hurdles eliminate the possibility of high-frequency or algorithmic trading, as least as it currently stands.\n\n“All kinds of revenue opportunities can emerge,” said Batlin speaking of how these innovations could be monetized, “but it’s still more expensive, so there is a way to go.” “\n\nUBS sign” by twicepix / CC BY-SA 2.0"", 'Navigating the web of government regulation, and effectively implementing the procedures governments actually call for, is one of the biggest hurdles a new financial company faces in the modern age.\n\nAs global terrorism grows an increasingly common theme internationally, concerns over money laundering and funding potentially shady cells must play a daily role crafting policy and procedures for a new financial company.\n\nThus, sometimes things pop up which can be interpreted as limiting freedom, and company’s can be criticized.

Circle’s user agreement states:\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why you can’t purchase most weapons on the Internet in the first place. They are not our rules; they’re the federal government’s. If you’d like to purchase these items (that’s a knife), we strongly suggest that you go to a physical store and use a different form of payment. Otherwise, we will have to close your account.\n\nIt’s likely Circle’s view of facilitating the global sale of knives is similar to their take on marijuana, which they expound upon a bit more than knives:\n\nWe’re not trying to ruin your vibe. We’re simply bound by the laws in place, and we don’t want anything getting in the way of building you a great product.\n\nCoinbase also bans “Unlicensed sale of firearms and certain weapons,” under which such knives such as banned by Circle could be meant.\n\nCircle is a consumer facing “Bitcoin bank”, as it marketed itself early on, “focused on transforming the world economy with secure, simple, and less costly technology for storing and using money.” The company provides mobile apps meant to enable greater ease-of-use in online and in-person payments.\n\nCircle made headlines in May 2014 by offering new customers $10 in free bitcoins.\n\nKnives have been a controversial tool in recent years, especially in England.\n\nIn England, police have organized to put an end to pointy knives. As the Lancashire Police posted on Facebook, they participated in a England-wide program to get knives off the streets.\n\nIn the US, regulation of knives has also received some attention, but in a much softer manner than England.\n\nAs Circle replied to Cryptocoins News: “Anyways, as you probably know there are a lot of knife types out there (kitchen, swiss army, utility, fishing, letter opening) but we’re more concerned with those that are directly identified, or perceived, as weapons.”\n\nCircle is merely doing what it believes it must in order to stay within the purview of laws by which it is governed. For instance, know your customer regulations make it explicit that a business operating in the manner of Circle, especially in the US, must take measures to ensure that its service is not being used to abet crime, in particular recurring crime, such as money laundering.\n\nCircle has merely taken note of the global trend by industrialized nations to regulate knives in some manner. There is one thing both Circle and Coinbase have in common in terms of user agreements:\n\nCircle:\n\nMaking money by selling coins.\n\nThere is a good deal of misinformation out there about this topic.\n\nWhile it may seem innocent enough (and maybe even profitable!) to buy or sell bitcoin using a web site that connects you directly with people in your area, federal law classifies this activity as “money transmission.” All money transmitters, ourselves included, are required to register with the Treasury Department, verify customer identities and meet a variety of other requirements. Further, many states require licensing to be able to act as a money transmitter. As such, Circle is not able to provide services to any individuals who may be engaging in money transmission activity.\n\nSo, if you find yourself performing this activity, either with strangers or friends down the block, we will have to end our relationship and close your account.\n\nCoinbase forbids the same on their list of barred practices:\n\nOperating as an unlicensed money transmitter, money service, payment service provider, e-money, or any other financial services business which requires licensure, including but not limited to exchanges of virtual currencies, sales of money orders or traveler’s checks, and escrow services\n\nSo, it is true. Coinbase and Circle might ban your account on their websites for buying knives and selling bitcoins, as well as numerous other activities. Nevertheless, bitcoins peer-to-peer nature makes both of these activities possible.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The number of Venezuelan bitcoin users has doubled and the trading volumes of Venezuelan bitcoin exchanges have increased substantially since 2014.\n\nA spokesman of bitcoin Venezuela told Panampost:\n\n“The price [of bitcoin] never fluctuates at the same rate as the devaluation of the bolívar, which lost 60 percent of its value in one month.”\n\nThe country’s largest bitcoin advocacy organization stated that a significantly large portion of bitcoin buyers hold the digital currency, and they are not worried about its volatility. Instead, some are very optimistic on the value of bitcoin, and they are hoping to see a short-term increase over the next few months.\n\nVenezuela’s official inflation rate hit 68% in 2014 and it is predicted to surpass 70% this year. In an attempt to escape the irregular volatility of the nation’s currency, Venezuelans have been desperately trying to purchase foreign currencies, especially U.S. dollars, on the black market, explained Venezuelan economist Luis Oliveros.\n\nDue to the government’s strict control on the purchase of foreign currencies and the plunge in supply, people there are shifting towards Bitcoin. With the rapid devaluation of Venezuela’s national currency, and people’s attempts to escape hyperinflation, the cryptocurrency has risen as a solution.\n\nTrading Volumes\n\nSurBitcoin, the first Venezuelan bitcoin exchange, was launched on August 15 of last year by BlinkTrade co-founder Rodrigo Souza.\n\nThe platform is still in beta, but the trading volume of the exchange has increased rapidly over the last ten months. Bitcoin Venezuela reported:\n\n“The SurBitcoin exchange is already the second largest in transaction volume in Latin America after Brazil. The growth is evident.”\n\nBecause of the increase of bitcoin buyers and the hyperinflation of the nation’s currency, several local businesses in Venezuela — including restaurants, coffee shops and shopping malls — have begun to accept bitcoin.\n\nWSJ reported in late 2014 that hyperinflation forced Venezuelans to carry piles of bills to purchase small goods like a cup of coffee, thus making it extremely inconvenient to carry cash and leaving people prone to robbery and theft.\n\nWhile bitcoin adoption and awareness in Venezuela is still relatively low compared to neighboring countries such as Argentina, bitcoin may be the ultimate solution to Venezuela’s current situation, if the number of bitcoin buyers, traders and merchants continue to grow at present rates.', 'VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 12, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Bit-X Financial Corp.

The project, which received €1.9 million funding from the European Union under FP7, wants to create a decentralized social networking platform for large-scale collaboration and decision-making.\n\nThe project team includes companies, universities and high-profile organizations such as the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM), the French CNRS, and NESTA, a U.K. charity dedicated to foster socially relevant innovation with activities ranging from early stage investment to in-depth research and practical programs.\n\nD-CENT announced that it will design structurally sustainable money systems via the creation of a digital ecosystem of blockchain-enabled complementary currencies to use in parallel with conventional ones. This “Monetary Ecology” will advance development in two domains of social innovation: complementary currencies governance systems and decentralized trust management systems.\n\nThe project will include Digital Social Currency pilot projects in communities that are already actively designing tools for collective decision-making in local economies:\n\n- Social Kronas, a blockchain-enabled municipal currency and reward system for political participation in Reykjavik (Iceland);\n\n- The evolution and decentralization of Eurocat, a complementary currency launched in Barcelona (Spain) in 2014;\n\n- A decentralized social remuneration system that can reward the contributions that members of the Helsinki Urban-Cooperative Farm (Finland) perform to the common interest of the cooperative. This model will be also piloted at a cultural center in Milan (Italy).\n\nSee the D-CENT document “Design of Social Digital Currency” for an overview of the Digital Social Currency pilot projects.\n\n“The Digital Social Currency pilot projects will experiment and test a new notion of proof-of-work: the Social Proof-of-Work, which is roughly the proof that a member in the system is endowed with coins as a reward to an action in the real world while abiding to community rules and enhancing collective values,” states the NESTA website. “By linking democratic deliberation with currency creation through the Social Proof-of-Work, systems can be designed to enable a flexible currency supply set in real time at the light of users trust management dynamics. The basic tenet is to consider social currency as reputation management that can inform the money supply of a complementary currency in terms of tolerance to credit risk.”\n\n\n\nAccording to the project team, most cryptocurrency design approaches tend to privilege the role of software and marginalize human contribution. D-CENT, instead, puts humans back at the center of the currency creation stage.\n\nThe project seems related to the concept of blockchain-enabled Local Exchange Trade System (LETS). A LETS establishes a complementary currency for local exchanges where offers, requests and IOUs are logged in a public accounting system visible to all members. In case of a default, the loss is absorbed equally by all members of a LETS, which makes it a mutual credit exchange.\n\nD-CENT is also related to recent proposals of Greece’s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who wrote a blog post in February proposing a similar IOU-based currency, which he dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin). Varoufakis is persuaded that blockchain technology could be put to effective use in troubled economies like Greece’s.\n\nD-CENT will develop and document a Freecoin Toolchain software kit based on Bitcoin Core 0.10 and capable of bootstrapping the genesis of new ad-hoc blockchains, integrating the work done in the e-democracy D-CENT pilots and the Social Proof-of-Work concept.']"
06/13/2015,"['The great thing about Bitcoin, for a tech columnist like me, is that it’s simultaneously over-the-top cinematic and technically dense. Richard Branson recently hosted a “Blockchain Summit” at his private Caribbean island. There’s a Bitcoin Jet. At the same time, 2015 has seen the release of a whole slew of technically gnarly–and technically fascinating–proposals built atop the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn case you’ve been living in a Faraday cage: a blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger system, (generally) safeguarded by cryptographic proof-of-work, initially devised by a mysterious entity called Satoshi Nakamoto … who released Bitcoin, the world’s first blockchain network/protocol/application/currency, in 2009.\n\nTo most people, Bitcoin itself is already deeply esoteric (and many still find it risible.) But to cryptocurrency aficionados, tired old garden-variety Bitcoin is so five minutes ago. Explaining today’s new cryptocurrency hotness to a general audience is an interesting challenge–I have an engineering degree from a top-tier school and I write software for a living, and I still find much of this material pretty impenetrable on first acquaintance–but here goes:\n\nSidechains Elements Alpha\n\nThe distributed Bitcoin mining network performs quadrillions of calculations every second that maintain the integrity of its blockchain. Other blockchains aren’t remotely as secure, but they innovate much faster. Sidechains, an innovation proposed and developed by the startup Blockstream, allow for the best of both worlds; the creation of new blockchains “pegged” to Bitcoin, so that value can be transferred between them, which can conceivably be automatically secured by Bitcoin miners via “merged mining.”\n\nThe sidechains vision of the future is of a vast globe-spanning decentralized network of many blockchains, an intertwined cable rather than a single strand, each with its own protocol, rules, and features — but all of them backed by Bitcoin, and protected by the Bitcoin mining network, as the US dollar was once backed by gold. Sidechains can also be used to prototype changes to the fundamental Bitcoin blockchain. One catch, though: this will require a small tweak to the existing Bitcoin protocol.\n\nI’ve written about this before. As of this week, though, sidechains are no longer vaporware. On Monday, Blockstream released the first alpha version of their sidechains software.\n\nTheir “Sidechain Elements” are a collection of blockchain features that go well beyond Bitcoin’s blockchain, including (among others):\n\nConfidential Transactions — At present, all Bitcoin transactions are completely public, albeit pseudonymous. Confidential Transactions, as the name implies, conceal the amount being transferred to all except the sender, the recipient, and others they designate. The resulting transaction size is significantly larger, but includes a sizable “memo” field that can be used to store transaction or other metadata, and is still smaller than eg Zerocoin.(Note that this isn’t as confidential as Zerocash, which conceals both the amount and the participants involved in any transaction, through the mighty near-magic of zk-Snarks. Mind you, Zerocash would require an esoteric invocation ritual to initiate its network. No, really. But that’s a subject for a separate post.)\n\n— At present, all Bitcoin transactions are completely public, albeit pseudonymous.

Segregated Witnesses — The current Bitcoin transaction signature algorithm is complicated and flawed, leading to a problem known as transaction malleability. Segregated witnesses would eliminate that, improving the efficiency of much Bitcoin software considerably … and making much more significant innovations such as the Lightning Network (see below) possible.\n\n— The current Bitcoin transaction signature algorithm is complicated and flawed, leading to a problem known as transaction malleability.

New opcodes — Every Bitcoin transaction is actually a program written in a scripting language. These opcodes expand the possibilities of that language, making whole new forms of transactions possible, such as lotteries, payments to a randomly chosen set of recipients, etc.\n\n— Every Bitcoin transaction is actually a program written in a scripting language. These opcodes expand the possibilities of that language, making whole new forms of transactions possible, such as lotteries, payments to a randomly chosen set of recipients, etc. Basic Asset Issuance — This allows sidechain clients to issue their own brand-new assets which, like Bitcoin itself, can be securely and fungibly transacted on the block chain: vouchers, coupons, stocks, bonds, etc. I am now officially taking bets on if and when the first bleeding-edge company IPOs via a “stockbase” transaction.\n\nBlockstream has also released an “Alpha” sidechain with all of those features up and running except the last, coupled to the Bitcoin testnet. (Used for testing Bitcoin software without putting real value at risk.) In the absence of the Bitcoin protocol change that will cryptographically secure the programmatic transfer of value between Bitcoin and sidechains, they’re cooperating with several external organizations to perform and validate those transfers. If and when that protocol change happens, though, pegged sidechains will be as permissionless, and as decentralized, as Bitcoin itself.\n\nThe Lightning Network\n\nBut wait, there’s more! A whole different group has released an early draft of a radical new proposal called the Lightning Network, which would, in principle, move the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions off the blockchain, without sacrificing any verifiability or security.\n\nI know, I know. As a faithful ear-to-the-ground early-adopter tech reader you’ve spent the last two years hearing everyone and their dog extol the virtues of blockchain technology, with which Bitcoin was supposed to be inextricably linked, and now suddenly people are talking about fully secure off-blockchain transactions?\n\nLet me explain. The Lightning Network allows for the creation of “micropayment channels” across which multiple Bitcoin transactions can be securely performed without interacting with the blockchain, except for the initial transaction that initiates the channel. There is no counterparty risk: if any party ceases to cooperate, and/or does not respond within an agreed-on time limit, the channel can be closed and all its outstanding transactions kicked up to the blockchain to be settled there.\n\nThese in-channel payments would be instant, unlike current Bitcoin payments, which require an hour to be fully verified on the blockchain. What’s more, payments would be routable across multi-hop paths, like packets across the Internet — so instead of having to create a channel to every new counterparty, you could maintain a few channels to a small number of well-connected secure intermediaries and send/receive money through them.\n\nIn theory, this distributed micropayment network–the Lightning Network–could scale Bitcoin transactions up to “billions of transactions per day” across the planet, with minimal use of the blockchain and minimal fees (zero, for direct channels.)\n\nHowever, the Lightning Network would, again, require a change to the existing Bitcoin protocol. (Though again it would be a “soft fork,” i.e. the existing blockchain would remain fully valid.) And/or — you guessed it — a Lightning sidechain. What’s more, one of the changes it requires, the elimination of transaction malleability, is handled by the Segregated Witness work in Sidechain Elements. (correction: all of of the changes required are incorporated into Elements Alpha — it’s Lightning-ready out of the box.)\n\nEarly days yet, for both; but still, these are interesting times indeed.', 'If you are day trading bitcoin, trying to make a quick hit, this article is not for you. If you think gold and silver are the only “real” commodities worth investing in, don’t let the door hit you on your way out. If you think the “strong” U.S. Dollar isn’t going anywhere as the “global reserve currency,” I hope you’re a strong swimmer.\n\nThat article is for the Bitcoin lifer. The full-timer. The person who gets paid in BTC, and knows where every Bitcoin ATM in the city, even the state, is. You are sharp enough to know how truly special it is.\n\nYou heard about Bitcoin at some point over the last two years and said “This is going to change everything!” You may own a Bitcoin business, or are building one. You see it as “The Future of Money.” You’re a little down because of the bitcoin price drop from well over US$1,100 back in late 2013, and eighteen months later you need a little pick-me-up! Well, welcome to your Bitcoin pep talk!\n\nReason #1 – Opportunity Knocks\n\nAnd it’s probably your last opportunity to score big with Bitcoin. Rich people see an investment’s perceived value drop, and they buy low, and then sell when it rebounds. Poor people buy high, panic, and sell low. That’s what keeps them poor. It’s the law of the West!\n\nThis is the most obvious reason. Buying something that was once almost US$1,200 for less than US$250 is a good thing. The only way this wouldn’t be a good thing is if you think Bitcoin is dead, and it is heading down to Ground Zero.\n\nBitcoin has had more dirt thrown on it, mostly from the mainstream media and private interests than a dinosaur’s fossils. When Chunky Soup goes on sale for 30% off this week, you don’t avoid Chunky Soup because it costs less. You see it as an opportunity to buy. Why avoid buying bitcoin when its price drops?\n\nThe rich buy the prices of an appreciating asset drop. They seize the moment. Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, the Fred Wilson who funded Twitter, Zynga, Tumblr and Bitcoin’s Coinbase when they were just concepts, told the Wall Street Journal that he always buys BTC when the price drops.\n\nAll he sees is the future of Bitcoin, the inherent value of it. So treat Bitcoin like a coupon at your favorite store. Or like an uber-successful venture capitalist, and stock up! If bitcoins were US$3,000 apiece, it would never have a chance to catch on with the mass market due to the price. Today, more and more people can buy it while it’s affordable, so take advantage.\n\nReason #2 – Bitcoin is Sliding because the U.S. Dollar is Rising, for now\n\nThe facts are that Bitcoin is doing everything right. It is getting more and more major merchants to accept it. It is securing a higher quality of mainstream press in general, and there’s no such thing as bad publicity. The customer base is getting broader, including other nations besides the U.S. and China. And better wallets, stronger exchanges, new debit cards, and innovative trading options are being added every day to the Bitcoin ecosystem. So what is the problem?\n\nThe U.S. Dollar is the problem. The story goes that the Dollar is rising in value, relative to other currencies. That sounds great, but just like with the U.S. Consumer Price Index, you might want to look that gift horse in the mouth.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index doesn’t compare it to the Chinese Yuan, which is up almost twice as much. Just because other currencies such as the Euro or the Ruble are dropping faster than the dollar doesn’t mean the dollar is actually strong. With that said, a stronger dollar buys more bitcoin units per dollar than a weaker dollar. But let’s look at the dollar’s track record since bitcoin hit the market in 2009. Maybe you will see something called an economic bubble? Or at least see an anomaly, if not a trend.\n\nAny currency can have a good quarter, but if you listen to the U.S. Government (U.S. Department of Labor/Bureau of Labor) tell it, inflation was LESS than 2% from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2013. Are you buying that?\n\nThe national price of gas was US$1.61 on January 3, 2009, the day Bitcoin was officially invented, and now its price is double that. U.S. ground beef prices are up 79% since Bitcoin. A lot of that has to do with actual cattle supplies being at an all-time low, but inflation is only 10% of that number? Eggs have also consistently risen in price much higher than 1-2%. If the Consumer Price Index is a very controversial way to measure inflation, it is the most popular and is government-controlled.\n\nThe problem with the index is the goods themselves change at their discretion, as will the quantity of a product. The rate of inflation is rigged just like the Comex markets, the LIBOR, and the stock market.\n\nSo why believe in the Dollar Index, also supplied by government forces? The fastest way to keep the dollar from falling like a rock is to convince Wall Street that the dollar is rising, and not manipulating the influential Dollar Index is too hard to resist. It is not wise to trust any government-supplied information. Why should you? Whatever they say, usually the opposite is true. If you live by that rule of thumb, you’ll do just fine, economically.\n\nReason #3 – Increased Bitcoin Acceptance and Commerce Causes Price to Drop, Initially\n\nThis is a double-edged sword that has a strong downside. In some ways, Bitcoin is a victim of its success. With all of the new merchants coming on-board when merchants take more Bitcoin, they are selling it for USD 95% of the time. The seller’s market is outnumbering the buyer’s market at this point, with the merchants almost exclusively selling bitcoin at the end of the night’s business, if not instantly. Bitcoin is attracting merchants that are in the business of selling bitcoin every day!\n\nIf merchants were taking bitcoin, and then paying employees in bitcoin, the ecosystem and price would strengthen, not weaken. That economic conversion of paying employees in BTC is still in Bitcoin’s future. Right now, that’s a rarity. The eagerness of merchants to accept bitcoin is another sign of its enduring strength and market demand. This is a very good thing, but paying employees in bitcoin would be a great thing.\n\nReason #4 – Bitcoin Went Through Its Bubble. Now It’s The Market’s Turn\n\nBitcoin has gone through the Mt. Gox Bot Bubble, the closure of Silk Road, the Chinese government/People’s Bank of China (Their Federal Reserve) regulation of the bitcoin exchange market in China, and Ben Lawsky’s draconian NY Bitcoin License fiasco over the last eighteen months. And bitcoin was still up almost 100% over the USD price at this time two years ago.\n\nThe stock market is in the middle of the largest bubble in history. The Western economy is stagnant, at best, but the stock market is booming? Did you ever think to ask yourself why? It wouldn’t have anything to do with all the new phony Fed money that’s been created?\n\n“Quantitative Easing” is a textbook way to create a market crash. Inflated stock value without any actual production supporting it? This is the “Bull Run” to end all “Bull Runs”. All “Bull runs” come to an end, and this one is running on fumes.\n\nThe average Wall Street Bull Run lasts 2.1 years. This one is at over six years. All good things come to an end. It’s just a matter of time. In other words, this bubble is 3X greater than the average market bubble. The market will correct itself, and you better not be near that mountain when the avalanche starts.\n\nBTW, how many times over the last year have you heard someone on TV, online, or in an investment discussion say “Buy Gold & Silver!”? You hear it almost every day. So why aren’t gold and silver prices 2-3 times higher than they are, at a bare minimum? The answer is simple. These markets are rigged and manipulated, just like the Dollar Index and the Consumer Price Index. The banks control those markets, and they’re holding the prices down. Many financial experts believe the true price of gold and silver is as much as 5-10X what the listed price is, which is why they say buy now. They’re right.\n\nIf you believe everything you’re told about the value of the dollar, the amount of inflation, and the price of gold and silver, you are walking blind without a cane. I do have a financial investment background on Wall Street, and all I can say is gold won’t be under US$1,500 long-term, and is ready for unprecedented growth, only because the price you see is not real.\n\nOne day, you’ll wake up, and gold will be US$5-8k an ounce. Silver will be US$80-100, as severe hyperinflation and the dollar collapse will hit the United States like a freight train. The only question is: Do you see the shell game for what it is? And will you get out of the market in time, or collapse with it?\n\nSo what does that have to do with the price of tea in China? When these manipulated markets correct themselves over the next couple of years, Bitcoin, and its owners, will be there to reap the rewards. Smart people, rich in gold and silver, will sell when price seeks its true level, and will invest in something else like bitcoin, if they haven’t already. You have to be patient. Fools rush in, and out.\n\nReason #5 - Halving Production will Double Bitcoin value\n\nDon’t forget that next year, at right around this time, Bitcoin production is scheduled to drop from 25 BTC every 10 minutes to 12.5 BTC every ten minutes. You don’t have the be a Wall Street economist to know that half the supply of any salable commodity with at least the same demand leads to prices quickly doubling at the very minimum.\n\nDemand and transaction volume has seen a steady increase throughout 2014, which was supposed to be such a bad of year for Bitcoin, to the present day. This has happened regardless of the BTC price, another indicator of market strength.\n\nThis means that prices should more than double after the halving takes effect on the market. Let’s face it, we are in the right place at the right time. Will you take advantage of the current buyer’s market is the only question.\n\nHere to stay\n\nNo one said a revolutionary new technology like Bitcoin hitting the mainstream would be smooth or easy. Bitcoin is going through some growing pains, but I needn’t go through history to show you how so many of today’s staples have gone through bumps in the road only to come clean out on the other side, stronger than ever.\n\nThe cassette tape was invented almost 15 years before the Sony Walkman took it mainstream in the 80’s. With Bitcoin, there is simply too much money invested, too much technology available, and too much corporate and global interest to stop Bitcoin at this point.\n\nThe world’s brightest computer and business minds are brainstorming about how to take advantage and leverage this new, innovative technology. “The Network Effect” of Bitcoin cannot be ignored. Bitcoin must go through this awkward stage, like a pubescent teenager who has outgrown his clothes from last year, before it can mature and become what we expect it to be.\n\nIn 2013, it went from Kid Currency to a grown adult, married with children, with no stops in between. The market corrected it. It always does. Now, the Dollar is having its day in the sun, which is suppressing bitcoin’s value. This too shall pass.\n\nJust like Bitcoin had to pay for being overvalued eighteen months ago, so will the dollar. Many with an economic education see the coming market correction as the final correction in the history of the dollar, and I agree. This has all the earmarks of an epic collapse of biblical proportions, and those who hold the bitcoins will be rewarded handsomely.\n\nBitcoin is much more than just a digital currency. It’s an invention that cannot be “uninvented.” Bitcoin will evolve, add new features, and it will change the world of technology. Digital currency is here to stay, mostly because it is much better than what is in place today, and the world badly needs a better currency system, with the superior digital protocols that come with it.\n\nBitcoin isn’t controlled by a single entity, which scares most centralized, controlled establishment forces, but the Internet was never centrally controlled, and it did just fine. You and I are doing just fine with the Internet. Better than fine. So good, in fact, that we have been given the birth of Bitcoin, money for the people, by the people.\n\nWhy not give yourself a round of applause? You are building and selling lifeboats in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, with The Titanic that is the U.S. Dollar heading for an iceberg right before your very eyes. Bitcoin won’t save everyone, but Bitcoin does need an event to propel it into the mass market mainstream, and the collapse of the dollar is coming to solve that problem in due time.\n\nPlenty of people will make you rich(er) by jumping on the Bitcoin lifeboat at the last second. Gold bars and ETFs won’t make good currency for food and water when the dollar faces its epic resolution by the market.\n\nWhen the dollar-loving laggards are finally ready, even forced, to get on board with Bitcoin just to survive, be happy to lend them a hand. They’ll surely need it, much sooner than they think.\n\nWhat event do you think will take Bitcoin “to the moon”? Share above and comment below.', 'Update: it appears that Todd Kantor was not the same man as reported previously, but another victim instead.\n\nEarlier this month, CCN reported on a nameless man who was held at gunpoint for Bitcoin in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nNow he has come forward to another outlet, YouMeAndBTC, and in the below video he is identified as Todd Kantor and describes the events in greater detail. It appears that the story that CNBC and others ran was summarily wrong in some respects, notably how long he was held and how much backstory there was in the events.\n\nIn the video he says that this has been going on for some time in New York. He also says that part of the reason he was willing to just get in the car with someone was that he knew one of the people he was dealing with. He describes the case of a firefighter who was robbed earlier this year and apparently decided to fight back, which cost him a few weeks in the hospital and initiated his retirement from selling bitcoins.\n\nHe says that it’s “mostly younger kids” buying bitcoins in Brooklyn, which means that they have a physical advantage over the middle-aged man in terms of conducting a robbery. He describes the actual events as being more thorough than previously understood. He says they held him for “a couple of hours” and forced his son to bring down electronics from his apartment.\n\nAlso read: The Government Could Struggle to Seize Your Bitcoin\n\nNew System in Place\n\nThe professional Bitcoin trader also said that he and other pro traders in New York have now moved to a system where they have teamed up and use an entirely different protocol. In a bit of a confusing bit, he describes the way it works now. They meet at a bank, which is usually a well-lit type of situation. They do the transaction, whether he is buying or selling, there. If he’s buying, he goes in and gets the money after the Bitcoin transaction has been confirmed. If he’s selling, he gets the cash up front.\n\nIt doesn’t seem that he has given up on Craigslist as a viable place to sell bitcoins, and this could be a privacy concern. Using Craigslist affords him the ability to leave no third-party trace of the deals he has conducted, which is a problem for many in the Bitcoin world. Further, the recent BitLicense passage could have some impact on his business model, so presumably he must be concerned about coming under the scrutiny of regulators by using a traditional exchange service.\n\nIn any case, CCN repeats our previous advice to avoid using random methods of selling bitcoins. There needs to be some form of accountability for both parties, and sites like LocalBitcoins provide that. Taking all the risk into your own hands, especially if you are the one selling the bitcoins, can put you in a hospital bed or worse, as has been repeatedly shown. But in the end, you’re going to do what you’re going to do, so for your own sake, please do it carefully.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Travis Patron is a digital money researcher and author of The Bitcoin Revolution: An Internet of Money. Here he explains why the late American mathematician John Nash may have influenced the creation of bitcoin.\n\nCould John Nash, someone who had been at the forefront of mathematical and economic thought into the prospect of \'ideal money\', be justly attributed credit for the formation of the electronic cash system of cryptocurrency?\n\nHe once stated in a lecture:\n\n""The special commodity or medium that we call money has a long and interesting history. And since we are so dependent on our use of it and so much controlled and motivated by the wish to have more of it or not to lose what we have we may become irrational in thinking about it and fail to be able to reason about it like a bout of technology, such as a radio, to be used more or less efficiently.""\n\nNash described the concept of ideal money as having the function of a standard of measurement and, thus, it should become comparable to the watt, the hour or a degree of temperature.\n\nHe asserted an ideal form of money should provide a viable solution to the Triffin dilemma – it should serve both short-term domestic and international long-term objectives where central banking money has utterly failed (the average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years).\n\nAsymptotically ideal money, a concept Nash studied in depth, focuses on the fluctuations and long-term perceived value of money, where the ideal inflation rate is as close to zero as possible, without being negative (deflation). Currently, this accurately describes the economic nature of bitcoin, as it is a disinflationary money supply by design – that is, it is decreasing in its inflationary nature by halving the block reward (and new currency issuance rate) at regular intervals.\n\nThe inflation rate of bitcoin asymptotically approaches zero as we inch closer to the currency limit of 21 million units.\n\nGlobal savings outlet\n\nNash described this ideal of money as something which could provide a global savings outlet for people who would otherwise be subject to \'bad money\', or money expected to lose value over time under conditions of inflation among other things.\n\nIn a paper published in the Southern Economic Journal, Nash described a nonpolitical value standard for comparisons of value, asserting that an industrial consumption price index could be ""appropriately readjusted depending on how patterns of international trade would actually evolve"".\n\nMoreover, Nash described how actors that were in control of this standard could corrupt this continuity, yet the probability of damages through corruption would be as small as the probability of politicians altering the measurements of meters and kilometers.\n\nWithin the bitcoin network, the mining difficulty index, which can be viewed as a type of consumption index, is intelligently adjusted based on a regulatory algorithm which assigns the difficulty at a rate where new blocks are mined every 10 minutes, on average.\n\nMajority miners\n\nFurther, authorities of the bitcoin network (51% mining pools) could corrupt the standard of non-double spending, yet doing so would be an attempt to alter the calculation of transactions while not honoring their own incentive to remain an honest mining participant.\n\nThe bitcoin whitepaper itself describes how such an authority would choose to ensure the integrity of this transaction standard, as doing otherwise would devalue their own authority position in the mining network.\n\nThe nonpolitical industrial consumption price index Nash described in his 2002 paper is represented by the bitcoin network\'s intelligent design towards regulating mining consumption power and readjusting the difficulty and block rewards accordingly.\n\nGiven that the bitcoin network is inherently regulated by an algorithm which adjusts the consumption index to an average of 10 minutes, could it be argued that the standard unit of measurement is time itself?\n\nBitcoin influencers\n\nHal Finney, one of the early developers of the bitcoin protocol, is often touted as one of the creators of the technology due to the optimizations to elliptic curve mathematics in the field of cryptography he made alongside Satoshi Nakamoto in the earliest days of its existence.\n\nAs the first transaction recipient of bitcoin, Finney was integral to bitcoin’s operational takeoff, and can justly be described as one of its most crucial creators.\n\nMuch in the same way Hal Finney is credited with optimizing the mathematics and cryptography behind the technology, John Nash can be seen as an integral, indirect component to the decades of research leading up to the invention of bitcoin.\n\nNash\'s work on ideal money is represented in the most fundamental aspects of bitcoin\'s economic nature. His insights into a form of money which can be used as a true measuring tool and one which solves the Triffin dilemma by serving as a viable domestic and international money supply, have made bitcoin into what it is today – a practical opportunity to achieve an international standard of ideal money.\n\nIs bitcoin the closest thing we have thus far seen to the concept of ideal money? John Nash’s work into the field did indeed make its way into the invention of bitcoin.\n\nAlthough he was very likely never behind the guise of Satoshi Nakamoto, his work lives on in the monetary policies built into the bitcoin protocol.\n\nJohn Nash image via Prometheus72 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

With the widespread use of smartphones and the increasing popularity of bitcoin, it is not surprising the two have found a way to compliment each other. In fact, smartphones are poised to drive anonymous bitcoin transactions in a massive way.\n\nAlso Read: Polychemy’s Necklaces Transfer Bitcoin Without Phones\n\nWelcome to the digital age. With a quick snap of a smartphone camera, QR codes can be scanned from signs, product labels, pieces of paper, computers, TV screens, even clothing. QR codes seem to be popping up more and more, but for a lot of people, they are still somewhat foreign objects.\n\nA QR code (a.k.a “Quick Response” code) is a bar code readable by mobile phones. They can store different types of alphanumeric data such as website URL’s, bitcoin addresses, email addresses, plain text, and phone numbers. While not a new invention, QR codes are becoming increasingly popular with the rise of bitcoin. Since bitcoin is an intangible digital currency, it is easy to see why QR codes are such viable tools for these transactions.\n\nHow Smartphones Read QR Codes\n\nA smartphone just needs a camera and QR code reader app installed, and like magic, the mobile device is upgraded to a new world of digital possibilities. What can you do with QR codes? The ways in which this digital technology can be used are almost unlimited. QR codes are not just for sending and receiving bitcoin, they come in handy for quickly navigating web links, promoting fundraising campaigns, or for business applications.\n\nSpecific Uses for QR Codes:\n\nraising money for a cause\n\ncontributing to political parties or campaigns\n\nengaging TV audiences\n\nreal estate\n\npaying for advertised items\n\nparking meters\n\nredeeming store coupons\n\nrestaurant menus\n\nOne example that points to the power of smartphones for driving bitcoin transactions is the Alabama college student who rounded up $24 thousand in anonymous bitcoin donations. In Dec 2013, the student held up this sign asking for bitcoin donations at a sports game aired on ESPN:\n\nThe donations flooded in. The student decided to donate 11 BTC, or approximately $11,700 to Sean’s Outpost, a non-profit organization. It is also an example of how smartphones make the process of raising bitcoin donations easier and faster.\n\nOther Ways Smartphones Drive Bitcoin Transactions\n\nApart from utilizing QR codes, there are several other ways smartphones are being used for bitcoin transactions. Some include bitcoin tipping features, bitcoin mobile payment platforms, and airtime remittance services. ChangeTip is a bitcoin tipping feature that can be used to send bitcoin directly through text messaging or email. BitPay is a mobile payment platform that allows bitcoin transactions using mobile devices. Yet another way we see smartphones driving bitcoin transactions is a service known as Bitrefill. Using Bitrefill mobile airtime remittances can be sent instantly with bitcoin.\n\nWhat are the coolest uses for QR codes? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nImages: Ariel Zambelich/WIRED, 2\n\nOriginally posted on: Smartphones and QR Codes to Drive Bitcoin Transactions', 'Bitcoin is the most established digital currency available today. It provides a safe, anonymous way to send and receive a virtual currency everybody trusts. However, managing bitcoins is not quite as simple as managing a bank account. In this article I will explain how to manage your bitcoins using Electrum. Please note that in this article I will provide working knowledge of how to use Electrum, without entering the mysterious land of cryptography and technical details of Bitcoin.\n\nThe basics: setting up Electrum\n\nFirst of all, I suggest you install the latest version of Electrum. Note that Electrum exists for Linux, Windows, OS X and Android. Instructions will vary depending on your operating system.\n\nOnce you have installed it, it will ask you what you want to do: create a new wallet, or restore a wallet. For now, just chose to create a new wallet leaving the default options.\n\nThe initial screen\n\nThen, the second step comes along: Electrum will show you your ""wallet generation seed"", which is a list of 13 words you will absolutely need to save somewhere safe.\n\nThe list of 13 words. If you are serious about bitcoins, you should memorise them\n\nRemember: anybody with these words will be able to recreate exactly your Electrum wallet, and spend all of your bitcoins if they wish!\n\nOnce you\'re done, it will prompt you with a password request. You should treat it like you treat your Internet Banking password.\n\nOnce you are done, you are finally good to go: Electrum will show by default a list of transactions you made. As you can see, there is (obviously) nothing here.\n\nElectrum started for the first time\n\nWhen you want to receive bitcoins you will need to provide your ""bitcoin address"": if you click on the ""Receive"" tab in Electrum, you will see the long string of numbers and letters. Each one of them is a valid bitcoin address you can use to receive bitcoins. Pick the first one in the list: that\'s the address you will use to transfer money into your wallet.\n\nGetting real money in\n\nExchanging Bitcoins into real money and vice versa is a tricky business. The main issue is that when you change real money into bitcoins, the tokens exchanged are 100% anonymous. So, these transactions are very prone to fraud and money laundering.\n\nYour default wallet, just created. Each line represent a working bitcoin address\n\nThis is the reason why:\n\ncompanies who exchange bitcoins for money and vice versa are really careful about the identities of their customer\n\nanybody who claims that they will send you money for your bitcoins without asking for ID and proof of address are very likely to be a scam\n\nWhat it looked like when I sent money over\n\nThe Bitcoin wiki has a page on How To Buy Bitcoins With Your Credit Card. I would not use any service that is not listed here.\n\nAs an Australian travelling through Italy, for the purpose of writing this article, I picked 247exchange.com. However, at the moment they do not cater for US customers.\n\nChanging real money into bitcoin can be a real pain! However, it\'s well worth the effort. Generally speaking, be prepared to provide one form of official ID and an utility bill with your address.\n\nShortly after initiating your transactions, your bitclient will show a ""pending"" transaction; it will stay ""pending"" for a while: it will take some time for the bitcoin network to acknowledge the transaction as ""done"". The details are a little technical; however, just remember that it will take around 10 minutes or so.\n\nThe transaction is still pending\n\nThe bitcoin address the money was sent to is now showing the transaction\n\nOnce the money is ""cleared"", it will appear as available in Electrum.\n\nOnce the transaction it\'s done, it\'s shown as done\n\nSee how the receiving address now has a balance\n\nOnce you have received the bitcoins, the receiving address will show a balance.\n\nSending bitcoins\n\nAssume now that you want to send bitcoins out. Assume that you want to send half of the bitcoins you have on your wallet.\n\nFirst of all, you will need to know the bitcoin address where you are sending your bitcoins to. Once you have it, go to the ""Send"" tab and enter the number of bitcoins you want to send.\n\nAssume that you want to send a portion of the bitcoins you have. So, you have 4.9 micro bitcoins, and you want to send 3 out.\n\nClick on ""Send"", enter the address where you want to send your bitcoin, pick ""3"" (as in, 3 micro bitcoins) and hit ""send"". You will be warned of a fee that will be automatically charged. Once you\'ve agreed on the fee (I recommend you leave the default), you are done.\n\nIf you look at your wallet after this operation, you will see that:\n\nThe address you used to receive the bitcoins is under the ""used"" list. It\'s not recommended to use that address again.\n\nThe equivalent of the ""unspent"" bitcoins is associated to a bitcoin address under ""change""\n\nThis can be confusing at first, but it actually makes a lot of sense: you had 4.9 micro bitcoins, and sent 3 out. However, in order to send those 3 micro bitcoins, you actually sent the whole 4.9 micro bitcoins, and got the ""change"" (minus the fees).\n\nThis will also preserve your privacy: this ""fragmentation"" in your virtual wallet makes it much harder for anybody to figure out how much a person has.\n\nSince that address now has a 0 balance (remember, the ""change"" went into a ""change"" address!), it is now marked as ""used"". This happens in Electrum once an address has been used at least once and it has a 0 balance (bitcoins received is the same as bitcoins sent).\n\nThe reason is simple: in Bitcoins, the list of transactions is 100% public. If you ever only use the same bitcoin address (even to receive the ""change"" of your transactions), anybody able to associate that bitcoin address to you will have a very clear idea of your spending habits.\n\nThis is why you are encouraged to have, and use, several addresses when sending and receiving bitcoins. Since it\'s impossible to know who ""owns"" a specific wallet, you might in time receive large amounts of bitcoins, but all to different addresses; only you (and your bitcoin client) will know that those addresses all belong to you.\n\nRecovering your wallets\n\nRecovering your coins in case of disaster consists in recovering your bitcoin addresses. Each address is made up of its ""public"" component (what you see when you run Electrum) and a private component (the super-secret private key associated to that address).\n\nStoring this information is tricky, because computers break, get stolen, and things can (and do) generally go wrong. While other programs will recommend to store your addresses ""somewhere safe"", Electrum has a much better approach: it uses the ""seed"" (the list of 13 words) to generate your bitcoin addresses -- and I mean both components, private and public.\n\nSo, there is no need to backup your bitcoin data: there is only a big need to memorise those words. The best spot for them is your own memory.\n\nThis article avoided any technical explanation about how Bitcoin works. If you are interested in a more technical view of it, I recommend How might we use blockchains outside cryptocurrencies? which is a fantastic explanation on how the Blockchain (the heart of Bitcoin) works.', 'Just last weekend, LocalBitcoins set its weekly record trading volume. Across disparate regions, there seems to be a unifying trend: volume is increasing on LocalBitcoins.\n\nBut this has left some wondering: how much of this trading volume is due to fraud? Most of the transactions done on LocalBitcoins are not done via peer-to-peer cash transactions, but instead on transactions based around intermediary financial institutions. Does this mean that more and more people are dealing in bitcoins by depositing money in other individuals accounts?\n\nNonetheless, it appears on LocalBitcoins, at least, Bitcoin trading has been on the rise in 2015. This in light of many former users saying that once they do a few transactions with a trusted source they met on LocalBitcoins, they remove the transactions off the website.\n\nIn many key countries, trading is on the rise in 2015. For instance, in Argentina, where economic uncertainty has brought fears of yet another episode of inflation, trading has spiked at certain points in 2015:\n\nIn Russia, where Bitcoin has been ruled illegal, trading on LocalBitcoins increases.\n\nIn Sweden, a similar trend:\n\nAustralia, where law enforcement has paid especially close attention to cryptocurrency, trading on LocalBitcoins is on the rise:\n\nIn India, a similar trend:\n\nLocalBitcoins has had history of fraud and scam issues, and the problem continues to this day. A recent spike in trading volume on the website in South Africa might spawn optimism for the currency in another under-developed economy.\n\nBut, it appears there is something a bit more sinister tied to the increase in trading activity. While few details are known, and it is not for sure, it appears the increase can be tied to fraudulent activity.\n\nBitcoin Charts is showing a marked increase in trading activity in South Africa on LocalBitcoins. Although it would be nice to think this is because more people are finding every day uses for Bitcoin, the spike is dramatic, and it is possible the situation begs for a more detailed explanation. Here is the website’s LocalBitcoins (ZAR) chart:\n\nSimilar is being seen on Bitx:\n\nMany are contending that there has been an increase in money scams in the region, and LocalBitcoins is suffering the consequences. As can be seen here, no in person trades are currently available on the main page of the website:\n\nAccording to one Reddit user:\n\nThere is a ponzi that is gaining popularity over there, which has caused us to be extra-wary of trading with South Africans at the current juncture. This ponzi was unrelated to bitcoin (shocking, I know) until just recently when the ponzi operators decided to start taking BTC instead of fiat for payments into the scheme. IMHO, this is causing the massive price discrepancy over there.\n\nWe’re not about to give them any extra publicity so don’t ask for a name or a link. Fuck ponzis… google it yourself if you are so inclined.\n\nPSA: if someone promises you super high yield returns for your “dream donation” it’s bullshit. Anything too good to be true, IS too good to be true.\n\nThe commenter did not respond to CCN for further comments.\n\nAnother user wrote seemingly unsurprised by the notion that there was a scam on LocalBitcoins.\n\nIf any one asks you for money or bitcoins/litecoins from South Africa it’s a scam, now there will be a lot more scams created. Simple rule never give money to stranger.\n\nTo be sure, this sort of behavior is not uncommon for LocalBitcoins, as the website has provided an entire forum devoted to warning about scammers. The forum is updated with nearly daily warnings.\n\nFor this reason, Cryptocoins News wants to take this opportunity remind everybody in the space to use the utmost precaution when dealing in bitcoins, and to use escrow whenever possible, and only when dealing with people you know and trust is no option.\n\nWith that said, the notion of peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions is truly at the heart of the Bitcoin network, and LocalBitcoins has certainly been one of the most important websites for the development of Bitcoin.\n\nHave more security advice? Let us know in the comments.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Zimbabwe’s currency, the Zimbabwean dollar, is undergoing super-hyperinflation. It is not on its last legs, its kaput, its collapsed, its down and out. Zimbabweans will have to exchange quadrillions of local dollars to gain a few US dollars next week.\n\nWhat would you do? There are various options that Zimbabwe might go in. Create a new fiat currency\n\nCreate a new fiat currency\n\nAdopt the US Dollar\n\nAdopt Bitcoin\n\nCreate their own digital currency\n\nIf they create a new fiat currency then who in the global market would accept it? How long would it take to create, and get accepted into the global financial market? With the fear of how they destroyed their previous fiat currency so fresh in the thoughts of the market would they even be able to trade internationally?\n\nAdopt the US dollar is an option. The world’s reserve currency, already accepted in most places. And currently it seems that this option is what their country is guiding itself towards. And how little US dollars will they receive?\n\nYahoo News reports it as;\n\nThe RBZ said customers who still have stashes of old Zimbabwean dollar notes can walk into any bank and get $1 for every 250 trillion they hold. That means a holder of a 100 trillion bank note will on Monday get 40 cents. The RBZ has set aside $20 million to pay Zimbabwean dollar currency holders.\n\nInternational Trade\n\nWelcome back to the global international market Zimbabweans, with your few pitiful dollars.\n\nI recently saw a Trews episode on Youtube. Russel Brand discussed how in the US a TV entertainment show had been created, for entertainment purposes. About giving money to poor people, so that they can feel what its like not to be desolate for once in their lives.\n\nSomething is very wrong in this world when things like this can happen.\n\nAdopt Bitcoin\n\nThey could adopt bitcoin. But at the current value of $232 (in-erringly stayed this way for the last two months), they would have very little for their entire populace. And would still be excluded from the global market through lack of purchasing power.\n\nCould they mine bitcoin? Possibly, but at the current rate of hashpersec, what would they receive? Assuming they could even afford to buy mining hardware at this point. They could make their own, but this would take time, and would still have to compete against the massive power of the current Bitcoin network.\n\nMaybe Startup 21 will come to the rescue. Do enough Zimbabweans have mobile phones that they would receive some Satoshi through mining? But how little Satoshi would they receive? Probably not enough to live on or trade internationally on any meaningful scale.\n\nAlso Read: 21 Inc Releases New Bitcoin Mining Chip for Smartphones\n\nCreate Their Own Digital Currency\n\nWith bitcoin acting as the world’s reserve for the Crypto-Age each nation needs its own national currency. It is fine how a country works taxation at the point of conversion to fiat at this time. But what of the time when the entire financial world operates based on cryptocurrencies?\n\nAnd as much as I hate to say it, they will need a form of taxation for public expenditures, free health, free public services, and similar. Preferably a taxation service that takes from all the avoided tax in the world, from businesses and individuals alike.\n\nTaking from the poorest is a pitiful amount vs. the amount you would take if you took from the richest. And a choice of where your taxes were spent would most definitely be preferred. But we live in the world that we live in, for now. Yes, I believe in a bit of taxation, call me a statist if you need. But I will not say no to free hospitals for poor and sick. Just compare the UK to the US, and how medical bills differ.\n\nIf the Zimbabweans created their own cryptocurrency, they could far easily integrate it into the global crypto-market. I expect that many exchanges international would be most interested to implement the world’s first national currency.\n\nZimbabweans can use the same hardware and facilities that could have used for bitcoin for their cryptocurrency. Float it on the open world market, pay their people in it. Zimbabwean miners could be earning a wage, a decentralised monetary issuance. And through their earnings employ others and expand the national growth.\n\nAn eventual finite system is immune to hyperinflation. It instead has a deflationary curve as its value increases over the open market as the supply declines.\n\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\n\nAssuming it has government and population support, is there any reason it would not grow? In 2009, Zimbabwe had a mobile penetration rate of about 24%, in 2011 the mobile penetration rate was 64%. Two years ago in 2013 it was 105.5%.\n\nHowever, in 2015 it seems to have dropped down to 87% penetration. Though this is based on the number of active sim cards in the country, so it has arguably dropped due to costs of keeping sims active due to hyperinflation.\n\nThe volatility you say? Any more or less than a newly created fiat currency entering the open market? And a fiat currency create after the collapse of the previous fiat currency is not very likely to gain in value.\n\nWould you buy some of this new cryptocurrency? Invest in a nation, support them at the grass roots. All they would need is a mobile phone, and an internet connect.\n\nWhereas a the world’s first national cryptocurrency would gain in value you question? Do you think there is much chance in that? I propose that there is.\n\nDisclaimer: I am biased on the last topic because of a project I am assisting on.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'While the hyperinflationary episode technically peaked in Zimbabwe in 2008, its national fiat currency has finally reached its painful end. At the current rate, one US dollar will buy you 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars - toilet paper is worth more.\n\nZimbabwe was the first country in the 21st century to suffer hyperinflation, and it has never escaped. Bad governance, led by strongman dictator Robert Mugabe, and almost no economic activity and production doomed the country to one of the worst economies on planet earth.\n\nWhat Does This Look Like?\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Mangudya, any customers who held Zimbabwean dollars in a bank account before March 2009 can “convert” them into U.S. dollars. This process will run until September, when those dollars expire and officially end the currency.\n\n“Bank accounts with balances of up to 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars will be paid US$5. Those with balances above 175 quadrillion dollars will be paid at an exchange rate of $1 to 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars. The highest — and last — bank note to be printed by the RBZ in 2008 was 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars. It was not enough to ride a public bus to work for a week.”\n\nWhile the death of Zimbabwe’s currency has been caused by many problems, paper currencies are under attack in favor of electronic money for various reasons.\n\nHistory of Zimbabwean Hyperinflation\n\nFrom March 2007 to November 2008, the daily inflation rate in Zimbabwe was 98% and prices for goods and services were doubling every 24 hours. Economic output, which is one the causes of hyperinflation, declined dramatically after socialist dictator Mugabe initiated land reforms that expropriated a majority of farm land from white farmers and redistributed it to the majority of the population. This in fact led to a collapse in output of over 50%. A war with the Congo was also extraordinarily costly and led to ballooning of government debt.\n\nThis led to paper money being printed, as mentioned. The Central Bank was constantly creating new money with larger dollar amounts on the bills, as prices rose. According to the Cato Institute, the highest monthly inflation reached 79,600,000,000%.\n\nTo get a better perspective on this, below is a timeline of currency denominations and inflation in Zimbabwe. This is what happens when there is rampant corruption and irresponsible fiscal policy, combined with a loss of monetary policy control by the central bank.\n\nThere is an opportunity for Zimbabwe to get creative and form a new currency to fill the vacuum of a dead currency that could prevent it from suffering another episode like this again. While it looks like the US dollar will be one form of currency accepted, the Zimbabwean Central Bank should consider thinking outside the box.\n\nPerhaps it will go the way of Ecuador and form its own digital currency, or perhaps look at a way to incorporate a blockchain-based currency of some kind. Fintech Daily imagines a future with a pan-African currency called Africoin, union-backed by bitcoin instead of the USD. While this still a long shot, Zimbabwe may become the first African country to get really creative with its new form of currency due to sheer necessity.', 'Die Schweizer eidgenössische Steuerverwaltung (ESTV) hat gute Neuigkeiten für die Bitcoin Community: Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass mit Bitcoin als Währung auch Waren gekauft werden, sieht die Schweiz keinen Anlass die digitale Währung der Mehrwertsteuer zu unterlegen.\n\n“Das sind exzellente Neuigkeiten für Bitcoin in der Schweiz.

06/14/2015,"['Anywhere you look, there seems to be a consensus that something has to change with the size of the Bitcoin blocks. Words like “scaling” come up a lot, and how we must be able to compete with Visa and MasterCard if everyday people are ever going to take Bitcoin seriously.\n\nWhile this may be true, there are extremists on both sides of the issue. There are some who advocate lowering the block size to 400kb, and there are others who believe a fork will be necessary in spite of those opposed. This could be an astronomically bad situation for Bitcoin. If the majority of miners don’t go along with the fork direction, ostensibly Bitcoin-XT, then the new network won’t be near as secure and likely won’t be as fast as the nodes and miners left on the other side of the fork.\n\nIn any team situation, there are going to be people you don’t like working with. That doesn’t mean you leave and start a new project, solely for that reason. Rather, you find a reasonable solution to the problem at hand, one that the element you don’t agree with will eventually accept. As John Light said in my recent CCN podcast, there isn’t really a discussion on whether or not the block size needs to be increased. The question is really how and when.\n\nSome of the most die-hard folks in opposition of the increase say that the increase could be implemented in “a couple of weeks,” but such a position fails to acknowledge exactly how long a time that a couple of weeks actually is. In trading time, it’s an eternity. If you’ve got a couple of weeks which allow the mainstream and anti-Bitcoin press to say the network has reached its capacity, that there is now irrefutable proof that such a solution can’t work for mass usage, then you’ve also got a pristine situation for something even worse: mass exit strategies being executed by large holdings. A self-eating bear that the value of Bitcoin could likely never recover from.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin-Xt Pushing Ahead With Bigger Blocks\n\nAnd let’s be clear: the fact that such elements raise this as a defense of their position, that such measures could be taken quickly, is also an admission that they should be taken at all. If you agree that block sizes should be increased at some point in the future, then why can you not agree that they should happen sooner than that? Is this some play to appear relevant, or moreover to illustrate dissatisfaction with other facets of the situation? Are you saying no to the developers proposing the increase, rather than saying no to the actual increases? Would this be the same if you were the lead developer, and even your most banal statements were echoed by hundreds of people within hours of making them?\n\nScaling is important, but it’s not all that matters. The opposition to block size increases have several valid reasons for their opposition, one being that it will increase the cost to miners of mining. This is a legitimate concern, and there needs to be some evidence that miners will be compensated on the other side of it. We need mining to maintain the security and integrity of Bitcoin. It would not be ideal if only large operations could afford to do mining. It would not be ideal if those coming to Bitcoin for the first time had to wait hours or days for their first transactions to go through.\n\nAt the same time, it would not be ideal if “free transaction” continues to be a refrain used by those promoting Bitcoin. It is not free to move bitcoins as well as it is not free to create them. It is not free to store the block chain, either, though it certainly gets less expensive as time goes on. These considerations need to be given the respect they deserve. The entire community needs to agree that free transactions are nonsense. If you can’t pay a penny to send some money, why then, really, are you sending money? Perhaps the increased costs of a block size increase should hinge on a mandatory increase in transaction fees. If we can now do 100 transactions per second and the mandatory cost of a transaction is a penny or half of a penny, wouldn’t miners be less likely to feel it so negatively? Wouldn’t they be able to compensate and, over time, profit by this?\n\nThe best solution will answer the concerns of everyone at once. This sounds impossible, but it seems that other divided groups manage it everyday. Obstructionists tacticians need to be ostracized. Those who are proven wrong in their position and then simply double up with some theoretical or otherwise unlikely reasoning to return to that position, rather than doing the rational thing, which is to concede it, should be replaced with equally competent people. As Nick Szabo recently said of the whole thing, we need less noise and more science. The science seems to disprove the doomsday predictions of the anti-increase crowd, and also seems to underline that it’s not as dire as the other crowd makes it seem either.\n\nWhatever happens, there are many thousands of people who are deeply invested in this thing we call Bitcoin, and for a few people to effect a massive devaluation of their investment simply because they can’t agree, that cannot be allowed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Tatiana Cutts is a lecturer in law at the University of Birmingham, UK, and a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. Her interest in bitcoin stems from prior research into private law aspects of money and tracing. Here, in an article co-authored by David Goldstone QC, of Quadrant Chambers, she examines the subject of bitcoin ownership and whether this impacts the fungibility of the digital currency.\n\nThere is an often tacit assumption in discussions of traceability in the bitcoin sphere that bitcoins can, in some sense that is meaningful to all those who use the term, be “owned”. So, people wonder what will happen if the arms race between tracking techniques and evasion capabilities is won, even temporarily, by the tracer: won’t that impair the fungibility of bitcoins, they ask, and thus undermine the effective circulation of funds?\n\nLegal ownership\n\nIn fact, both the assumption and conclusion require delicate treatment. To start with, it is important to note that the term “ownership” has a peculiar meaning in private law. At its heart is the idea that a limitless category of other people have an obligation to “stay away” from whatever is the subject matter of one’s claim.\n\nIf that obligation is breached, the remedy is an action in tort law. So, if you steal my chair, I can sue you, and – crucially – anyone to whom you give or sell it.\n\nMoney has a special place in law. We often focus on its status as “legal tender”, by which cash is transformed into a mechanism for final settlement. But the principles applicable to the transfer and protection of ownership of cash also differ from other physical commodities. In particular, whilst (practical matters aside) you can always sue an innocent recipient of a physical thing stolen, you cannot do so if the thing is money, and the recipient is an innocent purchaser.\n\nThe current possessor has the best claim. Why? Because the costs associated with figuring out whether the money is “good” or “bad” would stultify the circulation of cash. This is the second important point: it is not practical fungibility that money requires to circulate, but economic fungibility: there must be no reason for the payee to prefer the receipt of certain coins or notes over others of an equivalent nominal value.\n\nInformation\n\nThe application of property principles to the digital sphere has proven difficult, particularly in the UK. It is clear that pure information cannot be owned, because it is replicable or “inexhaustible”: if you “steal” the password for my phone, you have not removed it from me. Rather, we both now have the password, and can access the phone.\n\nIndeed, often the purpose of creating information-media is sharing: music exists to be heard, books to be read, plays to be acted. We therefore have rules for the protection of private and public information that are independent of the law of property, and do not share its basic tenet: they are rules that manage data dissemination and protect private information, not rules that build a legal fence around particular things.\n\nBut some digital assets, such as domain names, are both exhaustible and can be controlled exclusively. In coping with these assets, English law has taken a different approach from some US circuits: thus far, so-called “intangible” assets (although this term is fraught with difficulty) have fallen outside the sphere of property protection. Development has been actively opposed by the Court of Appeal, and is likely – by analogy with the treatment of contractual rights – to be knocked back at a Supreme Court level.\n\nOf course, contractual rights and digital assets are not identical. We do not apply property principles to contractual rights, not because they are not exhaustible or intended to be held exclusively (they are), but because the information costs associated with figuring out whether one’s actions interfere with another’s contractual rights are too high. That simply will not wash with an asset such as a domain name, in which details are stored in a central registry that links a name clearly to a real-world identity.\n\nBitcoin and property\n\nIn this regard, bitcoin is particularly interesting. Questions of proximity of user control aside, in its present form, the supply of bitcoins is exhaustible, and outputs are intended to be controlled exclusively. But, whilst some have argued that property principles are required to encourage and support digital development, it cannot be assumed that the economic incentives will all always travel in one direction.\n\nIn particular, we have already seen that if money is to circulate, it must be possible for the payee to acquire the confidence, cheaply and easily, that the value of those outputs in his hands is at least as good as any others. Doubt incites gridlock. There is, therefore, a good policy reason for the conclusion that one cannot, in a private law sense, “own” bitcoin.\n\n“Even if bitcoins are property, they ought not to be protected by the regime applicable to other commodities.”\n\nSo, whilst the law of confidence may provide a remedy to a user for interference with his or her private key, it is much less clear that the law of tort should provide remedies for remote recipients. If we do apply property protections to bitcoin, it will be necessary to embrace wholeheartedly the exception for money media.\n\nThis is certainly possible: there is no doubt that bitcoin it is a negotiable payment mechanism (or, in economic-speak “medium of exchange”) with a supportive structure of accounting, its value scale calibrated in accepted units. But now we have come full circle: even if bitcoins are property, they ought not to be protected by the regime applicable to other commodities.\n\nIn fact, this approach – which might well require an intensive investigation into the information of which a payee might have availed himself about the transactional history of the output, had he so tried – might prove equally cumbersome, and less predictable. As growth of heuristics linking transactions to one another, and users to transactions, starts to yield more substantial information, so the difficulty of confidently asserting that a purchaser who does not inquire is truly “innocent” increases.\n\nThe wrong tool?\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we must not assume that legal protections are necessary to drive a particular digital economy. Copyright law is the most obvious example of a tool that has fallen far behind in the search to secure sufficient protection to support industry growth. Access to online newspapers, music, audiobooks, images – the list goes on – is restricted not by the law of copyright, but by code.\n\nBitcoin has built-in cryptographic protections, a plethora of offline storage options, and it seems increasingly likely that the transactional record provided by the blockchain will itself disincentivise abuse. And, after all, the ability to exercise practical exclusive control over some asset must trump the ability to pay lawyers to chase it around the globe.\n\nBitcoin lock image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

A topic that was on the tip of everyone’s tongues, seemingly, was regulation.\n\n“You can regulate the intermediaries, and so a lot of the businesses that are building out infrastructure around Bitcoin – the wallet providers, merchant processors, etc. – are gonna be subject to all sorts of regulations, anti money laundering, money transmission regulations,” Brito told the audience. Srinivasan commented on where he sees the most liberal Bitcoin regulation.\n\n“The Japanese regulators actually dug in, really understood the tech and are now actually really positive on the technology… it is probably the most liberal country in terms of Bitcoin regulation in the world right now,” the Andreessen Horowitz representative said, mentioning the island nation as an intriguing place to want to do Bitcoin business.\n\n“Bitcoin isn’t the dollar, but it could be the dollar of the Internet,” Srinivasan said. “Our thesis is it’s going to start with micropayments. It’s gonna start with very low stakes kind of things, so for example in-game points for video games.” Both Srinivasan and Brito felt education was one of the most important areas for Bitcoin. “I think actually we’ve done a pretty good job over the last 18 months of education,” Srinivasan said.\n\nGoldman Sachs has not totally shied away from the cryptocurrency space, having led a $50 million investment round into Circle.

This is either because of a lack of reach by banks into their area, a lack of documentation necessary to open a bank account, or a simple wariness of entrusting banks with both large sums of money and personal information.\n\nThis is why the folks at BitOasis think virtual currency presents an enticing alternative to mainstream financial services.\n\nThere’s no intermediary controlling a person’s funds—Bitcoin is private and storing funds in a virtual wallet is essentially like storing money in a physical wallet.\n\n“It’s as private as cash,” says Doudin.\n\nAnd like a physical wallet, it needs protection from pickpocketing—hence BitOasis’ Multisig security system.\n\nDoudin also thinks Bitcoin is an attractive option for MENA because it offers a superior way of sending remittances. And since MENA features some of the largest remittance corridors in the world, Bitcoin gives workers accustomed to hefty transaction fees a cheaper way to wire funds internationally.\n\nThe fee for sending a remittance using Bitcoin would amount to roughly 1 percent (for exchanging the currency), says Doudin. Sending the Bitcoins is free—like an email. The same transaction with a bank would cost an average 13 percent of the total amount.\n\nInternational borders aren’t a roadblock when moving funds with Bitcoin.\n\nOne reason so many people in MENA are unbanked and suffer expensive transfer fees, Doudin explains, is because regional financial institutions don’t face any competition and have no incentive to change.\n\nBut with the saturation of internet-compatible devices rising in MENA, Bitcoin’s reach is as close as the nearest wifi router.\n\nAnd BitOasis’ launch may have been perfect timing.\n\nIn 2015, Doudin says, Wall Street and venture capitalists have finally started paying closer attention to digital currency.\n\nInvestment banking firm Goldman Sachs recently invested in a Bitcoin startup, and Nasdaq recently announced a partnership with Bitcoin startup Noble Markets.\n\nThe first quarter of 2015 saw the highest venture capital investment total yet, at $226 million, pushing total venture investment in Bitcoin to $676 million.\n\n“It doesn’t mean that this technology will work in the Middle East, but it does give us some assurance that this technology isn’t going anywhere,” says Doudin.\n\nDoudin and BitOasis know disrupting the world of financial services won’t be easy, but they’re banking on Bitcoin being just the catalyst MENA needs."", ""After a life-long fascination with how computing power can be used to solve problems, Alan Yong, founder of DNotes, wanted to add a human element to cryptocurrency.\n\n“DNotes must be built as a digital currency for everyone, irrespective of financial standing — from the poor to the super rich; from the unborn to the most senior. It must deliberately attempt to include and assist women to help close the gender gap.” — Alan Yong\n\nAfter being introduced to cryptocurrencies in 2013, and conducting some serious research, Yong went on to found three cryptocurrency-based organizations:\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Investment Savings Plan (CRISP) — A student-centric, self-directed investment plan that utilizes DNotesVault to release 100 DNotes to willing participants, without requiring them to pay for it. The first 200 accounts to register will be awarded 100 DNotes, plus 10 DNotes each month thereafter, until the account reaches 500\n\nCryptoMoms — A dedicated mission to increase women's participation in cryptocurrency\n\nDNotes — An altcoin with a holistic aim\n\nIn 1989, Yong founded Dauphin Technology, Inc. and quickly became a well-regarded visionary in the early days of mobile computers. In 1992, his company became the Pentagon's largest supplier of laptop computers after winning a US$395 million contract. The Dauphin DTR, a handheld computer that competed head-on with the Apple Newton, was among their best-known products.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke with Yong to learn more about his most recent projects.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What about bitcoin influenced you to create DNotes?\n\nAlan Yong: I feel that the concept of verifiable public ledger for every transaction using ingenious consensus technologies will have world-changing implications, leading to a quantum shift in how we conduct global business, resulting in a large-scale disruption of existing systems, especially in the financial services industry.\n\n“No one has sufficient self-interest to promote and protect Bitcoin, with an over-emphasis that it is a trustless system. [...] How could I hand over my life savings, if no one could be held responsible or would stand by it to give me the confidence that it is in good hands?”\n\nIn addition to business, I also have a background in behavioral science and it did not take me long to conclude that the industry has already developed a culture of its own. It is a culture of self-destruction, high stress, and blatant disrespect for other’s properties and human emotion. I had never seen any business that had a chance of survival in that kind of hostile environment. No wonder the male population has dominated it by a ratio of 95 to 5, male to female.\n\nI made one other observation. No one has sufficient self-interest to promote and protect Bitcoin, with an over-emphasis that it is a trustless system. I thought, what is trustless is the transaction between two parties, where it does not require a trusted intermediary.\n\nMy goodness, how could I hand over my life savings, if no one could be held responsible or would stand by it to give me the confidence that it is in good hands? To me, it is hard-earned money no matter what you call it; commodity, property, or virtual currency of no intrinsic value. These I believe are the serious problems confronting our industry, keeping it from gaining traction towards mainstream acceptance.\n\nDNotes decided since day one that, to be successful, it must create a new culture. That new culture must be built with trust and integrity, promoting mutual respect and cooperation, collaborating in a highly productive environment, focusing on the accomplishment of long-term mutual benefits.\n\nStarting with a shared-stake concept, DNotes must be built as a digital currency for everyone, irrespective of financial standing — from the poor to the super rich; from the unborn to the most senior. It must deliberately attempt to include and assist women to help close the gender gap.\n\nCT: How is cryptocurrency as a platform helping to solve the student debt crisis? What benefits has it posed over fiat?\n\nAY: Coming from a very poor family, I am passionate about using education as the most effective tool to help others move up the social economic ladder. It bothers me a great deal to take notice of students’ increasing debt burden.\n\nAs a society, instead of giving graduating students a head start, we saddled them with a significant student loan payment right off the gate. That is sad. If that was my case, I would not have been able to start my own business after receiving my MBA at Northern Illinois University in 1976, and we would not have DNotes today.\n\n“A small amount invested has the potential to make a big difference. Whereas, using fiat currency as a savings, the true impact is likely to be negative.”\n\nEspecially in the case of DNotes, we have positioned our digital currency on a path towards long-term growth for as far as we can project. Since we don’t expect sizable investment by any individual in CRISP For Students, the potential for huge returns is of major significance.\n\nA small amount invested has the potential to make a big difference. Whereas, using fiat currency as a savings, the true impact is likely to be negative, since the potential yield will likely be lower than the loan service. That being the case, it is better to use the extra money to pay down the loan.\n\nOne of DNotes future plans is to engage and challenge the top 2% and other wealthy individuals to help solve the increasing student debt crisis. Through our CRISP For Students programs, we are committed to working with students worldwide to develop multiple projects for others to participate in, including scholarship funds. It is important that students take advantage of this and sign up for the savings account, even though it is still in pilot stage.\n\n“CryptoMoms has been very successful by all accounts. In over a year, we have over 7,000 registered members and very active participation.”\n\nCT: What impact has CryptoMoms had on women’s empowerment?\n\nAY: CryptoMoms has been very successful by all accounts. In over a year, we have over 7,000 registered members and very active participation. The content the community has contributed is impressive. It is already a valuable learning center for anyone new to Bitcoin and Bitcoin alternative currencies.\n\nThe site is quite definitely well-supported and frequented by women. We basically created a forum with a conducive and supportive environment to empower women to have a space of their own in the cryptocurrency world and let them build it up to their expectation and benefits. No doubt it will pick up momentum over time to be a powerful force and a strong voice for women in the new world of digital currency.\n\nOur industry absolutely needs a drastic increase in women’s participation to gain mass acceptance. They control the purse strings and we respect that. Our CRISP For Kids is actually the contribution of one of our CryptoMoms community members, Chase. It has been well-received and has even attracted some grandparents.\n\nCryptoMoms is also a currency-neutral site where other coins can promote their products and services for free, and a very large number have used that platform. They all have used the service with great respect for everyone and some have been extremely helpful to others. Personally, it is very rewarding for me to see that.\n\nCT: What do you have in mind for the future of DNotes and your other crypto initiatives?\n\nAY: It is estimated that by the year 2020, over five billion smart phones will be in use, and there are 2.5 billion people worldwide today commonly referred to as the unbanked, for not having a bank account or serviced by a bank. I am absolutely convinced that a stable digital currency — with reliable long-term appreciation, in partnership with international charity organizations and the United Nations — will soon have a viable option within our reach.\n\n“DNotes will be known as the currency with a purpose.”\n\nWith two simple cell phones, or computers with an Internet connection, one can be set up to send and receive funds and conduct global commerce, thereby solving the problems of the unbanked. This alone has been my inspiration to work long and hard to position DNotes as a large-scale global digital currency that can take full advantage all the superior features of digital currency and blockchain technology.\n\nWe envision that within 24 months, we will have a world-class, licensed and regulated exchange trading DNotes, Bitcoin and a couple of other digital currencies. There will be an online global marketplace for students, a second one for small business owners, and a third one for women. They will all be launched on global scale. DNotes will be known as the currency with a purpose, with increasingly broad-based support.\n\nCryptoMoms will be a significant catalyst in attracting women’s participation, with increasing support from professional women. It will become the voice of women around the globe, and a power force hard to ignore."", 'Aus „Le Monde diplomatique“\n\nDas Bitcoin-Experiment\n\nDie digitale Währung könnte alle anderen ablösen. Sie ist instabil und betrugsanfällig wie andere Währungen, könnte aber das Finanzsystem verändern.\n\nEs klingt wie eine schöne Utopie: Banken sind überflüssig, keiner ist mehr vom Finanzsystem ausgeschlossen, und den Nationalstaaten ist ihr heiliges Recht genommen, Geld zu drucken. Seit etwa sechs Jahren halten einige Aktivisten das für eine realisierbare Option. Die Revolution könnte nicht durch politische Umstürze erfolgen, sondern mithilfe von Software.\n\nDas Zeitalter der modernen digitalen Kryptowährungen begann zwischen 2008 und 2009. Von seinem geistigen Vater ist nur das Pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto bekannt. Seine Software namens Bitcoin ermöglicht Finanztransaktionen direkt von Internetnutzer zu Internetnutzer. Die Dienste von Kreditkartenunternehmen, von Zahlungsdienstleistern wie PayPal und vor allem von Banken könnten damit potenziell überflüssig werden. Eine Überweisung in der neuen Währung Bitcoin geschieht „peer to peer“. Ein Beispiel: Frau Müller und Herr Schulz haben sich beide die kostenlose Bitcoin-Software aus dem Netz heruntergeladen. Will die eine dem anderen Bitcoin-Geld überweisen, vermittelt zwischen beiden online ein System, das niemandem gehört und keine Transaktionsgebühren erhebt.\n\nDas Bitcoin-System unterscheidet auch nicht zwischen erwünschten und unerwünschten Überweisungen: Politische Embargos gegen Länder lassen sich ebenso umgehen wie die restriktiven Währungskontrollen in China. Allerdings kennt das System auch keine Auflagen zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche und dunklen Geschäften. Bitcoin-Nutzer sind anonymer als Bankkunden. Bekannt ist jeweils nur eine Adresse aus Ziffern und Buchstaben.\n\nTheoretisch könnte der Bitcoin alle anderen Währungen ablösen: Mein Gehalt kommt in Bitcoins, und in Bitcoins bezahle ich meine Miete und meine Einkäufe. Faktisch ist aber das Anwendungsgebiet der Bitcoins bisher noch sehr begrenzt. Weltweit soll es etwa 100 000 echte Läden und Onlinehändler geben, die Bitcoins als Zahlungsmittel akzeptieren. In Internetshops lassen sich Tastaturen für Bitcoins kaufen, und in Bars im Berliner Stadtteil Kreuzberg kann man per Bitcoin-App auf dem Smartphone sogar bezahlen.\n\nLe Monde diplomatique Dieser Artikel stammt aus der aktuellen Ausgabe von Le Monde diplomatique.

Per Banküberweisung oder per Kreditkarte überweist man Euro auf das Konto einer Bitcoin-Börse im Internet und bekommt dafür Bitcoins gutgeschrieben. Wer Bitcoins erhält, tauscht die oft direkt wieder zurück in Euro, da sich damit immer noch mehr kaufen lässt. Über solche Kauf- und Verkauf?angebote auf Handelsplattformen wie der deutschen Börse Bitcoin.de bildet sich ein Umtauschkurs in Euro oder Dollar. Anfangs war ein Bitcoin wenig wert, zwischenzeitlich stieg sein Wert auf 800 Euro, und heute liegt der Wechselkurs bei um die 200 Euro.\n\nVor allem der dezentrale Charakter der Bitcoin-Währung lässt Aktivisten träumen – von einer Welt, in der nicht mehr nationale Banken die Geldmenge regeln, sondern der dezentrale Bitcoin-Algorithmus. Und tatsächlich sah es bis zum letzten Jahr so aus, als ob der Traum eine Chance auf Verwirklichung hat: In den fünf Jahren nach seiner Einführung 2009 nahm die Zahl der Bitcoin-Nutzer rasant zu. Der Gesamtwert des Netzwerks überschritt zeitweise die Marke von 10 Milliarden US-Dollar.\n\nBald gab es eine Flut neuer Kryptowährungen, die mit eigenen Konzepten um neue Zielgruppen buhlten. Deren Gründer kopierten manchmal nur die Bitcoin-Software, andere versuchten sie zu verbessern und das Prinzip Kryptowährung gleich ganz neu zu erfinden. Nerds und politische Aktivisten warfen eigene „Coins“ auf den Markt, aber auch Spaßvögel, Glücksritter und Betrüger.\n\nDer Litecoin, eine der Neugründungen, reduziert die Zeit für die Bestätigung von Transaktionen von zehn auf zweieinhalb Minuten. Der Zetacoin will sich als neue, mobile Zahlungsinfrastruktur für Afrika etablieren. Der Freicoin versucht, das „Liegegeld“-Konzept des Schweizer Ökonomen Silvio Gsell in die Software einzubauen, so dass das Horten von Geld unattraktiv wird. Plötzlich gab es auch einen Greencoin, einen Gaycoin und einen Clean Water Coin.\n\nAuroracoin, Scottcoin und Isracoin\n\nEinige der neuen Coins übernahmen überraschend die Idee einer digitalen Länderwährung – als Marketinggag oder mit dem Ziel, der jeweiligen Bevölkerung eine nichtstaatliche Währung zur Verfügung stellen. Es gab den Auroracoin für Island, den Scottcoin und den Isracoin. Viele alternative Kryptowährungen fanden kaum mehr als ein paar Dutzend Anwender, einige fanden deutlich mehr Nutzer. Die gesamte Marktkapitalisierung des Auroracoins beispielsweise erreichte in weniger als einem Monat mehr als 70 Millionen Euro.\n\nDann kam die Katastrophe: Die größte Bitcoin-Börse Mt.Gox meldete Ende Februar 2014 Insolvenz an. Zehntausende Bitcoiner verloren ihr Geld. Um die 350 Millionen Euro waren mit unbekanntem Ziel verschwunden. Viele hatten Mt.Gox nicht nur genutzt, um Bitcoins gegen Euro oder Dollar zu tauschen, sondern hatten der Börse auch ihre eigenen Bitcoins anvertraut. Die Wirklichkeit des theoretisch dezentralen Softwareprojekts war zu zentralisiert. Was genau passierte, ist immer noch unbekannt. Am wahrscheinlichsten ist ein Szenario, dass auch von großen Betrügereien bekannt ist. Ein technisch versierter Insider kannte die Sicherheitslücken und räumte in einem geeigneten Moment ab.\n\nSeit der Mt.Gox-Insolvenz ist die Szene paralysiert. Viele der alternativen Kryptowährungen sind in der Versenkung verschwunden. Der Bitcoin hat heute eine Marktkapitalisierung von 3 Milliarden Euro, das sind Peanuts im Vergleich zu den klassischen Währungen. In einer Studie der Bundesbank Mitte des vergangenen Jahres gaben lediglich 28 Prozent der Befragten an, die weiterhin mit Abstand größte Kryptowährung zu kennen. Und nur jeder Fünfzigste besaß auch Bitcoins. Nach einem Durchbruch sieht das nicht aus.\n\nUnbemerkt von der Öffentlichkeit arbeiten inzwischen viele Start-up-Unternehmen an Anwendungen, um den Bitcoin und andere Kryptowährungen alltagstauglicher zu machen oder um sie in das bestehende Finanzsystem zu integrieren. Hunderte Millionen an Risikokapital sind bisher geflossen. Die Investoren setzen darauf, dass der durchschlagende Erfolg des Bitcoin ihre Investitionen vergoldet. Auch Banken signalisieren immer wieder Interesse. Die Schweizer Großbank UBS etwa erkundet die Technologie für die Optimierung eigener Prozesse.\n\nHandy als Konto\n\nViele Regierungen scheinen Bitcoin & Co. viel zuzutrauen – und sehen darin eine Bedrohung. Die chinesische Regierung etwa hatte im April 2014 chinesischen Banken verboten, mit Bitcoin-Unternehmen zusammenzuarbeiten. Die Europäische Zentralbank warnte im letzten Jahr vor der Zusammenarbeit mit dem unregulierten Bitcoin. Weltweit schwanken die staatlichen Regulatoren zwischen Verteufelung, Ignoranz und der demonstrativen Umarmung der Digitalwährung.\n\nDie Öffentlichkeit ist gespalten: Die einen glauben, dass Kryptowährungen nie über ein Nischendasein hinauskommen werden; andere halten einen langfristigen Aufstieg für wahrscheinlich. Anfang dieses Jahres schlossen sich zwei US-Journalisten des konservativen Wall Street Journal überraschend den libertären Träumen der Bitcoin-Aktivisten an. In ihrem Buch „Cryptocurrency“ erklären die beiden Experten für digitales Bezahlen die finanzielle Revolution für höchst plausibel.\n\nDie Autoren beschäftigen sich auch mit potenziellen Folgeproblemen: Wie wirkt es sich auf die Arbeitsplätze aus, wenn Banken überflüssig geworden sind? Was passiert, wenn Staaten die Kontrolle über ihre Währungen verlieren? Sie trauen der Krypto-Revolution die Lösung einer globalen Schieflage zu. Schätzungsweise haben 2,5 Milliarden Menschen kein Bankkonto. Durch Bitcoins könnten sie an das weltweite Wirtschaftssystem angeschlossen werden.\n\nVor allem in Afrika haben viele arme Menschen zwar kein Konto, aber ein Handy, mit dem auch bei einfacheren Ausführungen Bitcoin-Transaktionen durchführbar wären. Eine Näherin in einer ländlichen Gegend Indiens oder ein selbständiger senegalesischer Straßenhändler könnten dann bargeldlose Zahlungen anweisen und annehmen, etwas Geld sparen und sich ein bescheidenes Vermögen aufbauen. Der dann unvermeidliche Umtausch von Bitcoins in klassische Landeswährungen und umgekehrt könnte in lokalen Läden vor Ort erfolgen. Per Handy transferiert man den Bitcoin an den Ladenbesitzer, der einem klassisches Geld auszahlt.\n\nEvolution oder Revolution?\n\nRaúl Rojas, Informatikprofessor an der FU Berlin, glaubt allerdings nicht an einen plötzlichen revolutionären Umbruch, sondern an eine graduelle Evolution. Er hat Mathematik studiert, dann bei dem linken Elmar Altvater zur Enstehungsgeschichte von Karl Marx‘ „Kapital“ promoviert und sich in Informatik habilitiert. Rojas denkt, dass sich die Staaten nicht die Aufsicht und Kontrolle über das Geld nehmen lassen werden. Er hält es aber für möglich, dass die großen Netz-Konzerne mit eigenen Zahlideen den Markt einnehmen. Google etwa bietet einen Online-Bezahldienst namens Google Wallet an, und auf dem iPhone lässt sich mit Apple Pay schon mobil bezahlen.\n\nDie dezentralen Kryptowährungen bieten wenig Raum dafür, von den Quasimonopolisten des Internets vereinnahmt zu werden. Im virtuellen Biotop von Bitcoin und Co. sind Google, Apple und Facebook kaum präsent. Aber wenn die Firmen leicht zu bedienende, zentralisierte Bezahlsysteme anbieten, könnte Bitcoin seine Attraktivität als innovatives Bezahlsystem verlieren.\n\nRaúl Rojas kritisiert, dass zumindest eine Vision der Bitcoiner gescheitert ist: dass es mit Kryptowährungen keine übermäßige Akkumulation durch wenige Reiche mehr geben wird. In der Realität halten wenige Personen große Teile der weltweiten Bestände. Für sie ist der Bitcoin ein Spekulationsobjekt. Sie profitieren von Kursschwankungen, die sie teilweise mit hervorrufen. Solange das so bleibt, tauge der Bitcoin kaum als ernsthaftes Zahlungsmittel. Rojas merkt an, dass bis jetzt vor allem Kreditkartenfirmen von den Kryptowährungen profitiert haben.\n\nIn der Regel wird am Anfang und am Ende einer Transaktion der Bitcoin in die jeweilige Landeswährung getauscht, mithilfe klassischer Finanzdienstleister. Rojas glaubt an die Zukunft der neuen Bezahlideen, aber nicht, wie sich Aktivisten das vorstellen: „Kryptowährungen werden sich durchsetzen, davon profitieren wird allerdings vor allem das herkömmliche Finanzsystem.“ Die Zukunft des Bitcoin und der anderen Kryptowährungen dürfte im Spannungsfeld zwischen linken Visionären, besorgten Regierungen und Investoren liegen. Die einen träumen von einer gerechteren Welt, andere fürchten einen Machtverlust.\n\nSteht wirklich eine Revolution bevor, oder wird es doch nur eine müde Evolution? Bitcoin und Co. haben noch einen langen Weg vor sich. Das Zeitalter der modernen Kryptowährungen ist gerade einmal sechs Jahre alt.', 'Finding a job in the Bitcoin world is not as easy as one might think. While there are several companies who are looking to hire additional team members, the recruitment process is still the same as it is with any other company. Send in your resumé, have it checked by a representative, and hopefully you will land a Skype call or a meeting. But what if there was an alternative recruiting process waiting around the corner?\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Jobs in 2015\n\nVettery: A Different Type of Job Recruitment\n\n\n\nThe current recruitment process is complicated, tedious, and leaves quite a lot to be desired. As soon as a company announces one or more vacancies, the resumés start flooding in en masse. It goes without saying that the people responsible for sifting through these piles of user information have a hard time finding the right candidate for the job, a process which can take up to a few months.\n\nVettery wants to shake things up a bit, which can be very beneficial to the employer and potential candidates. During the platform’s beta testing, major companies such as Jet, Etsy, Percolate, and Blue Apron have tested the features. And as of today, Vettery is open to the public, their platform acting as a job marketplace.\n\nCo-founded by Adam Goldstein and Brett Adcock — both of whom have been active in the hedge fund world for quite some time — Vettery prides itself on being transparent, simple, and straightforward to use. The decision to create a job marketplace platform came after years of little to no innovation in the hedge fund sector.\n\nGranted, there are other platforms active in the hiring process space, such as LinkedIn. Every employee or potential employee is advised to have a LinkedIn profile, as it platform allows people to connect with each other from all over the worlds. However, Vettery wants to try something entirely different by trying to tackle the “recruiter” problem directly.\n\nAs of press time, Vettery received over 80,000 job applications, which will be evaluated by an internal team of talent scouts. In the end, less than five percent of all applications are accepted, indicating a very streamlined process to quickly filter through tons of data.\n\nThose candidates who do get accepted in the system will then receive a phone call from one of Vettery’s talent scouts to complete their profile. If someone is lucky enough to land a job offering that fits his or her profile, Vettery will pay the new employee $2,000 USD, which is something unseen in the job recruitment world.\n\nInteresting Opportunity for Bitcoin Companies\n\n\n\nThere are quite a few similarities to be drawn between Vettery and the world of Bitcoin and digital currency. Especially in terms of transparency, which is something many people value when they learn more about the digital currency. It is a positive trend to see more transparent technology and solutions affect different aspects of our everyday lives.\n\nThis new platform also creates an interesting opportunity for Bitcoin companies to list their job openings on Vettery. Rather than relying on platforms such as Coinality, Vettery takes care of most of the screening process. That being said, Bitcoin is a different breed from most companies, so the results may vary slightly.\n\nWould you like to see Bitcoin vacancies on Vettery?

From Monday, the Middle East’s biggest economy will allow direct market access to large overseas investors with more than $5bn in assets under management as the conservative kingdom continues a gradualist approach to financial reform. The Tadawul market, with a capitalisation of more than $560bn, is expected to be upgraded from frontier to emerging markets status by 2017, encouraging more asset managers to allocate funds to Saudi Arabia. Tariq al-Sudairy, chief executive of Riyadh-based Jadwa Investment, forecasts $30bn-$50bn of overseas money will enter the market over the next three to five years. “Inward flows typically materialise gradually over a period of a few years, rather than an immediate flooding of the market,” he said. Until now, foreign firms have been using swap instruments to gain limited access and account for $9bn, or 1.6 per cent, of the overall market. The opening up will provide overseas firms with “a more efficient and direct way of building exposure”, he added. The move, made in the face of objections from some local investors, is part of the government’s broader reform efforts that seek to boost the private sector and reduce oil revenue dependency. The government has said it is also looking to encourage the listing of Islamic bonds, known as sukuk, this year to help companies raise money more efficiently as state finances and banking liquidity come under pressure from lower oil prices. Riyadh hopes the entry of foreign institutions will help the Tadawul mature into a respected emerging market commensurate with its size. Its capitalisation is almost as large as that of the other five Gulf states combined. Compared with its regional peers, the Saudi market is well diversified, with 169 listed companies spanning 15 sectors. Average daily liquidity is more than $2.3bn, making it the seventh largest and fourth most liquid global emerging market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch research. With retail investors dominating trading volume, the regulator hopes overseas institutions will foster predictability and make the bourse more attractive for domestic companies to list and expand. Tougher regulations, including requiring listed firms to publish their annual reports in English, are also expected to assure foreign investors that they will enjoy a level playing field on a bourse known for its volatility. “Part of the problem is that there are some very large investors who can play markets and benefit from inside information,” said Nasser Saidi, an economist and corporate governance expert.', 'French firm Spinali Design has developed the world’s first internet-connected bikini that will prevent people from sunburns.\n\nFrance-based startup Spinali Design has presented a first ever bikini that will help its owners to avoid sunburns. The new swimsuit features a small detachable UV sensor that tells when you are close to getting a burn. The user then chooses whether apply more sun cream or leave the beach.\n\nThe idea to create a connected bikini came to the designer of the project after seeing lots of people being sunburnt at beaches.\n\n“The project came from an off-the-cuff remark after seeing people looking like lobsters still in the sun,” said Marie Spinali, head of Spinali Design in Mulhouse, France.\n\nSpinali established her business last month in Mulhouse where she lives, and trades the bikinis via her website.\n\n“There are flowerpots that give an alert when plants need watering, so I thought it was time to invent something to warn when the sun is too strong,” she commented.\n\nThis is how it works. At first, you must enter your skin type via an app on a mobile device and input how much tan you want to get. The senor then measures the air temperature and, based on your type of skin, calculates the period you’re allowed to be in from of the sun without getting burnt. The user is then informed when they need to take an action.\n\nThe sensor is waterproof what means you don’t have to take it off while going for a swim. The app is also available in a special “Valentines” version that sends an alert to a partner. The smart bikini is not cheap and is currently sold at $167.\n\nIf you are a male or simply not wear bikinis, there is an option: a connected beach towel. It includes the same removable UV sensor and is also waterproof. The towel is priced at $111.\n\nSpinali Design currently works on the development of the children’s version of the app that will alert parents if kids are gone too far from them.\n\nSimilar lifestyle products have been developed over the last few months. Thus, French firm Netatmo presented a bracelet that observes the users’ habits and measures sun exposure.\n\nLast year, a UK company released a wearable watch-like gadget Sunfriend that measures UV levels and warns the users about possible sunburn.The bikini or the towel can be acquired at the company’s online website, although it is available only in French.\n\nOn Friday, the president of France Francois Hollande announced the opening of a new design and manufacturing centre in Angers for the Internet of Things. The facility, entitled the City of Connected Objects, is expected to help companies produce and design smart devices.\n\nThe new hub is a part of the 200 million-euro “La French Tech” initiative launched by the government in 2013.\n\nAccording to research company International Data Corporation, the market for the Internet of Things, a technology for connecting appliances, including fridges and watches, is anticipated to reach $1.7 trillion by 2020.', 'Berkshire Hathaway & IBM Stock Price Forecasts\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC (BRK.A)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc (BRK.A) is involved in many diverse businesses including insurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy.

To learn more about the company, please visit its website at www.berkshirehathaway.com\n\n\n\nBRK.A was covered in February 2015 with the expectation of one final marginal high. This did not occur so let’s quickly revise things using the daily and monthly chart.\n\nBRK.A DAILY CHART\n\n\n\n\n\nI have drawn a horizontal line which denotes a previous double bottom. I thought this would lead to new highs but it wasn’t to be and price breaking down below this level is very bearish in my opinion.\n\n\n\nAlso, I have drawn a green highlighted circle which denotes the first bear rally high. The first rally in a new bear rally often makes a deep retracement and this was certainly the case here with the high being just below the 88.6% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\n\n\nSince then price has been forming a pattern of lower lows (LL) and lower highs (LH). Price is now in the process of making a new lower low so things really don’t look good for the bulls.\n\n\n\nI have added moving averages with time periods of 50 (blue), 100 (red) and 200 (black). We can see there are bearish crossovers that have already occurred with the big one, that is the red line crossing below the black line, looking imminent.\n\n\n\nThe lower indicators, being the RSI, Stochastic and MACD indicators, are all looking terrible from a bullish perspective.\n\n\n\nLet’s now look at the monthly chart to reacquaint ourselves of the target levels for the bear trend to end.\n\n\n\nBRK.A MONTHLY CHART\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stochastic and MACD indicators have both turned down and are looking bearish. And this is the monthly chart no less.\n\n\n\nThe Bollinger Bands show price is now at the middle band. Will support come in here? Maybe temporarily but I wouldn’t like to bet on it.\n\n\n\nWhere is the final pullback low likely to be?\n\n\n\nThere is no change to the outlook as shown in the February 2015 analysis. I have added Fibonacci retracement levels of the move up from March 2009 low to December 2014 high and I am targeting price to clip the 61.8% level which stands at $130911.\n\n\n\nAlso, I have drawn a horizontal line denoting the December 2007 high at $151650 and I expect price to dip a bit below as it gives this support level a thorough test.\n\n\n\nSumming up, I believe a big correction is now at hand.\n\n\n\nDisclosure – I have no financial interest in BRK.A.\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP (IBM)\n\n\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp (IBM) is an information technology company and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with a market capitalisation around $165billion. Price last traded at $166.99. To learn more about the company, please visit its website at www.ibm.com\n\n\n\nIBM was last analysed in February 2015 and now that it looks as if the bear rally is over let’s revise things using the weekly and monthly charts.\n\n\n\nIBM WEEKLY CHART\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green highlighted circle shows the existence of a gap which has now been closed or near enough. The high side of the gap stands at $178.69 and price recently topped out at $176.30. That should be it.\n\n\n\nWe can see price has been trending down within the upper channel of the Andrew’s Pitchfork. A pattern or lower lows and lower highs are evidence of this downtrend which I expect to accelerate shortly into the lower pitchfork channel. The recent lower high was right at resistance from the upper channel line. Nice.\n\n\n\nThe PSAR indicator has a bearish bias after price recently busted the dots on the downside.\n\n\n\nThe Stochastic indicator is trending down and looking bearish while the MACD indicator has just made a bearish crossover.\n\n\n\nIBM MONTHLY CHART\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent high was held by resistance given from the PSAR indicator denoted by the dots.\n\n\n\nThis recent high was also at resistance given from the middle Bollinger Band. I expect price to now move back down to the lower band.\n\n\n\nThe RSI has been trending down and recently made a new low which is bearish while the MACD indicator has also been trending down and looks be threatening a bearish crossover which should see new lows made soon enough.\n\n\n\nAs for where the final pullback low will be, I have added Fibonacci retracement levels of the move up from October 2002 low to March 2013 high and I am still targeting the 61.8% level at $115.85. Price may nudge a bit below this level.\n\n\n\nI have drawn a Fibonacci Fan and I am looking for the low to be around support from the 76.4% angle which looks set to occur just under the 61.8% retracement level in late 2016.\n\n\n\nFinally, I have drawn a horizontal line which denotes the July 1999 high at $139.19. This level may provide temporary support but I favour an even deeper correction.\n\n\n\nDisclosure – I have no financial interest in IBM.\n\nBy Austin Galt\n\nwww.thevoodooanalyst.com\n\nAustin Galt is The Voodoo Analyst.

06/15/2015,"['MovieTickets.com, one of the largest movie ticket purchasing platforms in the US, now enables movie-goers to buy movie tickets with bitcoin at 985 theaters.\n\nThe move was made possible through an integration with bitcoin payment processor GoCoin. As a result, theater chains that use the credit card processing services offered by MovieTickets.com will be able to accept bitcoin for any film offered.\n\nGoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard indicated that this includes Regal Cinemas, the nation\'s largest theater chain with more than 500 locations. Holdouts notably include AMC Theaters, which itself boasts more than 300 locations in North America.\n\nThe partnership is the latest betwen GoCoin and a movie industry firm, following the May announcement that it was in talks with production studio Lionsgate Films.\n\nBeauregard told CoinDesk:\n\n""We think that the future of digital content is being able to use digital currencies to purchase content.""\n\nThe promotion was inspired by the promotional strategy for Dope, the hit indie film that scored big at Sundance and earned high-profile celebrity fans from James Franco to Russell Simmons.\n\nMovieTickets.com CEO Joel Cohen suggested that, however, the company saw the potential in enabling the technology in more of its offerings.\n\n""Our intention is to keep the option available beyond the film’s theatrical run for other films to benefit from. The more payment options we offer, the broader our customer base becomes,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\n\'Dope\' promotion\n\nHailed for its progressive take on youth black culture, Dope centers on the exploits of modern high school students inspired by 1990s-era hip-hop. Notably, bitcoin plays a role in the film itself, as its protagonists use the digital currency to profit from the illicit sale of ecstasy online.\n\nAs for the decision to include bitcoin as part of the marketing for the film, this was accomplished through a partnership between US distributor Open Road Films, MovieTickets.com and GoCoin.\n\nIn statements, Cohen aimed to describe the company as open to innovative and unique partnerships that drive attention to moviemakers.\n\n""It’s cool, it’s original and we’re going above and beyond the common boundaries to drive ticket sales,"" Cohen said.\n\nDope is scheduled to be released in the US on 19th June.\n\nHat Tip to The Wrap\n\n3-D movie image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

They will never catch Visa in the payments markets, according to the latest global figures, and see a real threat on the horizon in Bitcoin. Why would they spend the last year attacking digital currency in videos, to the Australian Senate, and now in a 4-page written statement? Something wicked this way comes. Something far better, as well. It’s called “The Future of Money.”\n\nYou know what your problem is, Bitcoin?\n\nMastercard has been around a long time, since 1979 in its current form and is a global leader in payment services. To thwart this existential threat to their future thiefdom, Mastercard has crafted this response to Bitcoin and digital currencies, in general. This is after the United Kingdom released its “Digital currencies: Call for information” missive. Mastercard and Bitcoin are about as similar as tuna fish and peanut butter, but, feeling threatened, Mastercard couldn’t help but give its two cents on the matter. Here we’ll go over key excerpts of their argument against the generally unregulated nature of Bitcoin and digital currencies, in general. Plus, let’s provide a point-counterpoint analysis of their information or misinformation on Bitcoin as a whole.\n\n“Low transaction costs and faster processing are mentioned as providing particular advantages, as is the safety of the system. However, we would argue that, when compared to MasterCard’s network, the claims pertaining to the speed and safety of digital currencies does not hold up, not least given that on average it takes 10 minutes for a block to be verified and that digital currencies are far more susceptible to hacking attacks.”\n\nSpeed: Bitcoin transactions are confirmed within 10 minutes, and after six confirmations, after approximately one hour, transactions are 99.8% guaranteed to be valid. This means both sides have had their accounts reconciled within an hour, and all funds moved and verified valid and fully transferred. Using Mastercard is not nearly as fast, nor as easily completed.\n\nA Mastercard transaction is far more complicated, making many stops along the way to completion, illustrated by the image above. This process takes anywhere from 24 to 72 hours, depending on the location, amount and type of transaction. This factors in fraud prevention, managing counter-party risk, and paying and debiting debtors, payees, and taking a much larger cut of the action than a Bitcoin miner ever would. Last time I checked, a maximum of one hour is much faster than 1-3 days.\n\nSecurity: The only “hacking attacks” Bitcoin has suffered have occurred when third parties have gotten involved in transactions, such as exchanges that act like banks, and were foolishly given private keys by customers. Or “Pump-and-dump” start-up exchanges that were schemes to steal Bitcoins from the start. Bitcoin’s block chain has never been hacked in over six years, protecting billions of dollars. Mastercard, Visa, and other card providers have been hacked several times, costing tens of millions of user their identity information, which is never at risk in a Bitcoin transaction. Mastercard is so far off here, it smacks of a planned deception, counting on the general ignorance on the matter to prevail over the truth.\n\n“….there is no central authority sitting behind the system itself. Regardless of the perceived security of the decentralized system, if a digital currency system collapses then all funds are lost. In comparison, depositors in the UK are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to £85,000 per person per firm(£170,000 per joint account per firm).”\n\nAlso read: Why Bitcoin Regulation Will Never Help Consumers\n\nThe only way the system would collapse is if the Internet itself collapsed, since Bitcoin’s protocol is primarily web-based. In theory, as long as full nodes exist anywhere on earth, the network remains, be it through morse code, satellite transmissions, or writing hex diagrams on napkins. The value is a perception, based against fiat currencies for convenience if nothing else. Mastercard knows better than anyone funds aren’t gained or lost, but merely transferred, from one perception to another, famously said by Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, in “Wall Street”. If a Bitcoin owner has any reasonable amount of security, their Bitcoins are no more vulnerable than any amount of fiat currency on a debit card account. And that fiat currency is much more likely to “collapse” and actually lose value than a digital currency with a finite production schedule. There is nothing finite or inherently valuable about any fiat currency.\n\n“In order for any payment system to be viable long-term and compete with more established payment systems, it must be trusted by a critical mass of those who use it. In order for this to occur, it can be visioned that a set of standards needs to be created.”\n\nWho is currently using Bitcoin for transactions that do not trust the algorithms and math behind the technology? People are using it more than ever each year because the apps, merchants, and websites are more enabled to handle its technology. User trust has never been an issue; the technology being ahead of its time has been.\n\nAs for a “set of standards”, who should set those? Bankers who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo in their favor? Or the trusted politicians, who are beholden to the bankers? Bitcoin is not a political football, but an economic alternative to inherently flawed and corrupt financial systems populating worldwide. It provides innovations and competition in industries like payments systems that desperately need new and better options for consumers. Why would Mastercard want more competition or innovation? Life was much easier when they had to just worry about being second-rate to Visa.\n\n“Separate but no less significant are the digital currency payment system risks associated with Anti-Money Laundering (‘AML’). AML concerns emanate from the anonymity that digital currencies provide to each party in a transaction…..As we have learned from the Mt. Gox situation the existence of a ‘block chain’ does little to enable law enforcement, other government authorities or the public to identify the real identity of the parties to a digital currency transaction and therefore seek redress.”\n\nSo-called money laundering practices are as old as the hills and are propagated through U.S. Dollars more than any other currency in the history of mankind. “Regulated” U.S. banks have been among the largest money launderers in history, which we will get to later on. Same goes for crime in general being the domain of fiat currencies worldwide, with the U.S. Dollar being the main conduit to criminality. No legislation has stopped crime or money laundering, and centralizing control over a decentralized network only strengthens banks and those beholden to them. If you hate privacy, fear conjured up “Boogie Men” who have never stolen from the common man like central banking has, and want all transactions run through less-than-trustworthy economic elitist looking to control the world, this is a valid argument.\n\nThe fall of Mt. Gox had nothing to do with Bitcoin’s block chain. It is widely understood that Mark Karpeles and associates removed the block chain from their security of user’s funds, and Mastercard knows this. Anyone who has spent five minutes looking into Mt. Gox knows this was not a Bitcoin block chain issue. Again, this is bordering on outright deception on their part. Pretty shameful and desperate.\n\nAnd finally, Mastercard’s solution to all of these major economic problems Bitcoin is heaping upon the global landscape, or just upon the declining interest in Mastercard (I’m having trouble telling them apart)……\n\n“A requirement that all transactions go through regulated and transparent administrators subject to supervision by the relevant domestic, European or global authority, rather than just the current block chain process.”\n\nFeel free to laugh out loud. I know I did.\n\nOne, regulators in government and transparency are never destined to meet. President Obama said his administration would be “the most transparent in history”. How did that turn out? If the President can’t be even remotely transparent to the people he governs, why would any economic regulator ever be trusted, or held to a higher standard? When Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were screwing over the nation’s homeowners, what did regulators do about it? When Wall Street tried to crash the U.S. economy out of pure greed, regulators did nothing. Not one banker went to jail. AIG, Goldman Sachs, LIBOR, Comex, and the Futures markets all rigged from the inside by bankers. HSBC was found guilty of $881 BILLION in money laundering, over 19,000 counts of assisting the Sinaloa drug cartel, illegally, for many years. Who went to jail for that? How was that “regulated”? Who bailed them all out and said “Better luck next time”? And notice how they snuck in “global authority”. What “global authority” are they referring to?\n\nI’ve been in the belly of the banking beast, so I know how sorted and leveraged this game is for the established players, and how against the common man it is. I’ve seen how deep this rabbit hole goes. Sometimes, I wish I had taken the Blue Pill, but at least I am not ignorant about how the world really turns. Money makes the word go ’round, and Mastercard holds many of the best cards, literally for themselves. They like the “Gravy Train” to run just as it has been for the last 35 years, but there are only a few problems with that.\n\nNew technologies. Innovation. A smarter public. A better mousetrap has been invented, and Mastercard can’t handle it, but they know people who might. Those of us who walk a path to decentralized economic freedom aren’t going back to centralized banking control. Like going back to Shawshank. Bitcoin is not here to replace Mastercard or Visa. It’s here to make them obsolete. Faster and more secure peer-to-peer global payments systems, with no easily corruptible centralized authority, identity theft, or massive transaction fees to worry about.\n\nFor everything else, there’s Mastercard.\n\nImage provided by Unibul Merchant Services and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nCan Mastercard scare U.K. regulators into an attack on Bitcoin, even after Chancellor Osborne has come out publicly in favor of Bitcoin? Share above and comment below.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The world’s two largest economies; two of the three most populated countries on earth; much more importantly: the world’s two largest Bitcoin mining communities locking horns in a struggle for power and control over the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe Far East versus the West; the United States versus China: a classic battle of global superpowers that may not have a winner, but may take the world’s first global currency down in the digital crossfire.\n\nPossible implosion\n\nThe issue of Bitcoin block size is coming to a head within a matter of days. Could a battle over block size between Western businesses and Eastern miners leave Bitcoin in danger of self-destruction?\n\nMike Hearn, a Bitcoin core developer, says it is highly unlikely, but yes, it is possible. Speaking to Epicenter Bitcoin in episode #82 recently, Hearn laid out the potential scenario for an implosion of Bitcoin, however unlikely.\n\nThe issue lies in the need for block size maintenance to prevent a logjam of transactions within the next year. Bitcoin blockchains can currently only handle seven transactions per second, and at current transaction rates, this will exceed the current 1 MB block size sometime next year. A raise to 20 MB has been proposed by core developers Hearn and Gavin Andresen.\n\nThe problem with the tentative plan of expansion is the overall effect on the mining industry, particularly in China, where reportedly 80% of all global Bitcoin trading volume takes place. Margins are thin after a year of price correction since the Mt. Gox collapse, and the vast majority of major Chinese miners and exchanges are in opposition to a massive increase in block size. The 20-times larger blocks would go from almost full to mostly vacant, causing some short-term issues for miners. Hearn explained:\n\n“The worst-case scenario is the economic majority is in favor, but the hash-power mining majority is not. That would be a very messy situation for Bitcoin. If the needs of the wider majority diverge from what the miners in China want, who wins? In a worst-case scenario, if the miners and the rest of the Bitcoin community end up in some full-fledged war that would wreck Bitcoin.”\n\n-- Go to 57:40 in the video.\n\nWorst-case scenario\n\nBitcoin miners in China have relatively poor Internet access compared to the U.S., so Western miners and businesses may require more block space than China to run transactional operations. The bulk of Bitcoin businesses reside in the West, and the bulk of bitcoin miners are in China, creating a War-of-the-Worlds scenario.\n\nThis could generate a “fork” in the blockchain, with the 20 MB blocks starting a new chain. Businesses would have to be convinced to follow it and get off the original blockchain that has been in service since 2009. The original blockchain might remain at 1 MB indefinitely.\n\nTheoretically, the strength behind both chains would leave a fracture within Bitcoin that may never be repaired. With both chains agreeing to disagree, this may cause irreparable long-term damage to the demand and value of the entire protocol. Again, this is a worst-case scenario, but still possible.\n\nHearn also states in the interview that a Bitcoin XT update with miner voting rights will be sent out this week. It will allow miners to vote for or against the 20 MB block size increase. Hearn believes a majority of miners and users are in favor, according to his preliminary estimates and discussions with principles, but the voting outcome will confirm the facts. If a clear majority shows for the block increase, he said, it will begin to propagate shortly after that.\n\nHearn worked for seven years managing network capacity for Google, before becoming a core developer for Bitcoin, so he has ample experience in this field at the highest level. He mentions speaking to Satoshi Nakamoto about the 1 MB block limit early on in Bitcoin’s development, and says that Nakamoto believed the 1 MB block size was only needed temporarily, not as a long-term governor.\n\nGiven the seasonal influxes of bitcoin transactions during the winter, Bitcoin will be essentially at the maximum network capacity early next year, according to Hearn. At that point, transactions may take hours instead of minutes, and resending of duplicate transactions may exacerbate the logjam effect, if not planned for in advance.\n\nIncrease, but by how much?\n\nGenesis Mining — with mining farms in Europe, Asia and the U.S. and headquarters in Hong Kong — conducted a poll of their miners on the 20 MB block size issue earlier this month. They found an overwhelming majority, 87%, agreed with the proposed 20 MB block size increase.\n\nAccording to Genesis, the disadvantage of bigger blocks is that they will destroy the market for transaction fees. If block space is not scarce, a market for transaction fees will not be established. Thus, the block reward might dwindle in the long run.\n\nAlso, requirements for full nodes will increase, requiring bigger blocks with much more bandwidth, making it harder to run a full node so some short-term issues would be expected.\n\n-- Image provided by Genesis Mining\n\nIncreasing the block size will increase capacity that is currently too low to support a global payment network. Current transaction amounts are not sufficient to support a massive global payment network. Transaction fees would become more expensive, catering only to larger settlements between large, centralized market players.\n\nGreater block size will also increase the total transaction fees. Allowing many transactions in one block will increase the total amount of fees, which will be a benefit for miners in the long run.\n\nMy only question is not the need for a block size increase, but the amount of the increase. Bitcoin has shown steady growth in the number of transactions worldwide, so something has to be done to give it the capacity that it needs to grow.\n\nHow was 20 MB decided upon? And is it too much, too soon? Can the same be accomplished with an increase of 8 MB? A 20-fold increase is massive, and, in theory, I can understand the consternation amongst some miners. There is a price for progress, but both sides should work together on a resolution. There has to be a middle ground between the status quo and a 20-fold size increase.\n\nWho is on the right side of history in this battle among national factions? Share above and comment below.', 'UPDATE (16th June 16:00 BST): Following the publication of this article, a spokesperson for the New York State Department of Financial Services told CoinDesk ""miners and mining pools are exempt from the BitLicense"".\n\nBTC Guild is set to close at the end of June, months after previously announcing that it would shut down its long-running bitcoin mining pool.\n\nIn its announcement, posted to Bitcoin Talk, owner Eleuthria cited the finalization of the BitLicense as a primary motivator for shutting down, stating that BTC Guild could not afford any legal threats that may arise as a result of the New York regulatory framework.\n\nThe pool announced last October that it was considering closure in the face of falling revenue and rising risks for both users and the pool itself. BTC Guild first floated the idea in July 2014, citing the then-incomplete BitLicense at the time.\n\nEleuthria noted that whether BTC Guild is based in New York ""does not matter"" and suggested that the pool could face significant legal liability regardless of its location because ""the final regulations have enough gray area that BTC Guild is at risk"".\n\nThe post explained:\n\n""This fact makes it possible for New York to attempt to claim jurisdiction to enforce regulations. Whether or not BTC Guild could win in defense of such an attempt is irrelevant, since the cost of defending the pool would be greater than any income the pool is expected to generate going forward.""\n\nBTC Guild will cease operating after 30th June, with withdrawals available until 30th September.\n\nThe mining pool – a collective of miners who share their hashing power to compete for blocks as a group – has reduced its minimum withdrawal amount to 0.0001 BTC, with no transaction fees required to remove money from the platform.\n\nBitLicense, fraud risk blamed\n\nIn addition to the BitLicense finalization, the gradual decline in size of the pool relative to its costs and liabilities was cited as a factor in the closure decision.\n\nEleuthria wrote:\n\n""As mining has become more centralized, BTC Guild has continuously shrunk in proportion to the network, now being less than 3% of the network hash rate. The costs of running the pool have not changed, and the amount of funds at risk in the event of a compromise is significantly higher than what the pool could ever recover from.""\n\nThe announcement pointed to the growing risk of fraud BTC Guild allegedly faces, with Eleuthria stating that ""I have been growing concerned for some time now about attempts to defraud pools.""\n\n""When the pool was 20-30% of the network, the amount of funds at risk was slightly higher, but the ability for the pool to recover from that loss was present,"" Eleuthria wrote. ""At 3% of the network, the pool would not be able to recover from such a loss.""\n\nSale cancelled\n\nIn its last announcement, BTC Guild floated the possibility of a sale in order to continue operating. According to the latest post, any idea of a sale was abandoned due to the perceived risk of fraud, as well as ""personal attachment"" to the pool on the part of its staff.\n\n""The risk of users being cheated or stolen from as a result of transferring pool ownership is not something I am willing to accept,"" Eleuthria wrote, reiterating that the decision to shut down is in part an effort to protect users from fraud.\n\nEleuthria went on to thank the community for its support of BTC Guild, which began operating in 2011, writing:\n\n""Thank you to all the users and the Bitcoin community for making BTC Guild a success for the last four years. It has been hard to finally make this call a second time with the determination to not reverse the decision.""\n\nClosed shop sign image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""Australian Bitcoin payment company Living Room of Satoshi announced that its new “Pay Anyone” service allows Australians to pay bitcoin directly to any bank account.\n\n“Bitcoin users can now pay their friends, tradesmen and anyone else; even if the recipient has no knowledge about bitcoin,” says Living Room of Satoshi CEO Daniel Alexiuc. “This is a vital piece of payment infrastructure that is now available to all Australians.”\n\nLiving Room of Satoshi is a payments company that enables payment of any bill that uses the BPAY system using bitcoin. Customers can spend bitcoin to pay phone bills, electricity bills, school fees, credit cards, tax payments and more. Founded in 2014, the company has processed more than $500,000 of Australian bills using bitcoin.\n\nBPAY is an electronic bill payment system in Australia which enables payments to be made through a financial institution's online, mobile or telephone banking facility to organizations which are registered BPAY billers. BPAY is a registered trading name of BPAY Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardlink Services Limited. Cardlink is owned equally by the four major Australian banks: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Limited and Westpac Banking Corporation.\n\n“Today BPAY offers fast, secure and convenient bill payments through over 150 Australian financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, covering over 95 percent of the consumer banking market,” states the BPAY website. “That means most Australians can now enjoy the convenience of paying their bills with BPAY. And with BPAY offered on over 44,000 bills (via 22,000 billers and more than 22,000 Sub Billers), these businesses cover a spectrum of industries with over 354 industry (ANZSIC) codes represented in the BPAY biller file. We now accept more payments than ever. In fact, each month we help process more than 30 million bills worth more than $24 billion – with around 92 percent of these paid through a customer’s online or mobile bank.”\n\n“All of our customers find Bitcoin a fast, secure and convenient way to pay bills,” said Alexiuc in a recent interview published on the Australian edition of CIO Magazine. “You can see from our graphs page that our customers are paying all sorts of everyday bills, from toll road charges to tax bills. Many use Living Room of Satoshi to pay off their credit cards with Bitcoin, which opens up an even greater range of places to spend bitcoin.”\n\nHe added that, in Australia, by far the biggest impediment to the adoption of Bitcoin is the recent GST (Goods and Service Tax) ruling. According to Alexiuc, Bitcoin is a nascent and unprecedented technology that regulators are still struggling to comprehend, and therefore the software developers in Australia need to continue to innovate and demonstrate the utility of bitcoin, which will in turn shape regulation. It needs to be easy for businesses to transact completely in bitcoin – to sell products in bitcoin, pay their staff in bitcoin and purchase supplies in bitcoin."", 'MonetaGo, a new exchange with ambitions to take bitcoin ""global"", launched across 40 countries today.\n\nFirst announced in April, the platform offers bitcoin buying and selling in 28 local currencies. As a twist, MonetaGo users can also \'fix\' or \'peg\' their bitcoin to these various exchange rates.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, serial entrepreneur Jesse Chenard, MonetaGo\'s CEO, said:\n\n""Digital currency is supposed to be this global phenomenon that is going to enable the seamless transmission of funds across borders, but the reality of it is that 90-something percent of all bitcoin trading happens in three currencies only.""\n\nIn extending services to underserved markets outside the dollar, yuan and euro, Chenard and his co-founders hope to make bitcoin more accessible and cost effective for new users.\n\nOn the surface, MonetaGo\'s interface is little different to other exchanges out there. However, under the bonnet the platform – built using Alphapoint technology – has access to 35 order books from a network of regional partner exchanges, via their API.\n\nChenard said the platform aims to reach 50 partners by the end of 2015.\n\nFixed value\n\nMuch like Bitreserve, MonetaGo offers users the ability to \'fix\' their bitcoin value to any of its 27 regional currencies. However, whereas the former does not offer the option to cash out \'Bitdollars\' into real dollars (only bitcoin), MonetaGo does.\n\nThe ability to send this fixed-value bitcoin to other users, who can then convert it into other currencies, could be beneficial to businesses, not just consumers, Chenard said.\n\nBesides shielding both parties from bitcoin\'s volatility, the process could speed up payments for companies who lack a fast and reliable corresponding banking network between them.\n\n""You have a balance of $12 and you wind up having to spend another $45 to get them their $18.""\n\nChenard says he is ""still rationalising"" how people will use this \'send\' functionality. For now, the focus is on getting MonetaGo\'s banking relationships watertight, to ensure fiat on- and off-ramps are smooth.\n\nIn terms of fees, the platform will be free of charge for the first few weeks, later charging between 0.1% and 0.5% per trade, dependent on each user\'s monthly volume.\n\n""If you\'re converting twice [by using the \'send\' function] we\'re looking at ways to halve that fee as we\'re double charging at that point,"" the CEO said.\n\nCompliance\n\nMonetaGo is privately funded by a handful of investors, including Chenard, who says the exchange is likely to raise a round ""fairly shortly"".\n\nAlongside Chenard, whose company Tremor Video went public in 2013, MonetaGo\'s founding team includes Chenard\'s ""serial co-founder"" CMO Tad Davis, ex-Alphapoint CEO Margaux Avedisian and Igot\'s Patrick Manasse.\n\nSince its beginnings in October 2014, MonetaGo\'s team has been laser-focused on compliance. The New York company is in the process of completing the paperwork for its BitLicense, but has spent the last six months in talks with regulators and banks across the globe.\n\nFrom these conversations, Chenard described a ""shaking out phase"" for bitcoin. Though some states, like New York, have made demands, others remain tight-lipped on the subject of bitcoin. This may soon change:\n\n""I feel this year there is going to be a lot of clarity brought to how we are supposed to operate and what standards we are supposed to meet.""\n\nWorld image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Michaela Juric is an Australian female Bitcoin enthusiast who most people know better as the “Bitcoin Babe.” She uses her beauty through photography to spread awareness about cryptocurrency. She has also been a Bitcoin trader since July 2014.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to Bitcoin Babe about her achievements, dreams and her views on women in the Bitcoin community.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Where does your story with Bitcoin begin?\n\nBitcoin Babe: I first heard about Bitcoin when a report came up on a mainstream news program here in Australia, talking about the Silk Road. I\'ve always been a savvy technology girl ever since I was a kid, so I was curious as to how I missed a whole new world going on on the internet. I started doing some reading and research, and sure enough that is where I found Bitcoin. I became more fascinated with the concept of digital currency and so I bought my first four bitcoins for $50 each back in July 2013.\n\n“It\'s all fine and well to call yourself the Bitcoin Babe, but anyone could hold that title. […] I could be a greased up fat man in his parents’ basement just pretending to be a girl.”\n\nCT: How did you come up with the name Bitcoin Babe and why?\n\nBB: I was checking out the competition and noticed the Australian trading market was very well established, so I really needed something to set me apart from the others, made me stand out, and of course made Bitcoin users want to utilize my services instead of their regular trader. So what better way to check all those boxes than to use ""Bitcoin Babe"". As for the name itself, “Bitcoin Babe” just has a good ring to it. Alliteration is catchy.\n\nCT: When did it occur to you that you want Bitcoin Babe to be a brand and how has the journey been so far?\n\nBB: I started trading as ""Bitcoin Babe"" in July 2014. However, it wasn\'t until September that I really started to step it up with brand awareness. It\'s all fine and well to call yourself the Bitcoin Babe, but anyone could hold that title. As a customer pointed out to me, I could be a greased up fat man in his parents’ basement just pretending to be a girl.\n\nI don’t know about anyone else, but being accused of being a “greased up fat man” is a very confronting situation to be in. I had to check in the mirror a few times to make sure that I wasn’t. So in August, I took that accusation to my photographer/friend and told him to “make me Bitcoin Babe.""\n\nFrom that point, not only was a brand born, but it rippled throughout my business; it’s almost like a different persona. It’s a bubbly fun loving attitude with a cheeky demeanor and a “BB xoxo” at the end.\n\n“[B]y being Bitcoin Babe, I am […] taking the cliché of what these people say, owning it and making it my own, and then throwing it back in their faces.”\n\nCT: Many have said that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space, in general, is male dominated. What do you say to this narrative?\n\nBB: A woman asks a man to get the butter out of the fridge. He opens the fridge door and has a look, yet cannot find the butter. He closes the door and tells the woman they have no butter left. The woman then goes to the fridge, opens the door, slides the carton of milk on the shelf to the left, and there sits the butter.\n\nMoral of the story, Men just aren\'t generally aware of what is around because they can\'t be bothered to look. They take everything for face value. It has been widespread amongst internet culture in general, that if a woman comes into a chat room and announces herself as such, she would be deemed an ""attention seeker"" or told to provide naked photos or leave. Why should a female be subject to such brutish behavior? There are far more females in the community than what men are led to believe. They just choose not to expose themselves as such in order to be taken seriously in the community.\n\nObviously, by being Bitcoin Babe, I am really playing into that behavior so that it some could see it as ""trolling"" of sorts. Taking the cliché of what these people say, owning it and making it my own, and then throwing it back in their faces.\n\nCT: Is it correct to say you are on a mission to give Bitcoin not only the female but also a sexy touch?\n\nBB: Absolutely. As I mentioned earlier, it\'s all about that ""Bitcoin Babe"" persona that is used to separate me from my competitors. And if my return customer rate is anything to go by, I would say it is working well!\n\nCT: You are also a professional trader. What has your experience been in that?\n\nBB: It\'s funny that it surprises people to know that I\'m not just a pretty face! My expertise is more in the focus of arbitrage trading – which, of course, is a needed skill when it comes to trading on LocalBitcoins. I was even lucky enough to do a 2-month internship in America with Bitcoin ATM Company, CoinOutlet, which was an amazing experience. The CEO, Eric Grill, has been wonderful in taking me under his wing. He has been my mentor of sorts and has really helped me open my eyes to a lot of things.\n\n“There is an extreme double standard when it comes to bitcoin here in Australia.”\n\nCT: Taking the current regulation and anticipated changes, do you think Australia will be that country where cryptocurrency enterprises will feel at home?\n\nBB: It\'s hard to say. There is an extreme double standard when it comes to bitcoin here in Australia. I read a lot of articles talking about how the banks are working to embrace cryptocurrency technologies, and yet as a bitcoin trader, who is trying to run a legitimate business, a lot of us struggle to keep a bank account open as we face being bullied, turned away and treated unfairly because of what we do by these banks.\n\nWe also have our unruly tax laws that tell us 10% of every sale made must go back to the government as part of the GST. The ruling was made in October, and was supposed to be reviewed (and potentially overturned) back in March. However things have been pushed out so far it’s hard to say what is going on at all. This has forced a lot of Australian based Bitcoin Businesses to either relocate overseas or shut their doors.\n\nA local business struggles to compete with overseas based business especially when the local one has to work with 10% extra in their margin. There has been a lot of talk about ""Support"" for bitcoin here in Australia, but it would be great if someone could step up and actually start to show it.\n\nCT: Would you say Bitcoin and cryptocurrency need more beautiful faces like yours to give it a balanced gender image?\n\nBB: Haha! There are already a lot of beautiful faces like mine out there. They just need to stand up, speak out and show it. Get involved, and own who you are.\n\n“A lot of people don\'t associate Bitcoin with ‘hot girl’ so it certainly swirls up a fair amount of curiosity.”\n\nCT: You are a photo model and often have Bitcoin themed photos of you taken. How do you think this has helped in spreading the word about Bitcoin?\n\nBB: I can say it certainly made people take notice. I get messages often from people who see the photos on social media and want to know more about bitcoin. A lot of people don\'t associate Bitcoin with ""hot girl"" so it certainly swirls up a fair amount of curiosity. I should clarify that’s curiosity about bitcoin, not sexuality!\n\nCT: What do you prefer comes first in the minds of the members of the Bitcoin community when they hear the name ""Bitcoin Babe""?\n\nBB: Well I would like to hope it’s nice things! Bitcoin Babe is always going to be one of those things that push the barriers of social acceptance within the Bitcoin community. Some people will love what I do and find it sexy, smart and attractive. Others will find it derogatory, demeaning and dangerous.\n\nRegardless of people\'s views on me and my business image, what I’m doing has certainly been a good ice breaker for the discussion of “women in bitcoin” and I’m glad I could have provided that.', 'Switzerland\'s bitcoin community has spoken out following confirmation that bitcoin is exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in the country.\n\nBitcoin had always been exempt from VAT in the country, Luzius Meisser, president at Bitcoin Association Switzerland, told CoinDesk, adding that the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (FTA) had clarified the situation following a formal question submitted by his group in February last year.\n\nWhen asked about the implications for bitcoin business in Switzerland, Meisser said:\n\n""This has direct implications for all bitcoin companies with Swiss customers. They now know for sure that they do not need to charge VAT. However, it does not affect transactions of Swiss companies with foreign customers. In that case, VAT might still apply as the service is exported.""\n\nErik Voorhees, founder at Switzerland-based cryptocurrency company ShapeShift, also welcomed the news and praised the country\'s ""measured and reasonable stance on bitcoin"".\n\nHe said: ""This is helpful to our business as prices can be more competitive – ultimately the avoidance of any tax is good for individuals and business and makes the market more productive as less capital is extracted from it.""\n\nThe digital currency\'s exemption from VAT was also praised by people outside the bitcoin space. Jean-Christophe Schwaab, a Swiss Socialist politician told CoinDesk:\n\n""I think that exempting bitcoin is a good decision that could help the rising of bitcoin in my country. To pay VAT on a payment method is quite absurd!""\n\nBitcoin taxation in Europe\n\nThe clarification for Swiss bitcoin companies follows their Spanish counterparts\' celebration in April, after the Ministerio de Hacienda – the Tax Office – clarified that bitcoin was exempt from VAT following a question submitted by a digital currency enthusiast.\n\nMeanwhile, an oral hearing to discuss bitcoin\'s VAT exemption is due to take place at the European Courts of Justice in Luxembourg on Wednesday. The session has been organised to address Sweden\'s question of whether bitcoin exchanges would be liable to pay tax on the fees that are charged to their users.\n\nThe Swedish case is known as C-264/14 Skatteverket v David Hedqvist.\n\nSwiss flags image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It looks like it’s consolidating below that ~US$231 level and has been mentioned before the 50 day estimated moving average, which is now ~US$233. The US$220 mark is now providing support. If this doesn’t hold, then the big support area of ~US$210 better.”\n\nThe US$220 held but price continues to consolidate below the 50-day EMA, it made a dash for US$235 but has rejected it and now sits below the 50 day which is at ~US$233.\n\nLong Term\n\nThe 1-year (long term) chart for bitcoin has been and remains bearish. The price remains below all three of its EMAs. All three EMAs are tight, particularly the 50 (US ~$233) & 100 (~US$244) days as they continue to compress. The Bollinger Bands are tightening again as price remains right below the 50 day EMA. It looks as though volatility may start picking up soon.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) appears to have topped out yet again at that 54 level now putting it what looks like a quintuple top. The MACD (moving average convergence divergence) continues to be listless around the zero line. MACD is not signaling a change to the long term trend, as price remains below the 50 day EMA.\n\nOn Balance Volume (OBV) has been flat for months and isn’t showing an imminent change of trend as price continues to be in a low volatility and low volume environment. Volume should come in before the next big price move as volume generally precedes price.\n\nA positive step that would show the beginning of a trend change would be for price to get and STAY above the 50 day EMA for more than a few days.\n\nIchimoku Clouds\n\nThe 1-year Ichimoku (cloud chart) broke out of the cloud below and remains there. Its rejecting entering the cloud at the ~US$233 mark, which is now providing big resistance (the lower bound of the cloud) as its the same level as the 50 day EMA, confirming this area as very important for any hopes of a trend reversal\n\nThe cloud ahead continues to be bearish after it crossed over last week. It has flattened out however, and is very compressed. This is causing pressure on the price.\n\nThe Tankan Sen (Conversion Line) and the Kijun Sen (Base Line) remains below the lower cloud. This continues to be bearish for price.\n\nFor further definitions of what is being discussed, please refer to this previous post on Ichimoku cloud charts.\n\nIntermediate-Term Trend\n\nThe bitcoin price has reclaimed the ~US230 area from which it broke down last week. Fibonacci retracements have been drawn from 2 price tops: the mid-November high of ~ US$424 and the mid March high of ~ US$298.\n\nSince price reclaimed its support area ~ US$230, it hasn’t been able to get above >5 Fib resistance of ~US$233, which coincides with the 50 day EMA. If price should break below the ~230 area, look for support at ~ US$220. This ~US$219-220 has held so far, but looks poised to be tested again. I still expect a test of major support in the US US$200-210 area. If this doesn’t hold, then price will probably test the lows made in early January.\n\nThe RSI shows that quintuple top and continues to stall with every attempt to get above the 50 day EMA. The Money Flow Index has rebounded from oversold territory but looks to be headed into a resistance area.\n\nIncluded is the Directional Movement Index (DMI), which looks at buying and selling pressures. The blue line indicates buying pressure, the red line indicates selling pressure, and the orange line is the ADX, which indicates the strength or weakness of a trend.\n\nSelling Pressure has fallen since last week, while Buying Pressure has risen. It’s still in a bearish place, though with Selling Pressure above Buying Pressure. The ADX line remains above both the Buying Pressure Line and the Selling Pressure Line but at lower levels then last week. It’s still on a sell signal.\n\nThe Bollinger Bands remain tight and a resolution has yet to come although this has been a condition for a while now. It’s still in wait and see mode.\n\nShort-Term Trend\n\nLooking at the short-term trend (May 24 price high of ~US$240) using Fibonacci retracements, the price tried to get above ~US$233 but couldn’t, hitting the US$235 mark and coming back down. All of the short term indicators appear to be peaking out. The first lines of support are ~US$231, US$228 and US$225. Price continues having trouble getting higher.\n\nStill Fighting\n\nBitcoin’s primary downtrend remains intact and the price has hung in this range for a long time without any resolution. The slow range-bound trading continues without resolution. The price continues to make lower highs though and is heavily entrenched under the 50-day EMA as well as the bottom of the Ichimoku cloud.\n\nA break down in price is still anticipated as long as these conditions continue.\n\nDisclaimer: Articles regarding the potential movement in cryptocurrency prices are not to be treated as trading advice.

06/16/2015,"['LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin surged by as much as 7 percent on Tuesday and was on track for its longest winning streak in 18 months, as concerns that Greece could tumble out of the euro drove speculators and Greek depositors into the decentralized digital currency.\n\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras lashed out at Greece’s creditors on Tuesday as he defied a string of warnings that Europe is preparing for a “Grexit”. The debt-stricken country faces 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in repayments to the International Monetary Fund by the end of June.\n\nBitcoin, a web-based “cryptocurrency” invented six years ago, is not backed by or controlled by any government or central bank and floats freely, fluctuating according to user demand.\n\nThough bitcoin’s value has previously been highly volatile, it has stabilized over the past six months and is increasingly treated as a legitimate and potentially valuable asset by major financial institutions, and even by governments such as Britain‘s.\n\nJoshua Scigala, co-founder of Vaultoro.com, a firm that holds bitcoin for its customers and allows them to exchange it for gold and vice versa, said that Greeks were buying the currency as their trust in the authorities waned. It is also unclear what currency would be used if a Grexit does occur -- another potential factor driving Greek demand for bitcoin.\n\n“Some people aren’t waiting for the government to figure out an exit plan and are doing it for themselves,” said Scigala.\n\n“You have people worrying about their families’ wealth or their life savings, and worrying that their money might be locked up in banks ... They’d rather hold money in a private asset like gold or bitcoin.”\n\nScigala said over the past two months, with Greece locked in talks with its creditors, the company had seen a 124 percent pick-up in inflows from Greek IP addresses - numerical labels that identify computers and other internet-enabled devices.\n\nBitcoin traded as high as $252.05 on the Bitstamp exchange on Tuesday, its strongest in over two months, before easing a little to $245.21, still up around 4 percent on the day. That marked its sixth straight session of gains -- its best run since January 2014.\n\nIn March-April 2013 bitcoin’s value shot up by almost 700 percent in just over a month, as Cyprus clamped down on withdrawals and seized deposits, rattling faith in fiat currencies.\n\nPaul Gordon, founder of bitcoin firm Quantave and a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association, said that although he did not share the view that worries about Cyprus had driven that rally, Grexit fears could be driving the current one, with more people now aware of bitcoin.\n\n“This time round, the worries about Greece could be filtering through. (Bitcoin) could provide an alternative outlet for some people who are concerned about capital controls, along with more traditional methods.”\n\nSome have suggested that a bitcoin-like digital currency, backed either by Greece’s assets or future tax revenues, could be introduced as an parallel currency to the euro in Greece in order to avert an exit from Europe.($1 = 0.8881 Euros)', 'No matter how much money Dope makes when it opens on Friday, June 19, it will already make its way into the history books as the first film to accept Bitcoin as payment for tickets. Open Road Films, MovieTickets.com, and GoCoin have all made a pact to work together to make the digital currency a viable option for going to the movies.\n\n“MovieTickets.com thrives on these types of opportunities,” Joel Cohen, MovieTickets.com CEO said. “It’s cool, it’s original and we’re going above and beyond the common boundaries to drive ticket sales.”\n\nThis isn’t just a clever way to make a film about tech-savvy kids more accessible to actual tech savvy kids, but also a kind of synergy that fits in with Bitcoin’s presence in the film itself. While main character Malcolm (played by fresh face Shameik Moore) might look like a ’90s throwback, he’s also a modern geek with a handle on all manner of app conveniences including Bitcoin which he and his pals contemplate using when forced into selling drugs after attending an ill-fated party.\n\nAccording to Alex Winter — the director of Deep Web, a film about how Silk Road was used to launder drug money by people like Charlie Shrem who helped form the Bitcoin Foundation before getting locked up — the concept is on-point.\n\n“The movie itself is using Bitcoin for drugs,” Winter said. “That’s actually pretty accurate. There would have been no Bitcoin without the Silk Road. These disruptive technologies often come into the mainstream via contraband or criminality.”\n\nThe movie comes from writer-director Rick Famuyiwa whose credits include The Wood and Our Family Wedding. Moore is joined on screen by Zoë Kravitz and Forest Whitaker who produced the film alongside Sean Combs and Pharrell Williams. As an added bonus Pharrell also lent his considerable musical talents to the film’s soundtrack which includes four new tracks by the “Happy” performer.', ""Bitcoin relies on the Blockchain being shared across a collection of nodes, which make up the decentralized network. Unlike conventional banking systems there is no central place where this ledger is stored. Bitcoin cannot exist without functioning nodes.\n\nBitcoin wallets and the miners that secure the network make up the majority of nodes, but some nodes are more important than others. There are concerns regarding the number of full nodes that host a full copy of the full 35 gigabyte Blockchain.\n\nA full node is defined as a network-attached bitcoin client application, such as the original bitcoin Core (QT) client or an implementation of the bitcoind framework. A full node has the entire, up-to-date set of blockchain files, and also has port 8333 open, so it is set to listen for incoming requests. This list is very specific, and all of these conditions must be met for it to be a useful full node.\n\nThe cause of declining full node numbers is well known. Users are discouraged by the 35 Gigabyte download, required to run a full node wallet app. The fear that the decline itself will render the Bitcoin network defenseless against attackers is the subject of much debate on boards like Reddit, and the Bitcointalk forum.\n\nA common mistake, that many bitcoin node owners make, results in many nodes that actually hinder the network more than help it. This mistake is not making port 8333 accessible for incoming requests, which mainly happens because they don't know that their firewall is blocking that port.\n\nWhen this port is blocked the node can only make a maximum of 8 connections to other nodes at a time. Correcting this one mistake across the network could double or triple the number of full nodes. Some developers feel we already could have an excess of nodes, because a change in the software or general user education would make such a big difference.\n\nHead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen took that critique even further last summer on Reddit.\n\n- Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin Head Developer\n\nWe recently investigated the number of bitcoin miners, and found the number to be over 100,000 strong. Bitnodes, a website that tracks the number of full nodes in real time, reports that there are between 5,000 and 6,000 full nodes online at any time of the day. Considering the growth of the bitcoin network, and transactions, BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp created Statoshi to investigate in this number is high enough.\n\nHis initial fears were that we are seeing too many “thin” wallets, sometimes called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallet clients, that don't have a full copy of the blockchain nor an open listening port. Through a lot of data analysis, and chart wizardry, Lopp eventually came to the conclusion that, “the current number of nodes is greatly in excess of what is needed in order to meet current demand.”\n\n- Jameson Lopp, BitGo Engineer\n\nLopp isn't the only bitcoiner pondering this issue. Reddit user i_wolf has thought long and hard about the problem and recently made the argument that running a full node gives individuals added security.\n\nSince an individual or business can be attacked on the Bitcoin network through a Sybil attack, where thieves surround an individual and try to feed her false information, it is only good, sound policy to run your own full node. Running your own full node could be considered as always having an accurate backup of the blockchain, and the information it contains.\n\nBitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto seems to have addressed this issue as well, in the whitepaper that first described Bitcoin, when he first proposed SPV clients.\n\n- Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nWhile the bitcoin protocol incentivizes miners to secure the network, there is no direct financial reward for running a full node. Some users have publicly called for financially incentivized nodes, suggesting a simple a collection for distribution among the owners. Others have proposed that a new channel be added to the bitcoin protocol itself, in order to send some of the fees to node owners instead of miners.\n\nThe most effective incentive appears to have been a program run by Bitnodes, that created a contest between node operators for having the most connections between peers. The winner of the contest gets paid a modest cash prize, drawn from a collection of donations.\n\nThere are also some enterprising web hosts out there, including Fullnode, that have decided to sell the service of full node-hosting. However, they are finding it harder to stay profitable with the growing size of the blockchain, and Fullnode has announced that they are stopping the service soon.\n\nDespite Fullnode's exit from the field, the price of remotely hosting a full node is not going up for everyone. While you can always run one from an old computer you have lying around your home or office, it's easier and far neater to run one on a VPS server. For a price around $10 to $20 per month there are many web host services that can help you roll out a Bitcoin full node with ease.\n\nThere are also several pre configured full nodes for sale, usually based upon the popular and inexpensive Raspberry Pi. Bitnodes recently launched its own hardware solution which is fully-contained and already configured for $168 worth of bitcoin. All it needs is a fast internet connection and power."", 'San Francisco-based digital currency exchange Kraken has launched a new dark pool for bitcoin trades.\n\nThe dark pool, which functions as an invisible order book separate from its public offering, is intended to provide a means for traders to move more than 50 BTC (roughly $12,500 at press time) on the market in relative secret.\n\nDark pools are used throughout the global financial system, though the practice has faced rising scrutiny from regulators, and banks have been penalized in the past for unlawful activity within the dark pools they operate. Supporters of dark pools say they help stabilize markets and reduce costs.\n\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell said in a recent interview that users have approached the company in the past about such a feature, noting that previously, it would manually handle large orders at customer request.\n\n""There’s been some people for a while going to us and saying they need to work a big trade,"" he said. ""They have a few thousand bitcoin they want to move but they don’t want to put it on the order book because they’re afraid of what that’s going to do the price and structure of the market.""\n\nKraken will charge an extra 0.1% on dark pool trades in addition to its standard trading fee, and is limiting access to customers with verified accounts.\n\nStock market graph via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Termed \'gift cards 2.0\', the ambitious project was first revealed at SXSW in March and followed Lingham\'s own involvement as an advisor and investor in so-called \'crypto 2.0\' firms, including Koinify and Trustatom.\n\nA statement from Gyft implied that the platform could solve real problems for the $100bn gift card market:\n\n""Consumers can redeem different forms of digital value in a single transaction: for example, a consumer can buy a cup of coffee by combining a gift card, branded reward point, and coupon, since all blockchain-based digital assets operate on the same open standards.""\n\nIn an accompanying white paper, Gyft\'s head of special projects Guillaume Lebleu suggests Gyft Block would seek to establish a common API for gift card issuers that more closely replicates those of credit and debit networks.\n\nNew white paper\n\nLebleu\'s follow-up provides an overview of the technological building blocks on which gift cards have been based, and how Gyft believes migrating these attributes to the blockchain could be beneficial.\n\n""Credit and debit cards require a standard infrastructure between thousands of financials institutions and millions of merchants ... A gift card, on the other hand, is a singular instrument typically redeemed only with the merchant who issued it,"" he explains.\n\nIn the post, Lebleu goes on to describe the ways in which Gyft Block will allow providers to issue gift cards on the blockchain that can be programmatically compliant with local laws.\n\nFor example, multisig technology would allow the keys to a bitcoin wallet for a gift card asset to be distributed among multiple parties including the issuer, the cardholder and a third-party to help enforce necessary rules.\n\n""The co-signing program manager is trusted to enforce the terms and regulations of the assets, including daily spending limits and unauthorized transfers, by rejecting any non-compliant transactions,"" he continues.\n\nThe costs of issuing gift cards on the blockchain are also favorable to the cost of printing plastic gift cards, Lebleu says.\n\nHis post concludes:\n\n""Ultimately, intelligent wallets will be able to connect to marketplaces, identify arbitrage opportunities and perform in the background complex chains of trade that maximizes the consumer’s purchasing power without compromising their privacy or control.""\n\nShopping image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Users will be able to log in and retrieve their history and request withdrawals until Sept. 30, 2015. The notice marks the second time BTC Guild has announced its closing, “but this time the decision will not be reversed.” The reasons for the closure are the same as originally announced. The pool is closing because it will not be able to cover losses in the event of compromise.\n\nUsers will be able to continue mining until the servers turn off at the end of day June 30, 2015. Since PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares) is a “backwards paying system,” the last shares submitted are unlikely to receive any blocks unless one is found “at the last second.”\n\nThe minimum balance for a manual withdrawal is reduced to 0.0001. It will not require a transaction fee to request a withdrawal.\n\nOffers to buy didn’t materialize\n\nOne reason BTC Guild cancelled the previous closure was there were offers to purchase the pool. The offers did not materialize. “The risk of users being cheated or stolen from as a result of transferring pool ownership is not something I am willing to accept,” the notice said.\n\nMining has become more centralized, causing BTC Guild to shrink in proportion to the network. BTC now is less than 3 percent of the network hash rate. “The costs of running the pool have not changed, and the amount of funds at risk in the event of a compromise is significantly higher than what the pool could ever recover from.”\n\nWhen the pool was 20 to 3 percent of the network, the level of funds at risk was slightly higher, but the pool’s ability to recover from the loss was greater. “At 3 percent of the network, the pool may not be able to recover from such a loss.”\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin mining pool BTC Guild forced to sell due to uncertain bitcoin regulation and mining centralization\n\nBitLicense looms\n\nIn addition, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) BitLicense regulations have finalized. The regulations have enough “grey area” that BTC Guild is at risk. The fact that BTC Guild is not in New York does not matter since it does business withNew York residents. NYDFS can attempt to claim jurisdiction to enforce regulations. Whether or not BTC Guild could win such a challenge does not matter since the cost of defense would outweigh future income.\n\nBTC has also grown concerned about attempts to defraud pools. “It would only take a fraction (1 PH/s or less could do it) to cause significant harm to a competing pool, and that activity could be masked by proxies and multiple accounts to be impossible to catch.”\n\nBTC Guild recommends the following pools: Bitminter, Eligius, Kano CK Pool and P2Pool.\n\nBTC Guild has eight known blocks and six unknown blocks as of June 16, 2015, according to Blockchain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Cryptocurrency-powered social network Reveal has closed $1.5m in seed funding from investors including Mike Hirshland of Resolute Ventures, Boost VC, Digital Currency Group and the Stanford StartX Fund.\n\nFounded by Matt Ivester, former CEO of social network Kindr as well as college gossip news site JuicyCampus, and Kindr CTO Josh Beal, Reveal is perhaps best described as a visually oriented, Q&A social mobile app.\n\nLike Instagram, SnapChat, Vine and other new social media incumbents, Reveal targets users in high school and college. Unlike these market leaders, Reveal\'s posts offer a unique combination of doodles, photos, video and cryptocurrency.\n\nIt\'s biggest asset according to its founders is reveal coin. A cryptographic token traded on the Stellar network, Ivester and Beal believe reveal coin will serve as a user engagement tool that will resonate with their target audience.\n\nIvester told CoinDesk:\n\n""For a social network, more than most other businesses, users really do contribute a tremendous amount of value by telling their friends about the network so that it grows, but then also by on a day-to-day basis contributing the content that attracts other users and keeps them coming back.""\n\nAs with past social-oriented efforts in the cryptocurrency space, reveal coin will be issued in limited quantities and distribute advertising revenue among users.\n\nHowever, reveal coin also functions as a ""currency for attention"", in that consumers can use the reward token as a way to interact with others they might not otherwise know.\n\n""Reveal coin becomes really interesting as you can create an incentive for another user to answer your questions,"" Ivester said. ""It goes to the top of their inbox, so it\'s a way to get a user\'s attention who you might not be able to access otherwise.""\n\nSocial synergy\n\nBy creating this marketplace for attention, Ivester explained, Reveal aims to first appeal to a key audience that could perhaps earn the most from the tool – influencers on other social websites.\n\nIvester said that Reveal has been working with prominent Instagram and Vine users who already have a large following in hope that their incentivized Q&A format will find appeal. He continued:\n\n""They can say, \'If you really want to get to know me, not just see my entertaining photos or videos, come follow me on Reveal\', because that\'s what we\'re really doing here. We think that that\'s a really great growth strategy for us.""\n\nReveal will also piggyback off other social networks by allowing users to earn reveal coin by inviting friends. Those who post questions, for example, will be able to advertise posted questions via Facebook, Twitter and more.\n\n""We think that Reveal is inherently viral and it will get a lot of growth from that,"" Ivester added.\n\nUser-first philosophy\n\nOf note, is that Reveal\'s founders have chosen a community-first revenue model given that the app might have found an audience even without a token to provide an incentive.\n\nThe fact that sharing value with users might not be ""the perfect business decision"", was acknowledged by the founders. However, Ivester said it was ""the right thing to do"", suggesting that Reveal could appeal to users who feel turned off by the revenue-generating approaches of other social network giants.\n\n""I think we can create a better UX through this,"" Beal remarked. ""Some users are upset by ads on Facebook, they feel like it\'s not something that benefits them.""\n\nAs for how they will attempt to educate their audience about cryptocurrency, both Beal and Ivester indicated that they believe the concept of community ownership will be inherently understood by Reveal\'s audience, even if the technical details are more alien to users.\n\n""The nice thing about reveal coin is you don\'t have to have a super deep level of technical understanding to see the utility in it,"" Ivester said. ""From the consumer side, it\'s a clear value proposition and we\'re starting to educate more people about it being a cryptocurrency.""\n\nSeeking growth\n\nThough excited about the possibilities of reveal coin, Ivester and Beal sought to underscore their belief that the app\'s user experience can stand on its own.\n\nIvester suggested that while social networks like Reddit or Periscope will allow users to interact through questions, he called such attempts secondary to the design of the platforms.\n\n""Reveal is a way to showcase your personality through photos and videos. The content feels a lot more personal than these other networks. There\'s text, photo and video, so it feels like they\'re having a conversation with someone,"" he said.\n\nIvester indicated that Reveal will use the funds to scale its team, build an Android app and begin exploring the possibilities for the continued use of reveal coin in new ways on the network.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""There\'s a lot more that we want to do, and this is going to allow us to do that even faster.""\n\nImage via Reveal\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In a statement sent to CoinTelegraph and posted today on the Bitcoin subreddit, they collectively rejected Bitcoin core developer Gavin Andresen\'s proposal to raise the limit from 1 MB to 20 MB, and instead presented a compromise.\n\nThe mining pools came to the agreement at the National Conference Center in Beijing last Thursday. As they jointly account for some 55% to 60% of all hashing power on the Bitcoin network, it may now be increasingly unlikely that a consensus among the global Bitcoin community can be found on a block size increase to 20 MB.\n\nThe statement released by the Chinese mining pools reads:\n\n“After undergoing deep consideration and discussion, the five pools agree that while the block size does need to be increased, a compromise should be made to increase the network max block size to 8 megabytes. […] We believe that this is a realistic short term adjustment that remains fair to all miners and node operators worldwide.”\n\nIn an article last week, we covered Chinese exchange\'s stances against the increase. Likewise, Chinese mining pool operators are concerned that a 20 MB block size limit could hurt their success rate. They argue this might lead to Chinese miners seizing their operations altogether, which could in turn cause a drop in hashing power and a corresponding reduction in the security of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe mining pools provided three arguments against the proposed raise to a 20 MB block size limit:\n\nFirst, Chinese Internet bandwidth infrastructure is not built out to the same level as that of other countries.\n\nSecond, Chinese outbound Internet bandwidth is restricted, which causes increased latency in connections to Europe and the United States.\n\nAnd finally, the pool operators claim that not all Chinese mining pools are ready for the jump to 20 MB blocks. Because of this, they fear that an increase to the large size could lead to a high rate of orphan blocks.\n\nThe mining pool operators consider a raise to 8 MB to be a temporary solution for scaling Bitcoin to levels appropriate to mainstream use. Speaking to CoinTelegraph, Evan Mo, CEO of Huobi\'s mining project Digcoin, clarified that they consider further adjustments to the protocol — such as the Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik\'s BIP-100 draft — to be feasible. Mo explained:\n\n“Raising the block size limit to 8 MB is the first step of an improvement plan for the Bitcoin network. There is no clear and definite block size to completely solve the transaction jam. 8 MB is therefore a good start for the improvement of the Bitcoin network, and at the same time a relatively mild solution. But it is undeniable that increasing the block size limit to 16M or 32M might be needed in the future.”\n\nHe also emphasized that the Chinese mining pools will not pursue an increase in the block size limit on their own. He says they would rather propose their alternative to the current Bitcoin core development team in order to come to a broader consensus. He told CT:\n\n“The pool operators could actually make such a change themselves without proposing that the core developers do such a thing. Instead, we would like to express our views and concerns to the core developers, and let the community form a discussion rather than rudely cast a divergence. We are happy to see the consensus on the final improvement plan. After all, a \'forked\' community is not what we are chasing after.”\n\nThe possibility of raising the block size limit to 8 MB has previously been suggested within the core development team and the broader Bitcoin community. According to Mo, contact with the Bitcoin Core development team have been positive:\n\n“We have really good communication with Gavin Andresen on this issue. The core developers are also adjusting Garzik\'s proposal on protocol upgrade.”\n\nCoinTelegraph also reached out to BTCChina, Antpool, F2Pool and BW Pool, but received no further responses at press time. This article will be updated if other Chinese mining pool operators provide additional comments.\n\nUpdate June 17, 10:03 UTC: F2Pool admin Wang Chung provided CoinTelegraph with an additional comment:\n\n""We do not necessarily consider an 8 MB block size limit a temporary solution, as we cannot predict what will happen years into the future. But we do think 8 MB is enough for the foreseeable future, presumable at least for the next three years. An increase to 20 MB however, is too risky, and we do not like the proposed Bitcoin-Xt alternative either. We do, on the other hand, support BIP 100 as proposed by Jeff Garzik.""\n\nUpdate June 17, 15:36 UTC: BTCChina CEO Bobby Lee provided CoinTelegraph with additional comments as well:\n\n""Through operating a large mining pool in China, we just feel that in the current fixed-level block size approach, an increase to 8 MB is the most appropriate for now. If the limit were smaller, then it won\'t give us enough headroom to include the ever-increasing number of transactions. And unfortunately, a larger limit is also disfavored because we feel the current global network is not yet ready to handle transfers of really large blocks, especially given the connectivity situation of mining pool operators in China.""\n\nAnd:', 'Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options']"

Read on\n\n[/np_storybar]\n\nThe virtual currency has been steadily climbing this month as talks have broken down between Greece and its creditors. Invented six years ago as an alternative to fiat currencies, Bitcoin has now climbed nearly 10 per cent in the past few days. On Wednesday, the value of one bitcoin rose 1.54 per cent, or US$3.86, to US$254.76.\n\nThe main driver for bitcoin prices seem to be Greek buyers. Joshua Scigala, co-founder of Vaultoro.com, told Reuters this week that his company has seen a 124 per cent pick up in web hits from Greek IP addresses.\n\nIf Greece does exit the eurozone, it is unclear what currency the country would use, since it currently trades in euros. Another concern is the possibility that the Greek government could implement capital controls on the country’s banks soon. Many Greeks have been pulling out their savings, fearing the effects a default would have on Greece’s financial system.\n\nBitcoin got a boost from a similar situation in Cyprus in 2013. That country saw capital controls imposed on banks in exchange for a bailout from the European Central Bank. Bitcoin prices surged 700 per cent from March to April as a result.\n\nBut while the Greece crisis has been a boon for Bitcoin, the virtual currency is still far off from its peak high of nearly US$1,000 set in late 2013. Even with the recent rally, the value of Bitcoin has been essentially flat this year, probably because it continues to be an unreliable alternative to fiat currencies.', 'Bitcoin wallet service Coinbase announced that it’s launching Instant Exchange, which allows users to buy and sell the cryptocurrency while protecting them from its price fluctuations.\n\nPrior to launch of this feature, purchasing Bitcoin on Coinbase would take between three and four days for US customers, as the company relied on the ACH bank transfer system to clear payments.\n\nInstant Exchange is available for users with USD, EUR and GBP wallets.

Soon afterwards Coinbase and BitGo followed suit, making insurance protection a common feature in the largest bitcoin wallet services.\n\nThe given purpose of the Lloyd\'s report was stated as a way to ""investigate the risks that insurers should consider in designing risk transfer,"" and the bulk of the content was an examination of the known risks involved with insuring bitcoins, as well as the benefits to be had from doing so.\n\nWhile Lloyd\'s does not officially endorse insuring bitcoin in the document, they do say that the technology behind Bitcoin is maturing.\n\n- Bitcoin: Risk factors for insurance\n\nThe benefits of Bitcoin listed throughout the report are detailed and well informed, perhaps reflecting the quality of the contributors. Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburgh, from Coin Center, recognize the extensive benefits of Bitcoin.\n\n- Bitcoin: Risk factors for insurance\n\nAfter a brief overview introducing the concept of Bitcoin as an emerging insurance industry, Brito and Van Valkenburgh begin with a section titled “Operational Risks Faced by Bitcoin Companies.” The duo draw a picture of the market today and give hints of the direction it could grow towards.\n\n- Bitcoin: Risk factors for insurance\n\nThe report proceeds to explain in detail what exactly bitcoins are and how unique the challenges to protect and insure them, “There are no physical bitcoins, nor are bitcoins software files like .mp3 music files or Word documents. Instead, a bitcoin, or some fraction of a bitcoin, is a chain of digital signatures stored in a public ledger called the blockchain.”\n\n- Bitcoin: Risk factors for insurance\n\nThe report then touches on the global threat vectors against Bitcoin itself, such as a 51% attack, transaction malleability, natural risk from a hard fork, Sybil attacks, and Denial of Services (DDoS) system attacks.\n\n- Bitcoin: Risk factors for insurance\n\nThroughout the first contribution a multitude of risks and the technology to combat them were analyzed.\n\n- Bitcoin: Risk factors for insurance\n\nThe Coin Center team concluded that innovations are happening so fast that it\'s impossible to simply set a precedent. The authors advise insurers to focus on new controls:\n\n- Bitcoin: Risk factors for insurance\n\nThe second contribution to the report, titled “Strategic risks to Bitcoin operations,” was written by Garrick Hileman, from the London School of Economics, and Satyaki Dhar. It was thick with charts, and covered many of the points made by Coin Center.\n\n- Bitcoin: Risk factors for insurance\n\nIts many charts and graphs spelled out a view of the Bitcoin space and left very few questions answered from an insurance business perspective. One section expanded on regulatory risks, and explained the differing legal statuses Bitcoin has in different nations around the globe.\n\n- Bitcoin: Risk factors for insurance\n\nBy the end of the contribution, having detailed various risk factors associated with bitcoin, Hileman and Dhar were clearly cautiously positive about the outlook for Bitcoin.\n\nThe Lloyd’s market is home to 96 syndicates, forming one of the world’s largest commercial insurers, and a leading reinsurer.

Customers should do their own research before investing funds in any company.', 'Bitcoin first became widely known as a currency, but many say the technology behind it, known as the blockchain, is what really has the potential to upend the financial system as we know it.\n\nAnd that means that many financial services may someday use Bitcoin behind the scenes without the consumer even being aware.\n\nCase in point: the announcement Tuesday at MoneyConf in Belfast, Northern Ireland, that Gyft, an online platform for buying, sending and redeeming gift cards that is owned by First Data , has partnered with blockchain infrastructure provider Chain to run gift cards for thousands of small businesses on the blockchain.\n\nThe new program, which will launch this fall, will be called Gyft Block.\n\n“Based on the numbers we have, 95% of small businesses that have point-of-sale systems do not have gift card programs, whereas something like 99% of the large merchants we currently stock all have gift card programs,” says Vinny Lingham, CEO of Gyft, which works with 300 large retailers, which he defined as national or regional multi-store companies. “The reason for that is the cost — it’s expensive to offer gift card programs.” Gyft decided that the blockchain would allow the company to offer its small businesses a “very cheap, very secure and very fast” solution.\n\n“What’s exciting about this announcement is that it’s really the first real-world blockchain-based product that’s not Bitcoin that people will experience and understand since everyone understands what a gift card is,” says Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain.\n\nGift cards are an excellent candidate for demonstrating the virtues of the blockchain because it should be more secure, cheaper and more flexible than the current system, allowing for innovations in gift cards and combinations with other forms of payment.\n\nOver the years, gift cards such as $10 Starbucks cards, $50 Target cards and $100 iTunes cards have become a handy go-to item for gifts and prizes. According to the National Retail Foundation, they’ve been the number one most requested holiday item eight years running. The amount of money put on gift cards in 2014 was about $125 billion, according to CEB TowerGroup, which provides market insights in financial services.\n\nBut the industry suffers from a lot of fraud. The current system relies on trust that the processor, distributor, reseller, gift buyer and gift receiver won’t steal the 16- to 19-digit code on a gift card and use it before the recipient can shop with it. It’s basically like handing a key from person to person, hoping no one makes a copy along the way.\n\nBut the system has a lot of leakage, from stealing by employees, counterfeiting and skimming of numbers. According to the National Retail Foundation, 78% of retailers have been the victim of gift card fraud. Usually, it’s not possible to tell a code has been compromised until the gift recipient tries to redeem it, and then it’s impossible to identify who the fraudster was.\n\nUsing the blockchain would represent an improvement in security over this system. A blockchain-powered process generates a new address for each transaction, even if the ultimate destination is the same. So, a consumer would receive a gift card into her wallet with one address and send that gift card back to the merchant’s wallet with another address. A fraudster can’t reuse any of these addresses to obtain the value from the card.\n\nAdditionally, once a gift card is in a new wallet, the only party who can move it out again is the holder of the private key. If that person wants to move the money to another wallet, which we can think of as a lockbox, she uses her private key to move the money out of her wallet and obtains a public key for the destination wallet. That allows her to perform the digital currency equivalent of slipping money into that lockbox, as head of Gyft Block Guillaume Lebleu put it in this Medium post. (However, without a private key for the second account, neither she nor anyone else, including a fraudster, could take money out of it.)\n\nOne of the most novel aspects of Gyft Block will be that the value of the gift card will not be held in Bitcoin, even though the transfers will be recorded on the blockchain. This means each gift card transfer will move a tiny amount of Bitcoin called a Satoshi, which is a hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin (a fraction of a cent), on which is coded metadata containing the value of the gift card (say, $50), the name of the merchant and other information. However, the transaction itself will not be moving $50 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nWhile this may sound complex, the user experience is anything but. “From the consumer side, at first, it’s not going to feel any different other than paying for something with your smartphone as you would today,” says Ludwin.\n\nAnother advantage a blockchain-run gift card system has over a traditional one is that it’s cheaper. Part of the cost-savings comes from the reduction in fraud, but even without that, a blockchain-based system is less expensive — about a penny at current Bitcoin prices — to issue, transfer and settle a gift card. That contrasts with the current rate of about $1.50 per plastic gift card, based on a 2.5% + 20-cent bank card transaction fee. (For various reasons, even if the value of Bitcoin went up, the processing cost for a gift card would likely remain about the same.)\n\nTo begin, Gyft Block will only work with virtual gift cards, although the company is experimenting with using the blockchain to issue physical cards. But the flexibility in this new system opens the door to many future possibilities. For instance, Blue Bottle Coffee could create a loyalty points card that would record every time you bought Blue Bottle coffee whether in a supermarket or cafe, and you could spend those points at the Blue Bottle Cafe. Or, if you have a gift card, some rewards points and a coupon, you could use all three together to pay for a purchase without having to go through the current rigamarole of swiping the cards to see how much money is on each. The app would just show you all your your options for payment and you could select whatever combination you like of your coupon, rewards and gift card.\n\nAlso, it will be much easier for consumers to swap blockchain-issued gift cards. So if someone receives a Starbucks gift card but isn’t a big coffee drinker, he could post his card in a marketplace that matches him with someone looking for a Starbucks gift card who is offering something he wants, and then the assets could easily be traded digitally.\n\nNoting that, in the current gift card system, each retailer has its own proprietary system, Ludwin says the new system will allow much more flexibility: “What’s happening its that there’s a shift happening away from rigid printed gift cards to digital cards and finally, really, merchant-issued currencies is where we’re ending up …. These currencies can move more seamlessly in social media, video games, in any kind of digital media, can integrate with other applications and apps on your phone more easily, so it’s a much more seamless system.”', 'Banks mostly aren\'t interested in bitcoin, but they are interested in the software that runs the digital currency — the blockchain.\n\nBanks run on systems that were in some cases built decades ago and as a result are slow, costly and cumbersome. The blockchain — the program that lets people send bitcoin to each other and records those transactions — doesn\'t have these legacy issues.\n\nThe blockchain keeps a public record of transactions, spread across a distributed network, and allows much quicker transfer of balances. As a result, sending bitcoin is faster, cheaper and more transparent than sending traditional currencies.\n\nThat makes it attractive to banks looking to soup up their money transfer businesses, but the technology also has potential in other areas — distributed ledgers could be used for ""smart contracts"" when banks make loans, for example, recording who\'s borrowed what across a public network.\n\n""We have internally identified 20 to 25 use cases where this technology can be applied,"" Mariano Belinky, head of Santander InnoVentures told Business Insider at MoneyConf in Belfast this week. Belinky reeled off international money transfers, trade finance, syndicated lending and collateral management as some of the areas where blockchain technology could be applied.\n\nSantander, the world\'s tenth biggest bank according to Forbes, is one of several lenders investigating how to use the blockchain in traditional banking. UBS has set up a blockchain research lab in London, Goldman Sachs has invested in bitcoin startup Circle and Nasdaq is also experimenting with the technology.\n\nIt\'s pretty clear why the banks are doing all this. As well as making their systems smarter, it could save them a huge amount of money. A report co-authored by Santander earlier this month estimated that blockchain technology could reduce banks\' infrastructure costs by up to $20 billion (£12.8 billion) a year.\n\nJulio M Faura, global head of R&D innovation at Santander, told Business Insider: ""For us, the first obvious space to explore all of this in is payments, particularly international payments. Later on we think smart contracts have the potential to transform many of the other things we do.\n\n""We still haven’t made anything official, we haven’t announced anything publicly, but we have an internal team working on this. We’ve done some proof of concepts.""\n\nFaura is heading up a team in Santander dubbed Crypto 2.0 — referring to cryptocurrencies — which is carrying out experiments with the blockchain and digital currencies.\n\nSantander InnoVentures, which Belinky heads, is the Spanish banking giant\'s $100 million (£64 million) fintech investment fund, launched last year. The fund has made 3 investments so far and Belinky said 2 more are close to completion. A source told Business Insider that one of these is a startup working on blockchain technology. Belinky declined to comment.\n\nBelinky told BI: ""We’re very excited about distributed ledgers and blockchain technology. They really have the potential to disrupt many of the basic processes we have underlying our transactional products.""\n\n""What we see as the foundation use case, which is international payments, we don’t really need a coalition of 50 banks to make it work. We have ten major geographies. Just us connecting our ten major geographies will allow 100 million customers to make instant payments worldwide. If we partner with two or three banks similar to us we’ve got pretty much global coverage.""\n\nBut Faura adds: ""This thing will only be interesting if many banks take part and collaborate. We are talking and experimenting with several banks.""\n\nBelinky chips in: ""It’s like having the first phone — there’s no point, you can’t ring anyone.""\n\nHe adds that while Santander is very keen to explore the possibilities of blockchain, we won\'t be sending cash over blockchain networks any time soon. Belinky says that ""while getting to a working prototype could be something that we do within months, getting to an actual product that regulators say is good to go and the compliance guys like — that will take a while.""\n\nStephen Pair, CEO of bitcoin company Bitpay, told me during our interview at MoneyConf that he\'s in conversation with several banks about the potential of blockchain and related technologies. But he said: ""I’ve been in and around banks for a while and they take years, even with software that’s well known and well understood.""\n\nPair thinks it will be at least 5 years before any banks seriously adopt a version of blockchain technology.', ""Bitcoin’s biggest problem is still the threat of a 51% attack, according to Dr Dirk Haubrich, head of consumer protection and financial innovation at the European Banking Authority (EBA).\n\nHe said his main concern about the widespread adoption of bitcoin is the risk of a 51% attack, where a single entity contributes the majority of the network’s mining hashrate and, thus, gains full control of the network and can manipulate the blockchain.\n\nHaubrich made these comments on Friday at an event titled Controlling Cryptocurrencies at the University of Birmingham in the UK.\n\nHe said he had spoken to numerous members of the virtual currency world two years ago and at the time, he was assured majority power would never occur. After it did, people assured him it didn’t matter, as the 51% would not abuse the system.\n\n“As a financial regulator, I don't believe it. I've seen so much stuff happen from the financial institutions that created the financial crisis – and that is partly what brought about virtual currencies in the first place – so I don't believe in those promises any more,” Haubrich said.\n\nEnsuring integrity\n\nHaubrich feels the EBA could probably find a way to split up mining pools to prevent a 51% attack, but he is reluctant to go down this route. He said it goes against the philosophical origins of virtual currencies and the concept of a system without centralised control.\n\nHowever, he added:\n\n“We want to make sure there is integrity in a virtual currency system. So we want someone to be responsible for the integrity of the scheme.”\n\nHaubrich said he doesn’t think a public authority or a regulator should take this responsibility. Two years ago, Haubrich would have suggested the Bitcoin Foundation for this role, but it’s not suitable now, given its “declining trajectory”, he said.\n\nThe EBA’s approach\n\nThe EBA produced a guidance document in July 2014, which outlined the risks and potential benefits of digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\nHaubrich explained the EBA’s process on deciding whether to regulate new technology or other developments in the payments space: “We assess the benefits, we define the risks and there is then the question to ask – do we need to get involved? Is there some sort of regulatory framework required?”\n\nHe admitted that, at first, the EBA thought it might be able to “shoehorn” cryptocurrencies into some of the existing directives, such as the Payment Service Directive.\n\n“That way we [would] have an easy fix, but then we realised that a more comprehensive and separate regulatory regime is required. We as an authority won't want to deal with that ourselves, if the task had been a bit smaller we could have managed it, but it's too much,” Haubrich explained.\n\nInstead, the authority issued an opinion, designed to offer guidance to other European Union institutions so they can decide what regulation, if any, to create. Haubrich said:\n\n“This is going to take a while, given the length of time it takes European Commission houses of parliament to actually develop something – it could take several years for this to get off the ground, if it ever gets off the ground.”\n\nWhatever happens, the EBA is keen for a regulatory environment that provides suitable consumer protections while also making sure innovation can flourish.\n\nEconomic sanctions\n\nHaubrich outlined that, when the EBA was assessing the risks presented by cryptocurrencies, there were many it would be capable of addressing, but others went beyond the authority's remit.\n\nSome risks, for example, fall within the political domain, such as the fact cryptocurrencies can undermine financial sanctions.\n\n“The way financial sanctions are imposed is to tell the financial intermediary – a bank or payment services provider – they can no longer accept money from this person, or from this jurisdiction to that jurisdiction,” explained Haubrich.\n\nHe went on to say the peer-to-peer nature of cryptocurrency transactions means financial sanctions cannot be readily enforced. Whether these sanctions are right or wrong is not for him to decide, he said, so it’s up to separate authorities to consider whether they value this political tool more than the potential benefits cryptocurrencies present.\n\n“We, as a financial regulator, are not elected by the populous. I am elected and I work to a mandate, not what I think should be the objective of society,” he concluded.\n\nEBA image via EBA\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The banks claim they are doing this to prevent fraudulent bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe Polish bitcoin forum bitcoinet.pl announced that as of Monday, express bitcoin payments are no longer available on cryptocurrency exchanges Cryptocoin.com, Bitbay.pl. and Bitmarket24.pl. “All this is due to the ultimatum that the four largest Polish banks bring to operators and BlueMedia CashBill payments,” the forum noted. BlueMedia and CashBill are online payment providers.\n\nBitbay.net, a bitcoin and litecoin exchange, has advised its customers that it can no longer make accelerated bank deposits because its online payment provider, Cashbill, has terminated its contract with Bitbay.net.\n\nImmediate Termination Of Service\n\n“CashBill contacted us and informed that he will need to end the cooperation with us due to the warning it got from banks,” Justyna Laskowska Witek, chief marketing officer at Bitbay.net, told CCN. “Banks demanded from CashBill an immediate termination of the contract with our exchange – BitBay.net. One day later, it turned out that it wasn’t only our case. Moreover, we did not receive any information (neither from the operator nor from banks) about the possibility of such a situation.”\n\nWitek said Bitbay.net is suggesting its customers use an alternative online payment service, BlueCash, to make deposits. However, by using BlueCash, customers cannot deposit directly from Bitbay.net to a bank. However, the process is not as fast as CashBill.\n\nWitek said Bitbay.net was seeking a solution to the problem. Bitbay.net has facilitated fast and secure bitcoin and litecoin transactions for USD, PLN and EUR since 2014.\n\nLast week, Bitmarket.pl announced that its payment provider, BlueMedia, took the same action. “BlueMedia announced the exclusion of services for BitMarket immediately ….

It now also sits above the 100 day EMA (~US$241) as well. It’s possible a change of trend could be underway, but it is still too early to tell.\n\nThis move has been made on very small volume and On Balance Volume confirms this. If the trend is truly going to change, volume should ideally come in.\n\nThe tell tale sign might be seeing volume come in if the price tries to break above the 200 day EMA (~US$261). A general principle and one that should be observed is that volume precedes price. However, the bitcoin exchange market has become very illiquid so price can be pushed up quite easily, which is why continued caution is recommended.\n\nPrice holding above the 50 & 100 day for a few days and old resistance becoming support could mean the trend is changing. The Money Flow Index and the Relative Strength Index are now both overbought on the daily chart and price should pull back. Expect a test of the 100 day first at ~US$241.\n\nShort term the price is also overbought: the MACD, RSI and MFI are all screaming for a pull back. Based on the Fibonacci retracements - look for it to test that ~US$241 area to start.\n\nThis is a positive start to what could possibly be a change in trend. In this area, waiting for price to resolve to the upside or downside is best.\n\nIt’s highly likely that a pullback should occur and if it’s a good one - meaning that the price tests it and doesn’t break down - a new trend may indeed be upon us, effectively reversing the current bear market.\n\nDisclaimer: Articles regarding the potential movement in cryptocurrency prices are not to be treated as trading advice.

06/18/2015,"['Elliptic, a bitcoin analytics and storage startup based in London, thinks it\'s just made a huge breakthrough that could make banks way more interested in bitcoin.\n\nThe company has created a sophisticated bit of software that it says can identify where a bitcoin has come from. That\'s a big deal for banks, which have a legal obligation to find out where the money they hold is coming from to ensure they\'re not holding proceeds of crime.\n\nBitcoin isn\'t untraceable — every transaction is recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. But the digital wallets that carry out transactions are anonymous, making it extremely difficult to actually make sense of the data. You could do some digging around and make a guess, but it\'s hard and time-consuming.\n\nThat means banks have been wary about holding bitcoin — if they take a bitcoin that\'s just been earned selling drugs in a dark Web market like Silk Road 2.0, or that has passed through a known money-laundering service, they could end up in huge trouble with regulators.\n\nElliptic says its tool, built by four Ph.D. holders, can make a hugely accurate guess as to who each wallet belongs to — and it can do so in real time. Using machine-learning, its software crunches through the internet and the dark Web, skimming references to wallets and other digital clues to build up a picture of the owner.\n\nTom Robinson, Elliptic\'s cofounder, told Business Insider the tool could be a ""game changer for the institutionalisation of bitcoin."" If banks can satisfy anti-money-laundering regulation then they can start to think about handling bitcoin. The tool was created after conversations with dozens of lenders.\n\nElliptic has released a visualisation tool showing the flow of bitcoin between entities over the entire six-year history of bitcoin, naming the 250 largest entities where bitcoins are sent to and from.\n\nLater this year, the company will launch a API of its software, meaning banks will be able to effectively bolt it on to their existing systems and use it. Kevin Beardsley, an analyst at Elliptic, said around five banks have already signed up for the API. (He didn\'t say which ones.)\n\nIn an emailed statement on Thursday, Elliptic\'s CEO James Smith said “if digital currency is to take its legitimate place in the enterprise it inevitably must step out of the shadows of the dark web. Our technology allows us to trace historic and real-time flow, and represents the tipping point for enterprise adoption of bitcoin.\n\nHe added: ""We have developed this technology not to incriminate nor to pry; but to support businesses’ anti-money laundering obligations.

(Picture: Reuters)\n\nWith time now rapidly running out, Athens and its lenders – other eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund – appear to be deadlocked over how much more Greece must tighten its belt in exchange for needed funding.\n\nThe eurozone portion of Greece’s €245 billion bailout expires on June 30, the same day Greece faces a €1.5 billion payment to the IMF.\n\nThis amount of debt and interest is totally unsustainable for Greece to maintain and the country has no more to give. So what next?\n\nCould Greece take bitcoin as its official currency?\n\nIt would not be a good idea for Greece to renounce the euro and adopt bitcoin which would mean giving up their sovereign monetary policy.\n\nMonetary policy, used responsibly, is useful to manage public finances, provided it is not abused to issue too much currency. Greece cannot itself use monetary policy whilst it is part of the eurozone and adopting bitcoin would put Greece in exactly the same position.\n\nWhat is bitcoin? An idiot’s guide to the virtual currency\n\nIn fact, the finance minister of Greece, Yanis Varoufakis, agrees that because it is deflationary, bitcoin would be bad for Greece.\n\nHe then goes on to say that bitcoin is a flawed currency because it is deflationary. This misses the point. Bitcoin is a global currency (or more correctly a ‘value-transfer’ system) for anyone and everyone and not a currency designed for use by a government.\n\nWhat is bitcoin? Bitcoin is a software-based online peer-to-peer payment system described by its inventor Satoshi Nakamoto (assumed to be an alias) in 2008 and introduced as open source software in January 2009. Transactions – payments and receipts – are all recorded in a public ledger (called the blockchain) using its own digital unit of account, which is also called bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, bitcoin is deflationary with a fixed amount of regular issuance controlled by the bitcoin software algorithm. The amount in issue today is around 14m and the total amount that can ever be issued is capped at 21m – forever.\n\nIt would be far better for Greece to consider adopting the bitcoin open source protocol to create its own government-backed bit-drachma with the Greek central bank and its national banks acting as ‘validators’ with a pre-mined (ie. electronically printed) amount of bit-drachma equivalent to the amount of euros held in Greek banks.\n\nIn addition, an additional amount, say up to 10%, should be pre-mined and distributed equally to each individual Greek taxpayer with a valid social security number.\n\nBitcoin fortune: Man buys flat after £15 investment in virtual currency\n\nThis would please everyone. It would be like QE (quantitative easing) for the benefit of the people of Greece and appeal to the philosophy of the left-wing party Syriza.\n\nThe bit-drachma would be issued as a parallel digital currency alongside the euro and help Greece to achieve a more controlled and manageable ‘Grexit’ from the euro.\n\nSo, if the Greek government issued a parallel digital currency, decreed it as legal tender and banks and businesses made to use it, this would also boost the Greek money supply in defiance of the policy of the European Central Bank and return monetary policy to Greece.\n\nBills and pensions could then be paid. Normality would start to return. Greek citizens would be happy and admire their government.\n\nThis could all reasonably be done by the end of June and new paper money (cash) could follow soon afterwards.\n\nMORE: 6 things you’ve always wanted to ask about Bitcoin', 'Polish payment processors and at least one bank in the country have closed the accounts of local bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBitBay, Cryptoins.com, bitmarket24pl and Bitmarket.pl confirmed that the regional payments processors they work with – CashBill and BlueMedia – had informed them that their accounts were being closed at the request of their own partner banks.\n\nBitmarket.pl told CoinDesk that PKO Bank Polski had also informed them that their bank accounts were being closed.\n\nRepresentatives from CashBill and BlueMedia confirmed that the closures had taken place. A spokesperson for CashBill, who declined to provide specifics, told CoinDesk that the company had been informed by ""various banks"" in Poland that continued work with bitcoin exchanges ""will result in termination of our services in those banks"".\n\nThe spokesperson continued:\n\n""Our aim is to provide 100% payment channel coverage of for all our customers.

However, security always comes first. Our decision was made exclusively based on fraud risk and assessment"".\n\nFraud cited\n\nWhen reached for comment, PKO Bank Polski representative Michal Tkaczuk declined to comment on the account closures, calling it ""a subject of bank secrecy"".\n\nTkaczuk provided the following statement:\n\n""In our opinion virtual currency markets are poorly regulated. Client identification and procedures use by bitcoin exchange platforms are inadequate and raise legal doubts. Taking this into account, PKO Bank Polski acts to prevent suspicious transactions.""\n\nNotably, the CashBill representative suggested that the company had an interest in bitcoin, but that the legal liabilities represent too great a risk.\n\n""We would gladly add bitcoin payments to our payment channel portfolio, but sadly bitcoin is not currently regulated in any way by Polish law and doing so would constitute a legal risk for our operation,"" concluded the spokesperson, adding that the change in policy ""left us puzzled"".\n\nSudden notice\n\nAt least one of the exchanges indicated that the shutoff was a surprise, with a representative for Cryptoins.com telling CoinDesk that CashBill had terminated its contract ""without prior notice"".\n\nMariusz Sperczy?ski, a spokesperson for Bitmarket.pl, said that its bank, PKO Bank Polski, had decided to terminate accounts with the exchange, a loss that occurred as its BlueMedia account was also suspended.\n\nBitmarket.pl previously had its bank account suspended by Bank BPH in January this year. Sperczy?ski said that the impact of the latest closures was minimal.\n\nThe impact on BitMarket24.pl appears to have been more significant. A spokesperson told CoinDesk that its revenues had fallen sharply owing to the fact that 95% of its payments were previously channeled through CashBill.\n\nJustyna Laskowska Witek, a marketing specialist at BitBay, said CashBill informed them earlier this week that it had received instructions from its bank partner to terminate its agreement with the digital currency exchange.\n\nSince CashBill terminated its contract, Witek said that BitBay\'s daily trading volume – previously 1000 BTC on an average day – had decreased.\n\n""However, we are trying to overcome this problem,"" she added.\n\nTermination of contract image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Does cryptocurrency have the potential to improve transparency in the context of land transaction records? Photo by: Antana / CC BY-SA\n\nOver the last year, Bitcoin has enjoyed significant news coverage, mostly of the negative sort, having seen its value trending down from $658 to $227 bitcoins to the dollar, and news garnering events such as the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange and scandal around the Silk Road website causing concern amongst potential users of the cryptocurrency. Lost amongst the excitement around the virtual currency is an underlying technology, blockchain, which may prove to have a greater impact than the cryptocurrency for which it was built.\n\nThe interest in blockchain has recently spread to the land administration sector, largely based on news regarding the decision made in Honduras to build a land registry system using blockchain technology. Even Hernando de Soto seems to be jumping in on the concept, as can be seen by his role moderating at the recent Blockchain Summit hosted by none other than Sir Richard Branson at his private getaway in the West Indies, Necker Island.\n\nTo assess why the blockchain concept might apply to the land sector, it’s important to understand what the blockchain really is. In the simplest terms, the blockchain is a distributed database holding a public ledger of all transactions, such as bitcoin. What makes the blockchain so innovative is that every node has a complete or partial copy of the blockchain and all historical transactions, eliminating the need for a central database and ensuring that a single user is unable to fraudulently manipulate the data.\n\nThe concept of a transparent, decentralized public ledger could easily apply to land information management, where the land registry serves as a database of all property rights and historical transactions. The added benefit of using the blockchain technology is that you can get away from a centralized database, which too often could be vulnerable to hacking, misuse by system administrators, or even natural or man-made disasters destroying the data center (unfortunately, too often land administration authorities in emerging economies do not utilize best practices in data backup). Blockchain could also potentially serve as a sort of virtual notary service, authenticating when precisely a transaction occurred, though it's doubtful U.S. lending institutions are quite ready to do away with title insurance based on blockchain, as described by blockchain advocate and former Mighty Duck Brock Pierce.\n\nIn Honduras, Factom, with support from partner Epigraph, intends to implement a secure land registry system built upon the blockchain technology.\n\n“In the past, Honduras has struggled with land title fraud. The country’s database was basically hacked. So bureaucrats could get in there and they could get themselves beachfront properties,” said Factom President Peter Kirby in a recent interview with Reuters.\n\nIt should be noted that there is very little information to be found regarding Factom, or its partner Epigraph in general, and program details such as implementation plans, timelines, organizational staff, project budget and domain expertise are not yet public, so it is difficult to ascertain what exactly the proposed system will entail.\n\nIn most emerging economies, such as Honduras, where property rights are lacking, technology is not the greatest impediment to secure tenure. More often, the problem is a lack of policies supporting equitable rights for all, high costs to formalize properties, inefficient bureaucracies that take years to accomplish rudimentary tasks (and even then only when under-the-table expediting fees are paid), and general issues with poor governance. Unfortunately, the real challenge (and much of the cost associated) with bringing property rights into the formal sectors lies more in the initial identification of rights holders, the details regarding their rights, restrictions and responsibilities, and ascertaining and documenting the geographical boundaries of the claim.\n\nAt Cadasta, we are working to identify what applications of blockchain are relevant and how we might support those applications via our software platform. Our goal is to assist individuals who are left out of the formal property rights system, and that make up an estimated 70-80 percent of the global population.\n\nFor those citizens, an iterative first step in identifying and recording their property rights will be to document their rights on an open and accessible platform. This improved land information data is a step toward a more robust system which could eventually become formally recognized and recorded in a national level land registry, where a blockchain-based system will be relevant and useful.\n\nIn the initial iteration of the Cadasta platform, expected in late 2015, integration with blockchain is not prioritized, as it is simply not yet applicable for most citizens. In subsequent iterations we will incorporate support for various blockchain components — for example, the Proof of Existence application to verify when a property right may have been documented. We will continue to monitor possible uses of blockchain and prepare to further support and integrate a technology that has such potential to provide a secure, transparent ledger of transactions.\n\nWhile a decentralized land information system based on the blockchain technology won’t help with the initial identification, demarcation and registration of rights (or resolution of disputes in the event of conflicting claims), it may assist in making subsequent transactions more secure.\n\nWhile a land information system built on the blockchain technology may provide additional security compared to a traditional land information system, is blockchain going to end world poverty as was claimed in a recent Forbes article? Probably not, but we welcome any disruptive innovations that could improve the livelihoods of the underserved and underprivileged. Could it fundamentally change the landscape for robust, scalable, enterprise systems that manage property rights in mature economies? Very possibly. Does it have the potential to improve the security and transparency of transactions? Without a doubt.\n\nTo read additional content on land and property rights, go to Focus On: Land Matters in partnership with Thomson Reuters."", 'Bitcoin and cryptocurrency software products company Newnote Financial Corp has announced that Canadian fiat settlement is now possible on online cryptocurrency marketplace Coinpayments.com using its Cointrader.net Bitcoin exchange.

For now, it is on alpha release for a limited time for users who have signed up on the Bitcoin Testnet.\n\nThe company was founded by Dr. Bedeho Mender who sought to improve the levels of bandwidth contribution and the lack of incentives for content providers known as seeders in the original BitTorrent client. Micropayments to torrent seeders could be made using bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Payments for Torrents\n\nThis will require leechers or those who download torrents to pay seeders or those who host in bitcoin. With that, seeders can be able to charge higher fees for premium or high-quality content.\n\n“I think the seeding market is very close to a perfectly competitive market, which means that seeders will compete the price down to the marginal cost of supplying the content, which is quite low,” Mender said. “Getting to that sort of situation does, however, take some time, and in the initial stages the first seeders will be able to charge somewhat monopolistic prices. This is temporary, and will give people an incentive to go through the trouble of preparing content and creating torrent files. It is hard to come up with an exact number, but I think the very low monthly prices of VPNs could be taken as an indication of how cheap bandwidth really is.”\n\nWith these incentives, leechers might also have the option to pick faster download speeds and pay additional costs to those seeders who support that. This could increase activity in the network and lead to more downloads for the platform.\n\n“The alpha release will be on Testnet, where everyone can try it out without risking any of their bitcoins, after that the goal is to get to a stable and secure version running on Mainnet with real bitcoins,” Mender added.', 'A US judge has ruled that a Kentucky man must repay a loan he originally solicited in bitcoin.\n\nJudge Frank Fletcher of the Breathitt County District Court, in an order signed 5th June, stated that Dennis Kerley must repay $67,591 on a loan he had received in bitcoin via the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform BTCJam.\n\nThe loan, dating back to December 2013, fell into default within a few months of receipt. The plaintiff in the case, Daniel Kaminski de Souza, loaned Kerley 11.95 BTC, worth just over $10,000 at the time it was solicited.\n\nThe case is perhaps suggestive of how US judges who lack a general understanding of bitcoin consider cases, even providing a degree of precedent for future cases involving P2P loans denominated in bitcoin, according to lawyer Kevin Palley, who represented de Souza in the case.\n\nPalley told CoinDesk:\n\n“The judge did not understand what bitcoin was, and this is a small county in rural Kentucky. So he asked anybody in the courtroom if they knew about it and one or two people raised their hands.”\n\nPalley said that he went on to treat bitcoin as a kind of highly speculative foreign currency, a explanation that was ultimately accepted by the court.\n\nKerley, according to Palley, did make an appearance during the 5th June hearing, and though Kerley responded to the initial lawsuit, Palley successfully petitioned the court to deem that reply a non-response to the specific claims in the suit.\n\nKerley could not be reached for comment for this report.\n\nMining loan\n\nIn December 2013, Kerley sought funding to buy bitcoin mining equipment from Bitmine, a Swiss company that ultimately went bankrupt amid accusations of fraud.\n\nKerley said that he intended to buy a 1 TH/s bitcoin miner, as well as a 400 GH/s unit if enough funds were available. In the loan description, he wrote that he planned to generate as much as 0.76 BTC per day.\n\nKerley added that he was offering an interest rate of 20%, explaining:\n\n“I realize there is some speculation and risk with this investment. But, as I am and have been actively mining bitcoins for more than a year, I believe this is a sound investment and worth the risk.”\n\nIssues emerge\n\nAccording to the user comments on to the BTCJam loan page, payment issues began shortly after solicitation was complete.\n\nDe Souza asked about the status of payment on 6th February of last year, and Kerley replied that the issue stemmed from shipping problems and damages to the miners he received.\n\n""I have over half the payment ready to send and will have it all in a couple of days. I will then make the payment and bring my loan to current,"" Kerley wrote. ""From this point forward there will be not more late payments and I will actually be paying the loan of early.""\n\nTwo weeks later, when asked for an update, Kerley wrote:\n\n""I have mined 2.3 BTC but can not make a partial payment on the loan dues to the BTCJam system design. I will soon have the coin to pay the late payment and will soon be at full capacity before the next payment is due.""\n\nThat message, dated 22nd February, was the last Kerley would post on that page.\n\nJust over two months later, de Souza wrote that he had received notification that the loan would enter arbitration for nonpayment.\n\nRelief sought\n\nWhen borrowers agree to use BTCJam, they enter into an agreement that states: ""The arbitrator\'s decision shall be final and legally binding and judgment may be entered thereon.""\n\nArbitration services are provided to BTCJam users by a company called net-ARB. According to an arbitration award document provided to CoinDesk, de Souza was granted an award for 64.74381250 BTC following 91 days of nonpayment.\n\nFollowing the arbitration award, de Souza told CoinDesk, he hired Palley, who subsequently reached out to Kerley to seek redress for the defaulted loan. In a response letter, Kerley requested information regarding the amount he allegedly owed, as well as verification of Palley\'s credentials.\n\nIn March 2015, Palley formally filed suit against Kerley on behalf of de Souza, seeking either an enforcement of the arbitration agreement or relief for breach of contract.\n\nThe complaint read:\n\n""Plaintiff has suffered damages due to Defendant’s failure to honor its contract and Plaintiff requests damages for breach of contract in the amount of $30,723.53 as of September 3, 2014, pre-judgment interest in the amount of $17.07 per day as of September 3, 2014, court costs, fees and post-judgment interest.""\n\nTwo months later, Judge Fletcher found in favor of de Souza.\n\nNext steps\n\nAccording to Palley, the next phase in the suit against Kerley involves seeking repayment on the loan, a process he suggested could pose additional challenges.\n\n""The hard part is going to be the collecting,"" he explained. ""So what I’ll have to do is do an asset search and see if there’s anything to collect. Getting a judgement is easier than collecting, and [de Souza] understands it could be some time.""\n\nDe Souza said one current issue is identifying financial institutions used by Kerley in Kentucky, a process he claimed has been hindered by a lack of information from BTCJam.\n\n""A measure [Palley] will have to take now is to send a garnishment letter to every bank in the Breathitt county because we don\'t know in which bank and agency the debtor has an account,"" he said.\n\nWhen reached for comment, BTCJam told CoinDesk that it was supportive of the outcome of the suit, calling it a successful example of the settlement process it has in place.\n\nThe company noted that it was bound by the law to provide sensitive information only through legal processes, but would be happy to do so through the courts if requested.\n\nKentucky legislature image via Shutterstock\n\nThe full order on motion for summary judgment can be found below:\n\nDe Souza v Kerley Judgment\n\nJudges hitting wooden gavel image via Shutterstock\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated that Kerley did not respond to the lawsuit.

LHV is the 5th largest bank and 2nd largest pension fund manager in the country.\n\nStarted as a brokerage firm, it received its bank license in 2009. Founding shareholders were co-founders of Hansabank (later renamed Swedbank in the Baltics after acquisition) — the most successful regional bank — created in 1991.\n\nLHV aims to mix 21st-century technology with 19th-century relationship banking. We are relying heavily on the Internet (operating only two branches for consulting and mandatory physical customer identification purposes) and are cashless. The aim is to keep the organization relatively small and highly efficient. Bank services primarily include SME-s and retail clients.\n\n“All Estonian government and finance infrastructure relies heavily on public-key cryptography, hence it is a natural step to investigate and test different variations of that.”\n\nCT: Why did you decide to experiment with the Bitcoin blockchain, and how can it help your business?\n\nRL: We believe blockchain technology is a great innovation commanding certain unique characteristics compared to ordinary centralized databases. Hence, the blockchain is potentially more suitable for some (this does not mean all) banking and finance related applications. All Estonian government and finance infrastructure relies heavily on public-key cryptography, hence it is a natural step to investigate and test different variations of that.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is the oldest, most tested and secure and hence suitable for our current applications. However it should not stay static, but develop quicker to avoid becoming obsolete. We are also naturally following alternative solutions.\n\nCT: The Cuber Wallet app uses colored coins. Does this mean it still uses Bitcoin and could you explain how this works?\n\nRL: Cuber Wallet does use bitcoins, but as a data carrier. We are using open colored coins’ EPOBC [enhanced padded order-based coloring motivation] standard developed by Alex Mizrahi. It means we are “painting"" bitcoin by adding unique markers to them, which then represents a claim in fiat currency against LHV Bank, as the entry into Oracle’s database represents a claim against the traditional bank system.\n\n“The merchant does not have to deal with bitcoins — he should not even know what it is.”\n\nCT: Does this mean bitcoins can be used with the app at any retail location that accepts fiat currency, i.e., euros?\n\nRL: The merchant has to approve this payment method just as they have to approve credit cards, etc. We are currently still testing it in few physical locations. However, I see much bigger use for that in online business, particularly for smaller payments.\n\nThe merchant does not have to deal with bitcoins — he should not even know what it is. I draw a parallel with the car industry — most cars are still powered by a series of explosions within the combustion engine, but the driver does not have to worry about that and industry does not advertise their product in this way.\n\nCT: Could you talk about the bitcoin-based digital security (certificate of deposit) that you are also working on? How will this work and when could we expect this to come out?\n\nRL: It is important to separate two things: LHV Bank-issued CUBER (Cryptographic Universal Blockchain Entered Receivable) securities, which are technically bank certificate of deposits recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n“The bank views [bitcoin-based digital securities] as a Lego building block for financial innovation.”\n\nThey are denominated in euros, may pay interest (not in today’s environment) and are suitable for various purposes — store of value, medium of exchange, trust and escrow services and, in the future, even for machine-to-machine transactions (due to basic scripting possibility). The bank views it as a Lego building block for financial innovation.\n\nThen, there’s the Cuber Wallet, which is a piece of software for mobile phones, enabling P2P transactions using underlying CUBER securities. In fact, it is just the first demonstration of real CUBER usability.\n\nLHV Bank has issued the first 100,000 euros worth of CUBERs for testing. There are naturally a number of issues the bank wants to research and test before scaling up.\n\n“The main challenge is developing a simple, secure and legally compliant bridge between crypto and traditional banking.”\n\nCT: You indicated last year that you saw this as an opportunity to ""explore what could be built on top of the underlying technology."" What do you think of this technology so far, and what kind of feedback have you received from your users?\n\nRL: The initial feedback for Cuber Wallet has been positive — the technology seems to work well and so far there have been no major consumer side issues. The main challenge is developing a simple, secure and legally compliant bridge between crypto and traditional banking. Right now, Cuber Technologies, Ltd (developer of the wallet) is focusing on this first product. There are some other new product ideas, but as always resources are limited.\n\nCT: With other banks, such as Citi and JPMorgan, looking into blockchain technology, as well as new competition from the FinTech sector (P2P transactions, Lending Club, etc.), do you think traditional banking is on the verge of being seriously disrupted?\n\nRL: LHV is clearly having a retail approach, utilizing existing reliable components (Bitcoin blockchain). I believe Wall Street is looking more into wholesale trading and settlements. Blockchain technology is best suited for trustless P2P transactions where counterparties do not know or trust each other. I am not convinced interbank dealings fit well into that pattern.\n\nCT: Many traditional players have shown interest in blockchain tech while dismissing bitcoin the currency. Do you also share this view?\n\nRL: Bitcoin tends to carry some libertarian political, even semi-religious message. As a rationalist, I tend to believe this side is going to disappoint many followers. I view it more as a beginning of a new technological thinking and if it manages to reform and develop itself, it can have a bright future. As a currency, I do not find it very useful as of today.\n\n“Estonian authorities generally tend to interpret laws quite narrowly and Bitcoin does not fit well into that.”\n\nCT: Estonia is known to be a tech hub, producing such innovations as Skype, while being home to many BTC-accepting merchants. Do you think Estonia is on its way to becoming a hotbed for blockchain technology?\n\nRL: Unfortunately, Estonia is not particularly a Bitcoin-friendly country at the moment. Neither is Bitcoin particularly popular. You cannot compare us to Israel. Estonian authorities generally tend to interpret laws quite narrowly and Bitcoin does not fit well into that.\n\nBut 10 years ago, we had a similar attitude towards green energy and it has changed significantly since then. And Estonia continues to be generally supportive towards technology and innovation. And it likes to be a spokesperson in the EU on IT matters. We think we might have a chance.']"
06/19/2015,"['The Canadian Senate’s Banking, Trade and Commerce (BTC) committee released its final report Friday asking the federal government to use a “light touch” in dealing with digital currencies.\n\n“We’ve heard, and we agree, that blockchain technology is at a delicate stage in its development and use,"" the report reads. ""This is why we urge the Government to explore the vast potential of this technology, while treading carefully when contemplating regulations that may restrict and stifle its use and development.”\n\nThis is cause for relief among the country\'s Bitcoin community and makes Canada one of the world’s most forward-looking countries in encouraging innovation in new financial technologies.\n\nThe Bitcoin Community Reacts\n\nSenators praised the many witnesses from the Bitcoin community who came forward to testify calling them “passionate and optimistic.”\n\nWitness Victoria van Eyk, now head of community outreach for ChangeTip, was not surprised at the report’s recommendations.\n\n“The senators we talked to were very wary of more regulations and expressed concern about the effect of regulations on stifling innovation,” said van Eyk.\n\n“The committee made it clear to us that they wanted nothing to stand in the way of Canada becoming a world leader in developing new financial technologies.”\n\nVictoria van Eyk demonstrates a Bitcoin ATM for members of the Canadian Senate (Photo courtesy of the Senate of Canada)\n\n""The conclusions of the Senate Banking Report on digital currencies are extremely positive for all Canadians,"" Bitcoin community leader Anthony Di Iorio, President of Decentral Consulting and co-founder of the Ethereum Project told Bitcoin Magazine. ""Recommendations from the committee that the government explore the vast potential bitcoin and blockchain technology while cautioning against regulations that might hinder its growth and potential have the great opportunity to solidify Canada as a leader in the digital currency and cryptocurrency space.""\n\n“This will go down as a defining moment in the history of Bitcoin in Canada,” said Kyle Kemper, executive director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. “This report represents the most thorough and well-balanced study of a technology that stands to be as impactful as the Internet.”\n\nCanada’s Cautious Approach to Regulating Digital Currencies\n\nAs mentioned in an earlier Bitcoin Magazine article, Canada’s federal government has taken a cautious approach to regulating digital currencies, and was waiting to see what the Senate would recommend.Because it’s an election year, the government’s attention is elsewhere and the senators did not expect the government to respond until after the fall vote.\n\n“This is in line with Bill C-31… which would see \'dealers in digital currency\' regulated as money services businesses,"" Amber Scott founder and CEO of Outlier Solutions noted. ""This type of approach is intended to foster innovation while protecting both Canada and consumers from threats posed by money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activities. I\'m in full agreement that regulation must be balanced. The possibilities that are opened up by technology innovation are much more exciting than the risk.”\n\nExpert witnesses who appeared throughout the 18-month study included:\n\nAndreas Antonopoulos\n\nDigital Finance Institute\n\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation\n\nRipple Labs\n\nBitPay\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation of Canada\n\nThe Bitcoin Embassy\n\nAnd many more.\n\nOn June 22, 2015, staff from Decentral Consulting posted the Senate report - Digital Currency: You Can’t Flip This Coin! - to the blockchain with proof of existence posted on Reddit.com.\n\nThe full report can be accessed online here.', 'Elliptic, a Bitcoin analytics and security firm based out of London, announced \'The Bitcoin Big Bang\' on Thursday. The software is a Bitcoin \'transaction monitoring and compliance\' visualization that could identify in real time which Bitcoins are legal in a given jurisdiction.\n\nCoinTelegraph interviewed privacy researcher and security expert Kristov Atlas and market analyst Tone Vays to discuss their perspectives on privacy, price and compliance in relation to Elliptic\'s Bitcoin blockchain analytics.\n\nElliptic\'s team of PhD data scientists and engineers have been working to map the 35 GB blockchain in an attempt to identify major players in the Bitcoin economy. The main goal, according to the team, is to deliver a suite of AML (anti-money laundering) compliance products to companies operating under regulatory pressure, a technology that may bring relief to many in the financial industry.\n\nThe software has already identified major players — such as Mt.Gox, Silk Road variations, and many other players to whom Elliptic has granted pseudonymity — and exchanges that have, knowingly or not, enabled trades of Bitcoins that have flown through the Silk Road and other Dark Web markets for illegal goods.\n\nThis ability is believed to bring much peace of mind to large financial players who may be concerned about entering the Bitcoin market, or about regulatory uncertainty and risk of legal punishment. Elliptic\'s CEO James Smith said:\n\n""We have developed this technology not to incriminate nor to pry; but to support businesses’ anti-money laundering obligations. Compliance officers can finally have peace of mind, knowing that they have performed real, defensible diligence to ascertain that their bitcoin holdings are not derived from the proceeds of crime.”\n\nWhat About Privacy?\n\nThe consequences of such a technology are vast and certainly controversial. The ability to do mass monitoring of Bitcoin transactions — and automatically alert companies, regulators and law enforcement as to which coins are associated with illegal goods — is basically the definition of surveillance. In this case, blockchain surveillance.\n\nThis means that bitcoins associated with illegal goods or services in this or that jurisdiction could be tagged and effectively branded “white bitcoin” or “black bitcoin.” White bitcoins would be accepted by merchants under AML regulatory pressure, while black bitcoins would be rejected and may possibly mark their users as suspects of illegal activity.\n\nThis could split the Bitcoin market in two, drying up the fungibility of bitcoins associated with illegal trade in a given jurisdiction. This also raises many questions, of course, about the security of Bitcoin users in such a world.\n\nAtlas, of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n""Elliptic just announced that they are doing what bitcoin privacy researchers have been warning about for years now. Put a couple computer scientists in a room, apply decades-old algorithms, and you get deep insight into the blockchain.""\n\nSuch teams include Chainalysis and Coinalytics.\n\nOne thing that is not clear is to what degree a particular bitcoin holding could be framed by bad actors. Say Pete wants to make Bob look bad on legal records, since they both compete in a given market. How hard would it be for Pete to find one of Bob\'s public addresses and set up a sale of fake illegal goods in the Dark Web, using Bob\'s public address? Or to bribe a Dark Web merchant to play along with the attack?\n\nSuch a cheap attack could smear Bob\'s credibility and add him to some suspect list.\n\nAlso, what about old bitcoins associated with illegal trade from years ago? A reddit user points out:\n\n“So....I have never done anything illegal with bitcoin; ever. I have purchased all of my bitcoins on Coinbase and then moved them to a cold storage wallet. That said, I have run those coins through mixing services before moving them to cold storage to protect my personal privacy. “So..in the future, when I want to use some of my cold storage funds, will it get flagged because I previously ran them through a mixer? Somehow maintaining my privacy marks me as a criminal and makes my bitcoins lose their fungibility?”\n\nThis is an important effect of blockchain surveillance to consider: How many degrees of association with illegal trade would be required for a given bitcoin to be considered “black” or “white”?\n\nTo what degree individual users will be able to keep their privacy intact with the use of HD hierarchical wallets, or other security practices, is unclear and depends on the tools used to build associations on Bitcoin transactions.\n\nBlockchain Surveillance and Price\n\nVays explained his view of what such a surveillance capability could look like in the years to come. He said, “Several things will happen. Wallets would have to pick a side: ""Do you want to track or not?”\n\nNot only wallets, however. Depending on how regulators react, merchants may have to apply AML as well, based on similar technology.\n\n“This situation might actually be good for Bitcoin\'s price,” Vays added, “as it will bring in billions of legit fiat currency into Bitcoin, if they know for a fact it will be tradable and legal.”\n\nResearch suggests that black markets are an US$10 trillion dollar international economy, bigger than any super power. Foreign Policy reported:\n\n“In 2009, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a think tank sponsored by the governments of 30 of the most powerful capitalist countries and dedicated to promoting free-market institutions, concluded that half the workers of the world — close to 1.8 billion people — were working in System D: off the books, in jobs that were neither registered nor regulated, getting paid in cash, and, most often, avoiding income taxes.”\n\n“Hence my view,” says Vays, “that if bitcoin becomes legal and controlled, there will be an anoncoin that will rise to the top and be 30 to 40% of Bitcoin market cap, and many useless jobs in the government will be added to endlessly fight against it.""\n\n“If they somehow succeed and break the popular anoncoin, it will spawn more anoncoins for a while, just like there were Kaza, Limewire, Bareshare, etc. after Napster went under.”\n\nAs far as the effects on Bitcoin\'s price, Vays points out:\n\n“When Silk Road closed down, bitcoin fell 30% that day, then over the next two weeks in doubled in price and took off. … The price of bitcoin will rise dramatically once its legal or illegal future is clear. “The biggest thing setting bitcoin and altcoins back is questions about Bitcoin\'s future. So everything hinges on whether bitcoin will be criminalized like alcohol in the 20s, drugs in the 70s, privacy in the 00s.”\n\nPutting emphasis on how important this move is for the cryptocurrency markets, Tom Robinson, Elliptic\'s cofounder, told Business Insider that the tool could be a ""game changer for the institutionalization of bitcoin.""', 'Bitcoin startup Case Wallet Inc. has raised $1.5 million in a latest seed funding round led by FuturePerfect Ventures, RRE Ventures, High Line Venture Partners and the Rochester Institute of Technology Fund.\n\nThe New York-based company meanwhile is close to completing the shipment of the 1,000 units of its credit-card-sized Bitcoin hardware wallet. Launched in 2014, the product has garnered enough fascination for featuring the biometric, and the gradually emerging multisignature technology.\n\nHowever with the new fund round, Case is reportedly looking to leap over its pragmatic consumer market to further hunt widespread adoption among the major financial sharks. In the company’s latest press release, CEO Melanie Shapiro described the potential role of Case Bitcoin wallets in assisting Nasdaq’s plans to experiment with the blockchain.\n\n“Case is poised to provide trusted, decentralized and biometrically secure signing of those and similar transactions,” she stated. “We’re looking forward to providing uncompromised security and ease-of-use for bitcoin buyers, sellers and users, to unlock the potential of bitcoin and blockchain technologies.”\n\nBy combing the two distinctive technologies into one another, the Case Wallet has indeed brought a viable alternative to the Bitcoin wallet user base, a majority of which still lives under the fear of being either hacked or losing their coins to system errors. Unlike online wallets, Case tends to identify a user through an in-built fingerprint scanner which, if matched, allows him to send Bitcoin using a multisignature authentication protocol.\n\nJalak Jobanputra, founding partner of Future\\Perfect Ventures, further recognized the potential of Case wallets among the individuals and enterprises, saying that they are thrilled to be a part of such a “leading edge technology.”\n\n“We look forward to working with Case’s world-class team to drive adoption of digital transactions and provide broader, more efficient access to financial services for the global market,” he added.', 'Like other serious crypto-anarchist visionaries, the 21-year-old Russian Canadian entrepreneur Vitalik Buterin sees the blockchain—the public ledger underlying bitcoin—as a way to liberate us all from inefficiency, cut out the middleman, and make big government and business bow at the free market’s feet. What makes his vision different is its scope. Where bitcoin aims to disrupt banks, Buterin’s Switzerland-based company, Ethereum, aims to become what he calls “the foundational platform for everything.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt the heart of this open-source software platform is a currency, Ether, named after the pre-relativity hypothesis to explain the propagation of light waves. Though it has yet to make a public release, Ethereum has already recruited a strong roster of programmers and last year raised $18.4 million, in the third most well-funded crowdfunding effort in history. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s founder Bitcoin’s blockchain model has been proposed as the backbone for a wide range of applications, from asset trading to real estate transactions, from escrow services to even a “national income distribution” system. What Ethereum proposes, in effect, is a global computer that could not only handle those transactions but also eventually emulate many of the functions of companies like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Amazon, and Kickstarter—but without the “inefficient” bureaucracies and the other intermediaries who take a slice of the pie. That is to say, companies that, once started, can run themselves. Imagine your favorite Internet business—but without the “inefficient” intermediaries who take a slice of the pie. That is to say: humans. If the blockchain is a giant ledger, Buterin’s goal—first articulated in a January 2014 article in Bitcoin Magazine, which he cofounded—is to build the army of robot accountants working on top—what are sometimes known as “smart contracts.” Nick Szabo, the cryptographer who is credited with coining that term and is speculated to have been involved in bitcoin’s creation, described blockchain-based autonomous organizations last December on his blog as armies of accountant robots: Instead of the cashier and ticket-ripper of the movie theater, the block chain consists of thousands of computers that can process digital tickets, money, and many other fiduciary objects in digital form. Think of thousands of robots wearing green eye shades, all checking each other’s accounting. Individually the robots (or their owners) are not very trustworthy, but collectively, coordinated by mathematics, they produce results of high reliability and security. Bitcoin as a whole is a step in that direction, but it’s only one application. Ethereum, on the other hand, is “Turing complete,” a system in which a program can be written to find an answer—or to execute a smart contract that can buy something, sell something, or do something. In aggregate, a group of smart contracts could run what is known in Ethereum-speak as a “decentralized autonomous organization” (DAO) or a “distributed autonomous corporation” (DAC)—in other words, a corporation distilled to its most basic tasks, and operated by little more than code and the logic of if this, then that.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAn overview of how the three components of the full Ethereum system work together. Alongside the blockchain, two additional protocols are being developed by the company: Swarm, to manage distributed file sharing, and Whisper, for messaging. For all of his bluster and dedication, however, Buterin—one of three co-founders of the project, and its most prominent spokesman—doesn’t project a Jobsian ego. Sometimes, he seems like the inverse of the Apple founder: Quiet, nerdy, and unequivocal in his belief that that ownership of large systems should be distributed across the web rather than consolidated under governments or corporations. While it overlaps with the popular libertarian philosophy of Silicon Valley, this decentralized ethos is also in some ways the diametric opposite of another Silicon Valley model: the startup economy, which must ultimately enrich its developers and investors more than its end users. Buterin’s crypto-utopia of cloud companies distributed across the global network is also a counterpoint to Washington, with its ossified bureaucracy, red tape, and taxes. A DAO or DAC, operated by servers around the world, would exist within no borders and, in theory, be very difficult to shut down. While some critics of Facebook and Uber have suggested they should be regulated more like public utilities, an Ethereum-based ride-sharing service or social network offers a parallel path, say its proponents–in theory, functioning more equitably than a standard corporation, taking in the fees necessary to maintain the network. Gavin Wood, an Ethereum co-founder and its chief technology officer, believes that the new digital bazaar could battle and eventually triumph over Silicon Valley’s old cathedral. As he wrote on the company’s blog in April, The idea of a rigid organisation or corporation will evaporate and left will be the true essence of human interaction patterns, policed only by openness and information-theoretic mathematics.. strict legality of the emergent behaviour will become increasingly less relevant as it becomes drastically pluralistic and unpoliceable with no entity, legal or otherwise, coordinating it or profiting from it. And if Ethereum fails, they insist, some future blockchain layer will accomplish the task. Working in parallel to Ethereum, but at a much more modest scale, has been the New Economy Movement (NEM). Like Ethereum, the Nemcoin developers don’t see it as a cryptocurrency but a vibrant decentralized ecosystem upon which any number of services and apps can be built. Elsewhere, Nxt and Mastercoin are attempting to map out some of the same decentralized app building and smart contract services as Ethereum is. I know this answer sounds rather dismissive, but it’s like asking if, during the development of the aeroplane, there was something else similar. But Ethereum’s supporters say that no other project has innovated on the blockchain the way that it has. “There is only Ethereum and projects that have forked Ethereum,” Aeron Buchanan, an Ethereum developer, told me in an email. “Ethereum is the trailblazer. That’s why it’s exciting. Bitcoin introduced the blockchain, which was a huge step forward technologically, but the functionality of bitcoin is almost as basic as it could be on the landscape of possibilities: zero-sum account balances. Ethereum opens up the blockchain to endless possible functionality.”\n\nadvertisement\n\n“I know this answer sounds rather dismissive,” he added, “but it’s like asking if, during the development of the aeroplane, there was something else similar. Well, Otto Lilienthal’s gliders were an inspirational basis for the Wright brothers’ powered flying machines, but does it help to say that Lawrence Hargrave was flying kites at around the same time?” How To Build A Robo Ride Company What, exactly, would you need to build a blockchain-based Uber or Lyft? I asked Buterin to join my thought experiment. According to him, a ride-service app must satisfy four basic functions. First, it must allow passengers to publish ride requests. Then it must feature a driver mechanism that filters these requests for those nearest them or along their route. Finally, it must feature payment and rating systems. When someone in Chicago makes a better matching engine, decentralized Uber switches over and doesn’t miss a beat. An Ethereum-based transportation company would not perform all of these tasks. One developer might create the interface, another the payment system, while another designs the GPS system. Through smart contracts between user and developers, each of these programs would be building toward a whole that could be far cheaper than existing “ride-sharing” services. “Long-term, there’s no reason all of these tasks need to be carried out by one company,” says Ben Doernberg, a bitcoin expert and \u200eresearch assistant at Harvard University’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society. “A designer in Brazil can build a lovely mobile app that sends your ride request to a matching engine based in San Francisco that pulls trust ratings from a blockchain-based decentralized identity system. When someone in Chicago makes a better matching engine, decentralized Uber switches over and doesn’t miss a beat.” When a driver is looking for a passenger, the driver’s client software could propose a cost function, like “prefer rides that start closest to me,” which in Buterin’s eyes would be an “efficiently computable math formula.” At that point, “the driver publishes a smart contract onto the blockchain which can automatically evaluate ride requests submitted to it, and after N seconds automatically pays a bounty of $0.10 to whoever provides the most favorable ride or set of rides,” says Buterin. Once the driver’s contract receives the most favorable set of rides and the bounty is paid, the contract deletes itself, and the information is passed along to the driver. Any or all of this computation could be outsourced for efficiency. In the decentralized Uber example, he said, there would exist a “completely open-access industry” composed of “specialized decentralized Uber cloud computing nodes.” Their sole purpose would be to look for contracts with search algorithms that determine which rides maximize the score with each other, and submit them. And Buterin says that in this system anyone could immediately start participating.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe payment system could be bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency. “The rating system would probably be best done as a decentralized publishing platform like Whisper,” Buterin said, referring to Ethereum’s distributed messaging protocol. “[B]ut maybe with a few nodes trusted by default, where those nodes provide functions like criminal background checks, etc. From there, the whole process is basically just as it was before, but without the middlemen.” (As for the rides themselves, Uber is already taking care of that, according to reports: The company has opened a robotics lab in Pittsburgh, reportedly with the aim of building self-driving vehicles.) In this “partial” example of a DAO, said Buterin, Ethereum basically provides the software and an IT department in a decentralized fashion. Drivers directly pay for the results, allowing individual end users or groups of people to come together as a community to satisfy “the mechanism’s needs.” As fantastical as it sounds, something like this already exists. La’Zooz, a startup based in Israel, has built what it says is the first decentralized ride-sharing application atop Bitcoin’s blockchain. Similar to Buterin’s vision for an Ethereum competitor to Uber, the end users own it. They can also earn Zooz cryptocurrency by contributing to improve La’Zooz’s ecosystem. The difference between La’Zooz’s blockchain app, and a theoretical Ethereum-based one is that the former is run by three cofounders, while the latter wouldn’t need any humans at all. In theory, at least. For a customer or developer to transact in an Uber or Airbnb killer, a transaction on Ethereum would have to run through all of the ecosystem’s nodes. Another way of putting it is that the transaction will have to be processed by all of Ethereum’s users, adding up to a very slow computer, one that’s only as fast as its slowest node. The slowness and inefficiency of the blockchain will be a primary challenge for Ethereum’s app developers, says Doernberg. Ethereum isn’t the only company to be thinking about turning the blockchain into a powerful, valuable platform for building global computers. Tech investor Marc Andressen has described the blockchain as an ideal medium of exchange for machines that need to talk to each other, and his firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has announced plans to invest “hundreds of millions” of dollars in bitcoin-related startups. Last year, Nick Szabo worked for Mirror, a bitcoin startup based in Palo Alto, and helped orient the company toward exploiting the blockchain for self-executing financial transactions. Ethereum’s founders Vitalik Buterin, Jeffrey Wilcke, and Gavin Wood Not All Humans Are In Agreement Here There is a whiff of sci-fi dystopia to all of this. Could a robotic or algorithmic corporation, completely decentralized, become a real-life capitalist Skynet? Should, someday, a network of computers come to control 51% of the Ethereum blockchain, could it override the human element in the network, and wreak havoc on securities, financial markets, home appliances, and infrastructure? Probably not, given the inherent slowness of blockchain technology, and the fact that a DAO still requires humans to develop its various Voltron-esque parts. And, after all, DAOs are not sentient but narrow-AI autonomous agents executing very specific tasks.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEmin Gün Sirer, a Cornell professor and systems builder highly active in the cryptocurrency community, has more practical concerns. He said that while blockchain enthusiasts are eager to see a Uber and Airbnb middlemen cut out, he’s not so sure there is demand for it. For him, there is no technological reason why an Uber or Airbnb would benefit from being built on an Ethereum-like blockhain. He also believes the highly rational, deregulated approach wouldn’t necessarily be good for users. “It turns out you can build some portion of these applications peer-to-peer, but often people misunderstand what these centralized services [Uber, Airbnb] really do behind the scenes,” Sirer says. “To a naive observer it looks like Uber and Airbnb are just about matching people; [but] they’re all about doing that security check, that incredible vetting [of drivers and sublessors or landlords], and it’s all about having that presence and identity.” I find these arguments that Ethereum and its descendants will somehow solve this just incredibly naive. “Vitalik and others will say, ‘Oh, there will be these services that vet drivers for you and they will compete for legitimacy, and we will pay these third-party services, and if there is a third-party service that isn’t doing its job, well, the invisible hand will correct them,” Sirer says. “But, if you think about it, no, that is not how things work in the real world, because what we’re talking about here is life and death and rape. This is not something I want to trust to market forces.” “I find these arguments that Ethereum and its descendants will somehow solve this just incredibly naive,” he added. Still, Sirer believes that more simpler smart contracts are the prime candidate for an Ethereum-type application—cryptographic clearinghouses for private transactions in which people decide to follow a set of defined rules. “Computer games would be a catchy, cool, and killer application. Financial derivatives would be a fine thing to do [on Ethereum], too. Also, future contracts where a farmer wants to hedge against a harsh winter that might effect crops. Those kinds of contracts I understand.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt CES in January, IBM and Samsung announced another practical purpose for Ethereum: simpler, crude, repetitive tasks in the so-called Internet of things, like monitoring the temperature or turning lightbulbs on and off. Under a project called ADEPT, or Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry, Ethereum wouldn’t just serve as a global computer: with connected devices around the world contributing to the global network—and mining Ether in the process—they’d be generating money, and “revenue-generating opportunities in their own right,” IBM researcher Veena Pureswaran told Fast Company last month. Under an Ether-backed Internet of things, perhaps, home appliances wouldn’t be sold but freely leased to consumers, subsidized partly by the minting of Ether. “The reason that they need this stuff is that they don’t want to pay,” Stephan Tual, Ethereum’s chief communications officer, said about the IBM-Samsung project. “It’s not altruism. They don’t want to pay for its maintenance.” Rick Dudley, an IT consultant who is trying to develop games for blockchains and has been digging into the Ethereum source code, believes it will make sense to launch blockchain-based competitors to platforms like Uber and Airbnb, but is measured in his expectations about the time frame. “I think the Ethereum community, which as far as I can tell is by far the furthest along [among various virtual currency projects] has a long way to go before they will provide an obvious benefit to existing organizations in those spaces,” he said. While Dudley says he sees “huge demand” for Ethereum-like services in industries like online gaming, he sees less of a need for the blockchain in other realms, like providing Internet service. “I am more skeptical of its value in the case of more physical things.” Before we can see Uber or Lyft competitors, Dudley said users will have to wait for more of the OS-level surface to be exposed. This won’t happen overnight. “It will take a lot of work to get to that point from where we are today or what is even being discussed in depth. $15 million is nowhere near enough.” Next, Dudley hopes “userland tools” will emerge that allow for development and deployment by anyone experienced with contemporary web development. In Ethereum’s ecosystem, the currency is Ether, and one’s Ether wallet is also a browser, which will function as one of many web interfaces, or portals, into Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement', ""While several global headlines have declared that millennials are increasingly disinterested in banks, the owners of BTC.sx exchange have launched Magnr, “the first savings account for Bitcoin.” They promise a 2.18 % return over the first six months of a deposit, and claim that all depositors will be able to audit their individual holdings on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n“One key difference from traditional processes is that we maintain all transactions on the blockchain such that all our clients have full transparency over their wallets. This provides auditability and accountability that no traditional institution has offered before.”\n\nWondering just how bank-like Magnr intended to be, CoinTelegraph interviewed Josh Blatchford, CMO of Magnr.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Do you lend out the money that clients put on deposit with you — i.e., do you practice fractional reserve lending?\n\nJosh Blatchford: Currently, no deposits are being lent out. Our trading platform, BTC.sx, operates with its own internal funds and the launch of Magnr does not change this. However, in the near future, a small proportion of client funds will be used for leveraged trades on our trading platform.\n\nWe have carefully modeled these risks and calculated a return that we can guarantee to our clients, ensuring a sustainable business model.\n\nCT: How are depositors able to earn a 2.18% return if Magnr does not loan out their deposits at interest? Are you just banking on a price increase of Bitcoin?\n\nJB: We operate under a money management business structure. By depositing funds with Magnr, you are entrusting us to safely manage your bitcoin. Our business model has been structured so that for every one bitcoin deposited, one bitcoin will be available for withdrawal.\n\nWe have reviewed our risks and our business model and calculated a guaranteed return of 2.18%. Following this six-month promotional rate, we will review this model again and determine what interest rate will be applicable. This process will be iterated every cycle, thus ensuring the appropriate level of returns to our clients.\n\nOur revenue is denominated in bitcoin. Therefore we do not have an exchange rate risk between BTC.sx and Magnr. We receive bitcoin income and then pay out bitcoin interest. Therefore we are not banking on the price increasing.\n\nCT: How are you different from a bank?\n\nJB: Traditional financial institutions operate by utilising assets that they manage either by lending, or investing in other asset classes that generate higher returns from which they can pass on to their clients. We operate a similar model, however in the cryptocurrency space. This is currently not possible in traditional markets.\n\nOne key difference from traditional processes is that we maintain all transactions on the blockchain such that all our clients have full transparency over their wallets. This provides auditability and accountability that no traditional institution has offered before.\n\nThe first use of the funds is in our existing and well-established trading platform (BTC.sx), where traders use leverage to invest. Currently, we have ample assets to cover any leverage. As the market grows, we may lean upon these other assets to provide additional leverage. However, these assets will always be maintained in a highly liquid state to ensure we can honor our client requirements.\n\nCT: If a user wants to withdraw her funds, does she get back the BTC amount she deposited plus interest, or the dollar amount she deposited plus interest?\n\nJB: We are a bitcoin-only company. If a user withdraws their funds, they receive the BTC amount they deposited plus interest.\n\nCT: What kind of security do you use to ensure that your depositors' private keys are not hacked?\n\nJB: The safety of client funds is our top priority. We use cold storage, transaction audits and BitGo multisig technology to keep deposits secure. We securely manage private keys offline, on behalf of our users.\n\nCT: Will you offer any other traditional banking products, like direct-spend platforms? Or are consumers' funds locked for the time of deposit?\n\nJB: We are considering the possibility of providing further traditional banking products. Customer funds are not locked away, but withdrawals are processed manually once a day for security purposes. Magnr savings accounts should not be considered as a wallet. We are considering providing two account tiers, one of which would lock away deposits in return for a higher interest rate."", 'Unless you ignore news reports, you’d know that Greece is in a spot of bother at the moment, and may default on its sovereign debt.\n\nQuite a few sites have suggested that Bitcoin could, or should be the next currency of Greece should it be thrown out of the Euro area.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the so-called “Plan B” Bitcoin solution for Greece.\n\nWhat’s happening now\n\nThe shortest way to describe what’s going on with Greece at the moment is to simply say that the Greek Government ran up the proverbial Government credit card in the form of excessive state debt, and are now unable to repay it.\n\nLike many socialist-oriented Governments in South Europe, Greece loves paying people to not work and throws money around like there’s no tomorrow, but the problem is tomorrow just arrived.\n\nThe immediate crisis is related to a €1.6 billion ($1.81 billion) loan due to be repaid by the end of June to the International Monetary Fund (IMF.) This isn’t the first time Greece has been in this position, but European Union partners such as Germany are becoming tired of bailing Greece out in these situations without them fundamentally reforming their economy, including specifically cutting payments made under their massive, unsustainable (they keep borrowing money to pay for it) welfare system.\n\nAt the time of writing there’s a crisis meeting due Monday afternoon GMT between European leaders to address the situation after Greece once again this week failed to compromise; in context, the current Greek Government was elected on an anti-austerity platform (no cuts) because the Greek people have this magical idea that they should be given free reign to spend money that doesn’t belong to them, and never repay it.\n\nHow is Bitcoin involved?\n\nIn the event that Greece defaults on its debts, it will be looking for a new currency in short shrift. This could come about in two ways: they are literally chucked out of the Eurozone by other Eurozone members, meaning they will no longer be able to print Euros (each European country has the ability within the overall framework to print or mint an allocated amount of currency,) or the other option is that Greece will simply by itself withdraw from the Eurozone.\n\nBitcoin has been suggested as a replacement currency for the country, and the idea isn’t helped by an April Fools Day joke by the publication Greekreporter claiming that the Government of Greece have said that they would do just that.\n\nThere is also some anecdotal evidence of Bitcoin growing in popularity in Greece as the crisis deepens.\n\nIn the event of a default, it is highly likely that Greek Government will suspend withdrawals from banks, or at the very least highly restrict them to stop capital outflows from the country.\n\nAlready this week, in advance of a default and restrictions of withdrawals, some €2 billion was withdrawn from Greek banks between Monday and Wednesday alone out of a total household and corporate deposits of €133.6-billion euros held by Greek banks as of end-April.\n\nBitcoin does provide a way for Greeks to invest that withdrawn money in an alternative financial system that is beyond the control of their Government, and, therefore, can’t be seized or controlled, and given Bitcoin is up 11 percent in June the suggestion is that at least some Greeks are doing just that.\n\nCould Bitcoin become the currency of Greece?\n\nIf you believe the hardcore of Bitcoin supporters, not just in the media and on forums such as Reddit’s r/Bitcoin, the answer is yes.\n\nBut despite the dream, at the time of writing it’s highly unlikely, primarily as the Greek Government is on the record as saying they won’t.\n\nVia Metro:\n\nIn fact, the finance minister of Greece, Yanis Varoufakis, agrees that because it is deflationary, Bitcoin would be bad for Greece. He then goes on to say that Bitcoin is a flawed currency because it is deflationary. This misses the point. Bitcoin is a global currency (or more correctly a ‘value-transfer’ system) for anyone and everyone and not a currency designed for use by a government.\n\nThe shortest version is that without Central Government control, the Greek Government couldn’t control monetary policy (that is both supply and interest rates on supply) if Bitcoin was the official currency in the same way that it can’t control the Euro (but could with its own currency,) and hence Bitcoin could cause rapid deflation within the Greek economy.\n\nBitcoin as a secondary currency in Greece\n\nThere is, however, a strong chance that Bitcoin could take the mantle of an unofficial secondary currency in Greece.\n\nIn the event of a Eurozone exit Greece will likely revert to the Drachma (its pre-Euro currency) and given its track record with finances it could in all likelihood follow in the steps of Germany’s Weimar Republic in the 1920’s, or more recently Zimbabwe, and print money to pay its citizens who are suckling off the public welfare teat.\n\nPotentially, and this is sadly no exaggeration, one of the main cradles of modern civilization could become apocalyptic, financially, in the space of a few years.\n\nCountries with collapsed economies traditionally go one of two ways when it comes to the exchange of goods: bartering, or the use of a secondary currency.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin is decentralized and not beholden to any Central Bank or the policies of another country, it does sit well positioned to take some, if not a substantive role in a floundering Greek economy.\n\nWe don’t normally give investment advice at SiliconANGLE but if you were betting on Bitcoin rising further off the back of the clusterf**k that is Greece, it would seem to be a fairly appealing investment.\n\nImage credit: Creative-om/Reddit', 'As Bitcoin grows in popularity, the number of transactions that are recorded in each 10-minute block on the blockchain, are increasing rapidly. Every now and then the one-megabyte limit on blocks is reached, which can create slower transactions that have to wait for the next block in order to be recorded.\n\nSatoshi set this block size limit at one megabyte knowing that it would need to be raised one day, and even told the other coders how to implement the upgrade. Today\'s developers are convinced that the time has come to finally do so, and the topic is constantly being talked about by head developers like Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, and Jeff Garzik.\n\nGarzik\'s solution to the problem, known as BIP100, (the 100th official Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) calls for a floating block limit size that could be anywhere above one megabyte and below 32 megabytes. Unneeded complication is generally blamed for that proposal not gaining acceptance, but it is considered high up on the short list of contenders for a solution.\n\nA more popular plan has been presented and discussed constantly since early May of this year by Gavin Andresen. Through dozens of blog and Reddit posts, he has been building a case for raising the block size to 20 megabytes, and he made many good arguments for that case. The trade-off, however, is that miners with more bandwidth restrictions may find it harder to compete for each larger block.\n\nChinese miners, in particular, have been worried about larger block sizes for a while, and the issue finally came to a head early this week. Given the fact that Chinese mining pools currently make up more than half of the overall hashing power of the bitcoin network, they have an extremely powerful voice in this discussion and perhaps even the power to dictate the terms of such matters if they unite and put their foot down.\n\nOn 11 June, it appears they did exactly that. A consortium of the five largest Chinese mining pools, including F2pool, BW, BTCChina, Huobi, and Antpool got together in Beijing and have published an agreement about how they want Bitcoin mining to strengthen, including a call for an 8 megabyte block size limit.\n\n- Chinese mining pool consortium\n\nThe consortium listed three arguments against Andresen\'s proposal to raise the block size limit to 20 megabytes:\n\n- Chinese mining pool consortium\n\nThey go on to state that 8 megabytes would be a good trade-off although they admit that in time it may still need to be raised further.\n\nAbout the same time they released this document, they were also in contact with Andresen and seem to have convinced him to change his call for 20-megabyte blocks down to the 8 megabytes they have requested. Gavin has already stated that he is ""happy to tweak the parameters"" and is now stress-testing an 8-megabyte block size limit that doubles every two years, so 16MB in 2018. This is subject to change if ""there is a soft fork before then because 16MB could be too much"".\n\nIn order to implement the new block size limit, bitcoin developers like Andresen will be testing it for the rest of the year and then sometime after March of next year which will result in a “hard fork” of the Bitcoin blockchain in accordance to upgrading the blocks.\n\nA hard fork is a coder\'s term to express a change in the protocol that is not backwards-compatible. It is generally always considered risky and requires all users to upgrade to a new version of the protocol or their application will no longer work as planned.\n\nHard forking the Bitcoin blockchain sounds quite scary, but it has been done before, and successfully, under emergency conditions. In March 2013 a version upgrade of the core bitcoin wallet was rolled out with some broken code in it, resulting in a broken bitcoin blockchain for the afternoon... But within a few hours the Bitcoin developer community rolled out a fix and Bitcoin was fixed just as quickly as it was broken. With a year to plan for Andresen\'s proposed hard fork, few people expect any complications and no transaction data should be lost at all.\n\n- Andresen\n\nRegardless of the number of megabytes that the Bitcoin block limit upgrades to next year, the current structure of limited block sizes will continue to constrain Bitcoin\'s on-blockchain transaction speeds to those smaller than needed. To scale up to that level of commerce, more improvements to the Bitcoin protocol will be needed, such as sidechains or the lightning network. Thankfully, few developers feel that it is an unobtainable goal in the long run.', 'After months in seclusion, the price of bitcoin once again emerged as the breakout tabloid star of this week\'s news cycle.\n\nSpurred by a sudden spike in trading activity on 16th June, the media quickly correlated the surge to Greece\'s increasingly possible exit from the European Union (nicknamed the \'Grexit\').\n\nThough real evidence to suggest bitcoin is becoming a tool for Greek citizens amidst monetary uncertainty is scarce, the coverage nonetheless succeeded at overshadowing other developments in the industry, both positive and negative.\n\nA \'Grexit\' price pump\n\nTo understand Greece\'s role in this week\'s news cycle, one has to look back to the 2013 Cypriot financial crisis and its impact on drawing attention to the then-unknown technology.\n\nUnsurprisingly given the media frenzy around another economic crisis, the media pounced on the chance to speculate on the effects of Greece\'s precarious financial situation on the digital currency\'s value.\n\nFor example, CNBC highlighted bitcoin\'s decentralised nature and its potential to circumvent possible capital controls imposed by the Greek government in a piece titled ""Bitcoin: Is it really ripe for a Greek rally?""\n\nDespite providing various opinions from bitcoin and non-bitcoin advocates, writer Matt Clinch used the instance to highlight the rising interest in bitcoin as a technology rather than an asset class.\n\nClinch wrote:\n\n""Not everyone is convinced by bitcoin\'s value, however, with venture capitalists telling CNBC that there is little worth in the digital currency beyond the technology that supports it.""\n\nIn his article, Clinch quoted Rob Moffat, principal venture capitalist at Balderton Capital, who said ""the digital currency had passed the peak of expectations,"" adding ""people had become more skeptical towards it"".\n\nThe report comes just as bitcoin venture capital investment is inching towards $1bn.\n\nIn the Financial Post, John Shmuel also picked up on the trend, though others from Nasdaq to SiliconAngle would quickly follow.\n\n""Grexit fears may be taking a toll on stock and bond prices this month, but it has been a boom for virtual currency bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk\'s bitcoin price index, the digital currency rose to $257 earlier this week. While this increase is observable, more contentious is whether the increase represents Greek investors withdrawing their savings from banks, in fear of the effects of a possible default.\n\nCoinDesk examined the issue in a separate report, finding little evidence of any increase in Greek visitors to major European exchanges.\n\nStill, this didn\'t stop journalist Michael Parsons from asking if bitcoin should become the new currency of Greece. Writing for The Metro, he ultimately concluded that it would be too risky a move:\n\n""Monetary police, used responsibly, is useful to manage public finances, provided it is not abused to issue too much currency. Greece cannot itself use monetary policy whilst it is part of the eurozone and adopting bitcoin would put Greece in exactly the same position.""\n\nBitcoin-friendly prostitution\n\nElsewhere, bitcoin seems to be enjoying increasing adoption in the seedier parts of global economies.\n\nThe digital currency allows you to buy drugs online – and other illicit activities which we\'ve documented as part of this weekly series – but did you know that the digital currency – like cash before it – is also being used to fund prostitution?\n\nWriting for Ozy, Jose Fermoso began his piece by highlighting just how versatile bitcoin is.\n\n""Bitcoin. Is there anything it can\'t be used for? Six years after its release, the digital currency has crept into the nether-regions of the global economy – the multibillion-dollar sex industry. Bitcoin is now a payment option at escort ad services like Backpage and Luxury Escorts International, while a small but growing number of independent escorts consider it a currency of choice.""\n\nAccording to Fermoso, their reasons vary.\n\nLiara Roux – her business name – said the author, has a ""long-nursed interest in cryptography"" which influenced her decision to accept payments in the digital currency from the onset. Another escort told Fermoso that she offered the possibility of being paid in bitcoin ""as a courtesy and for its international appeal.""\n\n""Bitcoin just makes good business sense,"" said Fermoso, adding ""It allows them [the escorts] to offer their clients something more widely coveted than all the fetish objects in the world: discretion. A lot more of it than cash or credit cards, anyway"".\n\nHe continued:\n\n""Bitcoin scatters information across the Web, transactions are effectively opaque, and so are the identities of the people making and receiving them. Accepting bitcoin allows escorts to broaden their client base much the way that accepting, say, MasterCard expands the client base of a bricks-and-mortar retailer.""\n\nWhile well intentioned, the above explanation doesn\'t capture the full picture.\n\nDespite being pseudonymous like email addresses, bitcoin wallets broadcast transactions on a publicly available, distributed ledger, a feature that recent law enforcement investigations show can be just as beneficial.\n\nBitcoin at the movies\n\nGreece and prostitution aside, the mainstream and local media went crazy this week, following the announcement that Dope would be the first film to accept bitcoin payments.\n\nThe promotion coincided with the news MovieTickets.com would broaden its bitcoin acceptance beyond the film, bringing the digital currency to all movies shown at more than 900 cinemas across the US.\n\nIt could be argued that the film producer\'s decision to accept bitcoin payments is part of wider marketing strategy, but this assumption also begs the question of how the actual film portrays the digital currency and whether it will serve to either splatter or clean up its reputation.\n\nIt wasn\'t long before Lauren Walker, a Newsweek writer connected bitcoin to illicit activity in the context of the movie. ""It [the film] offers an explanation of how bitcoin works that actually makes sense – a big part of the storyline involves the Dark Web.""\n\nSo there we have it, to understand bitcoin you have to know that it can be used to pay for illegal goods online.\n\nWalker was – unfortunately – not the only one to make the connection. The Washington Post also noted the way in which the cryptocurrency had been portrayed in the film.\n\nThe writer said:\n\n""Mr. Famuyiwa weaves new technology into his film deftly, with a dealer tracking Malcolm via the Find my iPhone app, a montage of YouTube videos and Vines chronicling Malcolm’s successful rise and, of course, the prominent role of the bitcoin. Malcolm uses bitcoins as an untraceable method of payment to sell his MDMA and his comfort with technology is the key to the hopeful ending of the movie.""\n\nIn an article for We Got This Covered,\n\n""Why go to an actual black market when you can just use bitcoins on the internet? The criminal underworld is evolving every day, and Famuyiwa, shows us how.""\n\nWhether it\'s being used to pay for prostitution or escorting services or it is the currency of choice for black market users, the digital currency seems to have been somewhat pigeon-holed by the media, who instead of offering a balanced view on its use cases, prefer to focus on the negative.\n\nThis week, at least, it seems bitcoin could do no right.\n\nImage credit: Newspaper image; mavkate/Shutterstock.com; S.Borisov / Shutterstock.com; Popcorn image\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

At the time of the loan, those bitcoins were worth about $10,000 (£6,300).\n\nThe borrower, Dennis Kerley, offered a 20 percent return to his lenders within a year. His plan was to use the money to buy bitcoin miners—obviously, it didn't work out. Kerley did not respond to Ars’ attempts to reach him on Thursday evening.\n\nAs he wrote at the time:\n\nThis BTCjam loan is for the purchase of one Bitmine 1 TH/s Desktop Miner and possibly one additional 400 Gh/s based on exchange rate manufactured in Sweden. These two rigs in Turbo mode will produce 2.1 Th/s This will be an great [sic] increase in my current mining capacity, (my current hardware earns ?0.56/week). This will guarantee profitability with the current high rates of complexity increase.\n\nWhen Kerley failed to repay the loan 90 days after it was due, de Souza used BTCJam’s arbitration process and was awarded 64.74 bitcoins.\n\nWhen those bitcoins were still not sent to him, de Souza contacted a US lawyer, who put him in touch with Kevin Palley, a Kentucky-based lawyer. Palley, in turn, filed suit against Kerley in March 2015, seeking either breach of contract or enforcement of the arbitration award.\n\n“That’s one of the dangers of lending money over the Internet,” Palley told Ars on Thursday evening.\n\nHe admitted that it would be difficult to collect the money from the Kentucky man.\n\n“Just because I get a judgement, it’s a piece of paper—I can try to put a lien on his house, take his car, but he has various homestead exemptions,” he added, citing a law in Kentucky and elsewhere that exists to protect homeowners with deceased spouses who owe money to creditors."", 'There have been several bitcoin business ideas setting up shop these days, and some have went on to expand their operations while others haven’t lasted for long. What’s the secret to starting a sustainable bitcoin business?\n\nIn the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York, bitcoin business owners and venture capitalists have provided some helpful tips on how to start a bitcoin business and make sure that it stays up and running.\n\nBitcoin Business Advice\n\n“The opportunity in bitcoin is so high,” said Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert. “I believe bitcoin has the potential to perform well in both good and bad times.”\n\n“I think everyone should pay close attention to what’s happening here,” said BitGive Foundation founder Connie Gallippi. “Why? Because I think it’s gonna change everything.”\n\nHowever, Silbert also notes that not everyone should set out to build a bitcoin business per se. He emphasizes that entrepreneurs should first evaluate what kind of tools they have in order to build that business idea. He pointed out that the financial industry, which spends billions of dollars for middlemen and intermediaries, offers a good potential for entrepreneurs to take out some of the market share.\n\nJonathan Chester of Bitwage adds that there could be a lot of disruption coming in the payments arena, as he mentioned that the last innovation introduced was that of credit cards. He recommended that entrepreneurs take a look at this potential explosion in innovation involving bitcoin payments.\n\nMeanwhile, Gallippi stressed the increased need for technical developers in the bitcoin business space. She added that there’s a lot of potential growth for the untapped unconventional roles in the bitcoin industry, such as that of charity or arts. BitGive Foundation has been involved with processing donations for various charitable institutions, ensuring that zero to no transaction costs are incurred and the funds are completely handed over to those in need.']"
06/20/2015,"[""But she says he was branded as a cyber-criminals by a legal system that rode roughshod over natural justice\n\nIn a revealing interview she described her 'gentle' son as an idylistic graduate with little money\n\nTo Lyn Ulbricht, her son was an idealistic graduate, a charity volunteer in shared digs who had so little money he didn’t even own a car.\n\nThirty-one-year-old Ross liked to spend time away from the trappings of the modern world, living for months at the family eco-tourism business in Costa Rica.\n\nBut to US prosecutors, Ross Ulbricht had a very different identity. To them, he was Dread Pirate Roberts, a criminal mastermind who created the notorious Silk Road website selling drugs and laundering money around the world using digital ‘bitcoins’ – a man so dangerous he had hired hitmen to kill rivals.\n\nThirty-one-year-old Ross Ulbright was jailed for life after he was accused of being Dread Pirate Roberts who ran the online black market site\n\nAnd the courts agreed. In a sensational judgment last month Ulbricht, still protesting his innocence, was sentenced to life in prison. He might never come out.\n\nToday, his mother is horrified, not just by the turn of events which has branded her yoga-loving son one of the greatest cyber-criminals the world has ever seen, but by a legal system that appears to have ridden roughshod over natural justice.\n\n‘Ross is gentle and peace-loving,’ says Mrs Ulbricht, 66. ‘He’d never given me more than a moment’s worry. Where were the millions he was supposed to have made? They even subpoenaed our bank accounts looking for it.’\n\nShe says she had never heard of the Silk Road until his arrest, but remembers that a few years earlier her son mentioned that he was inventing a video game.\n\nThe ordeal, she says, started five years ago when Ulbricht created a free ‘open market site’, a digital bazaar with buyers and sellers using encrypted identities and bitcoin virtual currency. He insisted the Silk Road was an experiment in free-market trade and his involvement ended as others took over the site.\n\nUlbricht had made his living from a bookshop near his family home in Austin, Texas, before moving to San Francisco to try currency-trading. Two weeks before his arrest, the family enjoyed a reunion.\n\nLyn Ulbricht, pictured with husband Kirk, is fighting for her son's freedom after he was convicted of being the Silk Road founder\n\nRoss Ulbricht was also accused of hiring an undercover FBI agent to kill two people although these charges were later dropped\n\nDrug kingpin or innocent founder? Ross Ulbricht confessed to starting the Silk Road website but says he did not make $18 million off of it - and instead handed off control month after the site's creation\n\n‘He didn’t mention a website and he was living as frugally as ever, wearing a pair of shoes I had bought him two years earlier,’ says Mrs Ulbricht.\n\n‘He’s never broken the law and if I had any worries as a mother, it was about his career. I hoped he’d use his science degrees and I thought maybe he should have a more sensible job. But he was self-supporting and well-adjusted.\n\n‘When he ran his book shop he gave away ten per cent of the profits to charity. He’s idealistic, a libertarian, and his passion is the free market. After his arrest, we talked about the Silk Road. He said it was a site like eBay, selling all sorts of things. He was 26 when he started it and the thing got out of hand.’\n\nFederal agents infiltrated the site, trying to find out the real identity of a drug kingpin calling himself Dread Pirate Roberts. From the few bits of evidence scattered around the internet, they homed in on Ulbricht.\n\nWeeks later, he was arrested as he worked on his laptop in a San Francisco library. He spent six weeks in solitary confinement before being shipped to Manhattan’s Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was placed alongside accused murderers, rapists and hook-handed Finsbury Park hate preacher Abu Hamza.\n\nSilk Road, park of the dark web, was an online black market, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs\n\nTime's up: The FBI has shut down Silk Road, an anonymous Internet marketplace for illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine and criminal activities such as murder for hire\n\nUlbricht was charged with seven counts of money laundering, computer hacking and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. Prosecutors also claimed he had paid £500,000 to hire hitmen to kill six business rivals.\n\nHis trial began at the start of January and to Mrs Ulbricht and his father Kirk, who watched from the public benches, it appeared one-sided. Their son’s lawyer Joshua Dratel, who represented Hamza last year, found himself constantly overruled by Judge Katherine Forrest.\n\nIt later transpired that two federal agents who had infiltrated the Silk Road had high-level access to the site and could have manipulated data and messages. They had been arrested for allegedly stealing funds from the site. Yet the judge ruled that there could be no mention of the agents or their arrests. The murder-for-hire charges were dropped, but prosecutors introduced them into evidence regardless.\n\nDefence claims that another man was the FBI’s main suspect and had set Ulbricht up a month before his arrest were also disallowed.\n\n‘All the evidence in favour of Ross was suppressed,’ says Mrs Ulbricht, shaking her head sadly. ‘We sat at the back of the court every day and Ross turned around during breaks in the proceedings to smile at us.\n\n‘Then he was barred from doing that – the jury wasn’t allowed to see that he had people there who loved and supported him.’\n\nStanding by his innocence: Supporters of Ross William Ulbricht hold signs during the jury selection for his trial outside of federal court in New York\n\nSupporters of Ross Ulbricht, the alleged creator and operator of the Silk Road underground market, protested his capture at Manhattan federal court house on the first day of jury selection for his trial\n\nAfter a month of evidence, the jury took just three-and-a-half hours to find Ulbricht guilty on all seven charges. Mrs Ulbricht says she is convinced the panel did not understand many of the cyber references, but claims expert witnesses paid for by the defence were barred from explaining the finer points of virtual currency and the hidden side of the internet known as the dark web.\n\nAfter telling Ulbricht that education and privilege did not make him above the law, Judge Forrest jailed him for life and ordered him to pay £115 million in restitution.\n\n‘This is effectively a death sentence,’ says Mrs Ulbricht. ‘The prosecution recommended 20 years but the judge went further. She swept aside the 100 letters of support for Ross and his own plea for leniency, saying he didn’t show enough remorse.’ Ulbricht’s lawyers launched an immediate appeal against the verdict and sentence, which, as his mother says, is longer than cult leader Charles Manson’s for ordering seven murders.\n\nMrs Ulbricht, who is living with relatives in Connecticut to be closer to her son, says legal costs have ‘ruined’ the family.\n\nShe says that despite his portrayal as a cyber-criminal, Ulbricht happily ditched technology while out in the wilderness."", 'Mere weeks after New York state\'s BitLicense requirements were said to be “in effect,” two Bitcoin mining pools have been forced to deny their services to New York IP addresses (one shutting down entirely), and one exchange has done the same.\n\nBTC Guild and Eobot are among Bitcoin\'s smaller mining pools — you know, the kind that have kept Bitcoin mining sort of “decentralized.” But BTC Guild has now shut down entirely, telling its members:\n\n“The fact that BTC Guild is not in New York does not matter, since it would be doing business with New York residents while they are physically in New York. This fact makes it possible for New York to attempt to claim jurisdiction to enforce regulations. Whether or not BTC Guild could win in defense of such an attempt is irrelevant, since the cost of defending the pool would be greater than any income the pool is expected to generate going forward.”\n\nSimilarly, Eobot explained to their members who use New York IP addresses that the mining pool could no longer afford to deal with them:\n\n“The new BitLicense requirements in this state place compliance and cost burdens upon Eobot that we believe are excessive.”\n\nLastly, after declaring a block of New York IPs, the online exchange ShapeShift.io cited that BitLicense is actually dangerous to consumers, gathering their personal data into “honeypots” to be hacked. ShapeShift\'s founder even started a website, PleaseProtectConsumers, which encourages companies to join him in refusing BitLicense compliance.\n\nHave Things Gone Terribly Wrong, or Precisely Right?\n\nBusiness licensing laws always hit the smaller guys first and hardest — but only if they\'re “aboveboard.” This means using banks, government IDs, and business licenses — being ""legally documented,” so to speak. While aboveboard businesses like Eobot and BTC Guild have been negatively affected by BitLicense, there will likely be a parallel effect: more businesses will go “below board” to the free — or black — market.\n\nDrug prohibition has provided the perfect example of this effect. There are no “Joe\'s Heroin Emporiums” or “LSD Quick Stops” to be seen, but that doesn\'t mean that there isn\'t vibrant drug trade happening in free markets.\n\nIf licensing laws aren\'t retracted entirely, digital currency-related businesses just may start doing the same. Aboveboard, regulation-compliant giants like Coinbase will become the new Big Pharma — that is, the legal drug dealers — and most others will go below-board to become the “illegal” street-level dealers.\n\nAnd according to some, the “below-board” economy is the only economy in the world that\'s even growing. And it\'s projected to eclipse the aboveboard economy within a decade or two.\n\nIt must be remembered: these business closures are the exact point of the BitLicense. State regulation of crypto businesses hasn\'t failed. It hasn\'t gone awry. It\'s working precisely as planned.\n\nIn a pay-to-play environment, only those willing to first pay tribute to the gods are allowed to compete in the open.

Share above and comment below.', '25 years ago, the Internet was just a gleam in some techies eyes, as a new age of technology was dawning. Many readers of this article will not remember an age before Facebook, Yahoo and Google, but yes, the Internet did exist without them. There was a time when there were no search engines, social networks, or even ESPN. Maybe you see the next 25 years being the Era of Bitcoin and its digital technology, taking the baton from the Internet and going to the next level?\n\nThe only problem is you need some funding for your Bitcoin innovation to take hold. Here are six things you can do to get that ball of creativity and entrepreneurship rolling.\n\n6 Things You Can Do To Fund Your New Bitcoin Project\n\nBootstrap The Project Yourself\n\nBootstrapping is literally pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and funding the project with your own funds, or through your sphere of influence. The founders of Pizza Hut borrowed $600 from their mom to open their first store in Wichita in 1958. Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken was a self-made man who took a recipe and turned it into a global franchise. There are countless other examples of people who worked an extra job, saved, hustled, and talked their way into advertising, promotion or creation of their vision. You know what they say, if you want something done right, do it yourself.\n\nThe problem with bootstrapping is it is usually the slowest way around the track to success, and our “microwave society” is more hare than tortoise. Another benefit of growing your Bitcoin fruit in your own backyard is no one can steal your idea because they are better funded or have a branded name or business. Slow and steady wins a lot of races, but patience is a virtue.\n\nIncubators\n\nAlso sometimes called “Start-Up Accelerators”, if you need some more speed in your game, and a boost could make all the difference, an incubator can be your ticket to ride. Companies like Seedcoin, Y Combinator (Disqus, Weebly, Reddit), and Techstars can help you in exchange for equity in your future business. Depending on the company and your needs they can help you in person or online. The upside is these companies are growing in number and funding with plenty of fresh venture capital hitting the Bitcoin investment market. A great time to make connections in this growing industry.\n\nCrowdfunding\n\nCrowdfunding is one of those trendy, hot words, but the major crowdfunding operations like Kickstarter or GoFundMe will kick you to the curb if you tell them this project is for digital currency. They view Bitcoin in their terms of use similarly to guns and pornography. If you want to go this route, you’ll need to take the road less traveled.\n\nCheck out Startcoin, the brainchild of RT’s Max Keiser (“The Keiser Report”). This is crowdfunding targeted directly at the digital currency community, so you can receive funds in Bitcoin, if you like. Get feedback on your idea from Bitcoin users even before you begin working in earnest. Be prepared to bear gifts to those who invest in you.\n\nAlso read: Wall Street Investment Firms Can’t Resist Bitcoin\n\nLoans\n\nMaybe you are one of the ten people left who hasn’t maxed out your credit card or that still has a 720+ FICO score. Instead of buying the latest tablet, video game player or rims for your car, maybe you can invest in a business that will change the bitcoin industry with your line of credit. Banks and credit unions won’t look kindly upon a direct bitcoin business investment, so don’t expect much help from the banking industry. The “pump and dumps” over the last 18 months have tarnished the Bitcoin name for many in the establishment. A small community bank or credit union may be more receptive, but you may need to be creative in your presentation, and avoid using the bitcoin brand up front. Like in established crowdfunding, you’ll get “the stink eye.” Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban says never take a loan out to start a business, but it is an option that might get you a few thousand fast. May be best as a last resort.\n\nVenture Capitalist\n\nCompanies like 21 Inc. know how lucrative having a venture capitalist, or a few, behind you can be. If you have a well-written business plan, a strong presentation, and a realistic plan to earn a profit within five years, this may get you more than one suitor. Investing in Bitcoin is the hip thing to do on Wall Street these days, and there are more venture capitalists in the Bitcoin space than ever before. Do some market research on potential competitors and have a few ways to generate a return, and a well-practiced presentation can really draw a crowd of investors.\n\nAngel Investor\n\nMaybe you don’t need millions, and your lyrics and plan aren’t as air-tight as the big money guys would like. Angel investors can fill the gap. They are usually well-heeled individuals who just may “take a shine to you” and your vision and get you the money you need for equity, or as a write-off, of sorts. They usually do not need the amount of documentation as a venture capitalists, but they don’t put up as much capital. Roger Ver is a legendary angel investor who has funded dozens of startups. Denver, Colorado, and the surrounding area is a known investing hotbed that has a high population of angels to seek out.\n\nUse this list as a reference to get your mind going in the right direction. If you are passionate, think through a realistic proposal, and can share in the profits, your idea should find the funds it needs to become a reality. If you don’t believe in your vision, no one else will. So move with a purpose and be ready to knock on every door until you find what you seek.\n\nIf you are serious, it’s a lot easier than you think to find someone who will back you up. There are plenty of people with money to invest but no vision. Fill that gap in the market today.\n\nWhat new business or app would you like to see in the Bitcoin space?

Parker was also posted in Sudan as a UN communications officer from 2003 to 2006 and was closely involved with raising the alarm about the war in the Darfur region.\n\nHaving worked in humanitarian affairs and on the ground in conflict zones for the last 20 years, Parker provides a unique perspective on how bitcoin could succeed where it\'s perhaps needed most – in struggling developing nations.\n\nParker told CoinDesk:\n\n""I\'ve seen how countries struggle when they don\'t have formal banking systems and I\'ve seen also the huge growth of the M-Pesa mobile money system in Kenya. Most recently, I was working in Somalia, which actually has been cut off from formal banking in many ways for 20 years.""\n\nSetting the scene\n\nSomalia provides an interesting case study for bitcoin.\n\nHaving been caught up in state of civil war – of varying intensity – since 1991, the East African nation was heavily hit by anti-money laundering (AML) regulation in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nTo add injury, in May 2013, Barclays, the last major bank to provide remittance services to the country, announced plans to shut down approximately 250 money transfer businesses.\n\nSomalis have been using Hawalas – an informal value transfer system run by brokers – to remit funds home, but they too came under scrutiny. In April this year, Kenya\'s government shut down 13 Somali money transfer businesses – or Hawalas – after the al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility for the attack on Garissa University which resulted in the deaths of approximately 150 people.\n\nAlthough the hawalas are still operating – with bank accounts in Dubai and Australia – it is fair to say that the Somali remittance market is suffering the consequences of lost relationships overseas, primarily in the UK and the US – both of which have relatively big Somali communities.\n\n""They [Somalis] have a huge diaspora community. They are very connected to home and send a lot of money in remittances [...] the remittance market is bigger than aid,"" Parker said.\n\nAccording to the UK government, remittances to Somalia are estimated at around $1.2bn a year, accounting for 50% of gross national income and supporting 40% of the country\'s population of approximately 10.5 million.\n\nDespite this, Parker said things were changing in Somalia.\n\n""The first MasterCard operation has just started there, with one of the commercial banks in Mogadishu,"" he noted, adding ""I think you could argue that the commercial banks have now seen that it [Somalia] is a frontier market that they need to play.""\n\nBitcoin in Somalia\n\nBut, is there room for bitcoin?\n\nIn Parker\'s opinion, the digital currency could co-exist with traditional banking, but Somalia, he thinks, should prioritise gaining legitimacy and re-instating formal banking relationships.\n\n""As someone who has tried to work for Somalia\'s stability, and looking at it more in a political way, and in an international image way, my argument is that Somalia does not need to be put in a special category. Just like anywhere else, assuming bitcoin doesn\'t go up in smoke, some kind of cryptocurrency will co-exist with traditional fiat and other mobile solutions.""\n\nLegitimacy, he said, is necessary because people often associate the country with war, famine and chaos. ""It\'s a huge stereotype.""\n\nHaving said this, Parker urged the relevant authorities to consider bitcoin regulation, noting how this should be a priority for developing countries where, perhaps, the digital currency is needed the most.\n\nHe went on to note that some of his colleagues, working on various UK-based remittance-focused projects had said that the digital currency\'s potential for remittances ""had not come up"" in discussions.\n\n""Does that mean that it [bitcoin] won\'t happen? Or does it mean it\'ll happen and then people will be scrambling for a policy response?""\n\nBitcoin vs mobile money\n\nFor bitcoin to really take off in Somalia, Parker said people would need to have access to modern mobile phones and these would have to reach wider adoption in rural areas.""Internet connectivity is not great, Internet penetration is not very high.""\n\nAs of December 2013, 1.5% of Somalia\'s population (156,420 people) used the Internet. According to 2012 data, the country\'s mobile penetration rate stood at 16.3%.\n\nSomalia represents an interesting contrast to neighbouring Kenya – where mobile penetration is alleged to have reached 80% – and mobile money system M-Pesa, powered by SMS technology, has achieved relatively impressive adoption. By 2012, approximately 17 million people had registered with M-Pesa in Kenya.\n\nThe System allows people who own a mobile phone, but do not have or have only limited access to a bank account, to send and receive money, top-up airtime and pay their bills.\n\n""There\'s one problem with M-Pesa"", said Parker, ""some would say that it has become a forceful quasi monopoly on the part of [moble network operator] Safaricom. If you want to send or receive money you need to be on Safaricom.""\n\nSpeaking about bitcoin\'s potential, Parker noted:\n\n""It\'s easy to make the jump and say, well, actually bitcoin achieves the same thing, with less friction, and less dependence on a particular mobile phone operator, and as far as I know, less transactional cost.""\n\n""Bitcoin is more frictionless, its cross-border and its not hooking you to a particular telephone company,"" he concluded.\n\nBitcoin in Syria\n\nUnlike Somalia, Parker said, Syria had a resilient banking infrastructure.\n\n""What was interesting about Syria was that the frontline was so fluid, the many public services continued to operate.""\n\nParker noted:\n\n""Is it [Syria] specially needy in terms of money transfers? I think yes [...] I assume now the banks are more or less closed, they weren\'t at the earlier stages of the conflict [...] in the case of Syria, the paranoia from donors about not sending money to the wrong people would make it unlikely that they would do any significant cash or cash equivalent inside Syria.""\n\nHe commented how there is a growing trend within the aid industry to send cash to those in need, rather than procuring other form of aid. Like bitcoin, cash presents a relative challenge to law enforcement agencies, who may be unable to trace the transferral of funds.\n\nThe fear of diversion of funds would make Syria a bad experiment [with bitcoin] at this point, said Parker. ""Is ISIL using bitcoin? I have no idea.""\n\nParker explained that in Somalia, Al-Shabaab, the extremist group, made all their money inside the country, by taxing people viciously.\n\n""Al-Shabaab would tax you at the checkpoint, tax business men, they would knock on the door of the shopkeeper and take the 10% and they\'d call it \'zakat\', which is charity, it wasn\'t charity, it\'s mafia racket.""\n\nHe also posed the argument that the terrorist group may have other avenues to raise cash. ""I don\'t think ISIL needs bitcoin,"" adding:\n\n""There are some scenarios, I think were cashless anonymous value is scary and dangerous and as I say, I think\'t that\'s law enforcement problem.""\n\nBlockchain for diamonds\n\nAlthough Parker said that the blockchain would warrant a completely different conversation, he also spoke about one of its most ""intriguing"" use cases; the traceability of diamonds and illegal exports from the African continent, specifically from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nOn the topic of blood diamonds – a term used to describe diamonds mined in war zones and sold to fund insurgent movements –, Parker said this was ""quite a hot issue in Botswana"".\n\nAlthough he claimed that he was not knowledgeable enough about blockchain technology, Parker outlined the distributed ledger\'s benefits for smart contracts:\n\n""I think if blockchain could be used for traceability that could be quite a good thing.""\n\nBen Parker is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York. Join him at the TimesCenter on 10th September.

Alex Batlin, who has been a vocal supporter of banks adopting Bitcoin related technologies, told attendees of the IDX Derivatives Expo in London that blockchain technologies will change banking.\n\n“Blockchain technologies can make banks more efficient – for example through instantaneous settlement rather than the days it takes at present, lower costs and lower operational risk,” according to Alex Batlin, chief technology officer for innovation at UBS.\n\nThe simple lesson for banks is that if we don’t do it someone else will. The key attraction is that there is no middle or back office, and no registry, so clearly a major impact on costs.\n\n“Utilising the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,” claims Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld. “Once you cut the apron strings of need for the physical, the opportunities we can envision blockchain providing stand to benefit not only our clients, but the broader global capital markets.”\n\n“All kinds of revenue opportunities can emerge, but it’s still more expensive, so there is a way to go,” said Batlin. Batlin in April tweeted in cryptography, “search for a challenge at UBS on the blockchain.”\n\nBatlin is not the first UBS executive to speak positively of Bitcoin. Oswald Gruebel was head of Credit Suisse for four years and took over at USB AG in 2009, resigning in 2011. As CCN reported:\n\nThe only investment that has been proven holds its value over a longer period, gold, and in the future (Bitcoins). Gold and Bitcoins production is limited. Not so with money. Central banks can print unlimited money and tell us today also very clear. It is for this reason not recoverable. You should not rely on The State itself. Maybe he paid you in the future is not what you imagine today. Everyone should take the initiative. When you create, you must find something that is limited and not increased arbitrarily.\n\nIn April, it was announced UBS would launch Open Blockchain Research Lab in London. In October 2014, Oliver Bussmann, group chief information officer at UBS, said the block chain had the potential “not only change the way we do payments but it will change the whole trading and settlement topic.” UBS concluded that the underlying Bitcoin technology could be used to improve global payment systems.\n\nSetting aside its political agenda, we see Bitcoin as having some potential as a new transaction technology, where a bitcoin-like technology could provide a basis for a new shared payments and transfer system using existing currencies and securities. Such a system could reduce systemic costs, and provide faster, secure, transfers – particularly in the international arena.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A new Bitcoin remittance service has started in Vietnam called Cash2vn. Created by Bitcoin Vietnam Co. Ltd , Vietnamese who have a verified bank account can send funds to contacts anywhere. The transaction is done for a flat fee of US$2, leveraging the use of cryptocurrency in order to “create real advantages for consumers and business.”\n\n“The lowest-hanging fruit here, despite very vivid competition in this market, is the remittance market, since one of Bitcoins core value propositions is the borderless nature of almost free monetary transactions.” — Dominik Weil, Co-Founder of Bitcoin Vietnam Co., Ltd\n\nThe team says it\'s dedicated to building the necessary foundations to bring access to the Bitcoin economy to the Vietnamese market. Bitcoin Vietnam recently also launched the country’s first live trading platform, VBTC. To continue their efforts, Co-founder Dominik Weil tells us the remittance service was the “first step” in defining Bitcoin’s “core value propositions” in the country.\n\nLaunched in March 2014, Bitcoin Vietnam has been introducing the digital currency to locals in the region ever since. Weil says residents have little faith in the Dong (VND) and “don\'t store their wealth in financial institutions.” This new remittance service aims to give Vietnamese trust in a decentralized currency over their fiat alternative.\n\nDominik discussed Cash2vn with CoinTelegraph to give our readers insight on the service and how they are using Bitcoin to teach Vietnamese financial independence.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Can you tell us a little about the new service Cash2vn?\n\nDominik Weil: After launching our broker exchange solution last year, which as a first step to build up the local Bitcoin ecosystem, it allows people to buy and sell Bitcoins against VND, which over time was improved to add several convenient functionalities (e.g., an integrated wallet into the platform or pre-loaded instant purchases). We are now focussing on building solutions by leveraging the advantages of Bitcoin technology. These solutions are creating use cases where people have a real advantage by using Bitcoin over the traditional way of doing things. The lowest-hanging fruit here, despite very vivid competition in this market, is the remittance market, since one of Bitcoins core value propositions is the borderless nature of almost free monetary transactions.\n\nCash2vn is therefore the logical first step in this direction and we are looking forward to provide other additional services, which are leveraging our existing business model in order to create real advantages for consumers and business inside Vietnam.\n\n""In Vietnam, around 80% of the population is still unbanked.”\n\nCT: Would you consider many in the region underbanked?\n\nDW: That is more or less the case for sure, even if the number of people who are using the legacy financial institutions is still growing on a yearly basis. Talking about Vietnam, around 80% of the population is still unbanked but you have of course a large gap between rural and metropolitan areas as well as intergenerational. The main target group of our existing Bitcoin exchange service (predominantly the well-educated, middle-class population living in the big cities as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang...) is usually in possession of personal bank accounts. Buying Bitcoins works already without the need for a bank account, since you can just make a cash deposit at any bank in the country.\n\nSince with the implementation of Cash2vn, our target group is expanding (the recipients may not necessarily need to know or care about Bitcoin, for them it just counts to receive cash quick and without paying too much fees), we are looking forward to implement additional cash-out possibilities over the coming weeks (e.g., cash-to-ID-withdrawals and cash delivery ). The current financial infrastructure in Vietnam is built to serve also the unbanked population, so there are quite a few options to plug our services into.\n\nCT: Are smart phones accessible for Vietnamese to use Bitcoin technology?\n\nDW: The current smartphone penetration is approximately 25%, covering basically our main target group of customers and rapidly expanding on a yearly basis. It may take another 5 to 10 years until Bitcoin is really an inseparable part of the average Nguyen\'s daily life, and we fully expect that until then the absolute majority of the Vietnamese population will be owner of a Smartphone. It is in Vietnam, by the way, much more common to surf the Internet with your smartphone or Tablet, than with traditional PCs or laptops.\n\n“The population of Vietnam is very entrepreneurial-minded — everybody is ‘hustling’ and trying to explore new ways in making and/or saving money.”\n\nCT: How do you see adoption going in Vietnam?\n\nDW: Right now, it is still early days in Vietnam. Bitcoin is at this stage far from being a ""mainstream product"" and the active local communities are still small in numbers. However everywhere we are speaking about Bitcoin, there is a lot of interest from the people. The population of Vietnam is very entrepreneurial minded, everybody is ""hustling"" and trying to explore new ways in making or saving money. Additionally, people here don\'t really trust the paper currency, and they also don\'t store their wealth in financial institutions. If they want to store wealth, they invest in gold or real estate. I found it much easier to talk to the people here about Bitcoin, than in my home country of Germany where people are far from being so open minded.\n\nCT: Can you explain your coalition with Rebittance?\n\nDW: Luis Buenaventura and his team did so far an awesome job in the Philippines, which can be an example for the rest of the region. In my opinion, the Philippines right now are the clear leader in South East Asia regarding their local Bitcoin ecosystem (if you leave out Singapore, which has quite a different socio-economical setup).\n\nRebittance is the newest product from the team, which basically serves as a central ""go-to-point"" if you are planning to do some international payments via Bitcoin — and we are happy to participate as Rebittance partners in Vietnam.\n\nCT: Do you think Vietnamese will see Bitcoin as a better method than traditional ways of transferring value?\n\nDW: Well, some Vietnamese people already do. The rest is mostly an education and awareness issue. Most people still don\'t know (enough) about Bitcoin (yet), but we\'re working towards change here as well — e.g. as co-organizers of the local Bitcoin Saigon meetup group, workshops at local universities, and working behind the scenes with the regulatory bodies towards our more friendly business environment for Bitcoin startups.', 'The whole premise behind Bitcoin is to democratise the economy. But increased mining costs and processing power requirements have led to the creation of few large Bitcoin mining pools run by data centres belonging to companies which invite people to invest in these centres for a small share of rewards in bitcoin.\n\nMining is an important operation in the Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin mining is responsible for registering and verifying transactions on the Blockchain. Mining operation requires a lot of processing power, which makes it more energy intensive. The processing power is now supplied by special hardware known as ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). Theses ASICs are developed specially for mining Bitcoin.\n\nIncrease in the number of bitcoins and bitcoin transactions is progressively increasing mining difficulty. As the difficulty increases, the need for processing power increases which in turn translates to increased energy requirements and costs. The unit prices for electricity from conventional sources is high which makes Bitcoin mining using independent rigs at homes uneconomical, thereby effectively discouraging individual miners. However, it is good news for Bitcoin mining companies who choose to set up their data centres in places with access to alternative energy to reduce energy costs and maximise profits by taking over a large chunk of mining.\n\nWhen it comes to costs, electricity from renewable sources is cheaper compared to other conventional sources. Currently, the electricity production using renewable sources is confined to harnessing wind and solar energy. While wind turbines have become more efficient in converting wind energy into electricity, the solar panels (photovoltaic cells/solar cells) still needs to improve. Even though the rate of energy conversion is not as much as we wish for it to be, solar panels can still be used to generate a decent amount of electricity for running mining rigs. Any shortfall can be offset using conventional energy.\n\nFor now, companies are setting up Bitcoin data centres in places like Iceland where electricity is produced predominantly using renewable and green energy solutions. But soon it will change, thanks to affordable wind turbines and solar panels entering the market. People will soon be able to have their own setup on their homes and generate enough power to power their mining hardware. In addition to cheaper power in foreseeable future, we can also expect more powerful and energy efficient ASICs along with smart devices that connect to Blockchain as part of the Internet of Things movement. All these things put together will soon democratize mining as it was meant to be. We can bid adieu to closed mining pools and welcome individual miners contributing bandwidth and processing power to the Bitcoin network.\n\nREAD MORE: Can Bitcoin Mining Harm the Environment?', 'Danish digital currency exchange CCEDK has been working diligently to remove any remaining barriers to mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Combining the strength of digital currencies – pioneered by Bitcoin – with the universal acceptance of major credits has lead to the elimination of most of the drawbacks concerning both systems.\n\nAlso Read: GoCardless Creates Global Direct Debit Network, but Bitcoin Already Has\n\nCombining Digital Currency and Debit Cards\n\nConsumers can now have it all, as they can enjoy the benefits of one single, seamless integrated solution which combines the peer-to-peer aspect of digital currency with instant international money transfers. Because of this powerful alliance between both worlds, anyone in the world can wire money to someone’s debit card, and it wouldn’t take up more time than completing a card transaction at your local merchant.\n\nIn doing so, CCEDK solved ten of the most emerging problems regarding the financial infrastructure available today. Rather than waiting around for multiple days – or sometimes even weeks – for a wire transfer to complete, users can now send money to anyone else in the world in a matter of seconds. And the recipient can spend that money instantly, wherever major credit cards are accepted.\n\nNot to mention, by eliminating the middleman from the equation, there is complete trust between both parties involved in the transaction. Plus, being able to store money in any mix of the most popular digital and national currencies gives users unprecedented flexibility. Especially when you take into account that you change these preferences within mere seconds.\n\nHaving the option to spend your money wherever you go, regardless of what country you are in, is the next logical step in the evolution of digital currency adoption. That being said, CCEDK keeps user privacy and security in mind at all times. The end user is always in control of his/her funds, and you are the only one able to authorize who can see your account details. In fact, any CCEDK user can decide to keep his/her ledger private.\n\nA Different Breed of Digital Currency Debit Card\n\nUnlike most Bitcoin debit card offerings, CCEDK links your Nanocard directly to any of the digital and local currency wallets containing funds. Rather than pre-loading your Bitcoin debit card before you spend any money, CCEDK users will have access to their account funds at any time. But such a massive undertaking would not be possible without a partnership with Bit-X.\n\nCCEDK CEO Ronny Boesing told Bitcoinist that:\n\n“CCEDK joined forces with licensed Forex participant Bit-x.com to offer the NanoCard. This is a partnership with no limitations, and as a result we are really proud after only one year in the industry to have the opportunity to offer an impressive project like this, the crypto currency community’s perhaps first true crypto debit card 2.0 provided by NanoCard and banking partners. It will be accepted everywhere – no need to convince merchants to use your favorite cryptocurrency.”\n\nBut that is not all, as Cryptonomex.com has joined the team as well. You may have heard the name Cryptonomex before, as they are the developers of BitShares, which is referred to as “cryptocurrency 2.0”. This partnership grants CCEDK integrated access to the BitShares 2.0 platform, allowing for digital currency transactions several thousand times faster than Bitcoin can process right now.\n\nWhen asked about partnering with Cryptonomex, Ronny Boesing told us:\n\n“Using the BitShares platform also gives CCEDK the ability to share its order books and services with future partner exchanges and digital asset providers to achieve deeper markets, tighter price spreads, and a growing suite of innovative products and services.”\n\nThe world of digital currency is evolving at a rapid pace, and exchanges will need to come up with new and creative ways to adapt to the technology “arms race”. Now that CCEDK can place their elders on the BitShares network, the company positions itself to be one of the most trusted and reliable exchanges available today. Whether or not more exchanges will follow this route of complete transparency, remains to be seen though.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on CCEDK’s NanoCard, and how do you see the landscape evolve?

With the accelerating pace of innovation in mobile communications and fintech, the region is expected to not only leapfrog the US & Europe by 2019, but also integrate millions of unbanked people into the global economy.\n\nLooking East\n\nThe Asia Pacific region, led by China, is growing fast. In 2014, the sum total of worldwide assets reached a record high of US$164.3 trillion. As central banks have come to the rescue, asset prices have risen to record highs globally.\n\nGlobal growth overall grew by 11.9% (see chart below). Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan is the fastest growing region with China and India accounting for 25% and 44% of the growth, respectively.\n\nMoreover, developing economies are accounting for 66% of all new wealth creation, while the US & Europe is only 33%. This translates into 62% of new millionaires coming from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nExisting wealth has grown much richer in the developed economies, resulting in the exclusion of other classes caused by monetary policies designed to stimulate the economies. What’s unique about this great wealth transfer east is that this region has the highest share of their investments in cash and deposits.\n\nThis is the great fintech and digital opportunity.\n\nEven more astounding is that the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan) has leapfrogged Western Europe into second place in private financial wealth, and according to BCG, it will pass North America by 2019 to become the largest region by share of global wealth.\n\nA Giant Opportunity\n\nHerein lies the giant opportunity: A massive shift in wealth has occurred East and its largely new wealth that has been created. Of this wealth, 40% sits in cash and deposits and is underinvested capital.\n\nFintech is allowing access to people who have never had access to the capital markets before and this is because a large number of the nouveau riche are tech-savvy entrepreneurs with a focus on functionality and user experience.\n\nThe chart below shows that China is a world leader in the use of mobile phone users and those who can access their financial institutions via mobile. This is providing massive opportunities in areas like mobile banking, wealth management and robo advising.\n\nTechnology Has Changed User Behavior\n\nTechnology has allowed people to embrace finance digitally and fintech firms have made the solutions that users want.\n\nAccording to a BCG report, fintech that allow clients to engage on social media to discuss market developments will have distinct advantages as clients want more frequent and rapid interactions as well as more ways to connect with a bigger community.\n\nWealth management is a very old business with very traditional ways of thinking, particularly when it comes to client interactions, which are face to face once a quarter and maybe a phone call once in a while.\n\nThe new investor who is connected wants wealth managers who are more available digitally and there are many ways for these user experiences to happen via chat, text, video (Skype) etc. Fintech firms can also use technology to segment specific customer segments and send them personalized messages/emails based on their profile and portfolios.\n\nAs the chart above shows from BCG, clients are demanding these services and the companies that respond will gain clients. In other words, clients want a more transparent and open dialogue with their financial advisors and wealth managers, and building this new brand will be the difference retention and attrition (loss of clients) as well as brand new clients wanting your services.\n\nAccording to a study, wealth managers who had advanced digital offerings reduced their attrition by as much as 5% and increased their revenues by 2-5%.\n\nThe unbanked\n\nWhile Asia-Pacific continues to accumulate massive amounts of wealth, there is one other massive fintech opportunity in this region: giving the unbanked access to bank accounts and the capital markets.\n\nThere are massive financial opportunities in bringing a digital financial opportunity to billions of people, particularly at a time when the wealth of the entire region is on the rise.\n\nTechnological innovation and wealth go hand in hand. The Asia-Pacific region is becoming the center of wealth and has unprecedented access to technology. This plays right into the hands of fintech companies who are springing up in China and the rest of region using the preferred tools of their rich new client base to give them low cost, transparent access to the capital markets.\n\nAs the pace of innovation accelerates, we may very well see a new global leader in wealth by as early as 2019.']"
06/21/2015,"['A former Secret Service special agent who helped bring down Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht will plead guilty to skimming hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin and routing the money to his own accounts, according to federal court documents.\n\nShaun W. Bridges, a computer crime expert, was part of the Secret Service task force that dug up the evidence that led to charges against Ulbricht and the shutdown in 2013 of Silk Road, the underground online black market he ran. Ulbricht eventually was convicted of narcotics trafficking, computer hacking, running a criminal enterprise and money laundering and was sentenced to life in prison last month.\n\nBut Bridges dug up more than just evidence, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.\n\nUsing information he got from his interrogation of a Silk Road customer service representative who had administrator access, Bridges accessed Silk Road\'s systems in January 2013, reset several passwords and transferred about 20,000 bitcoin from the accounts, according to the complaint. He then converted the bitcoin into cash through a Japan-based bitcoin exchange and from there sent the money to the shell company\'s investment accounts, investigators said.\n\nThe value of bitcoin in U.S. dollars fluctuates significantly, making it impossible to say what the haul was definitively ""worth."" But based on conversion rates at the time various transactions were made, federal prosecutors put the value of Bridges\' loot at $820,000.\n\nIn court documents filed last week, Bridges agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud and money laundering and is scheduled for sentencing Aug. 31.\n\nA second investigator, Carl Force, the Drug Enforcement Administration\'s lead undercover agent in the Silk Road case, faces a hearing in August for allegedly stealing bitcoin from Silk Road — and for allegedly blackmailing Ulbricht while at the same time selling him information about the investigation.', 'For the last few years now, non-tech-oriented friends and family occasionally ask me: ""So what do you think of Bitcoin?"" My answer is nearly always the same: ""It’s intellectually interesting, but not really practical.""\n\nYes, the blockchain is a neat idea. But unless you’re regularly buying stuff on Silk Road copycats, or if you live in a country with currency controls, or if you’re a hardcore libertarian, I’ve yet to hear a good reason why Bitcoin makes practical sense for most people in everyday life. Put another way: it doesn’t yet have a clear killer app.\n\nWill Bitcoin ever reach that level? I don\'t know. But I do know that today there’s a lot of very smart and very rich people who seem to think so. A few lines towards the end of Nathaniel Popper’s new book Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money cogently articulates this sentiment.\n\nAs Popper writes:\n\nYears earlier, Bitcoin had promised that it would spread its benefits to all its users, but by 2014 large chunks of the Bitcoin economy were owned by a few people who had been wealthy enough before Bitcoin came along to invest in this new system. Most of the new coins being released each day were collected by a few large mining syndicates. If this was the new world, it didn\'t seem all that different from the old one—at least not yet.\n\nPopper deftly chronicles Bitcoin’s rapid rise from being an obscure computer science project in 2009 to attracting some of the biggest Silicon Valley and Wall Street names just five years later. Readers may be familiar with some of the elements of his work: aspects of this overarching narrative have come out in bits and pieces in his reporting in the New York Times during that last few years.\n\nFurther Reading It’s all over: Bitcoin miner maker HashFast to auction remaining assets Similarly, since 2012 I’ve reported on a number of elements in the Bitcoin world, and what I’ve seen amounts to a lot of hype, and a number of companies that have either collapsed under their own incompetence, or have been outright accused of fraud. Sure, a number of Bitcoiners have managed to make a sizeable chunk of change along the way—particularly when one bitcoin was trading for around $1,000 in early January 2014.\n\nBut I didn’t know the full range of the men (and yes, they’re all men) behind the evolution of Bitcoin.\n\nThe most expensive pizza, ever\n\nOne of my favorite parts of Popper’s book is Bitcoin’s mythical origin story. While most focus on the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto—and yes, he addresses the Southern California man who turned out not to be him—Popper focuses on the first person to play with Bitcoin with Nakamoto, Hal Finney.\n\nFinney, who passed away in 2014, exemplifies the explorer, rather than the profiteer. The middle-aged Californian was someone who was interested in technology for its own sake, and initially met the mysterious Nakamoto through a cryptography e-mail list. He also mined some of the first 50 bitcoins ever after corresponding with Nakamoto. (Listen to this great interview with Finney here.)\n\nAfter some initial skepticism of the idea, Finney defended Nakamoto publicly, which earned him trust. After its creator, Finney became the first ""peer"" on the Bitcoin network.\n\nAs Popper writes:\n\nHal’s defense of the program led Satoshi to send him an early, beta version for testing. in test runs in November and December they worked out some of the early kinks. Not long after that, in January 2009, Satoshi sent the complete code to the list. The final software made some interesting tweaks to the system described in the original paper. It determined that new coins would be assigned approximately every ten minutes, with the hash function lottery getting harder if computer were generating more coins more frequently than that. … But on Sunday evening the first transaction took place when Satoshi sent Hal ten coins to make sure that this part of the system was working smoothly. To complete the transaction, Satoshi signed off with the private key associated with the address where the coins were stored. This transaction was broadcast to the network—essentially just Hal and Satoshi at this point—and was registered in the blockchain a few minutes later when Satoshi\'s computers won the next round of the hash function lottery.\n\nReading about these early days in Bitcoin’s history reminded me of Ars’ own brief experiment in March 2014 with creating our own cryptocurrency, creatively named Arscoin, an effective clone of Litecoin (using a difference hashing algorithm than Bitcoin).\n\nThis scene creates a pretty magical and often-forgotten moment in Bitcoin’s history. It is from where all the other ludicrous cryptocurrencies have sprung. The decisions made in Nakamoto’s initial code set precise boundaries as to how many such bitcoins could exist, and the Bitcoin community is living with the ramifications of those choices today. Such limits don’t exist in the classic ""fiat currency"" world.\n\nAs we reported then, in the United States, new money is made (or managed) by the Federal Reserve System, which creates an elastic currency: the US dollar. The dollar is said to be ""elastic,"" as the Fed can increase or decrease the money supply at any given time essentially by telling the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to simply print more money using fancy moneymaking machines and crazy-complicated inks and textiles.\n\nFurther Reading Feds say Bitcoin miner maker Butterfly Labs ran “systematic deception” [Updated] The Federal Reserve says (PDF) that the total value of currency and coin in circulation has risen from $31.2 billion in 1955 to $724.2 billion in 2003. Of course, when done unchecked, printing money can lead to hyperinflation. (Zimbabwe famously reached an inflation rate of 6.5 sextillion percent in mid-November 2008—it recently abandoned its local currency entirely.)\n\nIn the wake of the economic crisis of 2008, the Fed (and its counterparts in Europe, including the Bank of England) undertook a related practice called quantitative easing with the purpose of injecting more money into the economy. If you’re an anti-Fed libertarian, this is precisely the reason why the Bitcoin may be a panacea: it has crypto-based laws of nature.\n\nAs such, I’m sure that Finney and Nakamoto had no way to value what one Bitcoin was actually worth when they first started transferring them to one another back in 2009.\n\nFurther Reading Behold Arscoin, our own custom cryptocurrency! Similarly, that’s how I felt when back when we first created Arscoin. Like any cryptocurrency (or anything else for that matter), are worth whatever the market will bear. This is worth emphasizing: they’re worth whatever someone is willing to pay for them, whether it\'s $5, $500, or $5 trillion. One evening early in our experiment, I asked my wife what she would trade for 5,000 Arscoins. Her answer: ""A kiss?"" Boom! A market had been created.\n\nPopper even reminds us of the amusing tale of how, back in May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer living in Florida, sent 10,000 bitcoins to another bitcoin enthusiast in England, who promptly ordered $25 worth of pizza for delivery to Hanyecz’ house. At current exchange rates, those 10,000 bitcoins are worth $2.3 million. (In March 2013, when Vice wrote up this story, those coins were worth $750,000.)\n\nA “libertarian Indiana Jones”\n\nIn a way, the book is almost a blockchain of its own—a chain of people from whom the concept of Bitcoin generated from and has evolved into. While the opening of the book touches on Finney and then transitions into profiling the young programmer, Martti Malmi. The young Finn became one of Nakamoto’s early correspondents as well. In working with Nakamoto to create the ubiquitous Bitcoin logo, Malmi was the first outside of the enigmatic creator himself to touch Bitcoin’s source code.\n\nQuickly, Popper moves on to touching on some of Bitcoin’s biggest celebrities: Jed McCaleb (the original founder of Mt. Gox, before selling it to Mark Karpeles), Ross Ulbricht (the now-convicted founder of Silk Road), Gavin Andresen (now the primary developer on the Bitcoin code), and others.\n\nOne of the most interesting people Popper profiles in his book is Roger Ver, who has been nicknamed ""Bitcoin Jesus"" for his sheer enthusiasm and evangelism of Bitcoin.\n\nVer has been covered briefly here and there in the pages of Ars: most recently we did a short story about how after having renounced his American citizenship, he couldn’t get back in to attend a conference.\n\nPopper writes:\n\nIt was during a brief trip to California to see his family that Roger sat down to breakfast listening to a month-old Free Talk Live podcast on his iPod. When the hosts started talking about Bitcoin, something snagged in his mind and he stopped what he was doing. Many Bitcoin fanatics would later talk about their ecstatic moments of conversion to the Bitcoin cause, but few were as extreme as Roger’s. While the podcast was still playing, Roger did a search for Bitcoin on the laptop he had on his kitchen table and began making his way through everything he could find. He was so entranced by the idea of a financial system outside the control of the government that he read clear through the night to the next day. After a short nap, he began reading again, and went on reading for a few days until he eventually felt so weak, and so gripped by a sickness taking over this throat, that he called a friend and asked to be taken to the hospital. There he was connected to an IV sack that pumped antibiotics and sedatives into him. It might have been the drugs, but as he lay in his hospital bed, he felt he had found a kind of promised land that he had been waiting for all of his short life—the Galt’s Gulch he had been searching for like a libertarian Indiana Jones.\n\nVer is someone who had strong libertarian leanings even before Bitcoin. His corporate bio on the hardware retailer startup that he founder when he was 20 (Memory Dealers) claims that he ""concentrated his efforts on studying economics and moral philosophy, virtually reading every book available, including works by Adam Smith, Ludwig Von Mises, and Murray Rothbard.""\n\nFurther Reading Bitcoin investor who renounced US citizenship now can’t get back in Three years later, Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison after being convicted of federal charges of selling explosives on eBay. After he completed his probation in 2006, he left the US for good, settling in Tokyo.\n\nVer remains a committed libertarian, so much so that he donated over $150,000 to Ulbricht’s defense fund.\n\n""If Ross is falsely accused and was not [Dread Pirate Roberts], then he deserves the best defense money can buy,"" Ver told Ars in July 2014. ""Either way, he deserves the support of anyone who is opposed to the war on drugs.""\n\nAnother fascinating character is Wences Cesares, an Argentinian entrepreneur who probably has the most compelling arguments as to why Bitcoin is not only intellectually interesting, but necessary.\n\nAs Popper writes:\n\nThere was rarely a time during Wences’s youth when Argentina was not in some sort of financial crisis. In 1983, after years of staggering inflation, the government created a new peso, each one of which was worth 10,000 old pesos. That didn’t work so in 1985 the new peso was replaced by the austral, which was worth 1,000 new pesos. Seven years later, continuing inflation lead the government to go back to the peso, but this time pegged to the dollar, an experiment that eventually ended with a crushing financial crisis During most of this time, inflation ran at over 100 percent a year, meaning that the value of money in the bank fell by half each year and often much more than that.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin’s own trading value relative to the United States dollar has varied quite a bit too—topping over $1,000 per Bitcoin in early January 2014, while settling more recently at about $230.\n\nWences, a 41-year-old entrepreneur, now runs a venture-backed Bitcoin wallet startup called Xapo that ""combines the convenience of an everyday bitcoin wallet with the security of a deep cold storage vault."" The company is apparently working on a Bitcoin-based debit card as well but that has yet to fully come to fruition.\n\nAll in all, Digital Gold provides a well-written summary of how Bitcoin has gotten to where it is today. It doesn’t make any predictions or prognostications about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, but intentionally or not, the book seems to suggest that Bitcoin is a snowball that will only get bigger and badder with time.\n\nThe book ends with a confrontation between Cesares and Bill Gates, who initially was a staunch Bitcoin skeptic. Gates has apparently tempered his views within the last year.\n\nStill, after reading Popper’s history of Bitcoin, I personally remain unconvinced of its long-term viability as a means of everyday financial transactions. I come down on the Felix Salmon side—rather than the Ben Horowitz side—of the Bitcoin bet orchestrated last year by NPR’s Planet Money: ""Five years from now, in January, 2019, we\'ll poll a representative sample of Americans. If 10 percent or more say they have used bitcoin to buy something in the past month, Ben wins. If it\'s fewer than 10 percent, Felix wins.""\n\nWhat did they bet? A pair of alpaca socks—and possibly the entire future of money as we know it.', 'Cameroon Government has reportedly experimented with Bitcoin technology in a pilot project, a move that could transform its ominous payment ecosystem.\n\nAccording to the available details, the highly unbanked West African nation enrolled around 500 people to use an alternative digital currency “Trest” as their default payment method for about a month. The decision was taken to address the growing undercapitalization of Cameroon’s local banks and their inability to address a 90% of the unbanked population.\n\nTherefore with the said experiment, the government wanted to illustrate the feasibility of a peer-to-peer, decentralized alternative in order to assign entitlements and benefits directly to its people — something that could have been inefficient in case of traditional banks.\n\nAnd as it turned out, the results were highly optimistic.\n\n“In short, we artificially created a Trest-based micro-economy,” recalled Antoine De Padoue, a politician in Cameroon. “People were able to comprehend and understand this very new method of payment. They were excited and started improvising their own uses within the first five days of the pilot. We achieved quantifiable efficiency gains and the benefits far outweighed the negatives.”\n\nDe Padoue, who also happens to be the founder of Socapssi, an organization dedicated to assist Cameroon’s insurance sector (CNPS), further accoladed their project for triggering the nation’s first retail partner location and said:\n\n“Over the next 12 months, we will enroll 500 Trestor retail partners across Cameroon (10 regions, 54 divisions and more than 360 sub-divisions). This will create 1,200 to 1,800 direct jobs.”\n\nWhat is Trest?\n\nTrest is a Bitcoin like cryptocurrency, created by an Indian IT firm, Trestor, which also happens to be assisting the Cameroon government and Socapssi to address the nation’s need to efficient economical routes.\n\nThe government previously had thought about incorporating Bitcoin, but later dropped their plans due to the digital currency’s highly volatile and cost-consuming features.\n\n“Bitcoin’s transaction fee to the user was low but the real cost to the network was unimaginable. That was a deal breaker for us. We couldn’t believe the Bitcoin network consumed about $18.95 of electricity to process a single transaction,” De Padoue explained while saying they would rather feed 40 people with that money.\n\n“The Trestor team was transparent and let us study their real cost per transaction,” he added.', 'How many times have you noticed advertisements relevant to your recent search on your favourite search engine show up on your browser? I guess the answer will be “every time”. That shouldn’t come as a surprise as search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo etc. track user’s location and browsing data to show relevant advertisements. Now that they have your data, what stops them from using that data for purposes other than advertising? Nothing (except for few privacy laws)!\n\nIt is no doubt that the search engine giant has enough data available to profile everyone depending upon their interests and search patterns combined with other publicly available information to guess who the person really is. But what about others, the people without access to Google’s big data regarding its users? They can do some exciting things too, even when it comes to profiling the kind of people who are interested in the pseudonymous digital currencies like Bitcoin and that’s exactly what a couple of researchers did recently.\n\nBitcoin is known for the anonymous nature of transactions. Even though Bitcoin transactions can be tracked easily, the identity of the person or people who are parties to the transactions usually remains undisclosed. Then how did these two researchers identify a Bitcoin user’s profile? Well, they used Google, or Google Trends data to be more specific.\n\nThese University of Kentucky duo – Dr. Aaron Yelowitz and Matthew Wilson conducted statistical analysis of Google Trends data to find the pattern. Upon analysing the data they have found that people who do computer programming, criminal activity and Silk Road related searches are more likely to be Bitcoin users. They have published this study in a report titled “Characteristics of Bitcoin Users: An Analysis of Google Search Data”. The researchers make it clear that the results of this study is not a conclusive and they are not looking at the actual Bitcoin usage but just the search interests on Google.\n\nAs a part of this study, they considered four different interest groups (user profiles) commonly associated with Bitcoin – Computer programming enthusiasts, speculative investors, libertarians and criminals to find which of these groups have a positive correlation to Bitcoin usage. After eliminating potential false positives due to real world events that garnered lot of public interest from the timeline, they concluded that computer programming enthusiasts and criminals exhibit a positive correlation to Bitcoin usage. Speculative investors and libertarians figured pretty low in the list of Bitcoin user profiles.\n\nEven though this research succeeds in profiling likely Bitcoin users, the data doesn’t differentiate between those who are just curious to know about Bitcoin and those who were exploring the possibility of using Bitcoin or already using Bitcoin.', 'Last month marked a milestone of sorts for Michael Terpin. BitAngels, the first ""serious"" angel network in bitcoin, celebrated its second birthday.\n\nThings are markedly different since the group\'s first impromptu meeting at the Bitcoin Foundation\'s Bitcoin 2013 conference. After sending out a Reddit invite with the goal of six or seven people showing up, Terpin and co-founders David Johnston and Sam Yilmaz had 35 attend (60 joined within a week).\n\n""The spirit of discovery and camaraderie from those early days was magical and unforgettable,"" said Terpin. ""When we did our first set of fundings with bitcoin it was lower, $100. But compared to $5 that time a year earlier it seemed like it was on the rise.""\n\nToday, over 500 investors make up BitAngels\' decentralised global network. Those first discussions in crowded Mexican restaurants have made way for big budget conferences and monthly online presentations which Terpin describes as a ""Who\'s Who"" of bitcoin and blockchain companies. By January 2014, the group had invested over $7m in a dozen bitcoin startups including Blueseed, CoinTerra and GoCoin. From anecdotal evidence, Terpin estimates this total is now in the mid 20s.\n\nWith most deals negotiated outside its sessions, BitAngels is part social club, part due diligence service for its members. Now, under Terpin\'s leadership, it plans to become a matchmaker, with a \'city network\' that aims to foster entrepreneurship on a local level. Johnston and Yilmaz, meanwhile, have spun off into \'crypto 2.0\' projects with Dapps fund.\n\nNew blood\n\nSo far, six BitAngels chapters including London, San Francisco, Tel Aviv and New York are down to hold quarterly meetings where startups and angels can meet face-to-face.\n\nBesides angels and founding teams meeting in person, this new initiative is important, Terpin said, to pump new blood into the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIt\'s not that deals aren\'t happening, or that companies aren\'t good enough, but that bitcoin\'s price drop has divided ranks. Some investors have abandoned the bitcoin sector altogether, while others have chosen to buckle in for the ""long road ahead"".\n\n""With the price going down there\'s not this huge demand for people saying \'this is the perfect time to get in\'. If [bitcoin] hit $400 next week you\'d have a lot of interest ... but there\'s an equivalent fear that it\'s going down to double digits. I\'ve heard that several times.""\n\nThe long-term bitcoin holders that make up the core BitAngels demographic are less likely to part with their funds now than at the currency\'s peak, or when the market appeared more stable. The quality of startups pitching to the group remains high, Terpin said, but only 15% of people tuning into its monthly calls would be considered ""serious"" investors.\n\nTo boost these numbers, the group is reaching out to other angels who haven\'t yet invested in blockchain technology. An agreement with the world\'s largest angel group, Keiretsu Forum, will see BitAngels present bitcoin deals to some of its 1,500 members. The initiative will start in the locations with the greatest ""synergy"" to its new city network, he said.\n\nRather than speculating on price, Terpin thinks these tech-savvy individuals may help build out bitcoin\'s utility into use cases beyond payments.\n\n""I\'m committed to growing the group in ways that are even more relevant today, which I believe must include reaching out to people who were not involved in bitcoin\'s earliest days,"" he added.\n\nThen and now\n\n""Two years ago it was a given that investing in companies was riskier than just buying bitcoin because it pretty much always went up – but now that\'s certainly the minority view.""\n\nNow, BitAngels\' competition is fierce. As Terpin admits, ""we\'re not the only game in town anymore"". Companies like Tally Capital (Xapo, BitFury, BitPay), Pantera (Ripple Labs, 21, BitPesa) and Barry Silbert\'s newly-formed Digital Currency Group are laser focused on fostering crypto-talent.\n\nSilicon Valley accelerator Boost VC, helmed by fourth-generation venture capitalist Adam Draper, announced its first \'tribe\' of bitcoin startups in November, pledging to fund a total of 100 bitcoin companies by 2017.\n\nThe abundance of seed capital that these initiatives have brought to the ecosystem, sprinkling $50,000 here and there, has had a knock-on effect Terpin terms the ""Y combinator effect"".\n\n""Everybody who raised a seed round wants an A and not everyone is worthy of it,"" he said, noting that this issue affects all companies in tech, not just bitcoin.\n\n""You\'re not able to get something funded with a scratched out idea, you\'re not able to get a second round without really showing some traction.""\n\nWhen bitcoin marketplace Buttercoin shuttered just four months after launching with at least $1.3m from high-profile VCs, including Google Ventures and Y Combinator, its CEO blamed a lack of interest in smaller bitcoin deals.\n\nTerpin disagrees, adding that the general consensus was that Buttercoin spent too much time ""courting investors"" over users.\n\nThe void between seed and A rounds in bitcoin won\'t stop great companies getting funded, he said, citing Shapeshift as an example. For the Circles and Coinbases of the world, if you are hitting targets and have top tier investors on board, it seems like the B rounds are the easiest ones these days, he said.\n\nGood exits\n\nMichael Terpin first fell into angel investing in the 1990s when tech startups he liked couldn\'t afford the fees at his PR firm, The Terpin Group.\n\nWhile some of these companies failed, Terpin had ""a few good exits"" from these early deals and bridge loans, including dot-com Xoom – then the fourth highest IPO of all time.\n\nWith over 100 angel investments now under his belt, the PR guru says he doesn\'t regret the time and money spent on projects that went nowhere, but the billion-dollar firms that slipped through his net two decades ago.\n\n""Two of the best-known companies in tech I turned down working with when they offered stock instead of cash. Both are $100bn companies today.”\n\nBut beyond B rounds, which of these startups has what it takes to be bitcoin\'s first unicorn? This is a question Terpin considers as a partner at the AngelList Bitcoin Syndicate, part of top angel Gil Penchina\'s Flight.vc. If he thinks the answer is no, he said, it\'s simply a case of moving on to the next deal.\n\n""We\'re looking for revenue growth and a really big market where they\'ve already got traction to be a leader. If you\'re putting in something in a $5–10m valuation, what\'s your path to a $100–200m exit?""\n\nTerpin said the answer was ""absolutely in the wallet and exchange space"", with the general consensus in the community that due to its funding and traction Coinbase is leading the pack.\n\nIf the mining sector recovers, he added, startups like BitFury and KnCMiner could be potential unicorn candidates, too.\n\nTerpin himself is also launching a new Idea Lab-style incubator in Las Vegas, bCommerce Labs, alongside Jim Blasko. Its first startup will be unveiled at CE Week later this month.\n\n""I don\'t know that there will be a blockchain frenzy in a couple of years, but I think there will be good blockchain companies that are recognised by investors in the public markets certainly in the next three to five years. I\'d like to start building some of those in Las Vegas.""\n\nLong road ahead image via Shutterstock.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Pull the trigger? — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) June 20, 2015\n\nGold vs. Fiat: Crash Course\n\nWhen it comes to market crashes, history shows that investing in precious metals is not as wise as Dotcom thinks. In fact, during the 2008 market crash, gold prices “fell by about 25%,” according to Seeking Alpha, a stock market analysis website.\n\nAlso, while Bitcoin may have risen in price during the Cyprus crisis, there is no proof that the financial uncertainty in Greece has the potential to start yet another Bitcoin bubble.\n\nWhile Dotcom’s MEGA service is the only one available online that provides end-to-end encrypted video chat, as well as 50 GB of free storage, skeptics on Reddit claim this is yet another attempt by Dotcom to “pump and dump” the price of gold and Bitcoin, citing the Letsbuyit.com controversy back in 2001, which lead to a criminal investigation against Dotcom.\n\nBack then, Dotcom bought €375,000 worth of shares in Letsbuyit.com.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras himself has argued that the bailouts created a “humanitarian crisis” in Greece. The proposed austerity measures have caused tax prices to skyrocket, and have affected the elderly and newly retired the most.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has given the country one final chance to secure €7.2 billion by 30 June, an unlikely sum that may force Greece into default."", ""BitMD is a company that combines point-of-sale (POS) terminals, wallet software and Bitcoin Teller Machines (BTMs) to enable patients to pay medical providers in Bitcoin right at the counter.

Marijuana dispensaries in particular have found cryptocurrency to be useful over the last couple of years, as banks have routinely refused to do business with them. Even BitPay and Coinbase will not do business with dispensaries.\n\nBitMD is owned by Bitcoin Brands Inc. (BBI), whose CEO is Peter Klamka. A BBI pitch aimed at patients reads:\n\n“Are you aware that your consent is not required to disclose information from your medical files if it is made in connection with payment? A collection agency seeking an unpaid medical bill, a discovery request in a divorce or lawsuit, and under certain circumstances the police [...] may be able to access your medical bills. While bitcoin is not anonymous, it can be completely private when purchasing anything including medical services.”\n\nPatients at clinics with BitMD partnerships have options. If they already own bitcoins, they can make a simple payment at the counter using one of BitMD's tablets (or any device running the wallet software). If they don't own bitcoins, patients can either purchase them with cash using the BTM, or buy them with a swipe of their credit card using the POS terminal.\n\nBitMD then converts the patient-paid bitcoins into any percentage of fiat, and deposits it into the clinic's bank account. Clinics also make a small profit just by operating the BTMs (which appear to be Skyhooks).\n\nThe movement of cryptocurrency into medicine has been markedly slower than other industries – like tech – but notable stories have headlined in the past year, including Seattle's Bitcoin-accepting marijuana vending machine and BTC acceptance at the renowned Surgery Center of Oklahoma."", 'Everyone loves banks, right? Well, alright, perhaps that isn’t true. But banks reciprocate that by not feeling so rosy about everyone, either. Most banks make money by offering loans and collecting interest, which means they need people to repay those loans. If a bank gives out too many loans that aren’t repaid, they’ll eventually go out of business, just like the mortgage crisis of the late 2000’s. To manage their risk, banks have tools like credit scores to evaluate loan applicants, classifying them as prime or subprime, with subprime applicants having poor or limited credit; that’s why the last banking crisis is often called the “Subprime Crisis.” Banks exist to make money, so of course banks seek to loan as much money as possible to the most qualified loanees. So who services unqualified or less-qualified loanees who may only need microfinance loans? What other niche markets are underserved by the banking industry, and can Bitcoin capture this business?\n\nBanks traditionally seek to serve prime borrowers, equating to people with credit scores over 700, income of at least $75,000, and a significant credit history. That leaves a significant portion of the population outside of their target market. Industry research has termed consumers that do not handle all their financial needs through banks as “underserved,” as noted by Kevin Tynan in an article penned for www.americanbanker.com. The underserved population is more often seeking purely digital banking options, and tend to stay away from traditional checking and savings accounts, preferring prepaid cards or money orders. The demographic data of underserved consumers suggests they are typically millenials, immigrants, city-dwellers, those rebuilding credit, or a combination thereof, as noted by KPMG. These are services that Bitcoin could excel at supporting for consumers that are often savvy enough with technology to tackle the sometimes trying experience of using Bitcoin. In addition, the lack of overhead cost for a middleman offering digital transactions and the lack of interest from corporate competitors means doing business with underserved consumers is a no-brainer.\n\nPerhaps less lucrative, but equally rewarding, is dealing with underserved loanees from developing nations. On their blog, peer-2-lending service BTCjam wrote emphatically that their lending platform, which requires “only a few clicks,” can change lives around the world. This has been the call to action from www.kiva.org as well, which boasts over $700 million in successful loans and a repayment rate of over 98%. By enabling even a small percentage of those loans through a platform built on Bitcoin, services like BTCjam and their users stand to benefit handsomely, as well as contribute positively to developing nations. When financial and moral good align the incentive to participate is nearly undeniable. In this way, Bitcoin-based services could capture a larger following and improve the perception of Bitcoin as a currency used for criminal activity.\n\nMicrofinance, as an industry, services over 200 million people worldwide. In a road map for the microfinance industry published in 2012, industry leaders cited the need for lowered barriers to enable companies to service potentially billions of clients in need. What better way to lower barriers than to enable anyone with an internet connection to conduct peer-2-peer loans through a service that performs risk assessment and mitigation? The blockchain may not be ideal for many financial needs, but the case for Bitcoin support microfinance is compelling. The need for microfinance domestically for underserved consumers and globally for entrepreneurs in developing nations is a clear message of need. Could Bitcoin’s “killer app” be in microfinance? It seems like a strong candidate.', 'Promoting Bitcoin and digital currency can take many forms, but one of the easiest ways of doing so is by wearing crypto-related clothing. Pro Crypto is a brand new digital currency clothing manufacturer who is trying to make a name for themselves while pushing digital currency adoption to new levels.\n\nAlso read: BTC Outfitters: Bitcoin Clothing\n\nProfessional Bitcoin Swag\n\nWhen it comes to buying any clothing, the first and foremost important aspect is whether or not the fabric quality is up to par. In the case of Pro Crypto, the fabric used in their T-Shirts is very soft and does not irritate the skin when you start sweating. Especially in the neck area, where chafing of clothes is rather the normal, there seem to be no visible marks left behind, nor is there any annoyance while wearing Pro Crypto shirts.\n\nIn the world of Bitcoin and digital currency, there have been numerous efforts from individuals and companies who try their hand at creating a clothing brand. Not an easy task, mind you, as there is quite a lot of competition in this market. Plus, anyone can create a design and use platforms such as TeeSpring to have it embroidered onto a T-Shirt and sell it.\n\nBut this is where Pro Crypto differentiates itself from other players in the market. Rather than using an existing platform, the Pro Crypto team opened up their web store, where they accept payments through Stripe. As you would come to expect from a digital currency-related online shop, they accept Bitcoin payments – through both Stripe and BitPay – but also credit cards.\n\nOn the topic of designs, Pro Crypto offers some pretty unique designs you will not encounter anywhere else. Even though there are just over a dozen of different designs at this time, you can expect this number to increase as Pro Crypto gains more popularity and starts processing more orders.\n\nWhat makes the products offered by Pro Crypto of particular interest is how the designers have managed to embed their logo on the shirt, without it getting in the way of the actual design. All of the Pro Crypto shirts have the “Pro Crypto” name on the front of the shirt, near the bottom. In doing so, they make the design seem smoothless, as if “Pro Crypto” is a slogan rather than the company name.\n\nAffordable Pricing and Worldwide Shipping\n\nCreating an online clothing store means you will have to open up your products to as many people as possible. Pro Crypto can ship all orders worldwide, and they will use either USPS or FedEx for shipping and tracking. Do keep in mind that, depending on your location, delivery may take up to 20 days [through USPS].\n\nNote from the Author: Shipping costs will vary per location, but the cheapest option – without tracking number – will cost you less than US$5 per shirt in most cases.\n\nRather than keeping an inventory of T-shirts on-hands, Pro Crypto prints every order as it comes in. Due to this approach, it can take anywhere from two to seven days before the printing process is complete. However, as Pro Crypto becomes more popular, they will look into ways of keeping a stock of all shirts on-hand to speed up the shipping process.\n\nDepending on which design and color you want for your shirt, prices range from US$28 to US$31 per item. These prices are not exactly cheap, but it is not overly expensive either for a small start-up company. If all goes to plan, Pro Crypto will be offering women’s sizes, hoodies, and long-sleeved tees in the future.\n\nAre you planning to buy a shirt from Pro Crypto? Who (not)?

I have tried everything I recommend below to surprisingly positive results.\n\nYour Eyes\n\nEver get “eye strain” or a headache or “dry, itchy” eyes after staring for hours at a screen? You are not alone.\n\nDigital screens emit UV light, and this light is on a spectrum. It's the blue end of the spectrum that strains your eyes and causes discomfort.\n\nSeveral brands of “computer reading glasses” or “gaming glasses” have been developed to solve this problem. Their lenses contain a yellow tint and some kind of special coating that filters out most of the blue end of your screen's UV emissions.\n\nAnd here's the weird thing: the glasses actually work.\n\nI use the pair pictured above — US$35 from Duco. But I also experienced eye strain relief from a pair of US$13 Gamma Rays — less than half the cost. The Gamma Ray frames are a little flimsier, but they do the trick. There is a much more expensive (and patented) brand called Gunnar that serve the same purpose. Get 15% off any of them using PurseIO.\n\nYour Body\n\nThe next line of defense against health problems and pain is the posture you choose to take during your hours behind the screen.\n\nMany write that the proliferation of back pain in modern society is due to too much sitting. But back pain relief expert Esther Gokhale is building a small but rabid following on the premise that we're simply not sitting correctly.\n\nGokhale traveled to primitive cultures around the world and found that, even though many people sat for hours a day at needlework or pottery, they did not report any back pain. The difference? The way they sit.\n\nMost modern furniture is absolute crap. It's designed to fit the modern posture, which is slouched. Which of the sitting diagrams below more accurately represents how you sit in front of your computer?\n\nOffice chairs can be modified to encourage pain-free sitting. So can car seats. Even your computer hardware can be tweaked to encourage a better posture (i.e., get a wireless keyboard and mouse so you don't have to hunch over your laptop).\n\nMany excellent recommendations are made in Gokhale's book 8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back, which has been life-changing for me and several desk-dwellers I've given it to.\n\nGoing Forward\n\nYou may not be able to do much about your “programmer hands” (that baby soft feeling and pale color – eek!), but you can save your eyes and your body. Hours of sitting and staring at the computer is not inherently a bad thing, if you employ the right hacks.""]"
06/22/2015,"['The official ledger of all bitcoin transactions now contains something a little unusual — courtesy of the Canadian Senate.\n\nThe Standing Senate Committee on Banking Trade and Commerce released its new report on digital currency late last week, not just on the Parliament of Canada website, but also by posting a message in the bitcoin blockchain — the public ledger of all transactions involving bitcoin, by far the world\'s most popular digital currency.\n\nThat was done ""mostly for fun, and partly as a nod to the community,"" wrote Jeff Coleman, chief technology officer at Toronto-based technology consultants Decentral, posting on Reddit as ""emansipater"". Coleman posted a link to the message on the social news site, accompanied by another file called a ""proof of existence,"" which is used in bitcoin transactions to publicly prove the existence of certain data without having to reveal it.\n\nAlberta Senator Doug Black, who sits on the committee, tweeted a confirmation of the release linking to the Reddit post.\n\nThe blockchain is a real innovation. We published the Banking cmte report on digital currency & #bitcoin there today: http://t.co/yN9hAZYckG — @DougBlackAB\n\nColeman wrote that Decentral was approached by a Senate staffer who asked for help making the post to the bitcoin blockchain. Decentral specializes in blockchain and decentralized technologies like bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is a digital or ""virtual"" currency designed to make it easy to send money over the internet. Unlike traditional currencies, it\'s not controlled by a central authority such as a bank. Instead, it\'s a decentralized currency run collectively by users using open-source, peer-to-peer software.\n\nSince bitcoin came into existence in 2009, governments have struggled with how to deal with digital currencies like it.\n\n\'Almost a hands off approach\'\n\nThe new Senate report itself calls for a ""light "" touch — ""almost a hands off approach"" — when regulating digital currencies like bitcoin.\n\n""New technologies attendant to cryptocurrency have unimagined applications,"" the report says.\n\n""We\'ve heard, and we agree, that blockchain technology is at a delicate stage in its development and use. This is why we urge the government to explore the vast potential of this technology, while treading carefully when contemplating regulations that may restrict and stifle its use and development.""\n\nThe report notes that the technology\'s security features have the advantage of letting people take control of their online identity and prevent identity theft. It acknowledges concerns that the anonymity provided by bitcoin is an opportunity for criminals and terrorists.\n\nThe report includes eight recommendations about the technology and its regulation such as:\n\nRequiring digital currency exchanges, with the exclusion of businesses that solely provide wallet services, to meet the same requirements as money services businesses in order to discourage use by criminals.\n\nConsidering using related technology to deliver government services ""when advantageous.""\n\nThe Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, a non-profit organization that raises awareness about bitcoin, commended the report\'s ""sound recommendations.""', ""Swedish-based digital currency startup Safello has signed a proof-of-concept deal with UK bank Barclays to examine what advantages FinTech solutions could offer the financial institution.\n\nMaking the announcement during the June 22 demo day for the Barclays Accelerator program, Safello is celebrating the deal to explore blockchain technology with the major bank. The startup will work closely with staff from the bank. Safello CEO and Co-Founder Frank Schuil said:\n\n“[The blockchain could be used] at first as a way to optimize existing operations, [then later] as a complete new infrastructure to handle all kinds of financial transactions and p2p interactions.”\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph, Schuil explained what this proof-of-concept signing with Barclays means for the company:\n\n“Safello has always been on the forefront of cooperation with the traditional financial players. This solidifies this direction in a major way and it serves as a open invitation to other traditional financial players that are looking at blockchain. In that sense, there is no greater validation than doing a proof of concept with Barclays.”\n\nThe accelerator program Safello took part in saw 10 startups spend 13 weeks working with staff from Barclays, with access to some of the bank's internal data, to prepare a pitch for the bank's decisionmakers. Such tech programs are proving popular among banks, with Deutsche Bank announcing three innovation labs in the EU and U.S. earlier this month.\n\nGoing further into depth about how the Safello sees its tech as potentially helping the financial institution, Schuil described how he sees the blockchain offering advantages for banks immediately within existing operations, and further into the future:\n\n“There is a good understanding that blockchain technologies provide a frictionless and low-cost platform of international payments and beyond. The adoption of these technologies will go through different phases. At first as a way to optimize existing operations, but over time as a complete new infrastructure to handle all kinds of financial transactions and p2p interactions.”\n\nCommenting on the conclusion of the program, Derek White, Barclays' chief design and digital officer — a role that involves “embracing disruptive technologies” — explained why the UK high street bank is backing FinTech companies:\n\n“Today is about celebrating the successes, partnership and an exciting future with some of the leading startups in the fintech ecosystem right now. At Barclays, we’re embracing the digital revolution, exploring innovations early on so that we can help to shape their development and co-create the future of financial services with these startups.”\n\nBarclays is regarded to be one of the UK's “big four” banks, which between them serve just under 75% of the UK's consumer banking market. Safello was founded in Stockholm in 2013 as a digital currency exchange.

In April, Fortune reported where he had landed: Bitreserve, a cloud money service that uses bitcoin. And now, not quite three months into his time there, he has a new title: CEO.\n\nThat was fast.\n\nIt’s a swift rise that is in keeping with Watson’s whirlwind career in the past year. The former global operations CIO at Barclays landed on our 40 Under 40 list last year for his impressive background, quick achievements as CIO of Nike, and his advocacy and influence in the gay community (Watson is out, and was the first non-U.S. citizen to score a seat on the board of GLAAD). When he left Nike at the end of last year, some scratched their heads; they continued scratching them when he moved to a digital currency startup.\n\nWhy go from sneakers to bitcoin? Why go from Nike, a Fortune 500 company with $28 billion in annual revenue, to Bitreserve, a fledgling startup less than one year old with less than $15 million in funding?\n\nFor starters, Watson was always a technology guy. He’s worked at three banks—Citi (as a contractor), Wells Fargo, and Barclays—but before that, he spent four years at Microsoft. At Barclays, he treated the bank’s tech department like a small startup within the larger organization, and led the launch of a slew of mobile banking apps. At Nike, he quickly helped the company ink a new partnership with Juniper Networks.\n\nBitreserve was the perfect combination of Watson’s passions and previous jobs: banking and tech. After leaving Nike, he had offers from big banks, but preferred to do something more entrepreneurial. “I was itching to make an impact,” Watson says. At Nike, he wasn’t doing enough to address that itch. He says he was convinced to join Bitreserve after just 10 minutes with the founder, Halsey Minor.\n\nIn addition, Bitreserve’s theme of financial inclusion—a bitcoin benefit that the cryptocurrency’s biggest flag-wavers love to talk up—fits perfectly with Watson’s ambitions of helping the unbanked and under-banked. “I’ve already worked for major companies,” he tells Fortune. “When I met with the Bitreserve team, it spoke to me on a social and equitable level. And it’s very rare you find opportunities like that.”\n\nWhat Bitreserve does may be confusing to those unfamiliar with bitcoin. The company says it helps members to “transfer and convert the major currencies of the world instantly, safely, and for free.” (Low fees and no transfer delays are the selling points of many new fintech companies, not just those working in bitcoin.) Think of it as a bitcoin bank, though the company rejects that word. It allows you to convert bitcoin into different currencies (the site currently supports nine currencies and four precious metals) for use in the cloud, or simply to be stored, like a bank. Bitreserve is also big on transparency, so its web site (along with a separate visualization site) makes very clear what the company is holding: just $2.1 million USD, at the moment, 55% of it in bitcoin, 18% of it in U.S. dollars, and 10% of it in British pounds.\n\nThe company says it has more than 16,300 active members and has powered $16.5 million in cloud money transactions.\n\nBitReserve’s founder, Minor, has an illustrious tech resume that includes investing early in Salesforce and founding CNET. “Everything I’ve done has been at dramatically low cost and has allowed a lot more people to participate,” he told Fortune in April. “We all know, from Facebook and others, how incredibly efficient cloud-based services can be in linking lots and lots of participants together. So we’re doing that right now for nine currencies and four metals.”\n\nWith Watson becoming president and CEO of BitReserve, Minor remains chairman of the board and takes on a role as the company’s “chief visionary.” BitReserve also has two new boardmembers: Adrian Steckel, who has been CEO at a number of telecom companies in Mexico (most recently IUSACELL, which sold to AT&T for $2.5 billion), and Jim Milby, who worked with Watson at Barclays and Citi.\n\nThe company also will make an announcement in July that “changes their service and offerings,” according to a spokesperson.\n\nWatson had interest in digital currencies before, and had a small investment in bitcoin that he says “did well,” but now he’s suddenly a digital currency CEO. “The negative perception is there,” he says. “It would be foolish to say it’s not there. But I think it’s a young currency and the platform is just being developed. The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology. I can’t see many major governments around the world saying, ‘We’re going to move to bitcoin as currency,’ but I suspect that the world will embrace the uses of the blockchain.”\n\nNow he has to see to it that the bitcoin world embraces BitReserve, too.', ""There was a time in human history without war. Really. It also just so happened to be the most decentralized period of human history.\n\nThis is no coincidence.\n\nThe pre-agricultural period known as the paleolithic — or “hunter-gatherer” era – has been inspiring modern humans to improve their lives as of late. People who adopt paleolithic diets suddenly find themselves looking fit. Those who adopt “primal” postures notice a decrease in back pain. Even paleo-inspired romantic lifestyles known as “polyamory” are changing many lives for the better.\n\nBut does the hunter-gatherer lifestyle have anything to teach us about digital currency? If we're talking about the Bitcoin block size debate, the answer is a resounding “yes.”\n\nTime to Decentralize\n\nPaleolithic and even modern hunter-gatherer tribes did not expand indefinitely. In fact, the scientific Dunbar's number explains that our brains can't keep track of more than 150 relationships at a time because our ancestors would split — or “fork” — if tribes ever got that big.\n\nLet's examine the following three conditions that indicate that Bitcoin has reached its forking time:\n\n1. Battles Among Would-Be Chieftans — Where leaders emerge in small groups, it is typically because there is nearly-unanimous or unanimous consent that it is profitable to follow a certain person. Someone's who's proven himself wise and judicious and brave. These leadership emergences are not political, as followers voluntarily support and even desire a tribal leader.\n\nBut when a tribe gets too large, multiple would-be chieftans begin to fight against one another.\n\nThis scenario has been comically played in the Bitcoin space recently. “Mike Hearn wants Gavin Andresen to revoke commit access!” “Peter Todd has been paid off by anti-blockchain corporations!” “Gavin Andresen admits that playing 'dictator' is an attractive option!”\n\nThe hunter-gatherer approach is the only one that restores peace among the factions of battling chieftains. The tribe must fork, so those who wish to follow Plan A may do so, and those who wish to follow Plan B may do so. And those who want a wholly different plan? They start their own tribe (hello, altcoins).\n\nForking is the most literal kind of decentralization there is. And it keeps the peace.\n\n2. Irreconcilable, Competing Interests — The larger a group is, the more varying interests are introduced into the equation. Bitcoin has reached a point in which its users' interests no longer align.\n\nSome want a 1MB cap to ensure that individuals can run a full node on their home computers. Others want a 20MB cap to ensure that Bitcoin can scale to global demand. Still others say that blocksize caps themselves are based on economic fallacies and should be done away with.\n\nAll of these views are valid, and all are in direct conflict with one another. A solution cannot be reached which appeases all interests.\n\nBut a tribal split would appease all three. There need not be a loser — everyone can win.\n\n3. Increasing Scarcity — The anthropologic studies explored in the book “Sex at Dawn” suggest that primitive birth control took place among tribes to keep their growth rates stable. A baby-boom is not desirable if available resources — and the ability to acquire them — remain the same.\n\nScarcity's a bitch.\n\nAs we've seen, full Bitcoin nodes have become more scarce over the past year, even as the number of users has increased. Single miners have also become more scarce as they've pooled together to stabilize their payouts.\n\nIn other words, the two most sacred resources in Bitcoin — nodes and miners — have not grown at the rate of the “baby boom” happening at the user base.\n\nThis is no reason to panic, and certainly no reason to lament. But it is yet another reason to fork. When too few resources are being competed for by too many tribal members, a split into different regions can restore the peace and plenty.\n\nForgotten Wisdom for Modern Times\n\nThe success of tribalism has been hotly promoted by the likes of speaker Seth Godin, writer Cory Doctorow, cartoonist Hugh Macleod, blogger Robert Scoble and entrepreneur Corey Brown, among others.\n\nThe difference being that unlike in 12,000 B.C., where tribes were isolated from one another and hence unable to trade, the year 2015 and beyond can be markedly different. We can divide into our respective tribes, yes, but because of Internet and blockchains, we can still trade with one another. A lot.\n\nIf that seems like having the best of both worlds, it's because it is. If that sounds an awful lot like everyone winning, it's because it is. I almost dare not hope it, but maybe humanity could once again experience an era without war."", 'Blockstream recently announced the alpha release of their Sidechain Elements project, and one of the more interesting experiments in the release is Confidential Transactions. This is a proposal to improve privacy in bitcoin, which is not as anonymous as some users would like to think. In an introductory presentation to Sidechain Elements, Blockstream Co-Founder and Bitcoin Core Developer Greg Maxwell mentioned how he wouldn’t want to live in a bitcoin world if privacy were not improved.\n\nAlso Read: Blockstream Closes $21 Million Seed Funding to Fulfill the “Promise of Blockchain Technology”\n\nThe problem with bitcoin privacy right now\n\nBitcoin transactions are quite public. Although no one can gain much information about a transaction by simply looking at it on the blockchain, a lot of data can be revealed by simply figuring out one of the parties involved in the transfer of bitcoins. As Maxwell explained in his presentation of Sidechain Elements:\n\n”Once you pay someone, they know who you are because you transacted with them. They can look at your transaction history to make a good guess at what your financial history is. You can leak this information to everyone, and they just have to attach your name to one address [to] get all of the other details. When we ask institutions about using bitcoin, even the most boring institutions look at this and say, ‘We don’t want to use all of our transactions in public.’”\n\nIn many instances, the financial privacy of the legacy banking system is preferred over bitcoin. When dealing with a centralized financial institution, one’s transaction history is at least kept private (in theory) from everyone other than the bank and the customer.\n\nMaxwell also discussed bitcoin’s privacy issues in the context of the digital commodity’s usefulness as a money:\n\n“And a loss of privacy loses fungibility, and that’s an inherent property of money. If each bitcoin has a history and people know how it’s used, then maybe some people won’t want some bitcoin.”\n\nPast bitcoin privacy proposals\n\nThe privacy issues with bitcoin are well known, which is why there have been so many new privacy-enhancing proposals in the past. Some of these proposals are compatible with bitcoin as it stands today (CoinJoin, CoinSwap, offchain servers), while other, cryptographic solutions would require more serious changes to the underlying protocol (ZeroCoin, traceable ring signatures, zerocash).\n\nMaxwell noted that the second group of possible solutions have the “greatest functionality,” but they also have the problem of breaking pruning — which is essential for scaling bitcoin. At this point, a perfect solution for bringing more privacy to bitcoin does not exist.\n\nMany developers are focused on finding a privacy solution for bitcoin to make-up for the mistakes made during the development of other widely-used Internet protocols. According to Maxwell, there is a sense of regret within long-time developers who wish they put more focus into making the protocols of the Internet more secure and private. He explained:\n\n“When I work in the IETF with other long-time developers of the protocols of the internet, there is almost a ubiquitous regret that we built an internet where encryption wasn’t a default and always on. And there was always a reason for this: it’s complex, it’s slow, it’s incompatible with stuff already deployed. This is all true. But when we look at this history, these reasons were insignificant and we should have taken the cost 10 years ago to make encryption the default. As time goes on, it becomes harder and harder to deploy pervasive encryption. And it is universally recognized as a regretful scenario. I don’t want to make the same mistake with money. I think that if bitcoin were going to displace other forms of money, we need to improve privacy.”\n\nThe Confidential Transactions element\n\nConfidential Transactions are based on ideas expressed by Adam Back on the bitcointalk forum almost two years ago. The idea is that the transaction amounts will be private, while still allowing the public network to confirm that everything adds up correctly.\n\nWhen explaining the thinking behind Confidential Transactions, Maxwell compared cryptographic privacy work in bitcoin with traditional cryptographic privacy found on the Internet:\n\n“Most of the prior work on cryptographic privacy in bitcoin has focused on protecting the transaction graph — the flow of coins from one party to another. You can liken this to metadata to phone records or Internet traffic. And so it’s a little funny because for cryptographic privacy on the Internet we often don’t do anything about metadata. Now, metadata is important to make private, but it’s usually almost impossible to make private. So what if in bitcoin instead of protecting the metadata we protected the content.”\n\nMaxwell also explained how avoiding address re-use can help protect even more financial data:\n\n“What’s the content? A transaction’s content is its destination and its amounts. If you use the pseudonymous accounts and don’t reuse them, then your destinations are already private.”\n\nIn addition to making transaction amounts private, Confidential Transactions also enables the ability to add an encrypted memo to any transaction. This is often valuable for adding invoice numbers or short descriptions to transactions.\n\nBitcoin Core Developer Peter Wuille has also described how Confidential Transactions become even more interesting when combined with CoinJoin on Reddit:\n\nAlthough there are a few other cryptographic solutions to bitcoin privacy in the works, this is one of the more practical options that doesn’t involve any “moon math.” As Blockstream’s Adam Back explained on Reddit:\n\n“What’s new here is that this math is making no new novel crypto assumptions (assumes only the same crypto building blocks as bitcoin), and is provably secure.”\n\nYou can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.', 'Eobot, a cryptocurrency cloud mining company, will not serve customers in New York State as of July 1, 2015, on account of the recently finalized New York State BitLicense requirements. “If you are residing in and/or accessing Eobot within the State of New York, U.S., please withdraw all coins and cease all mining with Eobot as of July 1, 2015, as we are ceasing all Eobot mining connections from within New York at that time,” the company announced on its website.\n\nWe regret that we must cease Eobot business within New York State, however the new BitLicense requirements in this state place compliance and cost burdens upon Eobot that we believe are excessive.\n\nEobot another BitLicense victim\n\nThe announcement follows the closing of BTC Guild mining pool as of June 30, 2015 largely on account of the New York BitLicense. BTC Guild said the fact that BTC Guild is not in New York does not matter since it does business with New York residents. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) can attempt to claim jurisdiction to enforce regulations, BTC Guild noted.\n\nThere has been other fallout from the BitLicense as well.\n\nShapeShift, the Switzerland-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced last week that it is suspending service to residents of New York State on account of the BitLicense regulation, according to crowdfundinsider. Erik Voorhees, founder and CEO of ShapeShift, said BitLicense collects an “Orwellian” amount of information on users and creates security risks. He said BitLicense regulations “re-connect” personal information to transactions that would be anonymous otherwise.

Exponential Finance 2015 examined how rapidly accelerating technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, crowdfunding, digital currencies, and robotics are rapidly disrupting businesses throughout the financial industry.\n\nThe Singularity University’s news portal Singularity Hub published a conference wrap-up titled “Exponential Finance: Who Will Be the Instagram or Uber of Finance?” Instagram and Uber are examples of what Peter Diamandis, co-founder and executive chairman of Singularity University, calls the disruptive potential of digital technology.\n\n“Instagram was acquired for a billion dollars the same year Kodak went bankrupt,” writes Jason Dorrier. “Uber is a five-year-old transportation company worth $40 billion, and they don\'t own a single car or bus.”\n\nAccording to Diamandis, the blockchain will spark similarly disruptive innovations.\n\n“At its core, bitcoin is a smart currency, designed by very forward-thinking engineers,” said Diamandis. “It eliminates the need for banks, gets rid of credit card fees, currency exchange fees, money transfer fees, and reduces the need for lawyers in transitions … all good things. Most importantly, it is an ‘exponential currency’ that will change the way we think about money.”\n\nIn his talk at Exponential Finance, Diamandis added that simple and ubiquitous apps based on blockchain technology will change the banking industry and the insurance industry.It’s difficult to predict which companies will become the Instagram and Uber of exponential digital finance. Some of the established big players in the financial industry will probably continue to play an important role\n\n.Using again the analogy with digital photography, while Kodak went bankrupt because it didn’t adapt fast enough, Canon transitioned to become a major player in the digital camera market. But the biggest and most disruptive innovations could come from applications and business models that few anticipate today, CNBC\'s Bob Pisani pointed out.\n\nJust a few imagined the iPhone in the \'60s, “Reality has surpassed science fiction,” said Pisani.Abra, a blockchain company that wants to take a slice of the $550 billion global remittance market, is showing what can happen when several digital technologies converge in one product. Combining an Uber-like peer-to-peer network with smartphone technology and the blockchain, Abra permits sending cash as easy as sending a text message.\n\nAt Exponential Finance, Abra’s founder Bill Barhydt estimated that we\'re three years away from modern smartphones becoming ubiquitous in the developing world. At that point, it\'s possible many of the world’s unbanked billions in developing countries will skip traditional finance, a little like how they leapfrogged landlines for cell phones.\n\nBarhydt stated that Abra aims to be the Uber of digital cash. Abra, which allows people to send and receive money without a bank account, is building a global network of “human ATM machines,” empowered end-users who don’t even have to understand Bitcoin to use the underlying blockchain technology embedded in the Abra app.\n\nBarhydt described Abra as “the world\'s first digital cash-based peer-to-peer mobile money transfer network.” The Abra app allows anyone with a smartphone to send money to any other smartphone anywhere on the planet any time of day. The goal of Abra is to be as “private as traditional cash, but without introducing any financial intermediary.”\n\n""Traditional banking is really good at serving the global 5 percent to 10 percent of consumers who reach a certain income level,"" Barhydt told CNN Money. ""The reality is, the majority of the planet is a cash-based economy, and banking doesn\'t work for those people.""\n\nCNN Money’s take is that Abra makes banking more accessible while completely cutting out the actual bank – and bank accounts may be the next thing to go obsolete.\n\nBlythe Masters, the former J.P. Morgan star who now leads Digital Asset Holdings, a technology company that uses distributed digital ledgers to address operational challenges and settlement latency in both digital and mainstream financial assets, said that financial blockchain applications will be measured in the trillions.\n\nAugur, a fully-decentralized, open-source prediction market platform based on blockchain technology intended to revolutionize forecasting, decision-making and the manner in which information consensus is collected and aggregated, was selected as one of the five finalists in the “Breakthrough” category at the XCS Challenge at Exponential Finance 2015.\n\nA short video on the conference website shows the enthusiastic reactions of many attendees after the conference.\n\n“I feel we’re on the cusp of a step function in technology,” says Catheryne Nicholson, founder and CEO of blockchain API provider BlockCypher.', 'Yet another case of Bitcoin theft comes to the fore to haunt the Bitcoin consumers. Altcoin cloud mining hash power online marketplace Scrypt.CC has been hacked and a large, undisclosed amount of Bitcoin and hashing power has been stolen. The announcement, posted by the admin Marcelo Santos, can be seen on the website after a login.\n\nThe hacker committed this crime while the admin was in the final step of finishing with the server upgrade.\n\nA section of the message reads:\n\n“Around 14 hours ago our database was breached, the hacker credited himself BTC and KHS and withdrew BTC until our withdraw wallet was empty. He then proceeded to make suspicious orders in the market in which the market automatically turned itself off. This sent an alert to me and other support staff, one of them seeing what was happening but not being able to do much as he does not have back-end access, he enabled our “Panic” mode in which put the whole site on lock down. But the hackers still managed to gain access and steal the coins from the hot wallet and the backup withdraw wallet.”\n\nHowever, the total loss amounting to consumers will not be high as the notification says that a major percentage of the stolen Bitcoin belonged to the website. And users need not worry about their information being leaked as the server was timed to run hourly database backups and one was made just minutes before the initial attack and right before the final lockdown.\n\nIf a user will click on the ‘Status’ tab on the website, he will find no information displayed as the theft is being investigated and the database is being worked upon. Users will see 0 balance as the hash power seller is planning out further steps.\n\nUsers are advised to NOT MAKE ANY MORE DEPOSITS SINCE THE HACKERS STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE HOTWALLETS.', 'A new decentralized space venture has recently begun, formed by a recent partnership with BitNation and Spacechain. R.O.S.S. (Race to Open Source Space) is a small rocket being prepared by the two teams. The mission of the program is to compete directly with space operations owned and operated by the nation states and private businesses. CEO BitNation, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof explains:\n\n“Space exploration is something that nation state governments traditionally been providing, mainly because it required a significant amount of money. However, it has started to move to the private sector lately, with companies like SpaceX and Tesla, which were just the beginning of democratizing the technology, making it mainstream accessible. We aim to take it further, not just make it accessible to people outside of the government, but also make it open source, and DIY friendly.”\n\nOne of the steps in the organization\'s roadmap is the June 26 launch of Stratoshi – pending favorable weather conditions - which will be one of many high altitude balloon experiments to test the technology. The long term goal of this new space program is to create a peer-to-peer research service to study the cosmos. The rocket will host an FM transmitter to produce an idea called participatory proof-of-concept.\n\nThese efforts will be headed by Iman Mirbioki of Spacechain. He says “The very special essence of this idea is open source and decentralize space-travel; a space agency that is not bound to any nation or state.” Echoing BitNation’s mission statement, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof felt joining forces with Mirbioki was a ""natural fit"" and says “many new ideas have formed from the collaboration"".\n\nOne such idea is the implementation of a new eco-friendly fuel. R.O.S.S. will use the new fuel in its thrusters for separation of the payload from the second stage. (R.O.S.S. is a two-stage rocket)\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke with Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof and rocket builder Iman Mirbioki in the run-up to this week’s test launch.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Can you tell us the logic behind a BitNation Space Agency?\n\nSusanne Tarkowski Tempelhof: One of Bitnation’s service offering is service aggregation. Even if many can conceptually understand that free market organizations can offer the same services as nation state governments, people tend to be scared by imagining a world where everyone have to do so many choices about individual service provider for every single service the government currently provides. It feels insecure, and messy. Therefore, combining everything under one banner is a part of Bitnation’s mission to illustrate not only how a decentralized governance world is achievable, but also more practical and comfortable.\n\nSpace exploration is something that nation state governments traditionally been providing, mainly because it required a significant amount of money. However, it has started to move to the private sector lately, with companies like SpaceX and Tesla, which were just the beginning of democratizing the technology, making it mainstream accessible. We aim to take it further, not just make it accessible to people outside of the government, but also make it open source, and DIY friendly.\n\nTo crowdfund collectivist efforts, whether it’s building roads, or space missions, or finding the cure for cancer is the natural next step in terms of building a voluntary society.\n\nCT: Can you talk about the unique fuel that will be used in R.O.S.S.?\n\nIman Mirbioki: There is still a lot of testing to do before we can produce a stable fuel ready for use. The small amounts that will be used in orbit for a coming mission and in ROSS are produced and mixed by hand. We still don’t have the technology to produce it on industrial scale as the current synthesis process requires more resources and energy than ordinary “rocket fuel”. It’s one of obstacles we’re trying to tackle right now.\n\nThe objective of using the new fuel (we don’t have an official name for it) is also testing it in harsh environment. You see, it’s really pretty harsh up there; it’s ~400 degrees Celsius in temperature differences in light vs. shadow. There’s no gravity. Everything is bombarded all the time by all kind of radiation in all possible frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum, not talking about the particle radiation that burns the computer-chips and fries the electronics.\n\nThe new fuel must be reliable under those conditions, to name a few - after all, fuel is the mission-critical “component” number one of all things. No fuel, no nothing.\n\nCT: What\'s the goal behind the FM transmitter effort?\n\nSTT: The goal with the FM transmitter is to have a participatory proof-of-concept, so that everyone who’s interested in taking part of the mission can tune in, and listen to it when it’s in space.\n\nWe’ll broadcast Bitnation’s Declaration of Independence along with David Bowie’s “Space Oddity.” Considering that Bitnation, as opposed to other governance service providers, operates from cyberspace to a global, borderless world, it makes perfect sense to broadcast our declaration of independence from Space.\n\n“Bitnation’s mission to illustrate not only how a decentralized governance world is achievable, but also more practical and comfortable. We\'ll integrate it into the Bitnation Pangea platform, so the community can review projects, contribute with input, and help fund it."" — Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof\n\nCT: Do you expect to launch on schedule?\n\nIM: A lot depends on the outcome of the Stratoshi 1 mission that is headed for the stratosphere in a few weeks. The objective of the mission is to send up electronics and equipment to be stress-tested in near-space conditions, using a high-altitude balloon. The second objective of the Stratoshi 1 mission will be to remotely pilot a 1/12-size model of our experimental Phaeton spacecraft from freefall to safe landing in Stockholm.\n\nThe model is a V-shaped “wing”, with a wingspan of 1800 mm, weighing only 1600 grams despite the size and all the electronics. It will be dropped from 30-35 km altitude (100-115,000 ft) and we’ll do a miniature reentry simulation while we’re up there anyways. ROSS is also the (a smaller) kind of boosters the Phaeton spacecrafts will use in the future.\n\nCT: How do you feel about the current Nation States space programs?\n\nSTT: Current nation state governments are still leading the way when it comes to space exploration — and some programs are indeed very interesting, like the NASA Mars exploration program, for instance. However, it’s like everything the government is doing: closed-sourced and elitist, which is the very opposite of what we’re trying to do at Bitnation.\n\nCT: What can you tell CoinTelegraph about the project\'s next step after reaching orbit?\n\nIM: There are tons of opportunities. For example, mining titanium, an expensive metal which when shipped back from the Moon with current technology is still cheaper than mining it on Earth. The best ores on Earth contain ~3% or (often) less titanium vs. ~14% on the Moon, but also the absence of an atmosphere and liquid water have kept the minerals close to the lunar surface. That means, you don’t have to dig too much either.\n\nThe mining industry is also a heavy polluter on Earth. It’s a win-win situation for everyone. To get there, a fuel depot network in orbit must be deployed and that’s where the next steps go.\n\n""I finally realized that traveling to space is not that hard as it seemed. I had dreamed of becoming an astronaut my whole entire life without even thinking of the very idea that one don’t need a government-run organization and billions of dollars to build a space vessel. After all, ‘space’ is only merely 100 km above us, with all its wonders, dangers, possibilities and adventures. The key is not a new fuel, better engines or sharper technology. We’ve been looking at it the wrong way all the time. When you change your perspective, suddenly you realize that you were wrong and that there are other ways."" — Iman Mirbioki, Spacechain Lead Developer\n\nCT: What\'s the overall goal of this Space Mission for your team?\n\nIM: There will be several missions going on at the same time at BSA. Different teams works with different tasks, like one that is working with drones flying in swarms. It doesn’t look like space science, but it’s exactly what it is. The same navigational software will be used for multi-satellites in orbit.\n\nPutting something in orbit is one thing. It’s no longer “rocket science,” even if it’s rocket science. It’s in the reach of most common people if they really try it hard. Now, keeping something, or worse, somebody alive in orbit and bringing this poor being safely back to Earth (in one shape and not roasted) is another story.\n\nThere will be many successful launches, many discoveries, many milestones and tons of knowledge and data, but there will also be catastrophes and worse, it may even cost the lives of those who seek further in what is possible, before we get there - but we will get there no matter what.\n\nThe goal is very simple. We can’t live in the cradle forever. It’s essential for the survival of our species that we evolve further in space travel before we run out of resources, which is not so far away. It’s a matter of survival.']"

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Using the latest cryptography, Blockstream has created Confidential Transactions designed to improve Bitcoin’s user security by keeping the amounts sent visible only to participants in the transaction, or other specified parties.\n\n‘Confidential Transactions’\n\nMany have tried to improve on Bitcoin transactional security, with Darkcoin/Dash being the most notable example through their own altcoin. With the innovations inside chain technology, Blockstream has created Confidential Transactions (CT). Using the latest cryptography, Confidential Transactions is designed to improve Bitcoin’s user security by keeping the amounts sent visible only to participants in the transaction, or other specified parties.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you get a globally verified transaction that removes counterparty risk from transactions, but these transactions are fairly public for this process to take place. Not all financial transactions are meant to be for the public, so the Confidential Transactions program looks to fill that niche in the market.\n\nIf larger transactions aren’t done confidentially, thieves, agencies, and scammers can target known high-value addresses for more information. Free speech and fungibility issues, where a bitcoin’s history may make it more or less desirable, can compromise a user’s Bitcoin value, depending on the transaction.\n\nHow Confidential Transactions Work\n\nWith Confidential Transactions, the transaction amounts become privatized without compromising the ability to work within the public Bitcoin protocol. Verification of the amounts can still be done.\n\nAdditively homomorphic commitments is a technique within cryptography that makes this possible. CT allows the transfer of private ""memo"" data (like refund addresses) without raising the size of the transaction and doing so by reclaiming most of the overhead of the CT cryptographic proofing.\n\nBitcoin helps improve security for its users with the use of pseudonymous addresses, but in any Bitcoin transaction you are learning at least one of the user’s addresses. According to Blockstream, with that information, you can deduce other related addresses linked to the known address, compromising safety and security for any future transactions.\n\nIf you are paid in bitcoin by an employer, as an example, then use those bitcoins to pay for your monthly rent and your weekly groceries, this information can be derived by those parties. In theory, the landlord and store, for example, can collude and adjust the market against you if they notice an increase in your funds. Thus, they could use the information to increase food and rent prices accordingly, like inflation.\n\nMixing methods like CoinJoin and CoinSwap, which CT is fully-compatible with, have been used to improve security for Bitcoin transactions, where mergers of recent transactions of users are created by making joint payments. The problem is the amounts of these transactions can be dialed back to their origins, according to Blockstream. All other methods result in “pruning,"" with participants assuming ever-larger databases to verify new transactions.\n\nThis can happen because the established systems prevent knowledge of which coins have been spent. Other issues Confidential Transactions hope to solve generally include low performance, excessive costs, and the new cryptographic assumptions that are difficult to understand for the novice.\n\nOrigins of CT\n\nThis concept was originated by Adam Back in a 2013 bitcointalk.org thread called ""bitcoins with homomorphic value.” Created by Core Developer Greg Maxwell, this required the implementation of many new cryptosystems that work in concert.\n\nConfidential Transactions are all based on a concept called the Pedersen commitment. This commitment set-up allows users to hold some data secret but make a commitment to this data so that it is unchangeable later. Unlike other proposals, this system is not just speculation or pure cryptography without integration with the Bitcoin system. Confidential Transactions are enabled in Elements Alpha, and used by default by for all ordinary transactions.\n\nMaxwell has been a defender of Bitcoin versus the creation and proliferations of altcoins. A common refrain is of altcoin proponents is that Bitcoin takes too long to make improvements in its protocol, but he points out as digital currency systems grow that issue exists, whether it is Bitcoin or an altcoin. Maxwell hasn’t seen altcoins bring real value to the market, since they cannot generate Bitcoin’s “Network Effect.”\n\n“The value of currency comes from the network effect, and if you’re starting up new cryptocurrencies all the time, all you’re doing is fragmenting the network effect,” explains Maxwell. “Well, when Bitcoin came into existence it was worthless. Over time as people saw the potential value, they started trading bitcoins for larger and larger amounts of money.\n\nHe continues:', 'Yesterday evening, shortly before the markets closed in the UK, we published our twice-daily bitcoin price watch analysis piece. In the piece we highlighted the levels that we would be keeping an eye on in the bitcoin price as it matured throughout the Asian session and overnight in Europe, and suggested how we might respond to price reaching a couple of key break points. Now, as we head into a fresh European session, what are the levels that we are watching in today’s bitcoin price, and where will we look to get in and draw a profit from the market according to our intraday scalp and breakout strategy? Take a quick look at the chart.\n\nAs the chart shows, overnight we got a similar head and shoulders pattern as we saw late last week, with intraday highs topping out at 247.98 before correcting to bounce from support short-term and then breaking back through the neckline of the pattern to daily lows of 243.32. These are the two levels that we are going to be keeping an eye on today. If we can get a break below 243.32, it would present 241.06 as an immediate downside target. A stop loss somewhere around 244.5 will maintain a 2 to 1 risk reward profile on trade and take us out in the event that we return to range.\n\nLooking the other way, a break above 247.98 would validate 251 flat to the upside, with a stop loss somewhere around 246.5 once again making the trade attractive from a risk management perspective.\n\nFor those looking for a more aggressive option, if we get a run back down towards support at 243.32, and a bounce, a long entry towards in term resistance with a stop loss somewhere around 242 looks like a nice intra-range trade, with the opposite being true with a correction from resistance and a target of 243.32 to the downside.\n\nCharts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

It had sought to spend 20 BTC (around $5,000) on transactions totaling about 200MB in data.\n\nThe original intention was to flood the bitcoin network with transactions to see if the current 1MB block size was adequate at such volume, and if the network could recover quickly from a surge.\n\nCoinWallet\'s stated aim was to demonstrate that the 1MB block size is inadequate if bitcoin is to become ""anything more than a costly science project"".\n\nTen bitcoin servers would send transactions at two per second, each approximately 3KB in size and each sending to 10–20 addresses.

Some of the test fees exceeded 10,000 satoshi (0.0001 BTC) per KB of transaction data.\n\nWallet software maker MultiBit posted on its website that transactions with only 1,000 satoshi (0.00001 BTC) fee per KB were delayed during the test, some of them taking as much as 87 blocks to confirm.\n\nThe MultiBit HD wallet has a default setting of 3,000 satoshi (0.00003 BTC) per KB, which is user-adjustable between 1,000 and 10,000 satoshi.\n\nTransactions set at the default 3,000 satoshi took from 11–80 blocks to confirm, and those set at the maximum 10,000 satoshi took an average of nine.\n\nThe team concluded:\n\n""When the Bitcoin network is flooded with transactions at a particular fee level, transactions with lower fees do not get confirmed in a timely manner.""\n\nWhile most in bitcoin have argued recently for the size of a single 10-minute transaction block to increase to either 8MB or 20MB to handle larger volumes, others prefer the status quo.\n\nBitTorrent protocol creator Bram Cohen wrote in a blog post titled Bitcoin\'s Ironic Crisis yesterday that 1MB block sizes are preferable, as this would lead to more competition in transaction fees and in turn benefit the miners who keep the network secure.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

My name is Ofir, I’m 36 years old and I live in Tel Aviv, Israel. I have discovered the world of Bitcoin on April 2013 and since then have been a big supporter of the Bitcoin community.\n\nI started this website since I saw there was no practical non technical guide for Bitcoin newbies – everything was just too hard to understand. The initial website talked about various ways to buy Bitcoins but the site quickly grew from there.\n\n\n\nSince I’ve started 99 Bitcoins it has grown immensely and today we are helping more than 1.4 million new Bitcoiners each month. 99 Bitcoins is the largest information source for non technical newbies – including Bitcoin Basics, Bitcoin trading tips and techniques and even information about mining Bitcoins. My main role is to coordinate our team’s efforts and write the occasional blog post.\n\nI won’t give you my whole life story here but just so you’ll get to know me better here are a few details. In my spare time I fly helicopters, read comic books and work out. I absolutely ADORE swimming, I got into it after I suffered a back injury and couldn’t run anymore. My MacBook goes everywhere I go and it’s one of my most prized possessions (right after my wife and 2 dogs).\n\nMy main interest in the Internet world is in Internet marketing and today I give talks around the world about how to market Bitcoin startups – kind of combining my two passions of Bitcoin and marketing. Aside from me there are 7 other team members that help keep 99Bitcoins active, and now it’s time for a short introduction to each of them.\n\nIf you want to send me encrypted emails this is my public key.\n\nMichael Gusev – Lead developer\n\nMichael lives in Germany although he’s originally from Belarus. He deals with all of the technical aspects of the sites. He basically makes sure that the site is kept up and running even during all of the Bitcoin price rollercoasters. I don’t think I’ve ever met a motivated and talented developer like him in the past.\n\nZsofia Elek – Customer support\n\nZsofia lives in Hungry. She takes care of our readers’ questions. Zsofia started mining first Bitcoin then later some altcoins with the available AMD GPUs together with her brother. Although her mining activity has stopped by now her passion about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies remains.\n\nBrian Booker – Writer\n\nOriginally from Malaysia, today lives in the US Brian is our news guy. He writes up all of the weekly news updates and makes sure to keep everyone in the loop of what’s new in the Bitcoin arena.\n\nSteven Hey – Writer\n\nA former futures trader. Steven’s keen interest in matters financial, economic and political eventually led him to conclude that the current, debt-based fiat system is broken. It was a natural step from there to investing in gold and, in early 2013, Bitcoin.\n\n“John” Nicholo Meneses – Company presenter\n\n“John” as we call him on 99Bitcoins talks, thinks makes and builds things for a living. On 99Bitcoins “John” is kind our company presenter. Whenever we need a friendly face to explain something Bitcoin related we go to him.\n\nNate Martin – Video expert\n\nBefore coming on to host Bitcoin Whiteboard Tuesday, Nate was pretty much a newbie to cryptocurrencies. Only through his first episode of hosting did his interest get piqued. Nate believes that Bitcoin and blockchain technology represent an economic paradigm shift upon which new markets, and new fortunes, will be made.\n\nAs you’ve probably noticed our team is spread throughout the globe. We do not have any physical office, each of us works from his own location in a different time zone.

He has worked as a Founding Board Director for The Bitcoin Foundation and is currently an Editorial Board Member for CoinDesk. Matonis is also an advisor for major Bitcoin entities like Epiphyte, BitPay, and GoCoin. In addition, he’s also working on the pending global bitcoin exchange located in the EU.\n\nThus, what he says has a certain gravitas and experience that can’t be ignored. This is why his recent tweets regarding Bitcoin and the block size debate have led to some rumblings and controversy.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to Matonis to get some clarification on his stance of the limit and other issues he is working on to improve the mainstream utility of digital currency.\n\n“The Bitcoin ecosystem will soon need a reference interest rate similar to LIBOR.” - Jon Matonis\n\n.@morcosa Block size hard fork debate is instructive because it\'s precursor to inevitable fork revising block reward that increases 21m cap. — Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) June 19, 2015\n\nPreventing the Bitcoin block reward from halving in July 2016 is the evil twin of a block size increase. — Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) June 19, 2015\n\nIf Bitcoin Tx fees continue to be insignificant because of excess block capacity, either hashrate drops or miners demand more inflation. — Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) June 19, 2015\n\nCoinTelegraph: Your recent tweets have drawn some controversy. It can be construed as you are advocating removing the cap limit of 21 million bitcoins. Is this what you are advocating?\n\nJon Matonis: Of course, I don\'t want to change the 21 million Bitcoin cap; I\'m just saying that in the not-too-distant future someone will attempt it. One doesn\'t have to own BTC in order to propagate bitcoin software across the nodes in a propagation war. I would have preferred to have seen the existing BIP process utilized for this purpose so that the compromises can be worked out pre-propagation.\n\nThe rigorous infrastructure for code review and testing similar to the IETF is what Bitcoin protocol currently lacks and that\'s even more of a reason to reinforce the existing BIP process. It demonstrates code maturity. Yes, independent software propagation with time-released changes to hard fork the consensus chain should be there only as an absolute last resort. I simply think the trigger on that option was pulled too early.\n\n“Accounts at a money service business or financial institution can certainly be linked to identity, but the individual coins (or coin subunits) themselves cannot be.”\n\nCT: In your travels, you have worked with governments and regulators. How are they handling this new technology when it comes to integrating it with currently established systems?\n\nJM: As I am a participant on the Gibraltar Digital Currency Task Force, I also get the opportunity to brief other government regulators on the limitations involved in regulating their national currencies and Bitcoin. Even though, they are usually smaller and more responsive regimes; the issues are mostly the same.\n\nHow do we guarantee the bitcoin balances held on behalf of customers when those do not fall under bank deposit insurance schemes? Mostly, this is being addressed through a combination of cryptographic proof-of-reserves, best practices on cold wallet backup and recovery, and third-party insurance underwriters.\n\nAlso, how can they be in compliance with the spirit of global AML if they do not have a method of verifiably linking client identity to inbound and/or outbound transactions?\n\nThere is not really an answer for this because handling BTC is similar to handling cash. Whitelisting, blacklisting, and redlisting are not suitable solutions either because they damage overall bitcoin fungibility. Accounts at a money service business or financial institution can certainly be linked to identity, but the individual coins (or coin subunits) themselves cannot be.\n\n“[F]ungibility is the cornerstone of any viable payment system.”\n\nCT: How important is Fungibility and Privacy to the functionality of Bitcoin?\n\nJM: The problem with coin forensics is that it only provides an inconclusive statistical probability of taint that is not a very strong case. I refer to it as “Compliance Theater"" because banks want to feel that they are doing something, but it is ultimately ineffective and counterproductive. Plausible deniability will always exist, and then there is the further issue of political enemies sending someone else tainted coins that could have the effect of tainting the entire wallet of the recipient. This route is fraught with dangers.\n\nPrivacy, which means coins unlinked to identity, is a prerequisite for fungibility. And, fungibility is the cornerstone of any viable payment system. Therefore, governments that are proposing to regulate the way that their national currencies are bought and sold for bitcoin in their jurisdiction must take extra special care in preserving overall Bitcoin fungibility. It becomes incumbent upon them to play a role in maintaining, not harming, Bitcoin\'s fungibility.\n\nCT: So what are you working and focusing on now?\n\nJM: The Bitcoin ecosystem will soon need a reference interest rate similar to LIBOR. I am promoting the concept of BIBOR (Bitcoin Inter Broker Offered Rate). This reference rate is important in striking contracts, making loans, and for brokers providing bitcoin to potential short sellers. According to broker loan rates, the current implied annual interest rate for bitcoin is 26.5% (.0644 per day compounded x 365 days).\n\nJon Matonis will be speaking at the London Block Chain Conference on Wednesday with the focus of how the innovations of block chain technology can be integrated into large corporations and financial startups.']"
06/24/2015,"[""Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. has named San Francisco-based startup Chain as its partner for a pilot, announced in May, to test Bitcoin technology for the trading of shares in private companies.\n\nFounded in 2014, Chain provides infrastructure to financial institutions wanting to use the blockchain, which is the technology underlying the digital currency Bitcoin, in their products and services. The blockchain enables entities to digitally transfer money and other assets directly, securely and near instantaneously.\n\nNasdaq will be testing the blockchain in Nasdaq Private Market, which is a marketplace for pre-IPO trading of shares in private companies; launched in January 2014, it so far has more than 75 clients.\n\n”We are excited about the potential impact of this new endeavor with Chain on the transaction process,” Bob Greifeld, CEO of Nasdaq, said in a statement, adding that the manual process of tracking shares can be overwhelming. “As blockchain technology continues to redefine not only how the exchange sector operates, but the global financial economy as a whole, Nasdaq aims to be at the center of this watershed development,” he said.\n\nThe first company whose shares will trade on the blockchain will be Chain itself in the pilot expected to launch later this year.\n\nManaging the shares of private companies has long been an expensive, labor-intensive process involving lots of paper, as well as spreadsheets, lawyers and sometimes filing cabinets or bank vaults. Despite all the expense and effort, a lot of what is represented on those papers is often outdated, as employees are terminated or as they purchase the stock underlying their options.\n\nIn recent years, several companies have sprung up to offer software that manages a company’s capitalization table — a record of who owns what in a company -- thereby replacing spreadsheets as well as paper stock certificates, paper options grants and paper convertible notes.\n\nWhile the blockchain has an obvious advantage over paper for cap table management, it is also superior to software, says Adam Ludwin, Chain CEO. “It currently costs a lot of money to make sure there are no mistakes, even when you’re using [software], because there are human factors involved in the transfer, recording and valuation work around securities.”\n\nThe blockchain, in contrast, allows for every transaction to take place securely and be recorded on a public ledger, copies of which are held by computers all around the world and then continuously synced so that each ledger agrees with all the others about when money or assets have been transferred, how much, and which party sent and which received.\n\nLet’s say a private company wanted to use the blockchain to issue shares to employees. It would send each employee a nominal amount of money (a hundred-millionth of a bitcoin), on which would be coded metadata stating how many shares of the company are being transferred along with it. If, later, employees wanted to sell all or part of those shares to an investor, a liquidity company could be created to hold the shares of all employees wanting to sell. They would then transfer their stock shares to that liquidity partner’s wallet, and investors could buy those shares. Each transaction would only move a tiny fraction of bitcoin encoded with the number of shares -- not an amount in bitcoin equal to the value of the shares themselves. If the pilot goes well, the system could be rolled out to more private companies in Nasdaq Private Market and even the public exchange. Ludwin says the grand vision would be to apply it to mergers and acquisitions, to equity and debt, and to domestic and international markets.\n\nLudwin says another advantage the blockchain has over software is that companies would likely rather trust the blockchain than a third party for maintaining their records: “I think most companies think of themselves as wanting to operate for many, many years. One of the benefits of having this immutable public ledger being the record-keeping mechanism of that is you know it’s not going anywhere. You can trace back every action and activity on the company for a very long time.”\n\nPart of the reason companies may be seeking better ways to manage cap tables is the fact that companies are choosing to stay private longer, even after their valuation has risen past $1 billion. In the late '90s, the median time between first funding for venture-backed firms and their initial public offering ranged from two-and-a-half to just over three years. From 2012 to 2014, it’s hovered around seven years, according to the National Venture Capital Association [pdf], with many well-known firms such as Dropbox, SpaceX and Airbnb choosing to stay private despite valuations of $10 billion or more.\n\nThe Nasdaq partnership with Chain is also part of another trend — that of Wall Street beginning to explore the possibilities offered by digital currencies and/or the blockchain. In the first half of this year, several major Wall Street institutions, including Goldman Sachs and the New York Stock Exchange, announced investments in or partnerships with Bitcoin startups. And a number of long-time Wall Street players and financial regulators left their positions to head up or join Bitcoin companies or were named to their boards."", 'SEATTLE, June 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- You might ask yourself, ""How do I get bitcoin?""

They weren’t built properly. A lot of customers lost their money.”\n\nNevertheless, DigaTrade enters a crowded market. Vancouver alone is already home to the digital-currency exchanges Cointrader (acquired by Newnote Financial Corp. in March), Quadriga CX, and Taurus.\n\nMoynes said he’s looking to compete with the major international exchanges, such as U.K.–based Bitstamp.\n\nDigaTrade, which uses technology from Hong Kong–based ANX, will allow people from around the world to trade the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ripple, and Stellar for Canadian dollars and vice versa. Support for the U.S. dollar, British pound, and euro will be added soon after launch.\n\n“Our API [application program interface] order book goes out on to the Internet and sources out the best price worldwide,” Moynes said, explaining how DigaTrade is different than the other locally based exchanges. “We usually source the bitcoins from the exchanges in China, like Bitfinex, BTC China, and OKCoin.”\n\nBit-X, formerly an oil-and-gas exploration firm known as Rainchief Energy, will require DigaTrade users to produce a passport or driver’s licence, a bank statement, and a utility bill in order to verify their identities and locations. Users will pay a commission of 0.5 percent on limit orders and 0.75 percent on market orders.\n\nMoynes likened the state of Bitcoin to the Internet in 1996.\n\n“I think that there’s going to be a lot of developments and a lot of innovation, and a lot of things are going happen later this year and next year,” Moynes said. “We’re just starting to see venture-capital funds come into the sector. We’re now north of US$700 million into the sector, which is just the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nBit-X shares are traded over the counter under the symbol BITXF on the OTCQB.', 'A deal between bitcoin exchange Quoine and payments network Econtext will allow more than 20,000 online and eventually physical merchants to accept bitcoin in Japan.\n\nThe move essentially allows merchants that already use Econtext\'s payment processing services in thousands of online stores to accept bitcoin payments without the need for a bitcoin-specific processor. The service will be available for businesses to use today.\n\nQuoine CEO Mario Gomez Lozada said his company had entered into discussions with Econtext last year, and has since done extensive integration work to connect it to Quoine\'s payments platform.\n\nGomez Lozada told CoinDesk:\n\n""For us, it\'s a pretty significant deal.""\n\nAccording to Gomez Lozada, Econtext has signed up a couple of merchants to accept bitcoin already and is actively approaching others.\n\nThe partnership could spur a large increase in the number of bitcoin-accepting merchants in Japan, where adoption has been slower than in other nations due to negative media attention from the Mt Gox insolvency.\n\nHow the system works\n\nQuoine\'s exchange interfaces with the merchant\'s checkout system, supplying a bitcoin price for the merchant to quote to the customer.\n\nThe quoted rate is locked in for both customer and merchant for 30 minutes, even if bitcoin fluctuates wildly in that time. Econtext supplies a payment method selection screen for its merchants to use, which will now feature a bitcoin option and display QR codes customers can use to make the payment.\n\nThe company is a recently-acquired subsidiary of Digital Garage Inc, a Japan-based technology investment company.

What remains unclear is whether the company is still actively adding to its holdings from bitcoin sales.\n\nIn its latest SEC filing, the company noted that it receives all bitcoin payments via a third party denominated in US dollars.\n\nThe company wrote:\n\n""At present we do not accept bitcoin payments directly, but use a third party vendor to accept bitcoin payments on our behalf. That third party vendor then immediately converts the bitcoin payments into US dollars so that we receive payment for the product sold at the sales price in US dollars.""\n\nIn addition to cryptocurrency, Overstock also holds nearly $10m in gold and silver as well as interest and equity in businesses that will help facilitate its plan to build a decentralized stock market.\n\nClarification given\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Overstock cryptocurrency group general manager Judd Bagley indicated that the loss was primarily the result of declines in certain altcoin markets in which the company has invested.\n\n""The swing in the value of our cryptocurrency holdings is attributable to the sale of some of our non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, the use of some of our bitcoin to pay for services including our membership in the Chamber of Digital Commerce, and changes in the market,"" he said.\n\nHe went on to clarify that the company ""holds more than just bitcoin"", but did not clarify which digital currencies Overstock has invested in.\n\nBagley stated that, in its quarterly filing, the holdings are considered a part of the same asset class.\n\n""We’ve invested in other cryptocurrencies over time, and for the purposes of the SEC filing, we lump them all together,"" he continued.\n\nRisky business\n\nElsewhere, cryptocurrencies are listed as a potential legal risk for the company, with Overstock noting that penalties for non-compliance with local laws governing cryptocurrencies could ""negatively impact"" the business.\n\nOverstock was also upfront about the risks it faces carrying out its decentralized stock market project, Medici, writing that it does not have significant internal experience with this type of project, and that it may be expensive or ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nSuch language, though, is used broadly and throughout the filing, with Overstock noting its attempts to brand the company as O.co overseas may also fail to gain traction.\n\nDespite the risks, however, the filing suggests Overstock will continue to be long on its investment in bitcoin as a speculative asset.\n\n""In the future, we may transact in cryptocurrency directly or increase our cryptocurrency holdings,"" the filing states.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Ripple Labs, maintainer of the digital currency Ripple, has announced it will not continue the development of its smart contract project nearly a year after it was announced, saying the “small and nascent decentralization market” is too immature.\n\nIn a blog post, Ripple Labs CTO Stefan Thomas wrote that the company, which recently raised a $28 million funding round, has no plans to work on Codius, a platform that allows people to build distributed applications, and will instead build its own decentralized apps “manually.” He cited a lack of demand as the biggest reason why the project was closed.\n\n“Codius is just a way to make decentralization easier,"" Thomas wrote, ""it\'s an optimization, you don\'t need it,” but “If there is demand and corresponding supply there is an obvious incentive for somebody to capitalize on this opportunity.”\n\nCodius’ source code can be found on its Github and is free for anyone to tinker or build with.\n\nNot as decentralized, not as costly\n\nAnnounced in July, 2014, Codius set out to build a platform that smart contract-distributed apps could be built on top of. Unlike decentralized Bitcoin apps, this platform would use hosting providers, like the ones that run many websites, to host the decentralized applications — not a decentralized network. The Codius project was devised to make the process of setting up your smart contract app in a hosting provider automated and streamlined.\n\nWhile relying on centralized entities that require trust may not bode well with many bitcoin advocates – unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system – Codius is much cheaper both in terms of computing power and electricity. (Both systems have advantages and disadvantages).\n\nWhen Ripple announced the project, it said an industry like the one that was created around digital currencies would emerge around smart contracts. That vision hasn\'t materialized yet, although there has been recent interest in the space with two smart contract startups having just raised multiple-million dollar funding rounds.\n\nIt did get inquiries from a “significant” number of developers and companies, but ultimately, Ripple Labs saw the low demand as not enough to justify continuing the project.\n\nThe future\n\nAlthough Codius 1.0 was released earlier this year, much remains in the way of the advancement of the smart contract platform. In order to make the process further automated and secure, hosting providers will need to verify the programs being run by these smart contracts by certifying cryptographically what code they are running.\n\nOther challenges remain in the highly fragmented world of online standards. Codius relies on being able to automatically pay hosting providers, but without a clear Web payment standard (like Bitcoin), that is a continued challenge. Ripple Labs did say it was looking forward to completion of the work by the World Wide Web Consortium on this front. The other challenge cited by the company was differences in hosting providers’ APIs, causing problems for Codius.\n\nRipple Labs seems optimistic that a lot of the problems will be solved as the industry matures. The company said it will continue working on its own distributed applications (possibly for all those banks it has been partnering with recently) and advised others doing the same, or interested in doing so, to join the Codius mailing list.', 'Over the past few years, it’s become easier than ever for artists to share their work online — but stealing credit is just as simple. A Berlin-based startup is looking to change that, using Bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nAscribe wants to enable artists to own their intellectual property and transfer or sell it, without having to rely on a third party for help with the legalities.\n\nThe company is using Bitcoin’s distributed blockchain to allow artists to register their works. As the owners of their intellectual property, they can defend it from theft and misuse, transfer it to others or sell it securely.\n\nBecause all its records are stored in a publicly accessible database, artists can protect their claims of ownership on this independent registry.\n\nMore than just JPGs\n\nAscribe isn’t just for digital art, photography and design — it also works with physical art like sculpture and installations. All you need to do to register your creation is take a picture and upload it to Ascribe.\n\nThe company’s technology attributes scarcity of digital works, thereby giving them legitimate value, just like a one-of-a-kind painting or a limited edition photo print.\n\nUsing Ascribe’s service, artists can distribute their work on their terms. For example, a photographer can loan their latest series to a gallery online, and then sell a small number of each piece to interested buyers. Other copies of those photographs may exist online, but as they aren’t accounted for by the creator, they are simply counterfeits.\n\nSimilarly, an online marketplace can securely sell work that’s registered with Ascribe to collectors, who can rest assured that they are the sole owners of a piece of art they’ve purchased.\n\nThe end of piracy?\n\nAscribe’s blockchain-based technology can trace the journey of any registered file to track its distribution — giving rights holders a way to prove their ownership and a better chance of prosecuting anyone who may have stolen their work.\n\nThe company is also working on machine learning technology that can identify copied work on the Web, even if it’s had its watermarks digitally removed.\n\nThe way forward\n\nAscribe currently has more than 600 artists signed up for its service (which is free for creators), with 2,600 digital works and unique editions registered. A dozen marketplaces and platforms have also signed on to use its API.\n\nThe company has just secured $2 million in seed funding from numerous investors. CEO Bruce Pon says it will use its funds to improve its site for artists to register their work, bring aboard more developers to help marketplaces integrate Ascribe’s technology and continue its outreach programs to spread the word among artists across the globe.\n\n?

Really?\n\nRead next: Join 1,500 companies at our New York conference', 'Bitcoin hardware wallet provider Case Wallet Inc. has raised USD $1.5 million in an equity seed funding round led by FuturePerfect Ventures, participated in by RRE Ventures, High Line Venture Partners and the Rochester Institute of Technology Fund.\n\nThe company launched its hardware wallet at TechCrunch NY on May 4, and has been receiving preorders for the first batch of the multisig, multi-factor and credit-card-size hardware bitcoin wallets set to be shipped this summer.\n\nWith the new financing, the company aims to search for other possible usages for its secure signing device that utilizes biometric data. According to the company, Case already has gained the interest of well-established financial institutions that hope to implement the system to handle sensitive user data.\n\nThe Case hardware wallet has several features and functionalities that complete a biometric data security and authorization system. Specifically, by using three main components of the device – a fingerprint scanner, a camera and a GSM chip in the hardware wallet – transactions are authorized or sent with fingerprint information, which are then processed on Case’s servers. Once the verification in its servers is complete, the transactions are signed by the Case servers and propagated to the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe Case wallet uses a multisig solution with three different private keys to ensure the security of bitcoin in case of a hacking attack or a data breach. One private key is kept by the user, the second is held by the company, and the third backup is controlled by a cryptographic key management solutions provider, Third Key Solutions, founded by Andreas Antonopoulos and Pamela Morgan.\n\nAccording to the Case team, the same system that is used by Case bitcoin hardware wallet could be implemented to grant access to data and verify transactions in platforms of financial institutions, banks and organizations. The company is currently in the process of seeking partnerships with financial organizations to increase consumer adoption of its multi-layered biometric data security devices and system.\n\n""As more important assets move to the blockchain (contracts, property and identity), having a completely secure way to store and transfer those assets becomes even more paramount,"" Case CEO Melanie Shapiro told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n""We\'re interested in not only servicing the consumer holding bitcoin, but also providing the banks using blockchain technology the power to manage who has the authority to execute transactions,"" she said. ""We\'ve built something far more robust and institution-friendly than traditional 2FA tokens.""\n\nAs global financial organizations, banks and stock markets have begun to show interests in using the blockchain technology to optimize their systems, Case plans to continue searching for ways to integrate its biometric security system to settle transactions in many applications.\n\n“The recent announcement that the Nasdaq is piloting blockchain technologies for different use cases underscores the promise of the technology, and Case is poised to provide trusted, decentralized and biometrically secure signing of those and similar transactions,"" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\n""We’re looking forward to providing uncompromised security and ease-of-use for bitcoin buyers, sellers and users, to unlock the potential of bitcoin and blockchain technologies,"" Shapiro said. ""Making highly secure signing and authentication available across a variety of applications is just the beginning.”\n\nCase enters a market currently led by two popular hardware wallets commercially available, Ledger wallet and Trezor, both of which recently released multisig updates earlier this year. However, Case wallet is unique in the marketplace because of its simplicity and features that do not require users to link the wallet to another device, such as a smartphone or computer, in order to set up a secure multisig wallet.The company has also appointed Stephen Schultz as CTO as part of the plans for the new investment and to increase market adoption of its bitcoin hardware wallets. With over 20 years of experience in different technological platforms, Schultz is set to oversee the development of the company’s biometric data based security system and solutions.', 'Market Thoughts\n\nBy now everyone is attempting to explain the reason for the big Bitcoin price move last week. Many in the space are convinced Bitcoin’s price is about to go exponential once again, and are happy that they called it right. On the other side many technical analysts, that were sticking with the trend, were expecting a retest of yearly lows and will now have to put those thoughts on hold. It is really difficult to find the catelist for the move because the volume was nothing special, compared to similar size moves in the recent past.\n\nTaking a look at macro economics there has not been anything of note. The potential that the people of Greece, or other nations on the verge of a Sovereign Debt Default, have been moving their cash into Bitcoin is probably a bit of a stretch just yet. However, there were a few other interesting things in the headlines this week.\n\nA UK Company Elliptic introduced their Bitcoin Big Bang project. Basically it’s a tool to remove all thoughts of pseudo anonymity in Bitcoin transactions. The goal of the project is to show banks and other large financial institutions the history of the bitcoins, which they are considering to accept for business, so that they would know if the bitcoins have been used in illegal activity. Almost instantly news also hit the wires that other companies are looking to go in the completely opposite direction and provide more anonymity for the users and their bitcoins, which is what Blockstream is working on with their “Confidential Transactions”.\n\nWhat we now have to figure out is how will either, or both, of these initiatives would affect Bitcoin’s Price. At the moment, Bitcoin still has a serious identity crisis. It can’t possibly exist in a world where money and especially cash is being criminalized. So either bitcoins will embrace the anonymity side of the Blockchain, and accept the consequences of all Bitcoin transactions deemed criminal in countries where Government seeks full control over the population, or is it worth giving up the features that have gotten Bitcoin this far - taking a gamble that this is what is needed for mass adoption.\n\nIt is hard to say which is the better path, but as long this uncertainty remains, mass adoptions is a long way away. Billions in Free Market wealth and Billions in Government approved wealth will remain on the sidelines. Bitcoin did just fine back when the main use case was Silk Road, and donations to Wikileaks, and the one thing no one wants to acknowledge is the fact that just because a technology is optimal for activities Governments disapprove off, this does not in any way imply that it is not optimal for everything.\n\nFrom a purely economic perspective, what Elliptic is bringing to the world is a detriment to global economics. The world economy is slowing down and money velocity is plummeting. One of the main reasons is the constant increase in regulations and the criminalization of financial transactions. Those without Government connections are pretty much guilty till proven innocent when it comes to AML standards. In order for most of the indebted Governments to remain solvent they now need to hunt down every penny of tax revenue, hence initiatives like FATCA will only accelerate the global slowdown.\n\nBitcoin will suffer the same fate as the US Dollar, as regulations on financial transactions are increased, and people are scared to use it because they do not know if they are criminals. This is something Elliptic should consider as they release their initiative into the world. We have also seen the steep rise in the US Dollar, and if you combine the rise in the purchasing power of the dollar, the velocity of that same dollar is plummeting as seen in the FRED chart. The only logical conclusion to be made is that people across the world are running to the dollar and saving/hoarding it away for a rainy day.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nClearly Bitcoin is a long way from figuring out its true purpose, so we once again go back to the charts and try to make sense of what the consensus of traders think.\n\nThe arrows were left as they were the last few weeks indicating that, on a longer-term basis, we are still in a downtrend. There are definitely some positive signs, but even at the high mark it was just a touch of major resistance, and as the green arrow indicates long trades should not be in consideration until this resistance is clearly broken.\n\nThe zoomed in view with additional indicators is giving us something to really keep an eye on. It is pretty clear right now that Simple Moving Averages matter as the 3 month high last week touched the 200-day SMA perfectly before retreating almost $20 dollars to $240, twice. The good news is that we have cleared the 50-day SMA and as long as we remain above it, it is possible we are looking at a trend change.\n\nAlso notice that this was the outcome that was expected back in March on the break of the Ascending Triangle, which broke down in the less probabilistic directions. Ideally you want to see these moving averages cross to indicate some real strength in the rally. For now, it is probably best to consider this area between the averages as a watch zone while a move back under the 50-day being bearish and a move over the 200-day being bullish. The RSI was also hitting the overbought levels on this move for the first time in 3 months so it might need some time to cool off a bit.\n\nThis chart is getting really busy at this point, where both bulls and bears have good reasons for their positions. To add to the bear camp, another descending triangle has been added to the chart, even though the last few triangle patterns have not worked out, and the 50-day SMA support is only a few points away.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe big question one has to consider is if we are finally on the verge of a trend change. If the answer is yes, then there is no rush to get into long trades now, there will be plenty of time for that. Here is a typical image of what a trend change looks like. As you can see, it usually involves breaking out to a new high, labeled point 1, then dropping to test the area of the breakout which should now serve as support , point 2. Then break out one more time to new highs, point 3.\n\nApplying this to the current movement in Bitcoin, we have definitely formed point 1 but not 2 and 3. Aggressive long term bullish traders might look to pick up bitcoins when they feel point 2 has been created, which in an ideal world would be a bounce off the 50-day Simple Moving Average.\n\nThis article was completed on Wednesday June 24 5:00 pm ET, when BraveNewCoins Index showed Bitcoin price at $242 USD.\n\nTone Vays will be a speaker at the upcoming Inside Bitcoins Chicago Conference July 10-11.\n\nDisclaimer: The price projections above are just the opinions of one trader.

06/25/2015,"['A new survey published by Goldman Sachs has found that just over half of US millennials believe they will never use bitcoin.\n\nFifty-one percent of the 752 survey respondents said that they had never used bitcoin nor do they have any plans to do so. Twenty-two percent said they currently use it or have used it in the past, and intend to use it again.\n\nAn additional 22% said that they have never used bitcoin before but plan on using the digital currency. Just 5% of respondents said they have used bitcoin but do not intend to use it again.\n\nThe data forms part of a broader look at the financial inclinations of millennials, including how the demographic chooses financial services and how they manage money.\n\nAmong a group of payment options that included credit cards, Apple Pay and Square, bitcoin wallets scored relatively low in terms of trust. Less than 5% of respondents indicated they trust using wallet services, with Coinbase and BitPay being named directly in the survey data.\n\nFew privacy concerns\n\nNotably, a significant number of respondents displayed a general apathy toward financial privacy.\n\nGoldman asked how willing millennials would be to ""accept inconveniences"" in exchange for reduced privacy and better security.\n\nThirty-four percent of male respondents and 48% of female respondents said that they were “not too bothered” as long as their service isn’t directly affected.\n\nTwenty-two percent said that they are in favor of sacrificing privacy for the sake of security, whereas 20% of survey-takers replied that they weren’t willing to give up financial privacy.\n\nThirteen percent said that they are happy to accept loss of privacy for higher security, while 11% indicated that they didn’t care because they presume the government is already monitoring their transactions.\n\nRespondents also expressed a high aversion to fees, with many suggesting that the costs would be a major influence in their choice of financial provider.\n\nImage credit via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

We currently settle at T+3 [within 3 days]. Why not settle in 5-10 minutes?”\n\nChain Bitcoin API\n\nBitcoin API startup Chain is set to provide Nasdaq with the infrastructure and simplified API for the Bitcoin blockchain. Its easy interface to transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain will simplify the process of trading shares and assets in Nasdaq’s pilot test.\n\n“It currently costs a lot of money to make sure there are no mistakes, even when you’re using [software], because there are human factors involved in the transfer, recording and valuation work around securities,” explained Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain.\n\nStock exchanges have spent millions of dollars in handling transactions and shares of private companies over the last decades.\n\nThe process of trading shares on the stock exchanges has always required labor-intensive operations, from managing spreadsheets to the completion of documents and the approval of lawyers. With the help of Chain and Nasdaq, Bitcoin may prove to be the solution to the long-time problems of stock exchanges.\n\nChain has rasied $15 million USD in funding from Khosla Ventures, RRE Ventures and SV Angel. Within its first year of launch, the Chain API has been used by more than 3,000 developers creating Bitcoin apps and platforms.\n\nWith the growing popularity of Chain’s API, the Bitcoin startup’s shares are set to be the first to be traded on the blockchain upon the launch of the project later this year. The issued shares of Chain is set to be coded into a very small amount of bitcoin with metadata that states necessary information for shares trading: number of shares being transferred, receiver, and seller.\n\nPhoto: Times Sq. still weird even after all these years / Photopin', ""What is Bitcoin and what will it become? To believers, it’s the future of money, privacy and payments, the end of greedy banks and the fall of government fiat currencies. To critics, it’s an elaborate scam, the currency of cyber villains, a threat to sovereign states. To others, it’s already nothing, practically dead on arrival.\n\nOne thing's for sure: There’s no shortage of strong opinions about the world’s first digital cash, particularly, it seems, amongst people with billions of the traditional kind.\n\nTake Peter Thiel, for example. The PayPal co-founder predicts that Satoshi Nakamoto’s six-year-old invention will forever change the world as a currency. Not so much as a payment network, however. Mark Cuban gives Bitcoin props as a viable “digital accounting transport mechanism,” but thinks it has “no shot” as a long-term cryptocurrency. Bill Gates acknowledges that Bitcoin essentially revolutionized cross-border transactions, but says it can’t be Money 2.0, not in its current state at least. Warren Buffett, meanwhile, isn’t having any of it. He has cast the nationless geek’s gold off as a “joke.”\n\nGame-changing or not, Bitcoin is anything but a joke to a growing number of entrepreneurs throughout the globe, risk-taking trailblazers dead serious about pinning their livelihoods on it.

The two most common problems? Online merchants who don’t deliver the product on time — or at all — and merchants who give refunds in store credit, rather than currency.""\n\nThe post was released with an infographic that sought to illustrate this pain point, showcasing a return process where a consumer spends $100 in bitcoin, only to be refunded $75 due to the fluctuating value of the digital currency.\n\nCohen goes on to recommend that those who buy items with bitcoin first check the seller\'s reputation before exploring how the payment will be processed by the merchant.\n\n""If you pay with bitcoins, the only way to get a refund is through the seller or payment processor, so it’s important to choose companies you trust,"" the post states.\n\nRefund and return\n\nOne common problem, the FTC suggests, is the differing ways merchants that accept bitcoin handle the refund process.\n\nAccordingly, Cohen recommends US consumers determine the merchant\'s policies regarding damaged goods, the exchange rate that will be used for refunds and how the refund will be processed before proceeding with a sale.\n\n""Because people can change their virtual wallet accounts, a seller can’t always send a bitcoin back to the wallet it came from,"" the agency cautions.\n\nThe FTC also instructs consumers to ask how their financial information will be protected given the wallet addresses that execute bitcoin transactions will be available in the technology\'s public ledger, the blockchain.\n\n""If the seller uses a payment processor, check its privacy policy, too. A recent FTC report found many shopping apps had privacy policies that included broad rights to collect, use, and share data,"" she continues.\n\nThe post concludes with information on how consumers may file complaints with the FTC.\n\nWake-up call\n\nThe FTC\'s writings were further highlighted in a subsequent advisory issued by law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP to its clients that sought to highlight conclusions for firms operating in the digital currency industry.\n\nWriting on behalf of the firm, Carol Van Cleef and Linda Goldstein suggest that the post could foreshadow more formal actions by the agency against industry participants.\n\n""The blog post makes clear that the FTC believes it is very important consumers in these transactions be made fully aware of all of the material terms of the merchant’s return and refund policies since these payments do not enjoy the same legal protections as credit card payments,"" the authors write.\n\nVan Cleef and Goldstein sought to portray the advice to consumers as potentially significant for industry merchants and processors.\n\n""Sellers and processors in consumer transactions involving virtual currency should expect the FTC to scrutinize their privacy policies and procedures like those of sellers and processors in other types of transactions,"" the authors write.\n\nThe guidance goes on to conclude that the industry should treat the blog post as a ""wake-up call"" about the need for merchants and processors to address privacy concerns.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

For some regions, BitINKA’s bitcoin exchange and wallet platform will be the first bitcoin-related application to be introduced.\n\nTargeting Mainstream Bitcoin Adoption and the Unbanked\n\nAccording to the BitINKA team, the biggest market of South America is based on day-to-day expenses, which includes e-commerce, convenience stores, taxis, kiosks (small stores), etc. However, credit card penetration is substantially low in South American countries and thus, is often not used apart from e-commerce platforms. Furthermore, banks and financial institutions require a long list of documents and qualifications for bank accounts, and credit cards including two government approved licenses, tax income of at least two years, and financial statements from at least two different financial institutions.\n\nPierna Caballero, the co-administrator of BitINKA told Bitcoin Magazine “In some countries where Bitinka operates, people are educating themselves recently to use Bitcoin and they are realizing that is something very easy and also is a currency that people themselves control. In Peru for example this is something new and gradually has captured the public interest, in Bolivia it is prohibited Bitcoin as a payment method, so Bitinka works as a virtual wallet for businesses and users affiliates.”\n\nBitcoin is widely used in countries like Argentina, where well-established bitcoin payment processing startups and exchanges like BitPagos are based in. BitPagos is one of the most prominent bitcoin merchant payment platform which raised over US$600,000 in a funding round participated by Tim Draper and Barry Silbert. The startup is already close to processing US$1 million per month.\n\nHowever, bitcoin is still unfamiliar to a large number of people in the continent. BitINKA aims to help those unfamiliar with the benefits of the digital currency to easily accept, trade and receive payments using bitcoin.Caballero explained, “Brazil is a country that already use Bitcoin in different ways, as an investment, savings, etc. in Peru just a few people know Bitcoin, Peru is a country where new things are more difficult to be accepted so what we are doing with Bitinka is helping Bitcoin to incorporate in people's lives.”\n\nINTERVIEW WITH THE FOUNDER\n\n\n\n"", 'Bitcoin services company Coinplug has snatched the top prize in a financial technology competition sponsored by major banking group JB Financial Group.\n\nOver 100 companies vied for a total prize pool of 130m Korean won ($116,200) at the FinTech Frontiers Fair held in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nJB Financial Group is a financial services company with over 35.5 trillion Korean won ($32.3bn) in assets and 3,300 employees. It is one of the leading innovators of financial technology in East Asia.\n\nCoinplug\'s winning entry, which scored 50m KRW ($45,500), was a system utilizing the bitcoin blockchain to verify user identity in online transactions. It works by taking a cryptographic hash of a user\'s personal information and using that hash to create a certificate, which is then recorded on the blockchain as a transaction.\n\nThe blockchain\'s permanence means that information cannot be altered or modified once saved. Personal information is further protected from leaks, since Coinplug uses only the hashed information to verify, never seeing the original. No personal information needs to be stored at all.\n\nBenefits over existing systems\n\nCoinplug CEO Ryan Uhr told CoinDesk the system offered three main benefits: accessibility on more web browsers, security of private information, and reduced cost of issuance.\n\nThe blockchain system can be used in any web browser and does not require additional software such as ActiveX or NPAPI, which need plugins for proper operation. The certificates can also be re-issued easily on Coinplug\'s smartphone application.\n\nCoinplug is already in talks with several financial organizations who are interested in offering the service, and Uhr said winning first prize at a mainstream even definitely made other companies pay attention.\n\n""When blockchain-based authentication systems become a widely used method for financial transactions and e-commerce payments, there will be a very interesting and noticeable change in the market for user certification.""\n\nCost advantage\n\nSouth Korea\'s e-commerce and banking systems are currently required to authenticate users with Microsoft\'s ActiveX technology, running only on Windows and in the Internet Explorer browser (see details below).\n\nCoinplug\'s system would also deliver significant cost savings, Uhr added.\n\nThe current market size of Korea\'s user certificate system is around 120bn KRW ($110m), with each new certificate issuance for an individual running at 4,400 KRW ($4) and 110,000 KRW ($110) for a corporation. Registering instead through the blockchain would cost just the 0.0001 BTC (30 KRW, or 3 cents) transaction fee.\n\nCoinplug now needs to wait for official government approval to work its system into the national financial infrastructure.\n\nParticularly important for Korea\n\nCoinplug\'s use of blockchain technology could free Koreans from a legacy 1990s e-commerce law unique to that country, one that has prompted several security concerns.\n\nIn that decade, South Korea developed a local encryption system called SEED, designed to encourage e-commerce by providing user authentication with digital certificates. The only problem was that all e-commerce sites needed to verify the certificates with Microsoft\'s ActiveX plug-in.\n\nSince ActiveX is supported only on Windows, Korean users were locked into using that system and the Internet Explorer browser. ActiveX is known to have several security flaws, increasing risk of hacking attacks and personal information leaks, with even Microsoft now discouraging its use.\n\nThis system is only now beginning to disappear from Korean networks.

Iceland became one of the few jurisdictions to ban digital currency outright in March 2014.\n\nNow, with surprising yet groundbreaking changes in popular ideology in the country, the scope for change to occur could well become magnified in the run-up to the forthcoming general election in 2017.\n\n“We, the people, are the system,” Píratar’s leader Birgitta Jónsdóttir began in a recent TEDx talk earlier this month, a remark evocative of the decentralized principles whose implications remain excluded from the Icelandic economy.\n\nWhile commentators are unsure as to whether this spike in popularity of disruptive politics is a phase or part of a serious phenomenon, the figures to a large extent could be said to speak for themselves.\n\nPrior to the polls by Gallup and MMR, which placed Píratar on 34% and 35% of the vote respectively, Icelandic newspaper Fréttablaðið calculated in March that if elections had been held at the time, the party would have secured 14 seats in parliament, making it the second largest represented group.\n\n‘Switzerland of Bits’\n\nWhile explicit policies regarding disruption in the banking system have yet to surface from Jónsdóttir or others, much has been stated in the press regarding the party’s desire to improve digital freedom.\n\nIn an interview with Vice last year, Jónsdóttir recalled meeting with Julian Assange to realize a vision of making Iceland the “Switzerland of bits,” tackling the “extraordinary pressure” faced by those who undertake “serious journalism” there. Jónsdóttir added during June’s TEDx session, saying:', 'We know that Bitcoin is a great tool to bring about a financial revolution, and more importantly, it has tremendous potential to benefit the large population in under-developed or developing economies who have no access to the banks. A similar case has come to light where a Bitcoin-like money transfer service is serving over 17 million Bangladeshis and handles transactions in excess of 70 million daily.\n\nAccording to a splendid article on Wall Street Journal, Bangladesh’s leading mobile banking service bKash has emerged to be a boon for the nation which has a population of 160 million people but an appalling less than 30% of the population has a bank account.\n\nStore Your Funds in a Virtual Wallet\n\nbKash allows its users to store their funds in a virtual wallet which is easily accessible by a phone.\n\nWith transmitting money instantly and at a very less cost becoming a possibility for the industry workers, servants, drivers and others, this is a huge plus since they have to send money back home on a timely basis.\n\nThe Limitations\n\nEven though the system can be operated using a basic key-press mobile phone, there is still a large section of the population opposed to this idea.\n\nKamal Quadir, CEO of bKash said, “We understand that a lot of people don’t have the documents or feel they may make a mistake in sending the money, even though the system is really simple and can be done on a basic phone.”\n\nAdding to his worry are the repeated robberies occurring at bKash outlets. Ahsan Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, said that “although the bKash system is working well, it still doesn’t give you full protection because there is no insurance mechanism in place for something going wrong, either for the vendor who is managing it streetside or for the person who is paying.”\n\nFinal Note\n\nThere is a similarity between Bitcoin and bKash in the customers they can benefit the most, and the cheap yet reliable service they can offer. Also, the virtual wallet idea is easily comparable to the Bitcoin wallets. With the mobile payment industry expanding fast, we hope that Bitcoin can provide them with an even better, less expensive money transmitting option.', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article.""]"
06/26/2015,"[""Over the past few weeks, bitcoin has seen several major developments that many believed would help propel the cryptocurrency into mainstream use.\n\nFrom being used to purchased movie tickets to finding a place in traditional finance at Barclays PLC (NYSE: BCS), bitcoin appeared to be moving up in the world. However, a new survey by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) suggested that no matter how the bitcoin community has expanded, millennials are simply not interested in using the cryptocurrency.\n\nMajority Say No Future For Bitcoin\n\nThe Goldman Sachs survey found that of the 752 millennial respondents, just over half had no interest in using bitcoin in the future. Just over 40 percent said they planned to make use of bitcoin in the future. The survey shows that bitcoin may not be making the impact in needs to on the next generation.\n\nMillennials are crucial to the success of digital currencies as they represent the majority of future users.\n\nRelated Link: Have You Met The Bitcoin Booty Girls?\n\nA Silver Lining\n\nThe 51 percent who said they were not planning to use bitcoin had also never used the cryptocurrency. Of the 44 percent who expressed a willingness to use bitcoin in the future, 22 percent had used the cryptocurrency and the other 22 percent had not experience using bitcoin. Only 5 percent said they had used the currency and wouldn't use it again in the future.\n\nFor cryptocurrency enthusiasts, those figures could be encouraging as they suggest that the user experience isn't a reason for disregarding bitcoin. Instead, the responses imply that bitcoin's tarnished image needs more reparation and that the cryptocurrency needs to begin appealing to the younger generation in order to get them to try the currency out."", 'In the six years since Bitcoin\x92s debut, there has been no shortage of attempts to repeat its success. Thousands of blockchains have arrived and fizzled out without much fanfare. But many hold out hope that one day an alternative contender will succeed. Amongst the countless options that are currently available, there are currently three notable contenders that have managed to gather the most attention \x97 largely because they take heretical approaches to the problems the Bitcoin blockchain solves.\n\nThe first such contender is Ethereum. It is notable not only because of the whopping $18.4 million it raised from crowdfunding, but also because of the sheer number of features being promised by the project\'s directors.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has focused on providing only the most basic services needed to sustain value transfer and the immutability of its transactions, Ethereum has instead sought to cross out nearly every item on the community\'s collective wish list. The most noteworthy and promising feature, \x93smart contracts,\x94 consists of an extensive programming language by which value can be automatically routed by the network in response to new information. This allows blockchain technology to seamlessly execute the terms of contracts. But the current feature list has grown past its already ambitious initial goals to a list which includes anonymous instant messaging, decentralized file storage, identity and reputation management, a web browser and even a nice graphical user interface to make all of these features simple to use.\n\nWhile the smart contracts that the Ethereum project provides have proven to be very impressive, the project is having a hard time getting its blockchain to bear the weight of its ambitions. The blockchain design itself is very similar to that of Bitcoin. But the burden of its additional features, coupled with an extremely fast settlement heartbeat (also known as \x93block time\x94) has caused the project directors to drastically scale back their ambitions and continuously push back their deadlines. While Ethereum may have some viability in the future, it is clear that the road ahead is a long one. And meanwhile, many of Ethereum\'s best features \x97 most notably its ""smart contract"" features \x97 have already been imported over to the Bitcoin network.\n\nNext on the contender list is the venture-backed and well-marketed Ripple Labs. Whether this platform qualifies as a blockchain is up for debate, as transactions on the Ripple network are subject to the company\'s own moderation and management instead of network ""mining."" But what\'s certain is that the Ripple Labs project has turned to the ""centralization"" of its network management as a way to add features to Bitcoin.\n\nFive Ripple-controlled servers keep the heartbeat of this network in sync, which contrasts starkly with the many thousands of systems managing risk in the Bitcoin network. Ripple Labs has needed to maintain this centralization in order to successfully promote itself as a next-generation competitor to payment clearing systems Swift and ACH. But it\'s apparent that this technology does not provide much in the way of immutability or settlement risk-reduction when compared to a conventional blockchain design.\n\nRipple throws out the need for traditional mining, by requiring that all actors in their system establish trust relationships with each other as well as trust in the Ripple Labs corporation itself. By centralizing this trust, Ripple has exposed the entire network to risk in the form of an easy point of failure and censorship. This has resulted in the recent and very embarrassing freezing of funds for one large digital currency exchange, as well as an anti-money-laundering fine levied by FinCen. Within a conventional blockchain design, by contrast, value transfers are final. Neither a court order nor the whims of a small number of participants would be able to freeze funds or levy fines.\n\nThe centralized nature of Ripple highlights the settlement risks incurred by such approaches to blockchain technology. It now appears that any user of the Ripple network who needs to settle value amongst untrusted and/or risky actors will do so by way of well, a Bitcoin gateway attached to the Ripple network.\n\nWhile Ripple may offer some advantages over the incumbent Swift and ACH architectures, Ripple\'s architecture alone does not settle or route actual value outside the incumbent banking system. Meanwhile, as the Ripple community attempts to bridge its network to Bitcoin, so too has the Bitcoin community added many of Ripple\'s features straight onto Bitcoin itself.\n\nThe final and most obtuse new strategy being promoted in the blockchain space is that of Eris Industries. Eris Industries is providing a set of software libraries and tools that enable users to design their own blockchains from scratch. However, the Eris approach completely removes the incentive for miners to mine on a blockchain by removing the reward for mining entirely.\n\nThe guiding philosopy of the Eris project is that value routing is not important or needed, and that a blockchain is useful merely as a data-notarization tool amongst trusted partners. The need for such a tool would appear dubious, as non-blockchain solutions have performed this service with significantly greater efficiency for years. (The most popular of these solutions would be github.com.) Nonetheless, the venture capital funding for this project appears to have resulted in a positive marketing response thus far, and the project appears to be positioning itself to companies that don\'t see an economic efficiency in guaranteeing value settlement amongst untrusted actors. Immutability is not a feature of the Eris Industries project, which has even gone so far as to label its own tokens \x93junk\x94 \x97 seemingly to highlight this very point.\n\nWhat has become evident with this most recent crop of blockchain newcomers is that in order for a blockchain to succeed, it needs to be a public resource. This lesson harkens back to the early days of the Internet, where many of the companies who saw the Internet\'s potential embarked upon a short-lived and largely fruitless ""Intranet"" strategy whereby the network effect of the Internet was squandered in an attempt to retain complete control of its users.\n\nThe value of the Internet\'s network effect wasn\'t immediately obvious at first. So too with Bitcoin do we see many newcomers scratching their heads in an attempt to replace the current blockchain with a series of controlled silos.\n\nWhile there may be room for alternative blockchains in our future, the likelihood of any competitors achieving much traction outside a small niche seems increasingly unlikely. Similarly diminishing are critics\x92 reasons for finding Bitcoin unsuitable, particularly in light of recent moves by two of Bitcoin\'s newest and largest adopters.\n\nNasdaq and Overstock have each recently announced plans to make use of the Bitcoin blockchain. Much of the blockchain community was waiting to see which blockchain these companies would choose, as their decision would set in motion much of the network effect that is sure to follow. It would appear that both institutions recognize the immutability advantages of Bitcoin and the comparatively enormous advantages of using a public resource for their settlement needs.\n\nThis Bitcoin network effect shows no signs of slowing down. But if the last six years has shown us anything in the blockchain space, it\'s that alternate chains \x97 and their believers \x97 are ten satoshis a dozen.\n\nThe next article in this series will explore the future of blockchain technology.\n\nChris DeRose is the community director of the Counterparty Foundation. Follow him on Twitter @derosetech.', 'Blockstack, a San Francisco-based firm, is adapting the technology of Bitcoin for mainstream finance, including clearing and settlement. A small group of banks have started beta testing Blockstack’s technology, Bloomberg Business reports.\n\nThe startup, run by former Google Inc. and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. employees, is jumping into the competition to use digital-currency technology to tackle financial companies’ slow, antiquated back-office operations.\n\n“We’re not trying to destroy banking or financial services as they are today,” said Peter Shiau, Blockstack’s co-founder and chief operating officer, who previously worked at Standard Chartered Bank in product innovation. “We see what we’re building as technology that can help improve the back-office infrastructure that financial institutions are using.”\n\nBlockstack’s team also includes Philip Harris, a former Nasdaq executive, as an adviser, and chief executive officer and founder Miron Cuperman, who used to work as a senior security engineer at Google.\n\nAccording to the company’s website, Blockstack is a licensable software package to enable financial institutions and other enterprises to build sophisticated blockchain 2.0 applications on their own private blockchain.\n\nBlockstack.io is a hosted version of Blockstack to allow anyone to start building applications on a fully-featured private blockchain. Available in private beta, Blockstack.io gives financial institutions a stack of inter-operable components to build on, including a private, hosted blockchain, a colored coin issuer for representing assets, a framework for smart contracts using oracles and multi-signature transactions, and the ability to plug in external open source components.\n\n“The initial benefit of a private blockchain is simple: a financial institution can accelerate their learning about blockchain technology and prototype blockchain-based applications quickly and easily,” states the Blockstack product and service announcement. “The ultimate benefit of a private blockchain is that it gives enterprises a choice of infrastructure: whether to run an application on a public blockchain or run on a private blockchain with a group of known counter-parties.”\n\nBlockstack includes critical functionality for financial services: managing time-dependent financial transactions like coupon payments for bonds, ensuring complex compliance requirements from multiple groups in an organization, and scaling up the infrastructure to handle millions of transactions at low latency.\n\nThe Blockstack platform is designed to work with technologies designed for Bitcoin Core. As improvements are made to Bitcoin, they can be rolled in Blockstack so that it stays current with the latest technology.\n\n“When you have this private blockchain that’s shared by a number of financial institutions, all you’re doing is just keeping records of the transactions and who owns what,” Shiau said. “What’s nice about the blockchain is you can do that in real time. There are no fees involved.”\n\nBlockstack joins a growing number of fintech companies that want to use or adapt the blockchain technology of Bitcoin to enhance the efficiency and lower the cost of traditional banking and financial systems. Other companies developing ways to use the blockchain to streamline mainstream finance are Nasdaq, which recently partnered with startup Chain to implement the blockchain technology in its Nasdaq Private Market, and Blythe Masters’ Digital Asset Holdings, which uses distributed ledgers to track and settle both digital and mainstream financial assets in a fast and secure environment.', 'In March, Bitcoin Magazine covered the digital economy startup Digital Asset Holdings, headed by the financial superstar Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive.\n\nDigital Asset Holdings uses distributed ledgers to track and settle both digital and mainstream financial assets in a cryptographically secure environment where counterparty risk is minimized, and settlement times are drastically reduced.\n\nNow, Digital Asset Holdings LLC announced two acquisitions, Bloomberg Business reports. The company bought San Francisco-based Hyperledger and Budapest-based Bits of Proof for undisclosed amounts.\n\n“Hyperledger and Bits of Proof add valuable new dimensions to our product offering and great talent to our team,” said Masters. “We build tools to help clients harness the power of distributed ledgers to serve their own customers. We integrate financial infrastructure with a variety of innovative new technologies inspired by the blockchain. Different ledger technologies serve different purposes and all of those we integrate with are additive.”\n\nHyperledger, a finalist in the SWIFT Innotribe startup challenge, developed an innovative distributed ledger to allow banks and other financial institutions to clear and settle transactions in realtime. The company’s technology enables financial institutions to create multiple private blockchains across a known group of participants. Unlike other distributed ledgers, Hyperledger does not have an inbuilt cryptocurrency and uses a proven consensus algorithm capable of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nBits of Proof developed and deployed an enterprise level server to integrate blockchain technology into financial applications.\n\nHyperledger CEO, Dan O’Prey, will become Chief Marketing Officer of Digital Asset, and CTO Daniel Feichtinger will join the senior engineering team. Támas Blummer, founder and CEO of Bits of Proof, has joined Digital Asset Holdings as Chief Ledger Architect.\n\nAccording to information disclosed to Bloomberg Business by a person familiar with the matter, several large investors have expressed an interest in funding Digital Asset Holdings and entered private negotiations. A deal could be announced in the third quarter.\n\nIn related news, Digital Asset Holdings and other leading-edge fintech companies demonstrated their products and services to dozens of top bank, venture-capital and technology executives at the fifth annual New York FinTech Innovation Lab Demo Day organized by Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City.\n\n“[Digital Assets Holdings] is building next-generation, cryptographically secure distributed settlement and ledger services,” states the Innovation Lab press release. “The company will provide safe and efficient settlement of conventional and digital assets that eliminate counterparty risk and can reduce trade- processing time from T+3 to same-day settlement.”\n\nAt the recent Exponential Finance 2015 conference in New York, Masters said that Bitcoin’s underlying technology has the opportunity to improve settlement latency and system security for firms, and, therefore, the market for financial blockchain applications will ultimately be measured in the trillions. Digital Asset Holdings “bridges the gap between the blockchain development world and financial services,” she added.\n\n“How seriously should you take [the blockchain]?” Masters asked. “About as seriously as you should have taken the concept of the Internet in the early 1990s. It’s a big deal.”\n\nImage via Hyperledger', 'Digital gold, decentralized ledger, global currency – it\'s not easy to explain bitcoin in any setting, let alone to regulators or law enforcement officials.\n\nIf the task is any easier today, imagine attempting it in 2013. That was the challenge facing Coinbase\'s inaugural chief compliance officer (CCO) Martine Niejadlik. A former senior director at eBay and PayPal and senior manager of fraud prevention at Amazon, Niejadlik admits even she had trouble coming to terms with the tech.\n\n""Frankly, the first time [CEO] Brian Armstrong called me to tell me about Coinbase and bitcoin I thought he was nuts,"" she recalls. ""It took me some time, quite a bit of it, to understand why the technology could be very disruptive.""\n\nNiejadlik ultimately took the role, overseeing Coinbase\'s compliance during a period of rapid expansion that saw the company\'s user base grow from 650,000 users in December 2013 to 2 million in January 2015. She left the company in February to take the ""greatest job in the world"" as a full-time parent.\n\nDuring her time at Coinbase, she oversaw the company\'s implementation and management of compliance procedures, ensuring that the firm and its employees operated in accordance with internal and external policies.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of overseeing compliance in this setting, she believes, is the difficulty that comes with fitting bitcoin into existing regulations.\n\nNiejadlik told CoinDesk:\n\n""Basic questions such as \'What is bitcoin?\', \'Is it money?\', \'Is it currency?\', \'Is it an investment tool?\', \'Is it property?\' don\'t have straightforward answers, and different state and federal regulations contain different terms and definitions.""\n\nNiejadlik explained that this confusion is evidenced in how different US agencies have approached the subject, with the IRS treating it as property and FinCEN labeling it a currency. She went on to argue that there\'s a risk the compliance process will become more complicated should other global regulatory bodies follow a similarly diverse approach.\n\n""More clarity and solutions are on the way, but the main question is whether there will be consistent answers – it\'ll be tough for bitcoin companies if, for example, states, or even countries, take a different stance and there is a real possibility that could happen,"" she said.\n\nCompliance pain points\n\nWhile bitcoin companies face many of the same compliance issues as traditional financial services businesses, she said others are unique, including the relative difficulty companies have securing banking partnerships and the high cost of licensing.\n\nNiejadlik noted that simply working with other financial institutions like insurance companies to obtain surety bonds or audited financials that need to be supplied was part of the company\'s recurring responsibilities.\n\n""The \'big four\' are hesitant to sign off on things like whether a company is actually holding the bitcoin they say they are, think Mt. Gox, and for that matter, how to even properly account for such items on financial statements,"" she continued.\n\nElsewhere, burdens are placed on companies through mandates passed in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that aim to address money laundering and terrorist financing concerns.\n\n""It\'s not easy to build technology that can figure out who is a good guy and who is doing something illicit, or how to figure out if your user is the real person on the Office of Foreign Assets Control [OFAC] list or if he just happens to be an unlucky individual with the same name as someone on the list,"" she said.\n\nSuch systems, Niejadlik says, are expected to be in place from the time a company begins interacting with customers, necessitating that startups ""move quickly to implement solutions while working in parallel on their products"".\n\nMedia pressure\n\nCreating additional difficulty is the state of conversation about the technology among the general public, which Niejadlik framed as overly focused on negative incidents.\n\n""There has been extensive media coverage of negative events such as Silk Road, Mt. Gox and other notable arrests and illegal activities,"" she said, arguing that this is state of affairs is ""uncomfortable"" to regulators, law enforcement and those seeking to work with the industry.\n\nNiejadlik suggested that such negative press reinforces the heightened concerns of these parties, thus causing difficulties with what should be basic relationships for financial entities, though the coverage has not been without usefulness.\n\n""I think media attention to some of the negative events is important as it helps the public understand things such as why to not store private keys with a company developed to facilitate Magic The Gathering transactions,"" said Niejadlik. ""However, I do think proportionally there has not been enough attention to the benefits of the system and the good things happening in the bitcoin space.""\n\nOther issues, she suggested, have arisen regarding how media outlets portray a company\'s statements, such as when Coinbase formally launched its exchange.\n\nStriking a balance\n\nA more delicate balancing act, she said, is ensuring that companies are succeeding on both compliance and usability, a task that is not always easy as evidenced by the sometimes public outcry over the actions of industry companies.\n\nFor example, Coinbase came under fire following Niejadlik\'s tenure for what was denounced as invasive information collecting on firms that process bitcoin transactions.\n\nNiejadlik said that privacy requires ""ongoing internal conversations"" over what\'s best for the company from a regulatory and product standpoint, especially in light of the push by regulators to be more demanding of the compliance efforts of companies like Coinbase.\n\n""There is pressure coming from both new regulations [like the] NY BitLicense and from banks and their regulators to collect more data upfront, and that can unfortunately push users who are very concerned about privacy to services which are not regulated and may be less secure,"" she said.\n\nOverall, she suggested that other professionals who fill a similar role in the industry would be wise to involve team members on both the compliance and product side in decision-making.\n\nHistory repeated\n\nStill, Niejadlik said that such challenges, while unique to the industry, are not dissimilar from those overcome by other the Internet\'s early success stories.\n\n""Every company has it\'s challenges and set of problems to work through. In the early days at Amazon we were battling things like fraudulent credit card purchases and account takeovers. At eBay it was a whole host of policy violations such as listing banned items and leaving feedback on your own listings,"" she recalls, adding:\n\n""Companies in the bitcoin space grapple with many of the same questions that PayPal did, and does, such as how to best balance consumer experience with mitigating compliance and fraud risks.""\n\nNiejadlik said that bitcoin companies are now able to rely on services provided by large online e-commerce websites such as analytical, account takeover mitigation and spam email solutions.\n\nOverall, she expressed optimism that the abilities of the technology would be highlighted as similar solutions for the industry are developed, concluding:\n\n""The challenge is that the systems to mitigate these risks are in various stages of development.""\n\nNiejadlik declined to answer questions specific to her work at Coinbase.\n\nMartine Niejadlik is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.

The unit was chosen for its ease-of-use, as it represents a whole unit and allows players to be rewarded seemingly on a larger scale.\n\nWith additional opportunities for players to spend their bits on classes, items and other additional content within the game, PlayMC says it provides a ""safe gaming environment for kids to enjoy and have the opportunity to earn their own money"".\n\nMinecraft for the uninitiated\n\nAs the third best-selling video game of all time, Minecraft has sold over 60 million copies. Especially popular with younger people, it allows players and game developers to build worlds from 3D blocks not unlike digital Lego.\n\nEverything in the game is based on these blocks, which can either be destroyed or moved and placed to create anything within a player\'s imagination. It is an open-ended world with a high degree of flexibility as to what is possible, though some elements of the world are consistent across the different games.\n\nPlayers can play alone or connect to servers like PlayMC, allowing multi-player games and interaction in the online world with thousands of other players.\n\nPlugins allow game creators to determine the nature of play and objectives of the game, which usually involves players acquiring resources in order to build tools and structures, and sometimes fight off enemies.\n\nPlayMC\'s bitcoin economy\n\nPlayMC\'s server has plugins that change the main Minecraft game into mini-games, where players either cooperate or fight against each other to win. Each game has different objectives and different ways for players to earn their bits.\n\nA company spokesperson said:\n\n""For example in our game type \'ArcherGames\' players fight each other in a last man standing game mode. Each player is rewarded a small amount of Bits for killing other players and if they come in first, second or third they are rewarded with a larger amount of Bits.""\n\nAs well as awarding bits for standard play actions like kills and wins, PlayMC also allows its players to earn them for winning tournaments and powerups, and in non-game actions like bug reporting, blog post writing, bounties, and acting as server staff.\n\nNo parents had yet approached the company for more information on bitcoin but plenty of young players have been actively trying to understand digital currency, the spokesperson said.\n\nMost of the team\'s time is now spent clearing up misconceptions about bitcoin and providing links that explain bitoin in simple terms.\n\nPlayMC also has an extensive explanation of bitcoin and its in-game \'Bitconomy\' on the company website.\n\nE-commerce for kids\n\nPlayMC follows in the footsteps of other bitcoin-oriented Minecraft servers such as BitQuest, though PlayMC is aimed specifically at children.\n\nOne of bitcoin\'s touted advantages is the way it provides access to electronic payments to those under 18. Children generally have restricted access to banks or credit card accounts.\n\nOf course, anyone wishing to turn their bits into fiat currency will still need to go through a bitcoin exchange, which have similar verification requirements to banks. This could actually promote a bitcoin-based economy by engaging users who can\'t easily escape it.\n\nPlayMC was founded from a partnership between AcroMedia and developer Brandon Gordon, the latter of whom has been involved with Minecraft for five years and bitcoin for three. Given his personal interests, incorporating bitcoin into the game ""seemed like a no-brainer,"" he said.\n\nThe server was founded to introduce new levels of reliability to Minecraft, which often have an \'anything goes\' reputation and servers come and go with regularity.\n\nIt boasts 99.9% uptime and is regularly updated to the latest Minecraft version. Its community is always able to make suggestions and the focus is being as kid-friendly as possible.\n\nMinecraft image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

BTC.sx Bitcoin Trading Platform has brokered more than 60,000 trades since the introduction of its leveraged trading service in 2013.\n\nMagnr generates interest from traders, which is partly paid out as interest to savers.\n\n“One of blockchain\'s greatest innovations is its immutable ledger,” says Lee. “When developing our interest-bearing product, we asked ourselves on a technical level how we could rely on the blockchain as an external database as much as possible. To calculate interest payable, we take the timestamp from each client deposit directly off the blockchain. At the end of each month, this allows us to pro-rata interest calculations to whole 24-hour periods on the realtime transaction record that is the blockchain.\n\n”The Magnr platform doesn’t require a settlement period or a wait time for them to receive funds as payments to client accounts can happen in real-time. This also allows for the saver to check the on public blockchain for payments made to his or her Magnr account.\n\nThe Magnr team is founded by investment banking veterans. Joe Lee, formerly of Barclays Bank and Macquarie Group, first discovered Bitcoin in 2011. Joe began trading bitcoin and turned $100 into $200,000. This profit was then used alongside seed-funding to start BTC.sx. Colin Kwan, COO, worked at the senior management level at UBS and Deutsche Bank. He ensures the company\'s products have institutional-grade quality and compliance.\n\n“Our team is currently focused on product refinements and back-office operations,” says Lee. “Experience from the banks and investment banks we used to work with has taught us the value of building out a solid back-office operation as a matter of importance. We find that client trust starts with prioritization of the fiduciary responsibility we have when handling our client bitcoins. As we seek to engage with institutions and regulators worldwide to push the adoption of digital currencies, a well-managed operation speaks loudly for itself. This shows proof that business can be built in a trustworthy way using blockchain as its core rails.”\n\n""Fintech startups have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to revolutionize banking,"" Lee said.

06/27/2015,"['Originally designed to democratize power within the financial system, Bitcoin’s blockchain technology is now playing a role in the area of democracy itself.\n\nDespite receiving much attention, online voting adoption has yet to take off meaningfully worldwide, amid concerns that existing platforms are vulnerable to fraud, corruption and sabotage. Last year a team accredited to observe the 2013 municipal elections in Estonia – the only country to run Internet voting on a wide scale – revealed that they observed election officials downloading key software over insecure Internet connections, typing PINs and passwords in view of cameras, and preparing election software on insecure PCs.\n\nNorway also canceled trials of e-voting systems in local and national elections, concluding that voters\' fears about their votes becoming public could undermine democratic processes.\n\nThere are,\xad\xad however, increasing examples of political organizations and technology startups experimenting with secure digital voting systems based on the use of Bitcoin’s blockchain technology. Last year Denmark’s Liberal Alliance became the first political party to vote using a blockchain-based system for its internal elections. Similar systems have since been adopted in Norway and Spain and the movement is gathering momentum in the United States.\n\n“There is a common misconception that voting cannot be done online in a secure way. However, the introduction of blockchain technology is changing the conversation,” Adam Ernest, CEO of Virginia-based FollowMyVote – an organization committed to developing an online open source, transparent voting platform – explains.\n\nJust as Bitcoin users make transactions by sending the digital currency to the recipient’s digital wallet, blockchain voting systems involve creating wallets for each candidate or option in an election. All voters are then allocated a digital ""coin"" that represents one vote, which they can cast by sending their ""coin"" to the wallet of their choice.\n\nAs in a bitcoin transaction, the entire process is recorded in the blockchain public ledger, meaning that unlike most current elections, a voter can verify that his or her vote was actually counted.\n\nWhile the lack of anonymity in the Bitcoin system is a drawback for adoption in voting platforms, the use of anonymizing software can help ensure that voters’ identities are not revealed.\n\nThe New York-based V-Initiative is working on delivering open-source, fraud-proof, fully anonymous digital voting solutions based on the blockchain and uses zero-knowledge proof cryptography allied with IP masking software such as the ""TOR"" program to safeguard voter anonymity.\n\nFor many digital voting advocates, the end goal is ""liquid democracy"" – a combination of direct and indirect democracy whereby all citizens have the potential to vote on every issue but can dynamically delegate some or all of these votes to others that they feel are better qualified to vote.\n\nErnest notes that this concept is gaining much traction in countries such as Norway, Iceland and Germany. FollowMyVote, in partnership with BitShares and Cryptonomex, Inc., is working on a voting platform that is integrated directly with the BitShares 2.0 Smartchain that supports this use case.\n\nDespite the positive reception in parts of Europe, Ernest is quick to point out that a number of obstacles remain along the road toward a fully digital democratic system.“\n\nPushing for provably honest elections in the U.S. and abroad, we have a tremendous amount of money and influence stacked against us,” he said.\n\nAs a result, FollowMyVote is changing its approach. Instead of trying to lobby election officials or legislators whom they feel have no incentive to improve the voting process in the U.S., it is preparing to launch an educational marketing campaign targeted directly at the voter in an attempt to get them to lobby the government.\n\nErnest says he is confident that once voters are better informed about the benefits of a blockchain-based online voting system – from convenience and cost-effectiveness to security and transparency – governments will have little choice but to adopt these systems.\n\n“I firmly believe that in the future, voting will be done from our smartphones and our votes will be stored securely on the blockchain,” he said. Photo London elections - e-count scanners / photopin', 'It is time to reveal the top five reasons why bitcoins are superior to dollars, both now, and in the future.\n\nI’ve limited this list to the top five, but there are certainly many other reasons. The dollar has its own advantages, but they will prove fleeting in the coming years. The dollar’s reign as the world’s global reserve currency is running out, and bitcoin’s time as the world’s first and only global digital currency is just beginning. Here are five reasons why.\n\nNumber 1: Appreciation always beats inflation in the long run\n\nInflation occurs partly due to the number of currency units in circulation. U.S. dollar circulation continues to increase at a rate of about $1 trillion annually. The rate of inflation wasn’t always this high, but it has inflated ever since WWII.\n\nThe U.S. government sinks deeper into debt. Each dollar is a debt instrument, loaned out by the Federal Reserve, with interest, or more debt attached to it. This is a bad thing, since the more dollars there are in circulation, the less each dollar is worth.\n\nIn other words, the dollar you hold is losing its purchasing power as you read this right now. Here’s an example. When the Federal Reserve began in 1913, $100 could buy you a car. Today, it will buy you a monthly bus pass.\n\nThe increased money printing leads to inflation at levels of 5% or more, per annum. This is quantified if you look at the average transaction prices for things like meat, gas and eggs over the past five years. The U.S. government will tell you inflation is around 2% annually, but they base this on 25 items that they change conveniently to fit the inflation rates they want to show in their inflation index.\n\nIf beef prices are rising 10% a year, beef is simply removed and replaced with something that doesn’t reflect the actual current rate of inflation. It’s an economic shell game, or a game of Three-Card Monty, and you are the mark.\n\nBitcoin is anti-inflationary by design. There is always a set amount of bitcoins in circulation — 25 new coins are added into circulation every 10 minutes — which is capped at a maximum amount of 21 million in total. Thus, bitcoin’s value will increase based on standard supply and demand economic ideology, or “sound money” principles.\n\nNext July, Bitcoin production is set to halve to 12.5 BTC produced every 10 minutes, forcing its value to appreciate, assuming demand stays at current levels or increases. There is no reason to assume this won’t continue. As more people enter the Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin value per unit increases over time. This is a very foreign concept to anyone brought up to use a fiat or paper currency, as they almost never rise in value, because governments love printing more money at will. This helps governments and hurts citizens every time.\n\nWould you like your money to grow in value over time? Critics will bring up Mt. Gox and the corresponding bubble from 2013. Today, bitcoin is worth about twice what it was worth before Mt. Gox’s bubble and collapse. This is true even with the constant downward price pressure from tens of thousands of merchants accepting and exchanging bitcoin over the past two years.\n\nThings are looking up for Bitcoin’s value. This is not the case when it comes to dollars or fiat currency, in general.\n\nNumber 2: Bitcoin is much safer to move than dollars\n\nHave you ever tried to move $1 million dollars? What if you were to physically, or otherwise, move $1 million from your bank to ... anywhere! Assuming you had $1 million in your bank account, try to walk up to a teller and remove it from the bank. As a former banker myself, I can attest that this will not go unnoticed, or unavenged. The bank manager will come to see you, and the interrogation will begin.\n\nThey will create an SAR (suspicious activity report), which they currently do for any cash deposit or withdrawal for amounts as small as $5K, depending upon your location. You will definitely be on a few lists you don’t want to be on. The bank and the government will track your movement. These days, they may assume you are a terrorist, domestically or abroad. Where your money, with your name attached to it, ends up will be far from private, and it will be cross-referenced multiple times — your punishment for taking your money out of a bank to do with it as you please.\n\nNot only would the process be arduous, and so would your interrogation by multiple layers of bank personnel, you might be tailed and mugged. Good luck taking $1 million on a plane, or through any TSA checkpoint or customs area. At that point, you and the $1 million will spend a few hours in a room for another round of interrogation. You will make plenty of “law enforcement” enemies along your journey. It’s just a pretty bad idea, overall.\n\nIn contrast, someone moved $150,000,000 in bitcoin in 2013, from one Bitcoin wallet to another, in seconds, for the cost of fractions of a percent of a bitcoin. This is not possible in dollars without a major identity shakedown from multiple fronts. No pseudonymous protections for you.\n\nNumber 3: Bitcoin costs much less to move than dollars\n\nLet’s say you wanted to do the next best thing and wire your money overseas. Head down to your bank and see a teller or banker. This process involves a certain amount of costs and time lost. Fill out a form. Pay the bank’s fee, which will cost in the range of $30 for wiring a relatively small amount, up to a percentage of the amount for larger sums.\n\nLet’s assume your bank didn’t go JPMorgan Chase on you and tell you that you can’t move your money because they said so, and you actually are able to wire it. Now, you have paid the bank to know who you are, what you’re doing, and how much you’re doing it with. You are still on the same list, if you moved $1 million, and you will get the same 20 questions. Privacy is a cute concept, but it’s not for the real world of fiat currency.\n\nFor this example, you send US$100,000 to a person in China doing business with you. They have to travel to their bank, which is both a financial and time cost. They can pick up the transfer after exposing their identity and the fact that they are receiving money. They may have to pay a fee as well, just for picking it up. They will have to answer some questions. And usually the time involves a full day for the transfer to take place. It could be several days, depending on the amount and where the transfer is going. It’s inconvenient, costly, and time-consuming, and not at all private. A quadruple threat!\n\nWith Bitcoin, you can send any amount to someone’s QR code or BTC address. Just pay a miner’s fee one to four ""centibitcoin"" (0.001 BTC), and have the transaction reconciled within 10 minutes, usually less. No tellers, bank managers, interrogations, trips to the bank, ID verification, etc., are necessary. Just fast, effective service of your money. A little thing called freedom that we used to take for granted is now gone for the 99% of the population who haven’t yet discovered the convenience of Bitcoin.\n\nDo people really like using Western Union to send money overseas? Fees can run as high as 20% of the amount transferred! That’s why the remittances market is such fertile ground for Bitcoin in places like Africa and Indonesia. The Third World has been waiting for a better option than Western Union transfers. It will take time for people to overcome separating from a trusted brand like Western Union. While you can trust them to get you your money, you can also trust them to take a massive chunk for themselves. With Bitcoin, now people worldwide do have a choice on whether to get fleeced or not.\n\nNumber 4: Bitcoin is infinitely more secure than dollars\n\nHow many times have you lost $20? How many times have you lost your wallet in you lifetime? Five times? Ok, how many times have you lost your computer or digital wallet? Stupid people can do a lot of things, but let’s agree it is much harder to do, and will happen less often over time. Some things are a lot less likely than others.\n\nLosing paper money is relatively easy to do. Forget the actual theft of it. And identity theft is now somewhat commonplace. Plus there are counterfeit bills out there.\n\nBitcoins cannot be counterfeited. They are digital in nature, so they can be backed up and saved to other servers, computers, protected by multisig, passcodes, paper wallets, offline vaults, cold storage, brain wallets, and so on. The security options are only limited by your imagination.\n\nLeave your smartphone at a bar, with a passcode protecting a bitcoin wallet, if not the phone itself. Then leave your leather wallet at the bar, with it’s spiffy zipper for protection, and $500 cash inside. With your keys backed up on your hard drive, your bitcoins are perfectly safe. Your $500 in cash, not so much.\n\nNumber 5: Bitcoin’s future is brighter than the dollar’s future\n\nYou may have heard of the “almighty dollar,” but this is not 1965 anymore. Today’s U.S. dollar has arthritis, Alzheimer’s, and a runny bladder. The U.S. dollar hasn’t been backed by gold for over 40 years. The only reason other countries use it is at the barrel of a Western gun. (See U.S. invations of Iraq or Syria in recent history, based around the discontinuation of dollar use by their governments.)\n\nRussia\'s Putin hates the U.S. dollar so much that he made a world bank to work around it. Russia, China, Brazil, India, and South Africa have also created a world bank called the BRICS Development Bank for the sole purpose of hating the U.S. and the dollar it rode in on. These countries represent 40% of the world’s population and 40% of the global currency reserves, so it is a very big deal when they all form hate groups against the “greenback.”\n\nCentral banking interest rates are already at zero. In Europe, interest rates are now going into the negative! Fed Chairman Janet Yellin knows she can’t raise the rates, so she just says they’re thinking about it. This is enough to control the stock market for the next couple of years.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of countries have been performing bilateral trade agreements to avoid the dollar since the recession of 2008. The U.S. is already approaching $18,000,000,000,000 in national debt, and most economic experts have the dollar pegged for a full collapse by the end of the decade. In reality, they’re hedging their bets because they know things won’t last another five years like this. It is not a matter of “if” the dollar collapses under the weight of its own debt, social entitlement programs, and massive inflationary practices — but “when.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe typewriter. The buggy whip. The rotary phone. Every technology has a lifespan. Fiat currency is a technology. You don’t think of it as such because it is just a piece of paper, unlike Bitcoin. Compare dollars to the “tally sticks” of yore, used in Europe to account for monetary transactions for centuries, and you’ll understand this better. We have been trained, conditioned, like dogs — even coerced — to believe that fiat currency is not only valuable, but invincible.\n\nThe world of fiat currency continues to show its inherent mortality in places like Cyprus, Greece, Zimbabwe and Argentina. The U.S. dollar is also on currency’s death row. It\'s not a guess or a matter of opinion. It is, in fact, a mathematic and economic certainty. It’s not a matter of when this may happen, but when it must.\n\nFiat currency is not the standard of economic value. It is the previous generation of value facing its own demise against the value of the money of the future. That money of the future is called Bitcoin. Fifteen years from now, do you really think the world will continue to use paper currencies?\n\nPerhaps Ernest Hemingway said it best, and he may as well have been talking about the U.S. Dollar: “Never send to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee.”\n\nWhat do you think of Bitcoin’s value versus using dollars or other fiat currency? Share and comment below', ""BitTorrent has built solid reputation with the masses as being an instrument for 'free' but could it perform better and prove more popular with prices attached to downloads? That question could soon be answered following the debut of a new torrent client that allows leechers to pay seeders using Bitcoin.\n\nTo millions of users around the world, BitTorrent is a beautiful thing. Not only does it enable the worldwide sharing of any kind of media, but the manner in which it does so is a stroke of pure genius.\n\nUtilizing the bandwidth of all participants in its ‘swarms’, BitTorrent pools the resources of many to provide a streamlined downloading experience for all. It’s both complex and simplicity itself, a rare quality indeed.\n\nBitTorrent’s success as a protocol is tied to its low barrier to entry, since anyone with a computer and Internet connection can participate. Above and beyond that no actual money is needed to obtain content. However, the nature of the system means that it’s not entirely free, since users ‘donate’ their bandwidth to others in order to keep a swarm going.\n\nMillions of users are extremely happy with this setup but a proposal from developer Bedeho Mender could see money being brought into the equation.\n\nBedeho is the founder of JoyStream, a forthcoming BitTorrent client that tries to improve BitTorrent by allowing peer-to-peer Bitcoin payments in exchange for bandwidth – or content, whichever way one prefers to look at it.\n\nTo the torrenting masses, that probably sounds a bit like a tax on air. BitTorrent’s growth has stemmed from the fact that millions of people are happy to share for free. Is it possible that by introducing money things are going to improve? Bedeho thinks so.\n\n“BitTorrent has many strengths, but I would say people are often not sharing for free, e.g. in private communities which have far higher quality service. In that context one is required to adhere to strict and cumbersome rules about contributing to maintain ratios, and this makes the system work much better,” Bedeho tells TorrentFreak.\n\n“JoyStream is just an open version of that very same insight, except that you now are not forced to seed to maintain your ratio, something which is not practical for everyone. The key is therefore not money, the key is incentives to supply enough bandwidth. Money is just one of many means to try to achieve this, just like we do with other goods.”\n\nThe idea behind JoyStream is simple. If you have some spare bandwidth and content that people want, you can sell access to that content through the JoyStream client. The more common that content the less likely it is that you’ll be able to charge a premium price for it. Rare material, on the other hand, might be worth someone blowing a few fractions of a bitcoin on.\n\nIn very basic terms, if the user tells it to, JoyStream will wind back its upload speed to zero and only open up it up again when someone pays.\n\nOne of the claims Bedeho makes about JoyStream is that higher download speeds will be available in this kind of system. The idea is that if seeds are getting paid, they will stick around longer and offer up more bandwidth, a bit like a user on a private torrent site trying to improve his ratio.\n\n“All paid bandwidth comes from other peers which are paid to supply it. If you do not wish to pay to download, then you would just be using the regular BitTorrent tit-for-tat exchange procedure as is today, and JoyStream also supports that,” Bedeho explains.\n\n“With JoyStream it may turn out that people will opt to leave their computer on to earn back whatever they have spent when buying before, so it just becomes a closed loop system. That way you wouldn’t even be spending any Bitcoins in total, over time. In such a scenario, you should still expect the quality of the open BitTorrent system to be as good, if not better, than in private communities.”\n\nWhile earning money for seeding will be attractive to some, will the idea of being in a pay-to-download-faster swarm be off-putting to others? What if JoyStream took off overnight and became a significant player in most swarms?\n\n“Just like in regular BitTorrent, if no one has a full copy of the file and is willing to seed, then the swarm would get stuck for a while. However, since there is compensation, that is much less likely to happen with JoyStream type peers, precisely because those with a full download will not always leave right away, as is common today,” Bedeho adds.\n\nWhile the overall idea certainly provides food for thought, there will undoubtedly be file-sharing traditionalists shuddering not only at the mere thought of file-selling, but also at the prospect of being denied bandwidth at the hands of someone with more bitcoins to spare.\n\nFinally (and just to throw fuel on the fire) when JoyStream is out of alpha it should work on private trackers too….\n\n“I do not know how the torrent community will react in total, but since it is an open system, you are free to use or not use it, and I do expect there will be private communities which will ban it, and that is totally fine with me. That is what an open system like BitTorrent/Bitcoin is all about,” Bedeho concludes."", ""Matt Weiss is a portfolio director and business designer at IDEO Boston, where he blends his experience in strategic design for large corporations with his roots in the startup world. Alongside Dan Elitzer and Joe Gerber, he runs the Bits + Blocks Lab, a pop-up blockchain startup creation lab hosted at the Harvard Innovation Lab.\n\nThis post, which examines how bitcoin's blockchain could reshape our medical experiences, is part of the Humans + Bits + Blocks series. Read the previous post in the series here.\n\nBlockchains and health could be a happy marriage across a multitude of applications. From robust interoperable health records to proof of medication adherence, opportunities abound to create new value and enhance health-related experiences.\n\nFor the purposes of making this exploration tangible (as is our goal with this entire series), let’s follow the journey of a person with a chronic condition we’ll call Screenoritis* in a future with blockchains.\n\nFirst, it’s important to know that Screenoritis is a troublesome condition. The prognosis isn’t fatal, but the symptoms of it are debilitating, ranging from sleeplessness to short-term memory loss. The good news? It is both treatable and reversible, though the path to recovery is not easy.\n\nJane is 34. She loves her job as an animator and works way more than the average person. It’s Thursday afternoon, she’s totally worn out from a super challenging scene she just finished, and she decides to take a break. It’s beautiful outside, so she heads out for a run by the river. About two miles in, Jane starts to feel a bit nauseous and then lightheaded. She slows to a walk, but even so collapses 100 yards down the trail. A runner coming from the other direction finds Jane unresponsive on the ground and calls 911.\n\nWhen the ambulance arrives, the EMTs scan the fitness band on Jane’s wrist to retrieve her HealthChain ID, a unique public identifier used for health information. When Jane signed up for HealthChain, she created rules and named individuals who could verify access to her medical records. The EMT’s combine Jane’s ID with their own, which proves that they’re accredited emergency health responders.\n\nThey then issue a broadcast on the HealthChain network, which automatically generates alerts to Jane’s four emergency contacts asking them to validate that the EMTs can access Jane’s records. Ten seconds later, after two of her contacts grant access, the EMTs are able to access her emergency health info.\n\nA few hours later, Jane wakes up in the hospital. She’s OK, but she’s shaken up and wants to understand what’s going on. The doctor on call sits down with her to explain her encounter with Screenoritis.\n\nAfter reviewing some of the facts, the doctor asks if she’s willing to share her anonymized information in the public research repository – this has become standard practice, and she has no problem with it. She’s willing to share her medical history, pertinent data about the event she just experienced, and results from the tests they’re currently running.\n\nJane wants to learn what people like her have experienced and how she can get better. She and others have opted into share their information in order to participate in a private network. Compared to today’s self-guided searching, the doctor does a criteria match for her profile and finds an entire set of people who share many important characteristics with Jane, ranging from age to location to type of job.\n\nAlthough Screenoritis is fairly widespread and medications have been developed to treat symptoms, recovery is still difficult and treatment of the underlying conditions have gotten little attention from the medical community.\n\nAs part of her initial research about the condition, Jane quickly discovers that there is a publicly crowdfunded bounty for the release of a treatment regimen that will treat the underlying causes of Screenoritis.\n\nHer contribution is governed by a series of smart contracts that provide conditional access to treatments once they’re released. Unlike traditional crowdfunding, her contributions are held in escrow by the contracts until the treatment is ready for her.\n\nNow that Jane has a solid understanding of her condition, she’s begun to see a specialist who has prescribed a daily physical routine for her in addition to well-known Screenoritis medications. Adherence to both is critical for recovery and also rewarded by her insurer. With a watch that can track her location and movements and pills that are instrumented to collect data, the information that the insurer and doctor needs is readily available. So long as Jane sticks to her agreed-upon treatment, the entirety of her bills are covered automatically — no paperwork needed.\n\nHealth and blockchains turn out to be a great match. Together, they can usher in a patient-centric revolution in how we take care of ourselves and others. In our most vulnerable moments, we’ll seamlessly share permissions to access important information attached to our identity. We’ll make advance promises of payment in return for new treatments that we desire. Rather than opaque risk models and quotas, insurance payments will be triggered by our verified healthy behaviors.\n\nIt’s time for health to get an upgrade. Far from state-of-the-art, our health is tracked, diagnosed and treated without the full benefit of technologies that we take for granted in other aspects of our everyday lives. The addition of blockchains could change that substantially, and we’re excited about these future opportunities becoming real.\n\n* Screenoritis is not an actual disease.\n\nWritten by Matt Weiss, Dan Elitzer and Joe Gerber.

Interestingly enough, the first Bitcoin ATM has arrived in Athens just in time.\n\n4 options\n\nThe clear lesson being learned is the recipe of political and social integration before economic integration makes a terrible meal. A lot of noise and overcomplicated explanations have been put forth as to what will happen.\n\nIn reality, there are four options left as to how this can play out:\n\nGreece gives in; Greece digs in and demands more concessions, the EU listens and agrees; Greece defaults, which may lead to the EU pulling the plug on commercial banks in Greece and massive bank restrictions which would probably result in capital controls to stop bank runs in Greece and a total collapse in the monetary base; As a result of this, Greece begins printing its own currency in order to ease the massive blow of default which will be extremely painful at first and could lead to hyperinflation.\n\nBailout proposal\n\nThe latest news from Athens is that Prime Minister Alex Tsipiras has announced a referendum to be held on July 5 to accept the bailout proposal given by Greece’s foreign creditors.\n\nThis directly contradicts the weekend deadline that is needed to make a viable deal happen and is just more of the same from Greece to buy extra time. Expect fireworks this weekend.\n\nBelow is a key timeline of events for Greece over the next month:\n\nOption 1) Give In\n\nAs the chart above shows, Greece needs to make a EUR1.6 billion debt repayment to the IMF. Creditors have offered to release EUR15.5 billion of funding, EUR1.8 billion would be available immediately conditional on Greece carrying out more reforms.\n\nTo receive this money, the EU is asking Greece to take on more cost cutting and austerity measures, which include the following:\n\nmore cuts to pension payments and wages (particularly in the government sector);\n\nget rid of a special benefit paid to low income pensioners (a big sticking point);\n\nThe IMF wants deeper spending cuts accompanied with higher tax payments;\n\nAs well as a wider Value Added Tax (VAT) base to include medicines, electricity bills, hotels and restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, Athens wants a concrete commitment to debt relief, which creditors are not offering.\n\nThis is a hard pill for Greece to swallow, as Tsipiras ran on a platform of avoiding more cuts and higher taxes at all costs. Accepting this proposal will leave Greece a zombie country not able to control its own economic and financial destiny. However, in reality, it gave this up when it joined a flawed Monetary Union.\n\nOption 2) Dig In\n\nGreece could refuse to accept the terms being offered and ask for a different set of reforms that are less stringent and don’t choke off the entire populace.\n\nAlternatively, they can flat out refuse to accept a deal and hope the EU caves in since it certainly fears the implications of a Greek default i.e. contagion. According to many pundits, a Greek default will be “contained.”\n\nThe Guardian has reported that “eurozone finance ministers and Greece’s creditors are to draw up plans for emergency measures to ring-fence the country’s financial system unless the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accepts the creditors’ terms for a five-month extension of Athens’s bailout on Saturday.”\n\nImagining a Greek exit (Grexit) can be contained is a pipedream. This is not about Greece at all but about the other countries that will follow suit if Greece leaves (Spain, Italy, & Portugal). Not too far in the future (September) is an upcoming Spanish election, in which the far left party, Podemos, has a commanding lead.\n\nSpain has suffered a similar fate to Greece since entering the EU and is still in the midst of a deep recession. It would be highly likely that other countries would follow suit so this could play into Greece’s hand in negotiations.\n\nOption 3) Default\n\nIn anticipation of the real possibility of default, people have been rushing to withdraw money from Greek Banks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this has been going on for quite a while and not due to the most recent events in Greece. Deposits have fallen to their lowest level in 11 years, dropping by 3.7 billion pounds to 135.7 billion pounds, according to data from the European Central Bank.\n\nDefault will have its obvious implications: a complete collapse in economic output, a run on banks, Greek commercial banks being weened from the EU, capital controls being placed on Greece’s citizens as the banks have to deal with implications of default, unemployment rising even higher (see chart below), and complete social chaos.\n\nInflation will rise dramatically and could potentially spiral into hyperinflation as Greek Central Bank will need to begin printing its own currency, since it will have to drop the Euro.\n\nNote: Those figures imply 1.4 million unemployed (according to official records) out of a population of ~10 million. Unemployment Levels are at their highest levels since 2006, and will increase exponentially in a default.\n\nGreece may choose to swallow this bitter pill as Iceland did, which led to a lot of short term pain, followed by eventual growth and a return to some kind of economic normalcy.\n\nMeanwhile, a run on the banks is already being reported. According to a CNBC article written by Holly Ellyatt and Everett Rosenfeld:\n\n“Hours after the call for a referendum, reports about long lines for cash machines started appearing on social media.”\n\nFriend in north Athens tells me his wife dashed out to ATM and line was already 30-40 long. #Greece t.co/c9V6JIRUDw — Peter Spiegel (@SpiegelPeter) June 26, 2015\n\nFirst Bitcoin ATM in Athens\n\nIt will be interesting to see the numbers around of how many Greeks are using the first bitcoin ATM to launch in Athens this past week.\n\nWhile using bitcoin as a national currency may be a bad idea for Greece, using bitcoin as an alternative to the Euro and the Dollar in fears of a default, might be something some Greeks decide is a reasonable strategy as they panic to access their money and try and decipher what exactly capital controls might mean.\n\nThe world will find out soon enough what unfolds. What might not be clear, despite the result, is the aftermath of the decision and its impact on the entire global macro economy. Interesting days ahead.', 'Advertising can be a hard way to earn money, especially in an era when many people are using anti-advertising plugins for their browsers, and most often people are specifically clicking on ads in order to support the platform where they see them.\n\nBitcoin has a way of making that which is old new again, in that advertising is often a crucial means of distributing information about a new product in the Bitcoin space. There are some advertising platforms that have been specifically developed for the Bitcoin space. One of the oldest and best established is the CoinURL platform, which both allows users to monetize short links and allows websites to sign up and run display ads.\n\nCoinURL has published its stats, and as you can see, the outlook is bleak for advertising. Out of 10265790 impressions on June 22nd, for instance, the entire network received a total of just 2593 clicks. There can be many factors which contribute to this, including the content of the advertisements. Users need a real incentive to click an ad anymore, although in new niches like Bitcoin, ads can serve as a viable means to find needed information. A couple of days before that, the network experienced twice as many clicks, which may be a testament to the ads being displayed that day.\n\nBut then, ads don’t necessarily need to be clicked to be profitable to the advertiser. Brand recognition alone is a valuable asset, and a good way to develop it over time is to advertise in places that your potential customers frequent.\n\nAnother option for a website looking to monetize its content via advertisements is AdBit. AdBit is a specifically Bitcoin-oriented platform that allows the purchaser and the website to remain anonymous from each other. The platform owner decides which kinds of content they want to advertise, and the companies advertising are given a choice of companies. Rates are determined by the company, with suggestions made based on their performance. In essence, AdBit works a lot like AdSense from Google.\n\nThe Marketer Becomes the Market\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting option for the website owner is a new contender in the space, Coin Ad, by the same people who run Bitcoin Aliens, a massive traffic magnet that manages to give money away and remain profitable. These are the kinds of people who know how to make money from advertising if they’re able to do it in such a way that they can give away some of the money as well.\n\nCCN spoke to Daniel D’Alien, the founder of Bitcoin Aliens, about the Coin Ad platform.\n\nI wanted to make a more simple platform without too many bells and whistles. It’s modeled off more popular ads buying models like Google or popular mainstream network BuySellAds – you simply pick the site you want to advertise on, choose how many impressions you want – and this is what you get, along with simple stats on how many impressions are remaining and how many clicks you have received in real time.\n\nCurrently, the platform has more than 40 unique advertisers, a figure that D’Alien expects to grow with time. Most ad networks don’t disallow the website from using more than one network. Thus an entrepreneur could try out Coin Ad while still utilizing CoinURL, and vice versa, to see which made the most money.\n\nHaving a stable source of revenue is vital for the operation of any website, and advertising networks are one way for up and coming websites to ensure that they’re getting their fair share of the revenue that’s out there to be made.

Since the data and copyright cannot be changed once it is registered on the blockchain, artists will be able to defend their works without the need to spend money on the traditional process of hiring lawyers to create legal documents.\n\nWhile traditional forms of copyrights and patents are difficult to track and usually take days or even weeks to sell or transfer, Ascribe allows its users to sell their ownership securely and cost-free through the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSince the platform allows users to embed images and texts on the blockchain, artists also may register copyrights for physical art such as sculpture, by simply uploading images of the work with follow-up descriptions.\n\nCopyrights to the artworks registered on Ascribe will be available to public like a torrent file, which can be downloaded and used freely. However, the distributor or the user in this case, will always have full authority over the artwork, and will always possess the power to deny or grant access to their works.\n\nAccording to the company, more than 600 artists have already signed up for access, and over 2,600 works of art have been registered. Several marketplaces and platforms are also using Ascribe’s API to display the copyrights to the artwork.\n\nAscribe is currently in progress of designing a machine learning technology which will be able to search through the web to classify copied works without watermarks.\n\nEncrypting Unique Data on the Blockchain\n\nAscribe is using the function of the Bitcoin blockchain to encode additional information in transactions. On May 6, rock band 22HERTZ encrypted the copyrights to their album on the Bitcoin blockchain, using a function of the blockchain called OP_RETURN, which is a standardized function of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows data to be passed onto a transaction.\n\nIn this case, a user defined sequence of up to 40 bytes can be stored in the blockchain, which is enough to store encrypted texts of links to images, songs and long texts.\n\nWhile storing information and data on the blockchain has been criticized as being inefficient, the transparency of the blockchain makes it extremely easy for artists to track their copyrights and ownerships to their works instantly. Image via Ascribe', 'Interested in becoming a bitcoin ATM operator? ATM Marketplace, an ATM industry resource, has released a 40-page guide on bitcoin ATMs that explores every aspect of the business opportunity. The report is titled, “Bitcoin ATMs 101: Opportunities for the IAD.” IAD stands for independent ATM deployment.\n\nThe guide, the first to examine the emerging cryptocurrency ATM market, notes bitcoin ATMs offer an efficient and secure way for people to buy and sell bitcoins. ATMs are an alternative to bitcoin exchanges that many believe are more susceptible to hacking and fraud. Bitcoin ATMs shoulder the credit, counterparty and volatility risk associated with bitcoin exchanges.\n\nThe guide includes an overview of bitcoin for readers who may be completely new to cryptocurrency.\n\nOpportunity for Existing ATMs\n\nFor existing ATM operators, bitcoin offers an opportunity to generate additional revenue streams at their ATMs. Operators of existing ATMs can install bitcoin software, allowing them to provide bitcoin in addition to traditional currency.\n\nThose who opt for dedicated bitcoin ATMs must decide whether to provide the ability to buy and sell bitcoins or just bitcoin purchase capability.\n\nBitcoin ATM transaction fees are generally higher than traditional ATM transaction fees. The average transaction fee for buying and selling bitcoin at bitcoin ATMs is 6 percent.\n\nIn addition to charging transaction fees, some bitcoin ATM operators make money on the currency “float.” Because bitcoin prices vary among the different exchanges, bitcoin operators can sell bitcoin at a higher price than they pay for it.\n\nAs for income potential, the guide notes prime bitcoin ATM locations are reporting monthly transaction volumes ranging from $70,000 to $300,000. Successful operators have been covering the cost of their machines in three to nine months.\n\nThe guide also notes there are regulatory compliance requirements and remittance fees to consider. Operators need to weigh potential benefits against downsides, such as bitcoin price volatility and market uncertainties.\n\nThere is an overview of the current size of the bitcoin ATM market. As of March 2015, 356 bitcoin ATMs had been installed worldwide, according to Coin ATM Radar, including 119 in the U.S., 60 in Canada, 20 in Australia and 20 in the U.K.\n\nNearly two-thirds (61.8 percent) of bitcoin ATMs installed worldwide in March 2015 were one-way (selling bitcoin for cash) compared with 38.2 percent that were two-way (buying and selling bitcoin).\n\nThere is also an overview of the regulatory issues that bitcoin ATM operators must consider. In the U.S., banking and payment services are regulated at federal and state levels. One section addresses the recently published New York Department of Financial Services’ BitLicense. There is also a section on Canadian bitcoin ATM regulations.\n\nAlso read: Dollar wants to install 5500 bitcoin ATMs worldwide by 2016\n\nBitcoin ATM Manufacturer Overview\n\nThe guide summarizes ATMs from eight of the largest bitcoin ATM manufacturers: BitAccess, BitXatm.com, Coin Outlet, General Bytes, Genesis Coin, Lamassu, Robocoin and Skyhook. It also summarizes the different ID verification processes.\n\nThe guide can be downloaded for free by visiting the ATM Marketplace website.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin is a global digital currency being used by people across the world.

06/28/2015,"['Charles A Cowan is counsel in the Insurance Practice Team within the Corporate & Securities Practice Group at Drinker Biddle & Reath. He previously managed a team responsible for the investigation of internal and external financial crime and regulatory non-compliance at Lloyd’s of London.\n\nIn this article he discusses the risks that influence an insurer\'s decision to work with companies in bitcoin, and how they might be overcome.\n\nIn 1904, Lloyd’s of London was still largely a marine market. And so, when approached in that year to issue the world’s first automobile policy, underwriters did so while describing the car as a ""ship navigating on land"". Just as in 1904, insurance and innovation have often been inextricably – if, at times, awkwardly – interlinked.\n\nThose who invest time, energy and financial resources into developing and distributing an innovative product or process are often keenly aware of the vital role that insurance can play in supporting and protecting their ventures. And so, as virtual currency businesses (or \'bitcoin businesses\' for purposes of this article) increasingly establish themselves as \'mainstream\' enterprises, the logical question arises: what role, if any, should or must insurance play in the process and how should insurers and innovators navigate this space?\n\nInsurance is about risk: assessing, understanding, valuing and sharing risk. Insurers tend to be conservative when it comes to assessing and accepting risk, preferring to focus upon concrete data, loss histories and actuarial models rather than pure instinct. This is why insurers spend a great deal of time, energy and money discussing and analysing \'emerging risks\' such as bitcoin.\n\nA heavily regulated space\n\nThe fact that an innovative product or process has captured the imagination of venture capitalists, academics and inventors does not mean that it has yet reached a level of maturity necessary to be deemed an \'insurable risk\'. To the extent that underwriters have been slow or unwilling to insure risks associated with bitcoin business, what may explain this and what, if anything, can be done to bridge any perceived gap between insurers and innovators?\n\nInsurers operate in a heavily regulated space. From rates to contract wordings; lines of business to reserving practices: there are few aspects of insurance that are not subject to some form of regulation. Depending upon the markets that an insurer serves, moreover, they may answer to numerous regulators at once. In addition, insurers – like many large businesses – must answer to their investors for decisions that they make.\n\nWhen approached with a new, \'cutting edge\' type of risk, then, insurers must often first address the important questions of:\n\nWhether they can legally write the risk in the way proposed. What, if any, reputational issues might be implicated. Whether enough information is available appropriately to assess and value the risk.\n\n(There are many more factors, but time and space are limited here.) Each of these considerations is central to an understanding of how bitcoin is often viewed by underwriters.\n\nI will discuss each briefly below and then propose some possible ways that underwriters and bitcoin entrepreneurs can improve dialogue with respect to them.\n\nRegulatory concerns\n\nWith respect to regulation, a critical area of concern for underwriters is that of financial crime controls. (The question of the extent to which regulation can or should \'legitimize\' bitcoin is fodder for another article.) In an era in which nine- or 10-figure fines have been imposed by US federal and state regulators against banks that have been deemed to run afoul of Anti-Money Laundering or sanctions laws, insurers are keenly aware of the need to ensure that sufficient controls are in place with respect to risks that they accept.\n\nBitcoin, for obvious reasons, presents a challenge in this regard, not the least of which reason is its association with the Dark Web. Legitimate bitcoin businesses are right to challenge this view as outdated and to point to efforts by both industry and regulators to improve transparency and accountability in the exchange of bitcoins.\n\nBut the fact is that news reports persist of a resilient Dark Web marketplace and of the involvement of bitcoin in crimes (either as the target or as the medium of payment). This can be enough to discourage conservative underwriters from considering the risk.\n\nReputational risk\n\nClosely aligned with the regulatory risk that is exemplified by financial crime controls is reputational risk. Insurance is not merely a transfer of risk, it is a relationship based upon mutual trust. Consumers must be able to trust that insurers will protect them in times of need and, as a result, insurers have very practical incentives for placing a premium (pun intended) on reputation.\n\nAgain, while legitimate bitcoin entrepreneurs may protest that there should no longer be a perceived reputational risk associated with bitcoin, for reasons discussed above, many underwriters remain wary of being too closely aligned with bitcoin’s inescapable notoriety.\n\nThe availability of information – both generally with respect to an industry and specifically with regard to a proposed risk – are essential in the underwriting process.\n\nEmerging risks such as bitcoin present unique challenges to underwriters in this regard. Bitcoin start-ups, for example, will have no loss history, thereby making it more difficult for even the brightest of actuaries to assess the likelihood of future losses. And loss projections form a central part of risk pricing.\n\nNovelty value\n\nWhat makes innovations such as bitcoin even more challenging is that there are few analogous industries or products. Insurance has for some time provided cover for businesses engaged in the exchange and storage of digital assets such as copyrighted material, films and the like. And the electronic exchange of \'value\' is certainly nothing unique, as witnessed by the fact that consumers worldwide can manage and exchange value between their own insured bank accounts.\n\nBut it is the very decentralized, community-based nature of bitcoin that makes it difficult to compare with risks that, while \'virtual\' in some sense, are nevertheless subject to transparent and tested procedures, protocols, regulation and the like that make the assessment and valuation of such risks more acceptable.\n\nBear in mind that, at most large insurers, underwriting is subject to strict peer review and that, in order to accept an admittedly \'novel\' risk such as bitcoin, an underwriter will have to answer to his peers (and managers) questions such as:\n\nWhat does a proof of loss look like?\n\nHow can underwriters or insureds \'know\' the quantity of bitcoins that were held or \'lost\' at the time an incident occurred?\n\nHow can we be sure that we are not insuring the fluctuating value of bitcoin?\n\nCold storage, as described, seems all but fool-proof – so why do they need insurance? What do they know about their risk that we do not?\n\nAre there \'macro risks\', meaning those that exist apart from this particular insured’s profile, that nevertheless have a bearing upon this risk (here, the focus is generally upon whether the bitcoin protocol is vulnerable in ways that could lead to an unanticipated exposure at the level of each exchange)?\n\nIn paying claims, how do we address financial crime risk such as those posed by sanctions regimes?\n\nWhat should happen next?\n\nGiven the points outlined above, what can be done, if anything, to bridge perceived gaps between what bitcoin businesses want and insurers (as an industry) have thus far been willing to offer? The key is transparency and openness. Unless and until insurers are satisfied with respect to regulatory or reputational risk, they may be constrained from acting (even if some of their competitors are willing to do so).\n\nBitcoin businesses must recognize that these are genuine concerns and be willing, at the proposal stage, to address them in a detailed and thorough manner. More importantly, there must be a full and frank discussion of the vulnerabilities that arise from the business proposed.\n\nWhile the insurance industry is making strides in terms of bringing technological expertise into the industry, at present there is often a significant gap between bitcoin entrepeneurs and underwriters in terms of the technology and any vulnerabilities of which underwriters should be aware. In the long run, both parties are best served by that level of transparency because far too many business disputes are created by a lack of mutual understanding at the outset.\n\nI realize that this article poses more questions than it could hope to answer, but if it serves to foster future dialogue, then it has served its purpose. I can only hope that it serves to foster further exchange (again, pun intended).\n\nGap image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles. As such, the opinions expressed in this article are the author\'s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nFor more details on how you can submit an opinion or analysis article, view our Editorial Collaboration Guide or email news@coindesk.com.', ""Matthew Roberts and Elías Snær Einarsson, two developers who have been active in the crypto space, recently proposed and published a new technology known as timechain.\n\nSimply put, the timechain is a chain of keys that can be used by anyone to encrypt any information for a certain period of time. It introduces proper incentives for the people who create and maintain the chain, hence the system is considered a decentralized autonomous company (DAC).\n\nThe idea received quite some attention, as it claims to offer genuine security improvements for the crypto space. A lot of people have made attempts to use the element of time in cryptography, as it can solve many daily problems. Think of a trustless auction where people’s bids are revealed after a specific amount of time without relying on any third party.\n\nBut how can we tie cryptography, the science of secrets, with time?\n\nCryptography and Time\n\nMachines, despite being fast compared to humans, require a processing time for completing actions. A more complicated process results in more computations by a machine, which obviously requires more time to be completed. One good example can be bitcoin mining, which requires roughly 10 minutes for miners to compute the puzzle and propose a block to the blockchain.\n\nSo assuming we use a known input and generate an output using this complicated, long-running process like continuous hashing (Hashing is perfect since it’s a one way function and can’t be inverted) by machines and then use the generated output as an input in the science of cryptography, for example using the output as a cryptographic key to encrypt information.\n\nOnce the encryption is completed, if we can get rid of the output that was generated earlier, we are only left with that known input, with which we started off. Decrypting that information can only be done with the output that we got rid of and the only way to generate that output now is to apply that long-running process again to the input.\n\nTherefore, now we can consider our information time-locked. The time that is required to unlock that information is the time needed to generate that output again. This is the basic concept time-locked encryption that was proposed in 1996 by Rivest and Shamir (two of the well-known cartographers of all time).\n\nTime-lock encryption has two steps. First step is to time-lock an input using a long-running process and the second step is to redo that process to achieve the same number again. The first step can be done using parallel processing concurrently to speed the process up whereas the second step can only be done in sequence to find the right output.\n\nSo now the question is who’s going to perform this long running process?\n\nMaintaining the Timechain\n\nTimechain creates a process that anyone can participate in, just like mining, and generates a chain of locked numbers roughly every five minutes. The incentive for participant is a fee that is paid by those who want to use the service.\n\nCoinTelegraph asked Matthew Roberts about who initially maintains the timechain and what problems can it solve initially. He said:\n\n“To start with: we are. We're building the timechain to solve a very specific problem with smart contracts called transaction malleability. TX malleability effects refund protocols in smart contracts, and in order to fix them you have to rely on third parties to hold private keys. The timechain allows us to provide a refund service for our smart contracts (or anyone’s) which can't be hacked because of how the service is enforced.”\n\nBut how do we make sure that those who create these outputs are throwing them away and not storing them? There is no guarantee that those who generate the output using hash functions will delete them. Roberts replied:\n\n“If the service in question wants to keep parts of the timechain around, they can, but it would defeat the security benefits of using a timechain and that wouldn't make much sense to spend so much money on computations and then not generate the timechain correctly. That's not to say that a single timechain should be trusted. In the ideal scenario, you would use your own timechain for things like wallets, and companies would each generate their own. But if you absolutely have to, you can always use a threshold scheme where information is encrypted with multiple timechains in such a way that a threshold can fail without being able to compromise the time-lock.”\n\nRoberts continued by mentioning a few other problems with the current paper. “There's a few more problems left with the timechain that will be fixed in v2 of the paper, like the double-spend problem with financial incentives and our messy blockchain idea,” he said. “Not big issues, just requires us to propagate rewards up the chain and gives the first person who gets to a reward the ability to hide it for around 10 minutes, so they have chance to claim it before another person arrives.”\n\nUltimately timechain addresses a few security issues and tries to solve these problems by using time-lock encryption and creating a decentralized autonomous corporation with the right incentives for its maintainers to build these time-locked keys.\n\nWhile it still has a few technical challenges, it certainly holds a lot of promise and we need to wait to see the second paper describing their practical system before judging this technology."", 'Hacking attacks occur at the least opportune times.

The Snowden leaks have revealed it to be more of a mass surveillance malware than a secure communications platform.\n\nSecure communications like those between you and a friend as you sip coffee in your backyard are the ideal of end-to-end (E2E) encrypted online communications.\n\nWe want the same security, if not more, while talking to coworkers, friends or even strangers, from anywhere around the world. This is without a doubt a big challenge, especially when governments around the world are actively snooping and subtly trying to break into the mass communications of the general public.\n\nSnowden’s Recommendations\n\nIf anyone ever needed to be certain that their communications were completely secure, it was Edward Snowden. He successfully retrieved a massive amount of top secret information from the the NSA, the publicly funded and supposedly accountable government agency. He then proceeded to blow the whistle by handing the information over to professional journalists. To do this, he had to use the best and most secure communications technology available, some of which he has since shared with the public.\n\nThe first, is PGP. It stands for Pretty Good Privacy and it uses a public and private key architecture that is intended to prove that whoever you are talking to is actually who they claim to be. It can also encrypt information in such a way that only those with whom you choose to share information can read it. PGP has been the gold standard of online, secure communications for over 20 years, but it has some weaknesses. Most notably, if your private keys are compromised, all your previous communications could be decrypted. It also has a significant learning curve.\n\nNext up is OTR, which stands for Off-the-Record encryption. This technology continues the work of PGP developers by providing end-to-end encryption for text communications, but delivering where PGP is left wanting. “Perfect forward secrecy” is one of OTR's essential assets, and as the name suggests, it encrypts every communication with a different key, so if one of your keys is compromised, not all of your communications can be decrypted. OTR is the protocol Glenn Greenwald used to communicate with Snowden and coordinate the leak.\n\nOTR stands out as one of the pieces of software that, as far as the Snowden documents go, super power government agencies can't decrypt or bypass, at least sometimes.\n\nSpiegel International, the German newspaper, has gone into detail about the known capabilities of the Five Eyes spying coalition, as well as the limits of their prying power.\n\nThe Intercept reported on how Snowden and Greenwald smuggled the top secret documents past the most sophisticated digital surveillance system ever imagined.\n\nJitsi and Pidgin, the 'Browsers' of Secure Chat\n\nPGP and OTR cannot be used on their own, as they are only authentication and encryption protocols. To use them, you need some kind of communication client. Jitsi is often considered one of the best clients around. Think of Jitsi as a Bitcoin wallet and OTR. The of PGP as Bitcoin or Litecoin.\n\nJitsi can be thought of a browser for chat, VoIP and video calls. It is fairly feature rich and can be connected to send and receive communications simultaneously from a wide variety of platforms such as Facebook, Google Chat, Slack, IRC, Jabber, XMPP and many more. Most importantly, it comes with OTR and ZRTP (real-time transport protocol) built in. ZRTP enables secure, real-time VoIP encryption and was created by Phil Zimmerman (hence the Z in ZRTP).\n\nWhile the Jitsi client no doubt presents a great effort towards making secure communications easy to use, it still requires a significant amount of tech savvy to set up VoIP and end-to-end encryption on it. If you want to use it for E2E encrypted communications, therefore, I would categorize it as advanced in difficulty. It can also be unstable at times.\n\nOnce you figure out how to establish secure end-to-end encrypted communications with another party, then you can actually send messages through Facebook or even Google Chat, and they will appear as encrypted communications to anyone but you and the receiver.\n\nWhy not connect Jitsi to Skype? Well, because Skype is closed-source and will actively close or block any attempts to interact with its protocol. You can thank Microsoft and the NSA for that.\n\nI could also find no way to integrate Tox.im, a favorite among Skype alternatives, with Jitsi. However, there is a plugin under pre-alpha development that will allow the use of Tox with Pidgin.\n\nPidgin is a chat client very similar to Jitsi, the difference being that it does not come with OTR or ZRTP installed natively and they must be added as a plugins.\n\nPidgin and Jitsi are available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Jitsi has an Android version under development.\n\nMobile\n\nIn the land of mobile E2E VoIP apps, RedPhone is easily one of the most popular, with over 7,000 downloads. Designed by Open Whisper Systems, the app features end-to-end encryption using ZRTP and SRTP (secure real-time transfer protocol) for-real time encryption. It is all open source, though unfortunately, it is not compatible with other implementations of ZRTP.\n\nTheir website proudly boasts recommendations from Snowden and Matt Green, legendary Cryptographer at John Hopkins University.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nOther projects worth mentioning are MegaChat, by prominent activist and entrepreneur Kim Dotcom. The platform boasts end-to-end encryption, leveraging a similar technology as their cloud service. They have been actively engaging the security community's criticisms and feedback since launch.\n\nMegaChat only supports one-to-one video and audio calls on fully featured browsers as of this time. However, the team said they are working on secure group calls, as well as chat. We may even see mobile support at some point to accompany their cloud storage mobile app.\n\nAnother option is the Guardian Project, an organization putting out massive amounts of open-source privacy software with a strong focus on mobile. Their apps include mobile access to Tor, ChatSecure, a chat app that also implements OTR and many more.\n\nLast but not least, there's RaKeTu, which claims to offer encrypted VoIP and chat on all major platforms except Linux (which they say is coming soon). The company is not specific about what types of encryption they use, however, and do not mention any of the recognized standards of encryption mentioned above. They are also, for the time being, closed source. They do, however, have a hilarious intro video.\n\nConclusions\n\nOne of the unconquered frontiers of E2E secure communications is group chat and calls. It is also one of Skype's most predominant technologies. Developers will have to climb this hill and set their flag in order to attract a larger audience or whole communities to their products. Let’s hope they replace Facebook Groups while they are at it.\n\nGiven how many startups and companies are trying to fill the void of truly secure online communications, it will also be hard to find an app that a majority of people use. Unfortunately, interoperability among many of these apps is as a general rule lacking. This is similar to the altcoin space today, and means one dominant player may have to rise to the top, creating a massive encrypted city, rather than small villages with encrypted tunnels between them."", 'Bitcoin to kryptowaluta, któr? mo?emy przechowywa? w wirtualnym portfelu czy na swoim dysku i pos?ugiwa? si? ni? w internecie.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could give hackers unlimited access to these virtual appliances.\n\nAlso read Popular Android Apps Vulnerable to HTTPS Bug, More Education on Technology Needed?\n\nCisco’s Two SSH Vulnerabilities\n\nCisco is one the world’s leading companies as far as networking capabilities is concerned. With most of our technology taking on a cloud platform allure, Cisco has developed network security virtual appliances for different use cases. However, an SSH vulnerability was discovered, because virtual machines running on VMWare and KVM virtualization platforms share a default authorized SSH key.\n\nOriginally, these pre-authorized SSH keys were intended for “customer support” level of access only. However, if these keys were to be used for malicious purposes, they will grant an intruder unlimited access and control. Services affected include Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance, Email Security Virtual Appliance, and Security Management Virtual Appliance.\n\nOn June 25, Cisco released an advisory on the SSH vulnerability, which stated:\n\n“IP address connectivity to the management interface on the affected platform is the only requirement for the products to be exposed to this vulnerability. No additional configuration is required for this vulnerability to be exploited.”\n\nIn saying so, Cisco admits that an attacker would only need to obtain one type of SSH key from any of their virtual appliances. Once that SSH key has been obtained, the attacker can access any [unpatched] virtual appliance reachable over the internet, regardless of its location or purpose.\n\nTo make matters even worse, a second SSH vulnerability was discovered shortly afterwards. The aforementioned virtual appliances are vulnerable due to a “pre-installed set of SSH host keys that allow access to communication secured by those keys.” These pre-installed SSH host keys are put in place to protect appliance-to-appliance communication.\n\n“Because all deployments of WSAv or ESAv use the same set of default SSH host keys, accessing any of the private keys on a single deployment could allow an attacker to decrypt communication on WSAv, ESAv, or SMAv. An attacker with possession of compromised keys, who is able to intercept traffic between the WSAv or ESAv and a host it is communicating with, would be able to decrypt the communication with a man-in-the-middle attack.”\n\nSecurity Remains Key, In Both Old & New Technology\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology are often scrutinized for their lack of security. But these security vulnerabilities on Cisco virtual appliances are a strong indication that security is always a concern, f or both old and new technology. Plus, these vulnerabilities give blockchain developers a new idea for a use case of this disruptive technology to improve the security features we use to this very day.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these Cisco SSH vulnerabilities? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nSource: Ars Technica\n\nImages courtesy of Cisco\n\nOriginally posted on: Cisco Virtual Appliances At Risk Due To Two SSH Vulnerabilities', 'Simon Mundy in Seoul JUNE 29, 2015 0 Samsung Bioepis - a spin-off sweetener? Play video Drugmaker Samsung Bioepis has revealed plans to list on Nasdaq, amid controversy over a proposed merger between two of its parent companies as part of a broader restructuring at South Korea’s Samsung group. Yang Chul-bo, chief financial officer, said Bioepis needed to float to fund its development of six biosimilar drugs — copycat versions of biological drugs derived from living cells — but that preparations would take at least a year.  He said Bioepis was focusing on a potential listing on Nasdaq, which offered a better chance than the South Korean market of meeting the company’s target valuation of at least $8bn. The company’s plans were first reported on Monday by the Korea Economic Daily. Ninety per cent of Samsung Bioepis is held by Samsung Biologics, which is in turn owned by affiliates Samsung Electronics and Cheil Industries — each with a 46 per cent stake — and construction group Samsung C&T, with 6 per cent. Last month Samsung C&T’s board approved the company’s acquisition by Cheil in an all-share deal that has been seen as part of the group’s efforts to transfer control to a new generation of the founding family. However, the proposed transaction has been engulfed by controversy over the terms. US hedge fund Elliott Associates is pursuing legal action against Samsung C&T’s board, alleging that the deal was timed to maximise a disparity between the two companies’ market valuations, resulting in Samsung C&T shareholders losing out to those of Cheil — principally, Samsung’s founding Lee family. Samsung C&T denies this, saying shareholders will benefit from synergies produced by the merger. Michael Na, an analyst at Nomura, said the revelation of Samsung Bioepis’s listing plans would focus attention on one of the most valuable assets in Cheil Industries’ eclectic portfolio, which ranges from fashion to catering and construction. “A lot of people have been saying that Cheil Industries is just a shell, with the exception of [a 19 per cent holding in Samsung Life Insurance],” he said. “Everybody is asking why it should trade at more than 100 times earnings. If they do list Bioepis on Nasdaq, it could reinvigorate the momentum in the stock.” Shares in Cheil Industries rose 2 per cent on Monday before retreating to trade 0.3 per cent higher. South Korea’s Kospi Composite was down 1.4 per cent. Samsung Bioepis is widely seen as one of the leading players in the emerging field of biosimilars, which is poised for rapid growth as patents expire on the first generation of biologic drugs. The company expects to put two biosimilars on sale next year and to become profitable by 2019, having recorded an operating loss of Won25bn ($22m) last year, Mr Yang said. Its domestic competitor Celltrion, which launched a major arthritis biosimilar this year, has a market capitalisation of Won8.7tn — 82 times its forecast earnings this year.

With the Greek stock exchange closed and banks imposing a bank holiday on Monday, the European Central Bank refusing to expand emergency loans and creditors rejecting a bailout extension for the country, investors will be urgently assessing whether the fallout will be limited to Greece — or become a global event. Bonds Fears of a eurozone break-up during the 2011-12 crisis played out in the government bond markets of southern eurozone “periphery” countries, and a significant jump in Spanish, Italian and Portuguese bond yields on Monday would be a clear sign that investors are once again taking the possibility of contagion seriously. If that is the case, expect to see a flight to safety, with investors selling out of Europe’s riskiest assets in favour of the relative security of bonds issued by Germany. Government borrowing costs in “core” Europe could drop while those in the periphery rise, increasing the spread between the two. Worries about waning liquidity across markets could further exacerbate volatility in the event of a sell-off. But if the difference between the spread increases by up to 20 or 30 basis points it will mean contagion is viewed as manageable rather than wholesale, says Steve Englander, strategist at Citigroup. Even a jump of as much as 50 basis points would still leave the countries with historically low borrowing rates — and much lower than during 2011-12. Keeping a lid on yields will be eurozone “quantitative easing”. Since the ECB decided to follow in the footsteps of central banks in the US, UK and Japan by implementing an aggressive bond-buying programme this year, prices for bonds issued across the eurozone have jumped, pushing yields to record lows. In contrast, prices of Greek government bonds, which are not part of the QE programme, have collapsed. They are likely to fall further into distressed territory when Greek markets reopen. Equities Images of bank customers queueing to remove their money are likely to foreshadow a sell-off in Greek bank stocks, which would weigh heavily on the Athens stock exchange when markets reopen to investors. Across the world, share indices will act as gauges of investor views on the seriousness of the problems in Greece for other markets. Simon Derrick, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, says: “The risk is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that the Asian and European sessions are characterised by abrupt and substantial price moves.” Crucial for investors in Europe will be whether Greece will blow off course the eurozone’s gradual economic recovery. Some argue steps taken since 2011-12 have increased its resilience significantly. Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit, said in a note on Sunday: “I know that the safe bet is to predict disaster when you think through an unprecedented event, but I truly struggle to see why a Greek disaster should have more than limited and temporary effects on the rest of Europe. “My bottom line is this: if European risky assets sell off on the news of a Greek political suicide attempt, I’ll be a buyer on any material dip.” Currency Europe’s single currency has proved remarkably resilient to the drama in Greece so far. Whether this is because investors refuse to take the idea of a Greek exit seriously or believe the region is strong enough to withstand a default and ejection is not clear. Aurelija Augulyte, analyst at Nordea, says: “Many have been puzzled about [the euro] firming lately\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making people believe [it] is a safe haven now. Is it, really? Probably not as safe at it seems — or not for long.” Formed in 1999, the euro enjoyed a decade of stability before the eurozone debt crisis began in 2010. Some contrarians believe the currency bloc will be stronger again without Greece. If so, the country’s ejection could even see the euro climbing again. Markets are at a critical juncture and significant euro weakness is highly likely, says Kit Juckes, analyst at Société Générale. “Risk aversion is likely to spread and despite the PBoC [People’s Bank of China] easing in China, we are likely to see a strong dollar, and a stronger yen, across the board in the next few days.” A yen for cherry blossoms and safety Play video Beat Siegenthaler, global macro adviser at UBS, says investors will weigh up whether the situation in Greece is a full-scale “risk-off” event or a bump in the road towards a global recovery. “Strong risk-off would probably boost dollar safe-haven demand despite US yields dropping,” Mr Siegenthaler says. “If seen just as a delay in normalisation then the dollar might go lower as investors temporarily close out of consensus positions.”', 'Ben McLannahan in New York JUNE 28, 2015 0 Authorities in the US are stepping up a fight against “rent-a-tribe” payday lenders, which set up on Indian reservations to skirt state laws curbing high-interest loans. The model is simple: a lender teams up with a small and cash-strapped Native American community, perhaps of a few hundred members, then offers loans over the internet, bypassing state interest-rate caps and other restrictions by claiming sovereign immunity. In recent years such outfits have spread rapidly, even as states including New York and Connecticut have tried to peg them back. But a new federal action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania could prove more effective in stopping these operations in their tracks. The US Justice Department is accusing Adrian Rubin, a 58-year-old resident of a town near Philadelphia, of reaping tens of millions of dollars from payday lending over a more than 14-year period, latterly through an affiliation with an unnamed tribe based in California. According to documents unsealed last week, companies controlled by Mr Rubin would pay the tribe a monthly commission of $20,000 or 1 per cent of gross revenues minus bad debt, whichever was greater, while agreeing to shield it from legal expenses. In exchange, the tribe would give the appearance that it owned and operated the payday lender and agreed to evoke constitutional protections if anyone complained that the loans broke state laws. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have enacted double-digit caps on payday loans, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Yet loans from Mr Rubin’s company, known as First National Services, typically charged a fee of 10 to 30 per cent of the amount borrowed, which meant that the effective annual interest rate on a two-week loan could run as high as 780 per cent. Authorities have tried to get to grips with such operators before, arguing that claims of tribal affiliation should not exempt lenders from complying with federal laws. In January two payday lending companies paid $21m to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that they violated the FTC Act and the Truth in Lending Act by misrepresenting to consumers how much loans would cost them. That suit ensnared Scott Tucker, a Kansas-based businessman who funded a career as a race-car driver through arrangements with the Miami and Modoc tribes of Oklahoma and the Santee Sioux of Nebraska. But the Pennsylvania case marks the first attempt to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), a 1970 federal law that has been used to successfully prosecute members of the mafia and the Hells Angels motorcycle gang. The case was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the US Postal Inspection Service, and the criminal investigations arm of the Internal Revenue Service. The suit may not threaten the lending businesses of some of the bigger Native American groups such as the Navajo Nation, which in 2006 capped charges at an annualised rate of 15 percentage points over a well-known benchmark for corporate lending. But “most” tribal lenders exist only to evade state laws designed to protect consumers from ruinous debt spirals, said Ellen Harnick, a North Carolina-based senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending. She likens the tie-ups to previous schemes employed by payday lenders to evade state restrictions, such as appearing to issue loans through a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  That “rent-a-bank” ruse had largely died out by 2010. “I assume this will be shut down too,” she said. “It is about time.”', 'Bargeld ist ein Anachronismus, den abzuschaffen, ein Segen ist? Den Griechen, die am Wochenende in den Warteschlangen vor den Bancomaten standen, muss die Idee absurder vorgekommen sein als die Vorstellung, Wolfgang Schäuble werde jedem von ihnen persönlich aus seinem Portemonnaie über klamme Zeiten hinweghelfen. In Athen ist ein Vorrat an Geldscheinen und Münzen zu einer Überlebensversicherung geworden.\n\nDabei ist es gar nicht lange her, dass der deutsche Wirtschaftsweise Peter Bofinger mit seinem Abschaffungsszenario internationales Echo auslöste. Er erklärte, Bargeld hemme nur den Zahlungsverkehr, fördere Steuerhinter\xadziehung und Schwarzarbeit. Euros, Dollars und Franken würden darum besser abgeschafft und durch elektronisches Bezahlen mit Kärtchen und Handys abgelöst.\n\nDamals, ein paar Wochen bevor Reisebüros ihren Kunden rieten, sich in den Ferien auf Mykonos lieber nicht auf Visa oder Mastercard zu verlassen, schien Bofingers Vorschlag zwar gewagt, aber eine Diskussion wert. Der Wirtschaftsweise war auch nicht der Erste, der die Idee ventilierte. Ernst zu nehmende Ökonomen wie Harvard-Professor Kenneth Rogoff, der ehemalige US-Finanzminister Lawrence Summers und Willem Buiter, der Chefökonom der Citigroup, haben schon ausführlich und eloquent über die Bargeldabschaffung nachgedacht. Eine Versammlung der Notenbanker in Basel diskutierte im Mai den Vorschlag.\n\nBanken fürchten Einkäufe am Kiosk\n\nWarum erhoffen sich Wissenschaftler, Noten- und andere Banker Vorteile vom ausnahmslos bargeldlosen Zahlungsverkehr? Sie nennen drei Gründe. Zentralbanker, die in ihrer Hilflosigkeit schon Negativzinsen eingeführt haben, um das An\xadhäufen von Geld unattraktiv zu machen, fürchten, dass Guthaben in Notenbündel umgeschichtet werden. Diesen kann die schleichende Enteignung durch Negativzinsen nichts anhaben. Die übrigen Banker erhoffen sich vom bargeldlosen Zahlungsverkehr mehr Profit aus Zahlungsverkehrsgebühren. Schliesslich ist jedes am Kiosk gegen Bargeld verkaufte Zigarettenpäckli für die Banken eine entgangene Gelegenheit, mitzu\xadkassieren. Und zu guter Letzt glauben Ökonomen wie Bofinger an eine Eindämmung von Drogenhandel, Überfällen und anderen illegalen Geschäften, die dunkle Gestalten im Schutz der Anonymität barer Münzen und Noten abwickeln.\n\nDer Beifall für Bofinger war enden wollend und die Kritik absehbar. In der Schweiz setzten sich «Blick» («Wir lassen uns unser Münz nicht wegnehmen!») und NZZ («Bargeld ist geprägte Freiheit») ins selbe Schnellboot publizistischer Empörung. Es mischt den Reflex gegen jede Bedrohung des Althergebrachten mit einem Liberalismus, der in der Anonymität, die das Bargeld bietet, eine Garantie für die Freiheit des Einzelnen sieht. Jedes Hunderternötli ein Freiheitsbrief, jeder Gedanke an seine Ab\xad\xadschaffung ein Angriff auf bürgerliche Rechte.\n\nDiese Sicht beruht auf einem Missverständnis: dass Bargeld, und nur Bargeld, Anonymität im Geldverkehr bieten kann. Die elektronische Zahlungsabwicklung legt, so glaubt man, immer eine Datenspur, die sich Banken, Staat oder?– noch schlimmer – Hacker für ihre kommerziellen, staatsschützerischen oder verbrecherischen Zwecke nutzen können.\n\nAll das mag heute und in naher Zukunft noch zutreffen. Es wäre aber bar jeder Vernunft zu glauben, dass das so bleiben wird. Die Technik hat schon viele Bedürfnisse befriedigt. Sie wird auch das Grundbedürfnis nach anonymitäts\xadgeschützter Freiheit befriedigen können.\n\nErste Vorboten sind schon zu erkennen. Möglich ist bereits heute die Ausgabe von Zahlkarten, die keine Rückschlüsse auf die Herkunft zulassen. Noch grössere Bedeutung kommt dem elektronischen Zahlsystem Bitcoin zu. Geschaffen haben es freiheitsliebende Programmierer der globalen Open-Source-\xadBewegung. Bitcoin ermöglicht anonyme Zahlungen auf der ganzen Welt. Ironischerweise liegt genau in diesem Umstand eine Hauptkritik an dem neuen Zahlungsmittel: Es lasse die Verschleierung finsterer Geschäfte zu. Was die einen an Banknoten und Münzen preisen, ist anderen an Bitcoin suspekt.\n\nBargeld schafft sich selber ab\n\nUnabhängig aller Abschaffungsdebatten steuert die technische Entwicklung ohnehin unaufhaltsam auf die Abschaffung des Bargelds zu. Die Banken preisen neue Zahlmethoden via Handy an. Dabei sind ihnen Technologiekonzerne wie Apple schon wieder einen Schritt voraus. Sie machen das Bezahlen mit der Armbanduhr möglich – was im Land der Uhren bald Nach\xadahmer finden wird.\n\nDie Geschichte des Fortschritts bleibt beim Bargeld also so wenig stehen wie in allen anderen Lebensbereichen. Aber akademische Debatten über die Abschaffung des Bargelds anzuzetteln, bewirkt genau das Gegenteil der guten Absicht: Sie lösen Angst- und Abwehrreflexe aus. Diese haben beim heutigen Stand der Technik (und des Eurozerfalls) vielleicht noch eine Berechtigung. Längerfristig aber ist es destruktiv, die Vorteile einer Welt ohne Bargeld durch die vorausseh\xadbaren Reflexe der Technikfeindlichkeit und eines fundamentalistischen Liberalismus verschleiern zu lassen.\n\n(Tages-Anzeiger)']"
06/29/2015,"['With bank doors slammed shut, frantic Greeks are turning to online trading platforms to see if the digital money Bitcoin is a better bet than the euro.\n\nThe world\'s largest Bitcoin exchanges tell CNNMoney they\'ve seen a surge of business from Greece.\n\nTen times as many Greeks are registering to trade bitcoins on the German marketplace Bitcoin.de than usual, according to CEO Oliver Flaskaemper. Bitcoin trades from Greece have shot up 79% from their ten-week average on Bitstamp, the world\'s third-largest exchange.\n\nEven trading platforms in China are getting interest. LakeBTC, headquartered in Shanghai, is seeing a 40% increase in visitors using computers in Greece.\n\nOver the weekend, the Polish exchange Bitcurex got flooded with emails from Greeks. Among their questions:\n\n""Is Bitcoin a legal currency in EU?""\n\n""Can I use Bitcurex as a bank account?""\n\n""Do you have a Bitcoin ATM network in Greece?""\n\nBitcurex then started marketing directly to Greeks on its website: ""Sign up at Bitcurex and trade for 3 months for free. No Fees for Greece!""\n\nRelated: What is Bitcoin?\n\nFor those wondering, yes, bitcoins can be spent legally in Europe. And yes, a digital Bitcoin wallet can be used as a sort of access-from-anywhere bank account.\n\nThe simplest way to understand Bitcoin is to think of it as electronic cash. You can spend it using any smartphone or computer.\n\nBut that\'s not the hard part.\n\nFirst, it\'s incredibly difficult to obtain bitcoins. There\'s a single Bitcoin ATM in all of Greece -- at a bookstore in Athens. And the most common method -- buying them in an online marketplace -- requires sending a wire transfer from a bank. But banks in Greece are closed.\n\nIt\'s not impossible, though. The exchange Bitcoin.de said some Greeks are managing to get bitcoins, because they still get access to online banking. Meanwhile, LakeBTC said Greeks can try to find local ""LakeBankers"" who are willing to sell some of their Bitcoin stash using paper cash or PayPal.\n\nThe second challenge? There aren\'t many ways to spend them in Greece anyway. According to one publicly maintained registry, BitcoinMaps, there are only half a dozen spots in Athens that accept Bitcoin as payment. Among them: a family restaurant called Angel Tavern, a head-and-neck surgeon, and a yacht rental company.\n\nAs CNNMoney documented last year, it\'s difficult to live entirely on Bitcoin -- even in high tech, modern New York City.\n\nShare your story: Are you Greek? Now interested in Bitcoin?\n\nStill, this is a pivotal moment. Bitcoin was created as an independent, computerized money in 2009 to provide a stark alternative to government-issued currency held at banks. This could be its moment to shine.\n\nBut keep your wits about you. Filip Godecki, the spokesman for the Bitcurex marketplace, said it\'s unrealistic to think Greeks everywhere will suddenly ditch the Euro and start conducting business in Bitcoin.\n\n""I\'m not so sure Greeks will start buying cheese with Bitcoin on Wednesday,"" he said. ""But I think something changed in their minds [with the bank closures]. Greek people will start thinking about fiat currencies as something not so safe for savings.""\n\nThe biggest downside for Bitcoin is that it\'s extremely volatile. In November 2012, a bitcoin was worth $11. That skyrocketed to $1,100 a year later. On Monday, a bitcoin was trading at $253.\n\nBut that shaky price shouldn\'t keep Greeks away, Godecki said. Or worries that this electronic currency isn\'t real money.\n\n""You can\'t be cut off from Bitcoin,"" he said. ""It can be much more real than the inaccessible money in the bank.""\n\nJose Pagliery is the author of Bitcoin - And the Future of Money (Triumph Books, Chicago).', 'Kraken has officially launched in Canada following a partnership with digital currency industry-focused risk management specialist Vogogo.\n\nThe San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange now allows users in Canada to convert Canadian dollars into digital currencies using Interac e-Transfer and electronic fund transfers (EFT). Trading fees are then priced between 0.10% and 0.35%, with more active traders receiving more attractive rates.\n\nIn statements, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell indicated that the company saw significant potential in the Canadian market. The exchange has been one of the most active US firms in the global market, opening to Japan and adding GBP trading in October. Kraken is also one of the more prominent businesses to pull out of the US market over legal concerns.\n\nKraken becomes the latest US bitcoin exchange to enter the Canadian market, a move that follows the closures of former market leaders CaVirtex and Vault of Satoshi in early 2015. New York-based platform Coinsetter since acquired Cavirtex in April for an undisclosed amount.\n\nKraken is currently the market leader in EUR trading according to data from Bitcoin Charts, boasting 24-hour volume of 4,579 BTC, a figure that puts it ahead of competitors including ANX and BTC-e.\n\nImage via Kraken\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, despite the name, the event largely ignored the existence of bitcoin and its trustless, peer to peer transaction network.\n\nThe B-Word\n\nIf any of the speakers at the Dutch National Bitcoin Congress (NBC) summed up the day\'s general atmosphere, it\'s British digital transaction consultant David Birch, who said:\n\n""The future of money isn\'t Bitcoin [...] and the future of Bitcoin isn\'t money.""\n\nIn a sold-out room packed with suits, the Dutch financial sector gathered to discuss blockchain technology, smart contracts, digital title deeds and shared supply chains — anything but the decentralized, stateless, bankless, community-driven digital currency. They even avoided the word “Bitcoin,” as if it were cursed. “The B-word” was the term du jour.\n\nThe NBC was hosted at ING\'s national headquarters in Amsterdam and organized by Bitcoin Properly co-producer Rutger van Zuidam and well-known Dutch trend-watcher Vincent Everts. It\'s the second edition of the congress, after the introduction at the ABN Amro bank\'s Innovation Centre a year ago.\n\nAs opposed to the previous edition, however, with speakers such as Trace Mayer, Tuur Demeester and Mike Hearn, and contrary to its own name, this year’s version of the congress was not about Bitcoin.\n\nThis time, speakers included the previously mentioned Birch, Eris\' Casey Kuhlman, IBM\'s Arjéh van Oijen, trend-watcher Sander Duivestijn, former Dutch Central Bank director Lex Hoogduin, and of course a handful of bank CIOs. They all had two things in common — skepticism regarding Bitcoin, and enthusiasm regarding blockchain technology.\n\nThe biggest news of the day came from last year’s host. ABN Amro revealed that it’s in the experimental phase of developing its own Ripple clone: ABN Trade. In cooperation with Cegeka Nederland, the bank has forked the open-source Ripple protocol, stripped it from its internal XRP currency, and is considering deploying it along whole supply chains of trade networks. If implemented correctly, and adopted widely, this could further automate international trade, removing friction from the process.\n\nBut ABN Trade is not, of course, a blockchain.\n\nA blockchain is a very specific technological advancement that allows for a series of transactions to be immutably recorded in blocks that are cryptographically linked together in a chain. The technology allows for peer-to-peer transactions through a public and shared ledger, hence essentially getting rid of the need for a trusted middleman.\n\nBut much like Ripple itself, ABN Trade is centrally controlled. That means that if the central control is in any way compromised, the entire network may be as well. Moreover, as opposed to Bitcoin, the system is not trustless, and therefore lacks the single most important innovation blockchain technology has introduced to the world.\n\nA Telling Sign\n\nABN Trade seemed indicative of how the Dutch financial sector is approaching blockchain technology as a whole. Bitcoin has revealed how outdated the existing financial infrastructure is, and banks realize this. They know that the process of transacting money and assets will need to improve drastically, as they are suddenly faced with competition from the fintech sector. These banks are not naive. They have seen what happened to the record industry, to printed media and to Kodak.\n\nThe Dutch are historically known for their progressive mindset, in particular when it comes to trade. Throughout the centuries, a number of financial innovations have been incepted or adopted early in the Netherlands, such as paper money, stocks and central banking. The current financial sector is taking steps to live up to this tradition. It wants to improve and adopt new technologies, so the focus at the congress lay on possibilities, not on risks. Dutch Banks are willing to experiment and to innovate.\n\nBut they are not willing to give up control.\n\nOr as ING CIO Brunon Bartkiewicz put it:\n\n“We need to build the new digital infrastructure. For tens of years, we have build the infrastructure for payments in the way of building the clearing houses and the SWIFTs of this world. We need to build the new digital platform […] because as a matter of fact, I don\'t see anybody else who can do that.”\n\nThe Dutch banks present at the congress ultimately want to be able to control the shared ledgers on which title deeds, smart contracts, supply chains and anything else can be programmed. This is not surprising. Banks have made a living out of being middlemen. Their business model involves acting as a third party, and trust is their core product.\n\nBut more importantly, Dutch banks aren\'t willing to give up control over the flow of money — at all. As exemplified by Birch\'s opening statement, they aren\'t even willing to really acknowledge the existence of blockchain-based money. Bitcoin the currency, for them, is some kind of weird asset or a byproduct of the blockchain, at best, and a joke at worst. The Dutch financial sector still considers itself the sole gatekeeper and guardian of money, and anything that is not administered by them can therefore not possibly be regarded as such.\n\nTherein lies the inherent irony. If the NBC really is indicative of the Dutch financial sector, it looks like banks are embracing blockchain technology without embracing two of its core attributes: trustless transactions and peer-to-peer money.\n\nThus, it will be interesting to see how this space will develop. Because the longer the financial industry will deny or ignore these inherent qualities of blockchain technology, the greater the odds that the other B-word will eventually become completely obsolete. The B is for Banks, that is.', 'Bitcoin has extended its rally, hitting a new high for June as the month comes to a close. Also, the fate of Greece will be sealed today.\n\nBitcoin has hit a new monthly high of $258.89 and is currently trading up 3.36% at $258.55. With this, Bitcoin is up for the second consecutive day.\n\nImage: https://www.tradingview.com/x/hevV6jq0/\n\nTechnical analysis of the 240-minute BTC-USD price chart confirms that speculation has pulled the cryptocurrency into the overbought region, but that is not to say that the price cannot rise higher.\n\nBitcoin Chart Structure – As can be seen from the chart above, Bitcoin is retesting the previous peaks before heading higher, thus making it a buy on dips candidate. Post the weekend gains, the cryptocurrency retested the previous peak, while today, it has stamped the previous high for June before it headed higher.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence – The MACD indicator and the Signal Line are rushing towards highs. The latest MACD value of 3.2227 and Signal Line value of 2.2725 help in gradually bringing up the Histogram value to 0.9502.\n\nMomentum – The Momentum indicator has jumped to the highest level of the past 10 sessions with a value of 10.0400.\n\nRelative Strength Index – Bitcoin has become overbought from a near-term perspective. The latest 14-4h RSI value is 75.5988 but since the underlying strength remains comfortably strong, we may see more gains going ahead.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin is currently a very dangerous security to trade on. The price may fall considerably post the Grexit, if it happens, as traders look to book profits or even if Greece manages to stay in the eurozone. On the other hand, speculative interests may take the price higher to stratospheric levels. Therefore, it cannot be said for sure how the market will react to the probable scenarios of Greece crisis. Participants are advised to wait out the event and let the market settle down before fresh trading.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The unit was chosen for its ease-of-use, as it represents a whole unit and allows players to be rewarded seemingly on a larger scale.\n\nWith additional opportunities for players to spend their bits on classes, items and other additional content within the game, PlayMC says it provides a ""safe gaming environment for kids to enjoy and have the opportunity to earn their own money"".\n\nMinecraft for the uninitiated\n\nAs the third best-selling video game of all time, Minecraft has sold over 60 million copies. Especially popular with younger people, it allows players and game developers to build worlds from 3D blocks not unlike digital Lego.\n\nEverything in the game is based on these blocks, which can either be destroyed or moved and placed to create anything within a player\'s imagination. It is an open-ended world with a high degree of flexibility as to what is possible, though some elements of the world are consistent across the different games.\n\nPlayers can play alone or connect to servers like PlayMC, allowing multi-player games and interaction in the online world with thousands of other players.\n\nPlugins allow game creators to determine the nature of play and objectives of the game, which usually involves players acquiring resources in order to build tools and structures, and sometimes fight off enemies.\n\nPlayMC\'s bitcoin economy\n\nPlayMC\'s server has plugins that change the main Minecraft game into mini-games, where players either cooperate or fight against each other to win. Each game has different objectives and different ways for players to earn their bits.\n\nA company spokesperson said:\n\n""For example in our game type \'ArcherGames\' players fight each other in a last man standing game mode. Each player is rewarded a small amount of Bits for killing other players and if they come in first, second or third they are rewarded with a larger amount of Bits.""\n\nAs well as awarding bits for standard play actions like kills and wins, PlayMC also allows its players to earn them for winning tournaments and powerups, and in non-game actions like bug reporting, blog post writing, bounties, and acting as server staff.\n\nNo parents had yet approached the company for more information on bitcoin but plenty of young players have been actively trying to understand digital currency, the spokesperson said.\n\nMost of the team\'s time is now spent clearing up misconceptions about bitcoin and providing links that explain bitoin in simple terms.\n\nPlayMC also has an extensive explanation of bitcoin and its in-game \'Bitconomy\' on the company website.\n\nE-commerce for kids\n\nPlayMC follows in the footsteps of other bitcoin-oriented Minecraft servers such as BitQuest, though PlayMC is aimed specifically at children.\n\nOne of bitcoin\'s touted advantages is the way it provides access to electronic payments to those under 18. Children generally have restricted access to banks or credit card accounts.\n\nOf course, anyone wishing to turn their bits into fiat currency will still need to go through a bitcoin exchange, which have similar verification requirements to banks. This could actually promote a bitcoin-based economy by engaging users who can\'t easily escape it.\n\nPlayMC was founded from a partnership between AcroMedia and developer Brandon Gordon, the latter of whom has been involved with Minecraft for five years and bitcoin for three. Given his personal interests, incorporating bitcoin into the game ""seemed like a no-brainer,"" he said.\n\nThe server was founded to introduce new levels of reliability to Minecraft, which often have an \'anything goes\' reputation and servers come and go with regularity.\n\nIt boasts 99.9% uptime and is regularly updated to the latest Minecraft version. Its community is always able to make suggestions and the focus is being as kid-friendly as possible.', 'Reinventure, a $50 million VC fund whose largest investor is Westpac, has made a ""strategic investment"" in bitcoin-focussed startup Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase made the announcement on its blog and a spokesperson for Westpac confirmed the investment.\n\n""We plan to work closely with Reinventure and share insights into the use of digital currencies globally,"" the Coinbase blog entry stated.\n\nCoinbase provides an online bitcoin wallet, exchange services for the crypto-currency and a range of services for retailers that want to accept bitcoin.\n\nThe service has more than 2.2 million users and 39,000 customers.\n\n""Its mission is to be the most trusted bitcoin company in the world and it is investing heavily in next generation security,"" the Westpac spokesperson said.\n\n""Reinventure\'s investment will provide key insights into the use of digital currencies and associated technologies.""\n\nEarlier investments by Reinventure have included Australian based peer-to-peer lender, SocietyOne, next generation data analytics platform, Zetaris and neighbourhood social network, Nabo, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe potential of bitcoin and other digital currencies in Australia is currently the subject of a Senate inquiry.\n\nThat inquiry, an initiative of Labor Senator Sam Dastyari, was tasked with assessing the current regulatory environment for digital currencies and the impact on the payments, retail and banking sectors.\n\nMuch of the inquiry\'s public hearing has focused on the impact of the Australian Taxation Office\'s treatment of Bitcoin.\n\nThe ATO is treating of bitcoin as a type of intangible property instead of a form of currency.\n\nThat means individuals will be charged GST when they purchase bitcoin, and businesses ""will charge GST when they supply bitcoin and be charged GST when they buy bitcoin,"" explained an ATO submission to the inquiry.\n\nCrypto-currency advocates say that the tax ruling is acting as a fetter on the development of local bitcoin-based businesses.\n\nThe inquiry is due to report in August.', 'The wild valuation swings of Bitcoin are something of a sideshow when compared with the potential of the underlying blockchain engine. Focusing on the utility of this distributed, consensus-based technology is exactly what London-based startup Everledger is doing.\n\nThe very early stage startup — which was founder and CEO Leanne Kemp’s idea a mere three months ago before she was encouraged to bring it to the London-based Barclays TechStars fintech accelerator and set up as a business — is using the Bitcoin blockchain as a platform for provenance and combating insurance fraud.\n\nIt’s starting with diamonds, with a view to expanding into all sorts of luxury goods — such as high end watches, designer handbags and fine art — so basically high value items whose provenance might otherwise be reliant on paper certificates and receipts that can easily be lost or tampered with. The blockchain is a distributed public ledger for tracking provenance in a way that’s more robust and accessible than a paper trail.\n\nOf course individual diamonds can’t be immutably connected to that immutable digital ledger — given there is always the possibility for stones to be cut or reshaped, and for serialized IDs to be ground off. But Everledger digitizes a host of data point about each stone to create a multi-layered digital fingerprint.\n\n“If you have a 5 carat diamond, not only do we capture the serial number that’s inscribed on the stone, but most diamonds are described with four Cs (the cut, the clarity etc). We taken not only those four Cs, we then take the 40 metadata points that make up the diamond. The laboratory houses inspect the stone, they effectively digitize each of those diamonds… All of the angles and the cuts and the pavilions and all of the crown. And we take all of that, as well as the serial number, as well as the four Cs, and we put all that into the blockchain,” says Kemp.\n\nShe also points out that cutting diamonds results in wastage and lost value so there’s a natural economic disincentive for fraudsters to do that.\n\n“The perfect use case for the blockchain is most definitely when there is an immutable ID on a device that can not be changed and it is sitting within an immutable ledger. And that is clearly within the world of IoT [Internet of Things]. Where you literally get the Intels of the world providing an immutable ID. And we see that, from an insurance perspective, coming down the line quite quickly,” she adds.\n\nInteresting uses of blockchain technology outside the cryptocurrency space continue cropping up. Just this month Ascribe raised $2 million in seed funding for its “notary and timestamp for intellectual property and creative works”, which uses the blockchain to store and sign digital images — creating an immutable record of their existence and enabling copyright to be enforced on digital artworks.\n\nWhile back at Disrupt New York’s startup battlefield in May there was ShoCard, a digital identity startup which stores personal identity credentials on the blockchain. (They weren’t the first to see potential for blockchain-based passports either.)\n\nKemp, a serial entrepreneur who hails from Australia originally, has a background working in insurance and the jewelry industry, as well as with emerging technologies such as RFID. It was her combination of industry expertise and exposure — talking with insurers about the huge problem of fraud — plus a sense for the potential of a nascent tech like blockchain which ultimately sparked the idea for Everledger. She presented her idea at an Aviva hackathon last year, where it won an innovation award and caught the eye of TechStars’ MD who persuaded her to get a team together and incorporate as a business.\n\nThe team now includes a “blockchain guy” — Gaurav Rana, as CTO — and a data and API specialist, and has been “head down” building the tech stack and the business case for the past three months — culminating in demo day last week, which resulted in another kind of stack (investors’ business cards) ending up Kemp’s possession. “It’s nuts. There was a lot… I’ve just put them in a great big pile, taking my pace and my time, making sure that we have the right investors.”\n\nDiamonds are a global problem, in terms of document tampering and fraud… in London it’s a $2 billion problem.\n\n“I’m not a payments person. I’m not in the banking space. But when I saw what the fundamental principles of the blockchain provided it was just patently obvious to me that would make sense around reducing fraud related instances of valuables,” she adds. “This make a lot of sense to me. Just at a very basic level, you have an immutable ledger that’s distributed. Diamonds are a global problem, in terms of document tampering and fraud, and we know in London it’s a $2 billion problem, so this can work. Let’s make this work!”\n\nAt this point Everledger is focusing on getting diamond pipeline producers and major insurers adopting its system. Kemp describes this slice as a very consolidated market, with hundreds not thousands of companies in play, so she argues it’s “quite achievable” to elbow in and start generating revenue with its blockchain-based diamond fraud detection system. Albeit, there’s obviously a network effect for Everledger to prove its worth — based on getting enough stones on its books.\n\nIt now has some 280,000 diamonds digitized and embedded into the blockchain (it’s working its way through 850,000 diamonds submitted so far for adding to its ledger), and has all the major certificate houses signed up, plus four of the major London-based insurance companies. Kemp says it’s in discussions with police, Interpol and Europol who are also interested in what the tech offers — from a crime detection and prevention point of view.\n\nThe incentive for insurance companies to get involved is to reduce claims fraud and also recoup costs associated with paying out claims. “There’s really interesting economics around that because the insurance companies as they pay out these claims are actually the rightful owner of these diamonds because they paid the claim out and the title of that diamond ultimately sits with the insurance company,” says Kemp. “So it’s actually the insurance company’s property that we will recover.”\n\nPoint is: diamonds don’t depreciate in value; quite the opposite. So a stolen stone that’s recovered even years hence would still be an asset to its insurance company owner. “That’s one of the big use cases that’s coming out that we’re working with the insurance industry now,” adds Kemp.\n\nA third target is big online retail marketplaces where people might try to offload stolen or counterfeit goods.\n\n“Our play is actually around the police, around insurance companies, and having a line of sight and an eye — whether that’s across open portal data with open source intelligence, or whether it’s on direct API feeds — with really large houses like eBay and Amazon, Rakuten, these kind of portal sites… where people think they’re outsmarting the insurance companies by putting their goods online to sell it.\n\n“We can just do these as a one-on-one insurance play, or ultimately if we really want to stamp out the entire issue around diamonds then of course there’s a consensus around having all the insurers be a part of what we’re doing. But we’re not reliant upon every insurer, and we’re not reliance upon every diamond manufacturer. It can be as narrow as key select people.”\n\n“For us it’s about this longevity, of being in the market with enough transparency to have enough for people to understand hang on a minute you’re going to be caught, right? The world has existed in silos, there’s a silo in eBay, there’s a silo in Amazon, there’s a silo in insurance companies. We bring this together so there’s visibility,” she adds.\n\n“We’re making it visible to two important people in the ecosystem: we’re making it visible to the police, and let them go and chase down the baddies and investigate based on our data; and we’re making it visible to the insurance companies so they know they either can pay the claim or not pay the claim, based on reasonable doubt or not reasonable doubt.”\n\nAlthough diamonds are its starting point, Everledger is not intending to stick solely with diamonds forever. As noted earlier, it’s grand aim is to be a provenance platform for a variety of high value and luxury goods. Here again, this push is aimed at meshing with the needs of online ecommerce marketplaces which are under pressure to spot counterfeit or stolen goods being hawked on their own platforms.\n\n“These are very real problems in the luxury goods industry. In the first instance around diamonds we could turnaround and provide API services to eBay and Amazon to say actually you’ve got a seller… that’s just listed a diamond that’s actually been involved in an insurance claim over the last six months in London. And so therefore it becomes an onus on either eBay or an alert system somehow to say… this at one point was claimed as a stolen or a lost diamond,” she adds.\n\nIt’s also aiming to offer a consumer facing “digital vault” app where owners of luxury goods can create a record of ownership themselves — perhaps incentivized to do so by insurance companies offering lower premiums to people who self-certify their valuables in this way. This app is planned for release around September or October.\n\n“We do want to play inside that consumer space, with the certificates, underpin some transparency around diamonds for marketplaces and those sorts of things,” she says. “We see what we’re doing just beyond diamonds. Diamonds, watches, art, Louis Vuitton handbags, things that are identified through some kind of serialized way of identifying that product. Again it’s not ever going to be 100 per cent immutable, because they’re not smart devices, we’re working in a world of ‘dumb objects’. The utopic world with the blockchain is IoT, there’s no doubt about that.”', ""The overnight implementation of capital controls in Greece, as the government looks set to default on its IMF loan repayment, has led citizens to explore other methods for moving their savings out of the country.\n\nThe Greek government announced on June 28 that banks in the Mediterranean country would remain closed for the next week. The government also imposed capital controls to prevent the flight of money internationally. Let’s look at some of the ways Greeks may be able to exchange their funds for bitcoin, before the expected default on the repayment of the IMF loan on June 30.\n\nThe BBC news service explains what these capital controls mean for those trying to live day-to-day in Greece, including a 60 euro limit on daily ATM withdrawals, and a ban on overseas money transfer, except for important business transactions. The BBC defined these as follows:\n\nA maximum of €60 (£42; $66) can be withdrawn from an account in one day\n\nOverseas transfers of cash prohibited, except for vital, pre-approved commercial transactions.\n\nAdditional unconfirmed reports suggest that up 40% of Greek ATMs may already have been emptied of their supply of euros by concerned savers, leaving those in smaller towns and villages without a method to withdraw cash.\n\nThe prevention of overseas transfers means that Greek citizens are also finding themselves unable to digitally transfer their savings abroad to contacts in either Europe or the rest of the world where the funds may be better protected.\n\nThe controls on fund transfers also extends to Western Union, which confirmed on June 29 that their Greek arm of the business would also be closed for the rest of the week.\n\nWestern Union to close in Greece for rest of week t.co/f7j1RzpRHA — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) June 29, 2015\n\nWith traditional bank transfers and well-known options such as Western Union out of the picture, we spoke to Kevin Rinta, vice executive officer at Exmo.com about how the Spanish-based digital currency exchange was experiencing the Greek crisis.\n\nWe asked Rinta if there had been any increase in the number of Greek users seeking to move their savings out of the country via bitcoin. The VEO explained there hadn't been a distinct rise. He said:\n\n“The percentage of European citizens registered on our platform is quite large and growing. Naturally, Greece is included in this growing demographic.”\n\nRinta went on to describe why he believed there wasn't a large upswing in the number of Greek citizens specifically trying to purchase digital currencies as a way to move money abroad. He said:\n\n“[T]he problem here is foresight. If the banks are already closed, then people can't access their money to purchase bitcoin. However, those people who saw the writing on the wall and were prepared could have converted their euros into bitcoin and held them until this crisis blew over. Let this be a lesson to other people living in other countries struggling within the European Union.”\n\nWe asked Rinta what alternative methods through which customers in the country could still use Exmo's platform to purchase digital currencies without using the SEPA bank payment system that is now blocked in Greece. The question that has been popular on Reddit's /r/bitcoin. He said:\n\n“It is very easy. Customers can use any of the following payment systems: Perfect Money, AstroPay, Payeer, Ok Pay, Qiwi and Yandex Money.”\n\nIn January, CoinTelegraph predicted that the worsening financial climate in Greece could lead to monetary controls. A similar situation has been present in Ukraine since March, when the rate of hyperinflation reached 272%. The government there also acted to prevent citizens from moving funds abroad when it limitied their ability to buy foreign currency through the country's banks."", 'Mexican bitcoin exchange Bitso has secured a seed-funding round led by Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency group which was participated in by Mexico-based angel investors.\n\nWith the new financing, Bitso plans to expand its team in Mexico and aggressively push its project to use bitcoin for cross-border payments across South America. Since the majority of the population has no access to bank accounts or credit cards, Bitso aims to provide the nation with a cheaper yet robust mobile payment platform by connecting its bitcoin exchange with Transfer.\n\nTransfer is a lightweight banking initiative developed by the Mexican government as a collaboration with Mexican banks and corporations including Banamex, Inbursa, Telcel and Oxxo.\n\nSimilar to M-Pesa, the popular mobile payment service launched by Vodafone in Kenya, the joint project of Transfer and Bitso allows users to send pesos using bitcoin to more than 100 million cell phones in Mexico.\n\nThe receivers can withdraw cash at Banamex or Inbursa ATMs, creating a nationwide network of bitcoin withdrawal locations, thus increasing national bitcoin adoption.\n\n“Whether you are talking about new payments services that help facilitate faster and cheaper money transfers across the world’s most active remittance corridor, or mobile money and microfinance opportunities for Mexico’s underbanked consumers, bitcoin and blockchain technology is poised to transform financial services in Mexico and all of Latin America,” said Silbert. “Bitso is well-positioned to emerge as the region’s leader in bitcoin exchange and payments, and we are thrilled to partner with them to help build a big, important company in this emerging industry.”\n\nBitso to Emerge as Leading Mexican Bitcoin Exchange\n\nLaunched in April 2014, Bitso is one of the most prominent bitcoin exchanges in Mexico, with top-tier security standards and strong focus on regulatory compliance. To compete against Mexico’s leading exchanges like Volabit and meXBT, Bitso recently acquired Unisend Mexico, a bitcoin exchange which operates in both Argentina and Mexico.\n\n“Through Bitso, we have enabled an efficient and low-cost backbone for cross-border transactions,” explained Bitso founder and CEO Pablo Gonzalez. “We believe this will be a powerful rail to streamline international B2B payments, and remittances to the millions of unbanked and underbanked Mexican citizens.”\n\nFounder talks Bitcoin Adoption in Mexico\n\n“The most exciting aspect we are seeing firsthand is all the cross-border payment applications that are just beginning to happen: remittances, B2B payments, etc. Mexico is a hotbed for global payments,"" Gonzalez told Bitcoin Magazine. The US-Mexico corridor is the largest in the world with $24 billion USD-a-year flow.\n\nInternational trade and commerce is even larger. $360 billion USD a year, and it is bi-directonal ($761 billion total.) Several partners, including traditional remittance companies, bitcoin remittance startups and cross-border payment businesses, have been running tests and pilot programs for the past few months.\n\nGonzalez said that Bitcoin adoption has been growing steadily month-on-month in Mexico, as more businesses have begun to accept bitcoin payments.\n\n“We talk to the regulators on a regular basis,"" he said. ""It is positive overall. They are very excited about the potential ... However, they feel it is premature to regulate,"" he said, a view similar ""to some of the conclusions taken by the Canadian Senate recently.”', 'It may be an alternative to fiat currencies and traditional banking, but Bitcoin is using up entirely too much electricity. One critic claims the online crypto-currency uses 5,000 times more power per transaction than VISA and is not sustainable.\n\nAccording to the calculations by Christopher Malmo, writing at Vice’s blog Motherboard, “a single Bitcoin transaction uses roughly enough electricity to power 1.57 American households for a day.”\n\nCiting estimates by the computer cooling firm Allied Control, Malmo says the total power consumption of the Bitcoin network is anywhere from 250 to 500 Megawatts (MW). Taking into account the total number of calculations the network can perform per second (hashrate) and the “generous miner efficiency” of 0.6 watts per gigahash, Malmo writes, the network’s constant power draw is just under 215 MW, or enough to power 173,000 average US households for a day.\n\nSo a single #bitcoin transaction consumes enough electricity to power 1.57 US households a day http://t.co/iCD7xuIpyEpic.twitter.com/3HnU8zxOQm — Joseph Cox (@josephfcox) June 29, 2015\n\nTaking his calculations a step further, Malmo compared Bitcoin’s power usage with that of VISA, the world’s largest payment processing network. Using the available data, he shows that VISA processed 58.5 billion transactions in 2013, using enough electricity to power 50,000 US households a day. That, he says, makes Bitcoin about 5,033 times more energy intensive per transaction.\n\nREAD MORE: Russell Brand eyes cryptocurrency as integral part of global revolution\n\nA 2014 sustainability study by Hass McCook said that Bitcoin had 99 percent fewer carbon emissions than the banking system. Malmo dismisses this as irrelevant, because the conventional money system is much bigger. The world banking system’s market capitalization in 2010 was 1,989 times bigger than today’s total Bitcoin valuation, he says, putting the virtual currency’s relative economic impact at 0.275 percent.\n\n“It appears there are significant challenges to ensuring that Bitcoin’s growth minimizes environmental impacts,” Malmo quoted Jeremy McDaniels, a financial system sustainability expert with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “Energy footprints could be an issue if major scale-up is achieved.”\n\nOn the other hand, Malmo admits Bitcoin’s mining power demands won’t scale up linearly with increased usage or transactions, and that his figures are nowhere near exact. “It’s important to note that many of the variables in my calculation are constantly changing slightly,” he wrote.\n\nREAD MORE: Debt crisis: Will Greece exit euro? LIVE UPDATES\n\nNonetheless, Malmo concludes that “energy-conscious people looking to use an alternative currency for the masses should probably look somewhere other than Bitcoin.”\n\nComments have been mostly critical, objecting to Malmo’s calculations and pointing out that the current ratio of transactions to power consumption is low because mining for Bitcoins is more profitable than transaction fees. As more coins are mined, however, the reward per coin will diminish toward zero and the miners will profit more from processing transactions, lowering the network’s power demand.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin’s electricity consumption doesn’t seem to be deterring the Greeks, who are reportedly flocking to the virtual currency in droves as traditional banks are closing their doors and placing hard limits on cash withdrawals due to the debt dispute with the European Central Bank.']"
06/30/2015,"['Greeks are turning to cryptocurrency bitcoin in the face of painful capital controls and a potential exit from the euro.\n\nBitcoin exchanges have seen a surge in interest from Greek users and the digital currency\'s value has increased from $230 on 31 May to $264.79 at the time of writing, a monthly increase of more than 15%, according to price index Coindesk.\n\nCNN reported that bitcoin trades from Greece have rocketed by 79% on Bitstamp, the world\'s third biggest exchange, while Greeks are registering with German exchange Bitcoin.de at a rate 10 times higher than usual.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nAthens is edging towards an exit from the single European currency after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum on proposals from eurozone creditors, due to take place on Sunday. If the Greek people vote against the proposals, a Grexit would be the most likely outcome.\n\nIn the latest twist in its financial crisis, an extraordinary meeting of eurozone finance ministers has been called for tonight after the Greek government made a last-ditch appeal today for a new two-year loan.\n\nDespite the recent surge in popularity, Greece only has one bitcoin ATM in the entire country at an Athens bookstore, according to CNN. Publicly-maintained registry BitcoinMaps records only about a dozen locations which accept the currency in Athens and its surrounding districts, including a family restaurant and a yacht rental company.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency which allows for anonymous payments without the use of banks and is currently unregulated and not tied to any particular country.\n\nIn March-April 2013, the value of Bitcoin spiked by almost 700% in Cyprus when capital controls were introduced in the country, limiting the amount which citizens could withdraw from their accounts. On Sunday, Greece closed its banks and imposed a daily €60 limit on cash withdrawals.\n\nMike Hearn, a core Bitcoin developer who has also worked as a software developer for Google, admits that the cryptocurrency is not a ""magic bullet"" which would solve all of Greece\'s financial woes, although he believes that the Greek crisis could have avoided such a messy conclusion if the country had been using Bitcoin for a number of years.\n\n""If Greece used Bitcoin instead of the euro, the outcome would still be the same where the government would have to balance taxation and spending but it probably would have happened a lot sooner,"" says Hearn.\n\nHe says that fractional reserve banking - in which only a small percentage of bank deposits are backed by cash and available for withdrawal - is less likely under a Bitcoin system, where the amount of currency in circulation is regulated by a fixed formula.\n\nAccording to Hearn, this means Greece would have been unable to continue borrowing from its creditors and racking up such huge debts, meaning it would have been forced to get its house in order much earlier.\n\nThe use of the cryptocurrency, created in 2009, is legal within Europe. Bitcoins can be bought on exchanges using different currencies and are stored in a digital wallet on a user\'s computer or in a cloud storage system.\n\nIn August 2013, the value of all Bitcoins in circulation exceeded €1.3bn, with the digital currency particularly popular in North America and Europe, according to Bitcoin.org. The Isle of Man, which is part of Great Britain, is ranked by Coindesk as the most popular European location for the cryptocurrency, with one ATM for every 87,000 people.\n\nDr Stephen Kinsella, senior lecturer in economics at the University of Limerick, Ireland, says that Greek interest in Bitcoin is a natural reaction to the imposition of financial strictures on people\'s bank accounts.\n\nHowever, he says that the volatile nature of Bitcoin, which can vary wildly from week to week, makes it unsuitable for use as a parallel currency in Greece.\n\n""The key problem is volatility. Would you like your wages paid in Bitcoin? No. Would you like to pay taxes in bitcoin? No,"" he says.\n\nHowever, some commentators have noted that Bitcoin\'s value is highly volatile and believe that the recent surge in value is largely unconnected with the possibility of a Grexit.\n\nThe co-founder of Vaultoro, a bitcoin exchange which lets customers exchange the cryptocurrency for gold, told Reuters that there had been a 124% increase in visits from Greek IP addresses. However, he later told Coindesk that traffic had also grown by 60% in Germany and Spain, whose economies are in far better shape than Greece.', 'The co-founder of Coinbase, Fred Ehrsam, says the bitcoin company will encourage local regulators to support the growth of cryptocurrencies as a precursor to potential expansion in Australia, after Westpac Banking Corp\'s venture capital fund Reinventure Group invested in Coinbase alongside some of the world\'s leading venture capital firms.\n\nMr Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs currency trader who co-founded Coinbase in mid-2012, described the deal – the first involving an Australian bank and any bitcoin player – as an ""information sharing partnership"" that would provide Coinbase with an opportunity to educate Austrac and other financial regulators about bitcoin. This is digital money that is not controlled by any bank or government and allows transfers of value to be made to anyone with an internet connection without bank involvement in the process.\n\nSHARE\n\nShare on Facebook SHARE\n\nShare on Twitter TWEET\n\nLink Coinbase says it will educate Austrac and other financial regulators about bitcoin.

These include storing bitcoin in a digital wallet, allowing customers to exchange domestic currencies in and out of bitcoin, and providing merchant services to process transactions for companies dealing in bitcoin. It also operates an exchange where speculators can bet on direction of price of bitcoin, and various anti-money laundering and security services.\n\nAustralian users can currently use the Coinbase wallet but the company does not transfer Australian dollars, which would require a relationship with a local bank and approval by regulators.\n\nDespite the investment by Reinventure, it is understood that Westpac has no current plans to provide banking services to Coinbase. Like other Australian banks, Westpac is cautious about falling foul of regulators by working with bitcoin companies and has previously stopped providing banking services to local bitcoin start-ups.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company had no ""definitive plans"" to expand in Australia, Mr Ehrsam said on Tuesday. But ""there will come a point when we expand in different markets outside the US and Europe"", he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n""In the US, we are known as the pre-eminent bitcoin company because we have trust of consumer in terms of security and relationships with regulators. As we open to new markets, we want to establish that trust as well.""\n\nCoinbase allows users to buy and sell bitcoin in 25 countries and is focused on expanding to 30 by the end of the year.\n\nThe Senate Economics References Committee is due to report by August 10 on developing a regulatory system in Australia for digital currencies. The Reserve Bank of Australia and Australian Securities and Investments Commission have conducted detailed analysis of bitcoin.\n\nEarlier this month, US regulator Benjamin Lawsky released a final version of bitcoin regulations, known as BitLicense, which will require digital currencies businesses in New York state to operate with a license and report to government. The UK Treasury has also released plans for a regulatory scheme for cryptocurrencies.\n\nMr Ehrsam said that compared with regulators in the US and UK, Australia\'s regulators lacked transparency about how they are thinking about bitcoin. The company will work through Reinventure ""to be as forward with regulators as we can be, to ideally see them face-to-face and to have conversations proactively,"" he said. ""We can help the education process and hopefully this is something we can get going in Australia as well.""\n\nCoinbase has been seeking to legitimise bitcoin, which has been plagued by volatile moves in its price, the high-profile theft of some bitcoin from an exchange in Japan, and its use in the blackmarket economy.\n\nIn the US, we are known as the pre-eminent bitcoin company because we have trust of consumer in terms of security and relationships with regulators. Fred Ehrsam, Coinbase\n\nCryptocurrencies still controversial\n\nBitcoin is a controversial topic in banks given its broader acceptance could reduce bank fee revenue from processing payments and conducting international transactions, and may also make redundant the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been invested in closed payments systems.\n\nBut Mr Ehrsam said discussions with Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer suggested he understands that banks need to know about the operation of the ""blockchain"", the ""distributed ledger"" used by bitcoin that tracks who owns how much of the currency. ""Westpac] are wanting to ask questions and get smart now, even if they do not understand the implications yet, rather than have bitcoin grow and be behind the curve and asking questions later,"" Mr Ehrsam said.\n\nMr Hartzer was not available to comment but a Westpac spokesperson said Coinbase\'s ""mission is to be the most trusted bitcoin company in the world and it is investing heavily in next generation security. Reinventure\'s investment will provide key insights into the use of digital currencies and associated technologies.""\n\nReinventure Group co-founder Simon Cant said: ""We\'re very excited to be working with such a great management team and look forward to helping them grow their business.""\n\nReinventure joined a $US75 million ($98 million) ""Series C"" capital raising conducted by Coinbase earlier this year. It was also backed by the New York Stock Exchange; venture capital powerhouses Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Andreessen Horowitz, Robot Capital and Union Square Ventures; Japan\'s largest mobile phone operator NTT DoCoMo; USAA Bank; the venture arm of Spain\'s BBVA; and former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer. No amounts were disclosed, however, it is understood that each party put in between $US1 million and $US10 million into the raising, which was completed in January.\n\nThe deal comes after Westpac, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Commonwealth Bank of Australia begin testing out payment technology from US-based company Ripple Labs, an exchange for messages that is being targeted towards banks. The Ripple network uses similar blockchain-style technology to bitcoin, which it calls a ledger, but is a distributed network rather than a decentralised one.\n\nWestpac seeded Reinventure – which is managed independently – with $50 million in February last year. It has made four previous investments: marketplace payments provider, PromisePay; big data analytics firm Zetaris Corporation; Australian local community social network Nabo; and the peer-to-peer lender SocietyOne, which is also backed by media moguls James Packer, Lachlan Murdoch and Ryan Stokes.', ""As hard as it is to imagine now, 20 years ago, when Internet communication was new, it wasn’t always possible to know if you could trust the person on the other end of your interaction.\n\nAn innovation in secure Internet communication, SSL, enabled consumers to be able to trust that, say, their credit card numbers wouldn’t be stolen online. And companies like Verisign offered seals of approvals that let a consumer know when they were dealing with a company they could trust.\n\nIn the same way, Bitcoin security company BitGo announces Tuesday a new stamp of approval in Bitcoin transactions that aims to help consumers put more trust in transactions in the digital currency.\n\nThis “proof of reserve” product, called Verified by BitGo, intends to show users of Bitcoin companies that the firm they are dealing with has adequate funds, though at first, this will not be done in real time (more on that in a second).\n\n“It’s a way we can help our customers” — meaning Bitcoin businesses -- “show their end users that they’re operating in a good state, and make sure everyone can trust everybody. It’s kind of like an online audit that everyone has access to in a safe way all the time,” says Mike Belshe, chief executive of BitGo, adding that demand for the product came from Bitcoin businesses, not consumers.\n\nOne of the problems so far in the history of Bitcoin has been some operators not having the funds they claimed to have. The most notorious incident involved Mt. Gox, an exchange in Japan that, due to poor management, actually lost 850,000 Bitcoin, then worth $450 million.\n\nBitGo, which counts former Verisign CEO, chairman and president Stratton Sclavos on its board, will calculate both a company’s liabilities and its assets. As long as its assets are in excess of it liabilities, participating companies will be able to display a Verified by BitGo certificate on a dedicated page. The service is available to businesses that secure their assets at BitGo.\n\n“This is about a feature that Bitcoin provides that you can’t do in U.S. dollars,” says Belshe. “A company can’t say, ‘We have the money in the bank we say we have, so we’re worthy of your trust to do business with us.’” He foresees a future in which financial services companies are able to use technology to show, in real time, that they’re solvent. (Today, most Bitcoin companies hold 100% of funds instead of keeping a fraction as banks typically do.)\n\nThe first customer will be ChangeTip, a “micropayments” company that allows people to easily send small amounts of Bitcoin to each other. For instance, some ChangeTip users use it to send “a beer” ($3.50), “a doughnut” ($0.35), or — the most common choice on the service — “a coffee” ($1.50). Others even send people fractions of a penny as a sign of a “super like” for an especially comment on Facebook or a “super upvote” for the same on Reddit.\n\n“Historically, banks have operated as a fractional reserve, and that’s fine as long as the company is solvent, but if the company’s insolvent, there’s not enough money to cover [liabilities],” says Nick Sullivan, ChangeTip CEO. “Beyond just saying that we’re not running a fractional reserve, this new step forward with BitGo allows us to prove we’re not running a fractional reserve, with cryptography.”\n\nTo launch, the verifications will occur on a monthly basis. This means that, in the beginning, the Verified by BitGo seal could appear in transactions with companies that are insolvent -- at least until BitGo's next monthly audit. Belshe says the company is working toward daily reports and wrote in a followup email, “Keep in mind that Mt. Gox likely was running in an insolvent state for months or even years. Even a monthly based system probably could have prevented tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.”\n\nThe service is included in BitGo’s existing API and platform product and complements a new real-time proof of reserve offering that BitGo launched on exchange Bitfinex earlier this month. That product segregates accounts at Bitfinex, instead of pooling funds as most exchanges do, so account holders can verify their assets on the blockchain, while keeping their money in a wallet that has institution-level security. The Verified by BitGo product offers proof of reserve for companies that pool their customers’ assets."", 'The cryptography behind bitcoin solved a paradoxical problem: a currency with no regulator, that nonetheless can’t be counterfeited. Now a similar mix of math and code promises to pull off another seemingly magical feat by allowing anyone to share their data with the cloud and nonetheless keep it entirely private.\n\nOn Tuesday, a pair of bitcoin entrepreneurs and the MIT Media Lab revealed a prototype for a system called Enigma, designed to achieve a decades-old goal in data security known as “homomorphic” encryption: A way to encrypt data such that it can be shared with a third party and used in computations without it ever being decrypted. That mathematical trick—which would allow untrusted computers to accurately run computations on sensitive data without putting the data at risk of hacker breaches or surveillance—has only become more urgent in an age when millions of users constantly share their secrets with cloud services ranging from Amazon and Dropbox to Google and Facebook. Now, with bitcoin\'s tricks in their arsenal, Enigma\'s creators say they can now pull off computations on encrypted data more efficiently than ever.1\n\n“You can see it as a black box,” says Guy Zyskind, an MIT Media Lab graduate researcher and one of Enigma’s creators. “You send whatever data you want, and it runs in the black box and only returns the result. The actual data is never revealed, neither to the outside nor to the computers running the computations inside.”\n\nEnigma’s technique—what cryptographers call ""secure multiparty computation""—works by mimicking a few of the features of bitcoin’s decentralized network architecture: It encrypts data by splitting it up into pieces and randomly distributing indecipherable chunks of it to hundreds of computers in the Enigma network known as “nodes."" Each node performs calculations on its discrete chunk of information before the user recombines the results to derive an unencrypted answer. Thanks to some mathematical tricks the Enigma creators implemented, the nodes are able to collectively perform every kind of computation that computers normally do, but without accessing any other portion of the data except the tiny chunk they were assigned.\n\nTo keep track of who owns what data—and where any given data\'s pieces have been distributed—Enigma stores that metadata in the bitcoin blockchain, the unforgeable record of messages copied to thousands of computers to prevent counterfeit and fraud in the bitcoin economy. (Like other bitcoin-style decentralized crypto schemes, Enigma\'s architecture can seem almost like a Rube Goldberg machine in its complexity. For a full technical explanation, read the project\'s whitepaper here. In addition to that whitepaper, Zyskind and Nathan say they plan to publish the open-source code for the project by the end of the summer.)\n\n""I can take my age, this one piece of data, and split it into pieces, and give it to ten people,"" says Zyskind. ""If you ask each one of those persons, they have only a random chunk. Only by combining enough of those pieces can they decrypt the original data.""\n\nCourtesy Oz Nathan\n\nIt\'s important to note that any new and unproven encryption scheme should be approached with caution. But if Enigma\'s encryption works as its creators promise, it would have vast implications. Private databases could be hosted and queried in the cloud without any risk of revealing the database\'s contents. It could also enable a search engine to return search results without ever seeing the user\'s unencrypted search request. Enigma\'s creators suggest the project could also enable Internet users to safely share all sorts of data with pharmaceutical companies and advertisers without any privacy risks—the companies could run computations on the encrypted data and get useful results without the access to see any specific user\'s data. ""No one wants to give their data to some company when you don’t know what they‘ll do with it,"" says Oz Nathan, Enigma\'s co-creator. ""But if you have guaranteed privacy, data analysis can be a lot more powerful. People will actually be willing to share more.""\n\nIf you have guaranteed privacy, data analysis can be a lot more powerful. People will actually be willing to share more. oz nathan\n\nThe Enigma creators are far from the first to suggest a scheme for achieving homomorphic encryption\'s goals; IBM researcher Craig Gentry achieved a major breakthrough in 2009 when he came up with the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme—a mathematical technique that allowed any computation to be performed on encrypted data with no security compromises and none of Enigma\'s complex network of distributed computers. But Gentry\'s method was also extremely slow: Performing a computation such as a Google search using it could take as much as a trillion times longer than doing the same task without encryption. Since then, Gentry has dramatically sped up the process, but it still multiplies the time necessary for a calculation by close to a millionfold.\n\nEnigma\'s creators say their decentralized encryption process, on the other hand, only multiplies the computing requirements for a calculation by less than 100 fold. They hope to further reduce that in the near future to a tenfold increase. They also note that the computing requirements for any Enigma computation depend on the number of nodes involved. The more computers involved, the more secure the user\'s data, but the slower the process.\n\nA considerable hurdle for Enigma, however, is that it requires hundreds or even thousands of users adopt the system and run its code before it can start working securely. To get that initial buy-in, Nathan and Zyskind have created an incentive scheme: Every time someone requests a computation from the Enigma network, he or she pays a bitcoin fee. A tiny part of that money is paid to a computer in the bitcoin network to record Enigma\'s metadata in the blockchain. But a larger portion of the fee goes to the nodes in the Enigma network as a reward for storing and processing the user\'s encrypted data. And the Enigma software can also be configured to reward the owner of the data, so that an Enigma customer, like an advertiser, can pay users for the privilege of mining their data—but without ever seeing it in a decrypted form.\n\nThat attempt to recruit as many nodes as possible is designed to combat a fundamental vulnerability in Enigma\'s scheme: If enough Enigma nodes work together, they can team up to decrypt and steal the user\'s data. But that kind of collusion isn\'t likely, says Zyskind. He compares the problem to a so-called ""51 percent attack"" in bitcoin, in which a majority of the bitcoin nodes collectively agree to take over the blockchain and defraud users. That sort of bitcoin attack has never occurred, Zyskind points out, and he says the same malicious collaboration problem in Enigma is even less likely.\n\nTo keep Enigma nodes honest and ensure that the nodes\' computations are accurate, the system also includes a ""security deposit"" that each must pay in bitcoin to join the network. If a node is found by other nodes in the network to be dishonest, its deposit is seized and distributed to the other nodes. ""It all balances out and kills the incentive for people to cheat,"" says Zyskind.\n\nEnigma may be able to make the mining of deeply personal data safer from a privacy perspective.\n\nZyskind and Nathan\'s adviser on Enigma is Sandy Pentland, a well known MIT data scientist who gained fame for his work in data-mining social interactions. In one experiment, for instance, Pentland\'s researchers put sensor devices called ""sociometers"" around hundreds of subjects\' necks within work environments, and used the resulting data about who talked to whom and even in what tone of voice to learn lessons about what type of group within the office was most productive or who its real managers were, as opposed to those with the highest titles on the org chart.\n\nEnigma may be able to make that mining of deeply personal data safer from a privacy perspective. ""My work...has always explored a future where sensors and computers are far more ubiquitous than they are today,"" Pentland writes in an email to WIRED. ""The advent of bitcoin changed these discussions profoundly by adding tools to protect privacy in a whole new way. Enigma is the result of that collision between bitcoin and privacy and security research.""\n\nIf Enigma can enable computation on encrypted data, says Zyskind, perhaps it can eventually entice users to even make more data available for mining, without the Big Brother fears that data mining usually brings with it.\n\n""How can we do more with data, and from a privacy perspective, how can we protect it?"" Zyskind asks. ""This is a way to get data privacy now.""\n\n1Correction 7/1/2015: An earlier version of the story referred to Enigma as a type of homomorphic encryption.

Photo: Bitcoin\n\nJOHANNESBURG – You can now use bitcoin to buy airtime and data.\n\nBitcoin exchange BitX has begun selling mobile airtime and data for South African mobile networks.\n\nFor now the facility is only available via the BitX website, but the company says it’ll be adding the functionality to its Android and iOS apps soon.\n\nBitX was founded in February 2013 and is headquartered in Singapore.\n\nThe company has offices in Cape Town and Jakarta.\n\nIn addition to serving as an exchange between bitcoin and fiat currencies, BitX provides bitcoin wallet services and provides an API that developers can use to build support for bitcoin into their apps and services.\n\nThe company’s merchant services make it possible for businesses to accept bitcoin as a means of payment while being paid in a conventional currency of their choice and being insulated from exchange rate volatility.\n\nA year ago BitX partnered with payment gateway PayFast to enable PayFast customers, which include some 30,000 South African websites, to accept bitcoin as payment.\n\nThe addition of the new airtime and data facility can’t hurt the uptake of the cryptocurrency, the success of which hedges largely on retailers finding ways to accept it and consumers actually making use of it.', 'As an Internet-based payment system, most bitcoin transactions today necessitate that users are online or otherwise can print and exchange private keys.\n\nHowever, Romanian mobile payments provider Netopia mobilPay is now backing a proposal that strives for a middle path. Called OffCoin, the proposal is for a system that allows microSD cards in mobile phones to generate, store, transmit and delete bitcoin private keys.\n\nIn effect, OffCoin would be capable of moving digital currency between mobile phones without requiring users to be connected to the Internet or needing to pay the cost of using the bitcoin blockchain. By transacting with NFC, Bluetooth, QR codes or a combination of these technologies, Netopia suggests it can allow users to send and receive bitcoin without paying fees for sending funds over the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nCEO Antonio Eram called the project one of the company\'s recent ""experiments"" with bitcoin, which also include the new exchange product, BTKO.in it debuted at a recent Silicon Valley event. An established mobile payments company, Netopia boasts an estimated 24 million customers and relationships with telecommunications giants T-Mobile and Vodafone.\n\nExplaining his firm\'s interest in the OffCoin project, Eram told CoinDesk:\n\n""Decentralised bitcoin for offline usage is a reality with our solution. As I have presented, there is only positive impact on the public ledger. We\'ve just created a trusted offline, off-blockchain infrastructure.""\n\nProject developers argue that the system is decentralized, since there\'s no central entity that guarantees the funds. Further, parts of the transaction process are segregated, as the bitcoin wallet would only have part of the private key, to be completed by the microSD cards.\n\nNetopia indicates that OffCoin now works with most Android phones version 4.1 or higher that accepts microSD cards, though the company is seeking to expand its capabilities.\n\n""We have an USB version available for testing and soon one that is compatible with iPhone. This was designed to be universally acceptable and not a solution for high end phones,"" said Eram. ""Our vision is to enable offline bitcoin transactions anywhere in the world. Including the areas where phones are not exactly high end.""\n\nProject origins\n\nOffCoin as a concept and project dates back to late 2013, as it is a rebranding and furthering of development of the Othercoin project started by Romanian developer Razvan Dragomirescu.\n\nUnder its former name, OffCoin attracted the attention of notable bitcoin developers such as Gregory Maxwell, Adam Back, Mike Hearn and Peter Todd, who offered early and varying opinions on the concept. Maxwell, now a CTO at Blockstream, called the proposal a ""fantastic idea"", but suggested issues could arise should the issuers of the microSD cards compromise the system. Similarly, Hearn expressed his optimism that advancements with smartphones and Internet connectivity would negate the need for such solutions.\n\nDragomirescu ultimately developed the project alone, but he attracted the attention of Netopia, which began negotiations to invest and promote the project this year.\n\n""This solution is revolutionary in terms of enabling bitcoin payments and transfers for offline usage,"" Eram said of the move. ""We may be in avant-garde, however, we know the applicability can be expanded exponentially.""\n\nBecause OffCoin maintains security while keeping transactions private, Eram went so far as to say it could be a potent development tool as the network seeks to increase its transaction processing capabilities.\n\nFor example, the recent debate over bitcoin\'s standard block size rests on the number of transactions able to be transmitted over the network each second. By conducting transactions off-chain more widely, the number of transactions broadcast on the network could theoretically be reduced.\n\nSolution viability\n\nGiven the offline nature of transactions, Eram framed the project as one that could have relevance in context of proposals such as the Lightning network that are seeking to reduce the number of transactions that need to be entered directly on the blockchain.\n\n""Offcoin is about real privacy. Achieved offline without any changes in the blockchain, as in forks, or expensive hardware. This is an elegant solution that accomplishes a lot,"" he said. ""Releasing pressure from the blockchain is in line with the discussion of changing the block size for allowing more transactions. With OffChain, we can do this and use the blockchain as a settlement layer.""\n\nStill, some observers caution against the widespread use of the tech, with developer Justus Ranvier suggesting a more thorough analysis of the cost of extracting private keys through illicit means would be needed.\n\nOther factors could also limit the usefulness of the system, however, such as the decline in the use of microSD cards in mobile devices, a trend attributable to the cost phone manufacturers can charge for more data space.\n\nEram, though, believes developments such as Google\'s Project Vault, which seeks to build a secure computer on a microSD-sized device, demonstrate a continued interest in the technology.\n\nQuestion of scale\n\nOne of the most frequent criticisms levied against the project, while interesting to developers, has been the difficulties in achieving scale, which is where Netopia believes it can help take the project forward.\n\nAs a mobile payments specialist, Eram said, the company already has a network of consumers, merchants and telecommunications providers it could leverage to promote solutions like OffCoin as well as bitcoin more broadly.\n\n""Since we are big enough, we can push bitcoin to various markets. We\'re pretty confident that our investment in the ecosystem will pay off in some time,"" he added.\n\nEram said that interest in bitcoin is growing among members of these industries due to the use of bitcoin amongst Romania\'s freelancers.\n\n""They want to be paid in bitcoins now. That\'s an income that is in bitcoins, and they have to be used, and so what we have done in the last six to seven months is that we enable a lot of merchants to accept bitcoins,"" Eram said.\n\nHe estimated BTKO.in is now doing roughly 5 BTC in daily volume, but that the service has yet to open to the general public.\n\nNo launch schedule\n\nAs for when the project may be more widely announced, Eram indicated Netopia is currently looking for the ""best opportunity"". He suggested this could coincide with the launch of BTKO.in.\n\nEram noted that Netopia will likely use its standard strategy in promoting the technology, placing an early bet that may be advantageous later.\n\n""We are in a very good position to start a bitcoin business in that region, also we are very well known for innovation, even if we do like crazy experiments,"" Eram continued.\n\nIn particular, Eram said that Netopia is currently investigating how it can enter the European, Latin American and Middle Eastern markets later this year, concluding:\n\n""With OffCoin we think is the same. Huge potential. Maybe not the right time, considering the acceptance of bitcoin, but we are confident that we can make a difference.""\n\nPassing notes image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The idea has been swirling around in bitcoin conversations as of late. At the front of the conversation is blockchain consultant Tim Swanson who often injects skepticism into the space. He explained some of the details of permissioned blockchains and how that would work in last week's Epicenter Bitcoin, a podcast dedicated to cryptocurrency developments.\n\n“He's been making people very angry on Reddit,” said Epicenter host Brian Fabian Crain when introducing his guest. And, true to this description, Swanson's name topped the subreddit Sunday in a stab at his take on the blockchain.\n\nBusinesses such as Hyperledger, which was recently acquired by Blythe Masters' Digital Asset Holdings, and Eris Industries have brought blockchain software to the table that drops cryptocurrencies. Swanson recently released a white paper in which he describes eight companies working on projects that use the blockchain without the coin. He said in the podcast:\n\n“Let Bitcoin be Bitcoin and not turn it into a million different things that it's not particularly suited for based on its capital expenses that are involved in proof of work.”\n\nBut Swanson is not necessarily smugly anti-bitcoin. He described the takeaways in his paper on permissioned blockchains in comparison to bitcoin, explaining:\n\n“There is no one size fits all. They both have tradeoffs. They'll probably both coexist.”\n\nThere are areas where bitcoin could potentially work better, but there's also a niche for permissioned ledgers.\n\nSwanson frames permissioned ledgers as better suited for incumbent financial players. “A bank's starting assumptions are different than a cypherpunk's,” Swanson said. In the immediate term the private blockchains, which are controlled by a central entity rather than a decentralized network like Bitcoin, could slash IT costs.\n\nBut distributed ledgers—even as the decentralized aspect is stripped away—can provide benefits such as resiliency and the ability to conduct transactions without the worry of counterparty risk.\n\nCrain stepped in to defend Bitcoin. “There's this really ambitious gamble and bet to have this global decentralized cryptocurrency. And it's a long shot. It's a hard thing. But it's a revolutionary, huge idea,” he said. The two Epicenter Bitcoin hosts also mentioned use cases like microtransactions and remittances later in the podcast.\n\nSwanson described the state of the Bitcoin ecosystem, questioning whether it would be able to jump many of the hurdles in its way. He mentioned that the Bitcoin ecosystem has recreated many of the things that Bitcoinites had vowed to destroy:\n\n“Bitcoin has recreated all the problems we've had the past four hundred years with intermediaries, custodians, and with currency itself. And we get to see it in a very compact—six to seven years—form.”\n\nWatch the rest of the episode, which touches on a number of thoughts on the future role of blockchains in more detail."", ""ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter more than a year of hiatus, Newsweek needed to resurrect its U.S. print version with a bang. On March 6, 2014, it hit newsstands with a blockbuster cover: Reporter Leah McGrath Goodman claimed to have figured out the identity of ''Satoshi Nakamoto,'' the elusive founder of Bitcoin and often thought to be the pseudonym of one or several ambitious programmers.\n\nAccording to Newsweek, Satoshi was genuinely named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto: a 64-year-old family man living outside of Los Angeles, as math-savvy as Bitcoin's creator would have to be, who shyly avoided the limelight once it became clear he'd created a monster.\n\nThere was just one small problem: In no uncertain terms, Nakamoto told The Associated Press later that very evening that he was not the man everyone's looking for and that he first heard about the digital currency when Newsweek came knocking. (To be fair, the real Satoshi would probably say something like that.)\n\nNewsweek never retracted the story, but its online version is now amended with a statement from Dorian, who categorically denies being Bitcoin's inventor, and who once promised to sue — though it's unclear what became of that lawsuit. (Dorian's lawyer, Ethan Kirschner, didn't respond to the Kernel's request for an update.)\n\nEither way, this was just the biggest of many attempts from the mainstream press to engage in Bitcoin's oldest, most maddening endeavor: guessing at, and refuting, possible Satoshis. Speculation has ranged so widely that I'm not even going to pretend this is comprehensive history, or that the cited sources are the first time they appeared anywhere on the internet. Instead, it's a loose one, a mere cornucopia of fake Satoshis that people believed in at one point or another.\n\nNov. 1, 2008\n\nBitcoin and Satoshi came on the scene together when a paper called ''Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,'' appeared on a cryptography listserv, signed with his name. ''None of the list's veterans had heard of him,'' Wired wrote three years later. ''Google searches for his name turned up no relevant information; it was clearly a pseudonym.''\n\nFeb. 11, 2009\n\nA user identifying himself as Satoshi Nakamoto announced on the P2P Foundation message board introduced Bitcoin. His profile listed his location as Japan and his age as 38. He would go on to occasionally communicate with other users, though only sporadically, and he never shared personal details. The fact that he seemed to speak in Britishisms, though his original paper reflected a more American style, helped the theory that ''Satoshi Nakamoto'' couldn't be his real name.\n\nFeb. 27, 2011\n\nBitcoiners, still totally in the dark about his identity, joke that ''Satoshi Nakamoto'' is a clever combination of the four Asian tech giants that created him: Samsung, Toshiba, Nakamichi, Motorola.\n\nOct. 10, 2011\n\nIn one of the first definitive looks at Bitcoin, New Yorker writer Joshua Davis went to the Crypto 2011 conference. Noting Satoshi's penchant for British phrasing, Davis identified nine British and Irish lecturers that could fit the bill. He then narrowed his list — some had little software experience, some dismissed Bitcoin — before he settled on Trinity College's Michael Clear, then 23, who pointedly avoided Davis's question of whether he was Satoshi.\n\nLater, Clear said he'd been joking; of course he wasn't Bitcoin's founder. But he emailed Davis with a great lead: ''I also think I can identify Satoshi.'' He named Finnish programer Vili Lehdonvirta, who promptly denied it.\n\nOct. 11, 2011\n\nThe next day, Fast Company's Adam Penenberg ran something of a rebuttal to Davis, who assumed a popular theory: Not only that Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym, it's a clue. Satoshi can be translated from Japanese as ''clear-thinking,'' Naka as ''inside,'' and moto as ''foundation.'' (Clear thinking inside the foundation! That must somehow be a person!)\n\nPenenberg found an obscure encryption software patent that oddly contained some of Satoshi's phrasing. The names on that patent were Neal King, Vladimir Oksman, and Charles Bry. Oksman and Bry both flatly denied it. King said he ''had never heard of Bitcoin until this question came up.''\n\nAugust 2012\n\nA discussion at the since-shuttered, Bitcoin-funded site bitquestion.com (archived) speculated Satoshi was actually Jed McCaleb. McCaleb founded the once-great Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which he sold in 2011. Besides, the theory went, McCaleb was a big fan of peer-to-peer software, since he created the file-sharing site eDonkey 2000. And to top it off, finally, he's a total Japanophile, at least according to the breathless bitquestion theorist. How could it not be him?\n\nJanuary 2013\n\nRedditor youarenofreddurstsir, touting advantages like ''I am new to Bitcoin'' and ''I have Asperger's,'' put forth an elaborate theory on Reddit's r/Bitcoin. He decided that the real Satoshi must be American, must be male, must have a certain kind of résumé, and must know a handful of particular big names in cryptography. Therefore, he must be acclaimed University of North Carolina computer scientist Michael Reiter, who fits in each of those four categories.\n\nMarch 15, 2013\n\nA commenter on bitcointalk.org named rpietila produced the saddest theory: Satoshi was Len Sassaman, a Belgian systems engineer who committed suicide July 3, 2011, about six months after the last known communication from Satoshi. Maybe the CIA was involved, rpietila suggested.\n\nMay 17, 2013\n\nTed Nelson, a 75-year-old futurist who in 1963 coined the term “hypertext,” posted a rambling YouTube video titled “I Think I Know Who Satoshi Is.” His answer was straight out of left field: renowned number theorist Shinichi Mochizuki, who met the requisites of being Japanese-American, not young, and brilliant at math. The connection seems to end there.\n\nOct. 26, 2013\n\nSecurity researcher Dustin Trammell, known as a libertarian and an early Bitcoin adopter who emailed back and forth with Satoshi in the currency’s infancy, wrote a blog post called “I Am Not Satoshi.” In it, he promised he hadn’t actually been emailing himself.\n\nNov. 24, 2013\n\nTwo Israeli scientists produce a study of the history of Bitcoin transactions and come to a startling hypothesis of M. Night Shyamalan–level irony. Satoshi is actually Ross Ulbricht, who had recently been arrested as the kingpin behind the Bitcoin-enabled black market site Silk Road.\n\nThey retracted that idea the next day.\n\nRead the rest of this story at The Kernel."", ""Yesterday, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Greece had closed its banks and imposed capital controls to prevent financial chaos after the breakdown of bailout talks with its international creditors. The decision came at the end of a weekend that brought Greece closer to “Grexit” – the potential exit from the Eurozone and perhaps the European Union (EU) itself – and confronted Europe with a serious crisis.\n\nToday, Jose Pagliery, the author of “Bitcoin - And the Future of Money,” reports on CNN Money that Greeks are rushing to bitcoin. The article includes testimonials from top bitcoin exchanges such as bitcoin.de, Bitcurex, and China-based LakeBTC, stating that they are seeing a surge of business and inquiries from Greece.\n\nThis is, according to Pagliery, a pivotal moment. “Bitcoin was created as an independent, computerized money in 2009 to provide a stark alternative to government-issued currency held at banks,” he says. “This could be its moment to shine.”\n\nThe introduction of capital controls is likely to push people, not only wealthy investors but also ordinary people, to the conclusion that governments and banks couldn’t be trusted with their hard-earned savings. They may then start looking for alternative ways to store their savings, out of reach of predatory central banks, and choose bitcoin as the best alternative.\n\nWith limited access to their bank account and no legal way to transfer money abroad, the Greeks are likely to experience difficulties in buying bitcoin at the moment. But while it’s late for the Greeks who waited until now to act, other less optimistic Greeks have been buying bitcoin for some time now. In other countries, especially in neighboring European countries with troubled economies, it seems likely that people will begin to realize that the government can – and will – impose capital control and cut them from access to their savings if the economic situation worsens.\n\nBased on real-time reports collected by The Wall Street Journal, Zero Hedge notes that the contagious fear of capital controls may already be spreading from Greece to neighboring Italy. Several Italian banks reportedly failed to start trading on Monday as fears over a Greek debt default induced many investors to shed peripheral stocks, including Italian, with banks suffering the most.\n\nSales orders on Italian stocks, in particular financial stocks, piled up before the market opening. At the start, the sales orders were so numerous that the system couldn't manage to process them, something that often happens when specific news causes a sell-off on a stock.\n\nSpeaking to Italian daily La Stampa, University of Chicago economist Luigi Zingales noted that a psychological contagion could spread immediately to Italy, because the Italian economy is not growing. “The question is: Would [Italians] too think to withdraw their money from the banks or not?”\n\nLa Stampa also reports that “The Bitcoin fever rises in Greece,” and mentions the recent April Fool’s joke of Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis: “Greece Will Adopt the Bitcoin If Eurogroup Doesn’t Give Us a Deal.” La Stampa describes similar scenarios as “unlikely, but potentially disruptive for Western economic culture.”\n\nPhoto M?rti?š Bru?enieks / CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported""]"
